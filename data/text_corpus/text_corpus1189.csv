5945,groundwater is an important resource in arid and semi arid regions and determining its residence times is critical for sustainable use radiocarbon 14c is currently the primary geochemical tracer for determining residence times of regional groundwater systems the analysis of 14c contents of dissolved inorganic carbon dic became more straightforward following the development of accelerator mass spectrometry which has led to an increase in the number of studies using 14c however the interpretation of 14c data is not always straightforward and many studies consider relatively few of the multiple processes that may affect the 14c contents of dic in groundwater commonly studies have focussed on correcting 14c contents for closed system dissolution of 14c free calcite which is a near ubiquitous process however especially in semi arid and arid areas uncertainties in the initial 14c contents and δ13c values of recharge due to the presence of low 14c soil co2 in the deep unsaturated zone recharge by rivers or open system calcite dissolution pose problems for mass balance calculations additionally processes such as methanogenesis and mineralisation of organic carbon may be locally important most studies also assume a constant atmospheric 14c content and non dispersive piston flow in aquifers which results in residence times being underestimated and makes it difficult to compare the groundwater archive to other palaeoclimate or palaeoenvironment records additionally mixing of water within aquifers diffusion of 14c between low and high permeability layers and sampling from multiple units in long screen wells may limit whether a meaningful residence time can be determined overall while it is relatively straightforward to estimate broad ranges of residence times or determine general patterns of groundwater flow the quest to quantify residence times flow rates and recharge remains a challenge the use of multiple radioactive tracers better characterisation of δ13c values and 14c contents of the potential sources of dic and more critical assessment of flow systems will improve the utilisation of this important tracer keywords radiocarbon groundwater residence

et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 haddeland et al 2014 gleeson et al 2016 given that surface water supplies are often limited and may diminish further because of climate change groundwater represents a critical resource in these areas and thus understanding residence times is vital for its sustainable use this paper reviews the application of radiocarbon to determine residence times of regional groundwater in arid and semi arid environments we examine issues relating to the interpretation of radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope data and also assess problems relating to estimating residence times that result from mixing and dispersion understanding residence times is vitally important given the worldwide dependence of people in such areas on groundwater and the depletion of groundwater resources that has occurred disproportionately in arid and semi arid regions over recent decades currell et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 with a half life of 5730 years 14c is one of the cosmogenic isotopes that mainly originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases 14c is produced in the troposphere and stratosphere by neutron activation of 14n and is incorporated into atmospheric gases e g co2 co and ch4 dissolved inorganic carbon dic is ubiquitous in groundwater with dic concentrations ranging from a few to several thousand mg l the common presence of dic has led to the widespread use of radiocarbon 14c to estimate residence times of groundwater in regional aquifers clark and fritz 1997 kalin 2000 there is a progression from earlier studies that utilised liquid scintillation counting and baco3 precipitation followed by benzene synthesis fontes 1971 stuiver and polach 1977 to a predominance of studies using accelerator mass spectrometry ams since the late 1990s the development of ams techniques allow precise commonly c 1 determinations of 14c 12c or 14c 13c ratios to be made from a few milligrams of c synal 2013 kutschera 2016 this transition also reduced the need to collect and process large often in excess of 100 l volumes of water in the field that aside from not always being practical was prone to contamination by atmospheric co2 aggarwal et al 2014 the increase in the number of facilities globally together with the ease of measurement has contributed to the increased number of 14c studies of groundwater for example published studies listed on the scopus database increased from less than 20 per year before 1990 to more than 50 per year since 2010 conventions for the reporting of 14c data are discussed by stuiver and polach 1977 kalin 2000 plummer and glynn 2013 for ams the international standard is the national bureau of standards nbs oxalic acid normalisation of 14c 12c or 14c 13c ratios to 14c activities a14c in percent modern carbon pmc is common this normalisation commonly assumes that the δ13c values of dic are 25 which is generally appropriate for archaeology and tree ring studies by contrast the range of geochemical processes that occur in the unsaturated zone and below the water table commonly results in groundwater dic having a range of δ13c values because these processes may affect the 14c contents and δ13c values differently clark and fritz 1997 han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 meredith et al 2016 several authors e g kalin 2000 plummer and glynn 2013 han and plummer 2016 recommend that 14c values not be normalised un normalised 14c ratios are denoted as a14c in pmc however this recommendation is not commonly adhered to with many publications reporting normalised values received from the analytical facilities or not reporting whether normalisation has been carried out additionally pmc pmc and pmc and other variations such as mc notations are used interchangeably supplement table 1 the errors in calculated residence times introduced by incorrect normalisation are small relative to the other uncertainties in radiocarbon dating however more complete reporting is desirable especially for subsequent comparison or compilation of data here we use the generic term 14c contents meredith et al 2016 for the 14c of dic in groundwater while 14c contents of groundwater may be used as a qualitative indicator of residence time or mixing of older and younger water in aquifers dassi et al 2005a hamed et al 2008 iverach et al 2017 miller et al 2017 priestley et al 2017 many studies use this tracer to estimate residence times supplement table 1 the detection limit of 14c contents determined by ams are 1 pmc and precision is typically 1 2 plummer and glynn 2013 thus under ideal circumstances where the flow system is simple with little large scale mixing the initial 14c content of recharge is known and the sources of dic in the groundwater are well understood 14c could be used to determine residence times as old as 40 ka with an uncertainty of less than a few thousand years however potential contamination with atmospheric co2 during sampling and uncertainties in quantifying the sources of dic in groundwater result in large uncertainties in waters with low 14c contents plummer and glynn 2013 han and plummer 2016 an upper limit of 25 to 30 ka is probably more realistic kalin 2000 clark 2015 which still encompasses the residence times of groundwater in many regional aquifers due to the magnitude of the half life and the elevated atmospheric 14c contents of up to 200 pmc produced by atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s the bomb pulse it is difficult to use 14c to estimate residence times of regional groundwater where these are less than one or two thousand years clark and fritz 1997 kalin 2000 clark 2015 however estimating the residence times of post bomb pulse recharge using 14c in combination with other tracers such as 3h or the chlorofluorocarbons cfcs is sometimes possible le gal la salle et al 2001 cartwright et al 2007 following recharge the groundwater is isolated from the atmosphere and 14c decays to the common isotope of nitrogen 14n as groundwater commonly contains significant non radiogenic 14n the use of 14c to determine residence times relies on determining the loss of the parent isotope rather than the accumulation of the daughter in most studies of regional groundwater supplement table 1 residence times t are calculated assuming that atmospheric 14c contents have been constant over time this yields conventional radiocarbon ages in years before present bp where 1950 ce 0 years bp the assumption of constant atmospheric 14c contents allows residence times to be calculated from the measured 14c of dic 14ct using the decay equation 1 t 8267 l n 14 c t 14 c i q clark and fritz 1997 where q is the proportion of dic introduced via recharge and 14ci is the initial 14c of dic in the recharging water some authors vengosh et al 2007 burg et al 2013 huang et al 2017 combine the 14ci and q terms into a single term often denoted as a0 that accounts for processes such as carbonate dissolution that affect 14c contents post recharge however because both 14ci and q can vary it is useful to separate them 1 1 the terrestrial carbon cycle and carbon isotope ratios the use of 14c contents to determine residence times relies on understanding the changes to carbon isotope ratios in the terrestrial carbon cycle fig 1 a major challenge in using 14c to estimate residence times results from estimating the proportion of dic that originates as recharge q in eq 1 rather than being derived from within the aquifers most groundwater originates as direct recharge by rainfall that infiltrates through the soils and regolith to the water table although in arid and semi arid regions recharge from ephemeral rivers may also be important scanlon et al 2002 2006 healy 2010 dic in the recharging groundwater is derived from a combination of atmospheric co2 dic in surface waters dissolution of co2 from the soil zone and weathering of carbonate minerals in the unsaturated zone clark and fritz 1997 fig 2 the fractionations of 13c 12c and 14c 12c ratios in the terrestrial carbon cycle are described below prior to the significant combustion of fossil fuels the atmosphere had a pco2 of 10 3 5 atm and the δ13c value of atmospheric co2 was c 6 5 clark and fritz 1997 fig 1 the concentration of co2 in the soil zone is considerably higher pco2 commonly 10 3 to 10 1 atm than the atmosphere hence soil zone co2 is generally more important as a source of dic in the recharging groundwater the uptake of co2 by plants via photosynthesis fractionates the 13c 12c ratios with the degree of fractionation varying with the photosynthetic pathway o leary 1981 farquhar et al 1982 o leary 1988 farquhar et al 1989 around 80 of plant species use the c3 photosynthetic pathway still et al 2003 and the resultant plant material typically has δ13c values between 37 and 20 with a modal value of c 27 kohn 2010 fig 1 c4 plants which account for approximately 15 of species and include common crops such as maize and sugar cane as well as many grasses have δ13c values that are generally between 16 and 10 approximately 6 of plant species mainly in desert environments use cam photosynthesis which involves both c3 daytime and c4 night pathways smith and winter 1996 the resultant biomass δ13c values are intermediate between those of c3 and c4 plants bacteriologically mediated aerobic decay of plant matter in soils converts the biomass c back to co2 due to outgassing this process fractionates the 13c 12c ratios by c 4 cerling et al 1991 hence the δ13c of co2 produced from the decay of typical c3 vegetation δ13c 27 is c 23 and the δ13c of soil co2 produced from the decay of c4 vegetation δ13c 12 5 is c 8 5 however although these values are often quoted the range of possible δ13c values within the c3 and c4 plant classes are several per mil kohn 2010 the dissolved co2 dissociates into hco3 and co3 2 with the relative proportion of each c species varying proportional to ph vogel et al 1970 deines et al 1974 mook et al 1974 in low ph waters aqueous co2 dominates hco3 is dominant at circumneutral ph and co3 2 at high ph as each species has a different fractionation factor the δ13c of the dic varies with ph and temperature at ph 6 5 and 20 c the dic in equilibrium with co2 gas with a δ13c 23 has a δ13c of c 19 fig 1 carbonate minerals especially calcite may precipitate from the dic due to evapotranspiration in the soil and the formation of pedogenic carbonates as either nodules or calcrete layers is particularly common in semi arid and arid areas quade et al 1995 breecker et al 2009 takeuchi et al 2010 pedogenic calcite formed in equilibrium with soil co2 that has a δ13c of 23 at 20 c has a δ13c of c 12 bottinga 1968 the internationally accepted radiocarbon dating reference of 100 pmc is 95 of the 1950 ce content of 14c in the nbs oxalic acid normalised to δ13c 19 3 the factor of 0 95 adjusts the 14c content of the oxalic acid to that of pre industrial 1840 to 1860 wood from c3 vegetation due to the higher mass difference processes in the carbon cycle fractionate 14c 12c ratios by c 2 3 times the 13c 12c fractionations saliege and fontes 1984 cerling et al 1991 thus the 14c content of atmospheric co2 in equilibrium with that vegetation is c 104 pmc the aerobic decay of pre industrial c3 vegetation results in soil zone co2 having a 14c content of 100 5 pmc the corresponding 14c content of dic at ph 6 5 and 20 c is c 101 4 pmc as with the stable carbon isotopes differences in vegetation type and ph or temperatures in the soil zone result in differences in the 14c content of the dic however these differences are minor compared with some of uncertainties that are inherent in using 14c discussed below 1 2 carbon 14 as a residence time tracer an ideal groundwater residence time tracer would be non reactive be derived only from recharging water have well defined input functions and be easily and cheaply measured the utility of 14c to determine groundwater residence times largely stems from its convenient half life ubiquitous presence of dic and relative ease of measurement rather than it being an ideal tracer issues affecting the use of 14c include the several potential sources of 14c free carbon contained in aquifers that may be difficult to estimate and processes that affect the 14c contents of dic in the recharging water relatively little attention has also been paid to the long term variability of 14c contents of atmospheric co2 and adopting more realistic conceptualisations of flow in aquifers thus despite its wide use deriving groundwater residence times from 14c is not always straightforward and is prone to oversimplification supplement table 1 summarises a range of 14c residence time studies in arid and semi arid groundwater illustrating the wide use of 14c in these environments where possible we have indicated the methods used in the studies for analysis of 14c reporting of the carbon isotope ratios and correction for the input of 14c free dic in groundwater for residence time calculations 2 concentrations and isotopic ratios of dic in arid and semi arid regions this section summarises key issues that affect the use of 14c to estimate the residence times of groundwater some of these are common to groundwater from all environments however several are more important in semi arid and arid regions there are several potential sources of 14c free dic in aquifers which result in values of q in eq 1 being 1 if unaccounted for the addition of 14c free dic results in the overestimation of groundwater residence times understanding the input of 14c free dic is a major challenge in interpreting radiocarbon data in groundwater from all environments fontes 1992 aravena et al 1995 clark and fritz 1997 kalin 2000 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 cartwright 2010b han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 han and plummer 2016 closed system dissolution of carbonates in the aquifer matrix is a likely source of 14c free carbon and is the process most commonly considered in determining groundwater residence times values of q may be calculated from major ion geochemistry or the δ13c values of dic in groundwater via mass balance geochemical modelling using programs such as phreeqc or netpath or graphical techniques pearson and hanshaw 1970 vogel 1970 tamers 1975 fontes and garnier 1979 clark and fritz 1997 geyh 2000 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 clark 2015 salmon et al 2015 han and plummer 2016 the simplest form of the isotope mass balance equation 2 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c calcite δ 13 c recharge δ 13 c calcite estimates q from the measured δ13c values of groundwater dic δ13cdic calcite in the aquifers δ13ccalcite and the dic of groundwater recharge δ13crecharge this mass balance approach assumes that the δ13c values of the components are well known and that closed system calcite dissolution is the major process affecting 14c contents of groundwater dic while some studies discuss these assumptions and they are well explained in reference texts such as fontes 1992 clark and fritz 1997 and kalin 2000 it is not uncommon for isotope mass balances to be carried out with little discussion while the δ13c of dic is routinely measured many studies assume values of the δ13c of calcite commonly using a typical marine value of 0 and very few directly constrain the δ13c of the recharging water 2 1 other sources of 14c free dic in anoxic groundwater from all environments bacteria may use carbon as an electron acceptor and produce ch4 and or co2 aravena et al 1995 valentine et al 2004 leybourne et al 2006 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 cartwright 2010b abiogenic methanogenesis is also recorded but is probably more common at higher temperatures than that recorded in most groundwater sherwood lollar et al 2006 currell et al 2017 so4 2 is a more efficient electron acceptor than co2 and in the presence of so4 2 anaerobic bacteria will oxidise organic carbon represented as ch2o via reactions of the form 2ch2o so4 2 h2s 2hco3 because the organic carbon has low δ13c values this pathway of methanogenesis produces dic with low δ13c values and due to the 34s 32s fractionations between so4 2 and h2s the residual so4 2 has elevated δ34s values in the absence of so4 2 and no3 bacteria may produce methane from organic carbon via acetate fermentation 2ch2o 2h2o ch4 co2 due to the fractionation of 13c between ch4 and co2 50 80 valentine et al 2004 leybourne et al 2006 the co2 produced by this reaction has high δ13c values direct reduction of dic whiticar et al 1986 also results in the residual dic having high δ13c values while methanogenesis resulting from the direct reduction of dic does not appreciably change the 14c contents clark and fritz 1997 cartwright 2010b methanogenesis resulting from the breakdown of old organic material that is part of the aquifer matrix results in the dilution of 14c aravena et al 1995 mayo et al 2007 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the diffusion of exogenic ch4 from deep organic rich formations can be accompanied by aerobic or anaerobic methanotrophic oxidation currell et al 2017 iverach et al 2017 this process can also result in dilution of 14c in the receiving aquifers the occurrence and pathway of methanogenesis may be inferred from groundwater geochemistry e g lack of dissolved oxygen low nitrate and or sulphate concentrations high δ34s and or δ13c values and the presence of dissolved methane leybourne et al 2006 cheung et al 2009 currell et al 2017 locally geogenic co2 derived from volcanic outgassing or deep crustal sources such as metamorphic devolatilisation may also be a source of 14c free dic cartwright et al 2002 caliro et al 2005 genereux et al 2009 koh et al 2017 co2 derived from the mantle and many igneous rocks has a δ13c of c 6 javoy et al 1986 clark and fritz 1997 which contrasts with those of marine limestones and the dic derived from the soil zone during recharge correction for methanotropic reactions methanogenesis or geogenic co2 input may again be made via a sequence of mass balance equations reactive transport models graphical techniques and or geochemical models however in the case of methanogenesis the pathways vary with the geochemistry of the waters and the types of bacteria present which results in the geochemical changes being difficult to predict in detail 2 2 14c content of unsaturated zone co2 commonly the interpretation of groundwater 14c data implicitly assumes that the co2 in the unsaturated zone has 14c contents that are similar to those of the atmosphere this may be appropriate for temperate zones with high recharge rates and relatively shallow unsaturated zones however the 14c content of co2 from the deep unsaturated zone in semi arid or arid regions may be significantly lower than that of the atmosphere bacon and keller 1998 thorstenson et al 1998 wood et al 2015 haas et al 2016 thorstenson et al 2016 the 14c contents of unsaturated zone co2 commonly systematically decrease from near atmospheric values at the surface to lower values near the water table for example the 14c content of co2 at ti tree central australia decreases from 100 pmc at shallower than 10 m below ground surface to as low as 50 pmc at the base of the unsaturated zone generally between 20 and 35 m in this area wood et al 2015 the 14c content of co2 from 7 m depth in the unsaturated zone at saskatoon canada is as low as 20 pmc bacon and keller 1998 and as low as 50 pmc at 8 5 m in the unsaturated zone in north dakota usa haas et al 2016 co2 at the base of the thick unsaturated zone c 110 m in nevada usa has a 14c content of 20 pmc walvoord et al 2005 the high 14c contents of the co2 in the shallow unsaturated zone probably results from plant root respiration and or the decay of recent organic matter although the latter is likely only within the root zone which may be up to a few metres thick in the case of deep rooted trees the low 14c contents of the deeper co2 most likely result from the oxidation of old organic matter below the root zone where there is no contribution of co2 from root respiration a decrease of po2 with depth thorstenson et al 1998 is also consistent with the oxidation of organic matter changes to the relative importance of root zone respiration vs organic matter oxidation increasing ages of organic material with depth and diffusion within the unsaturated zone produce the observed gradients in 14c contents of co2 while the 14c contents of unsaturated zone co2 are rarely measured the few studies that have measured it in semi arid to arid regions illustrate that automatically ascribing low 14c contents of dic largely to decay in groundwater may significantly overestimate groundwater residence times wood et al 2014 wood et al 2015 2 3 sources of recharge recharge of aquifers in high rainfall areas is dominantly by the direct infiltration of rainfall scanlon et al 2002 healy 2010 by contrast especially in low relief areas substantial recharge in arid and semi arid regions may occur through flooding of ephemeral rivers allison et al 1985 scanlon et al 2002 scanlon et al 2006 morin et al 2009 cendón et al 2010 meredith et al 2016 the dic concentrations in river water are generally substantially higher than those in rainfall since arid zone soils commonly have low organic carbon concentrations that result in low pco2 much of the dic in groundwater may originate from river recharge cendón et al 2010 meredith et al 2016 the δ13c values of dic in rivers are governed by in river processes such as mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon dissolution of particulate inorganic carbon in river respiration and photosynthesis and exchange with the atmosphere quay et al 1992 aucour et al 1999 telmer and veizer 1999 raymond and bauer 2001 striegl et al 2007 cartwright 2010a the balance of these processes results in variable δ13c values for example δ13c values of dic in the murray darling river system in semi arid southeast australia are 10 to 5 cartwright 2010a meredith et al 2016 dic in other major river systems from a variety of environments are similarly variable for example the ottawa river in canada has δ13c values of between 16 and 8 telmer and veizer 1999 δ13c values in the okavango delta range from 8 to 2 at low water levels to 12 to 6 at higher flows akoko et al 2013 while aucour et al 1999 reported that dic in the rhone river western europe had δ13c values of between 11 and 5 the δ13c values of dic in river recharge are generally significantly higher than those in equilibrium with soil co2 and are likely to vary between recharge events as the relative importance of the individual in river processes will also vary identifying the initial δ13c value of dic for the mass balance corrections of the type in eq 2 may be difficult likewise where recharge is episodic following major rainfall events the δ13c values of dic in the infiltrating water may be variable meredith et al 2018 where samples with a range of 14c contents are present trends in δ13c values 14c concentrations and dic concentrations may help constrain the composition of the end members generalised graphical techniques to determine the contribution of dic from different sources were discussed by han et al 2012 and han and plummer 2016 these techniques are likely to yield most information where there is a dominant source of dic and where the end members have well constrained and restricted geochemistry e g meredith et al 2016 2 4 evapotranspiration and open system carbonate dissolution semi arid and arid areas commonly have high potential evapotranspiration rates relative to rainfall totals supplement table 1 consequently the salinity of water in the soils and regolith can be high and calcite precipitation may occur in the soils or on the surface herczeg et al 2001 hacini et al 2008 gocke et al 2012 ephemeral water bodies such as small lakes or pools on the floodplain commonly have salt crusts that contain calcite together with gypsum and locally halite episodic recharge water may subsequently dissolve these near surface carbonates and consequently they may be the source of significant volumes of dic in the groundwater as the water table is commonly relatively deep in arid or semi arid areas much of this calcite dissolution may occur under open system conditions in an ideal case the δ13c values of the biomass and the temperature of evaporation will govern the δ13c values of pedogenic carbonate however as discussed above dic in surface water may have a wide range of δ13c values resulting from the relative rates of mineralisation of organic matter exchange with the atmosphere and photosynthesis by aquatic plants or algae consequently calcite formed by evapotranspiration of that dic will also have variable δ13c values calcite precipitated from small volumes of surface or soil water may occur under conditions approximating rayleigh crystallisation which will result in the progressive decrease of calcite δ13c values as evapotranspiration proceeds not suprisngly the δ13c values of soil and surface carbonates are variable quade et al 1989 quade et al 1995 landi et al 2003 breecker et al 2009 cartwright 2010a cartwright et al 2013 meredith et al 2016 the δ13c values of pedogenic calcite may also be temporally variable δ13c values of calcite deposited by evaporating flood waters from the darling river central australia were c 1 lower than the calcite present prior to the floods meredith et al 2016 where calcite is present in the unsaturated zone open system calcite dissolution may take place during recharge if the calcite δ13c values are known the changes to dic concentrations δ13c values and 14c contents caused by open system calcite dissolution may be predicted clark and fritz 1997 gillon et al 2009 cartwright et al 2013 the dissolution of calcite increases the ph of the water in the unsaturated zone if the reservoir of c in the soil co2 is large compared to that of c in the dic the exchange of c between the dic and co2 increases both δ13c values and 14c contents as ph increases this reflects the change in proportion of the aqueous co2 hco3 and co3 2 species in dic and the 13c 12c fractionation factors between those species and co2 fig 3 a shows the changes to ph and dic concentrations in water that initially has a ph of 5 5 and which contains c as its only dissolved component the calculations assumed t 20 c and pco2 values of 10 2 5 or 10 1 fig 3b shows the corresponding changes in the δ13c values and 14c contents of dic assuming that the calcite had a δ13c value of 0 and the 14c content of soil zone co2 was 100 pmc 13c fractionations may be calculated from vogel et al 1970 and mook et al 1974 and 14c 12c fractionations were assumed to be 2 3 times the 13c 12c fractionations saliege and fontes 1984 for an initial pco2 of 10 2 5 calcite saturation is achieved at ph c 7 5 resulting in a δ13c of 15 and a 14c content of c 104 pmc for an initial pco2 of 10 1 0 calcite saturation is achieved at ph c 6 7 resulting in a δ13c of 18 and a 14c content of c 102 pmc most groundwater studies utilise wells that are screened below the water table and relatively few studies have also directly studied processes in the unsaturated zone by sampling the infiltrating water nevertheless open system calcite dissolution may be evident from the presence of high 14c groundwater that also has relatively high δ13c values carmi et al 2009 gillon et al 2009 cartwright et al 2013 3 carbon 14 input and flow path geometry as noted above the decay equation eq 1 yields residence times in radiocarbon years however to compare the groundwater residence times with other datasets such as palaeoclimate records weninger and jöris 2008 conversion to calendar years is desirable calculation of residence times in calendar years requires that the variation in atmospheric 14c contents over time to be considered aside from the elevated 14c contents resulting from the atmospheric nuclear tests there have been long term variations in the rate of production of 14c due to variations in cosmic ray activity reimer et al 2009 comparisons with tree ring chronologies and u th ages of corals indicate that the 14c content of atmospheric co2 was as high as 170 pmc between 28 000 and 30 000 years ago the use of eq 1 also implicitly assumes one dimensional non dispersive flow piston flow such that all the groundwater collected at the well was recharged at the same time i e that it has a definite age this is obviously an oversimplification as groundwater flows along paths of varying lengths and undergoes hydrodynamic dispersion and diffusion which affects the solutes such as dic thus a groundwater sample contains aliquots of water that have a range of residence times rather than being of a specific and definable age maloszewski and zuber 1982 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 suckow 2014 in the absence of preferential flow and large scale mixing mean residence times may be estimated using lumped parameter models maloszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski and zuber 1992 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 jurgens et al 2012 lumped parameter models allow the variability of the 14c input more realistic flow path geometries and the effects of dispersion may be taken into account the 14c content of groundwater at time 14ct is related to the 14c content of dic in the recharging water over time 14ci via the convolution integral 3 14 c t 0 14 c i q t τ g τ e λ τ d τ where τ is the mean residence time t τ is the time when the water recharged λ is the decay constant and g τ is the response function that describes the distribution of flow paths and residence times in the aquifer there are several lumped parameter models that may be applied to different aquifer geometries maloszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski and zuber 1992 amin and campana 1996 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 jurgens et al 2012 the dispersion model which is derived from the one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation is applicable to regional groundwater flow systems with layer parallel flow and is used here to illustrate the effects on calculated mean residence times similar results would be apparent from the other lumped parameter models atkinson et al 2014 howcroft et al 2017 calculations were made using the tracerlpm program jurgens et al 2012 the input function is the 14c record for atmospheric co2 reimer et al 2009 adjusted for the fractionation between atmospheric co2 and soil zone co2 fig 1 for this illustration all dic was assumed to originate from recharge i e q 1 the dispersion model requires the dispersion parameter that is the inverse of the more commonly reported peclet number and which describes the relative importance of dispersion relative to advection to be specified in regional scale groundwater systems the dispersion parameter is likely to be between 0 05 and 0 1 maloszewski 2000 equation 3 may also be applied to piston flow in which case it accounts for the temporal variations in the 14c content of the recharging water howcroft et al 2017 even where piston flow is assumed longer mean residence times are estimated using the 14c record in fig 4 as the input function than using the decay equation with a constant initial 14c content of 100 pmc fig 5 for example groundwater with a 14c content of 30 pmc yields mean residence times of 10 9 vs 9 4 ka from eq 1 this is due to the generally higher 14c content of atmospheric co2 over the last 30 ka than the present day values the mean residence times calculated from the dispersion lumped parameter model increase as dispersivity increases i e as the dispersion parameter increases again for a 14c content of 30 pmc the mean residence times are between 11 8 dispersion parameter of 0 05 and 12 4 ka dispersion parameter of 0 01 for a more highly dispersive system dispersion parameter of 0 5 a 14c content of 30 pmc yields a mean residence time of 17 7 ka the width of the residence time distribution i e the frequency distribution of the ages of the individual aliquots of water in the sample also increases with increasing dispersivity fig 6 since the decay of 14c is exponential the presence of a significant fraction of water with shorter residence times than the mean results in higher 14c contents at any given mean residence time while the lumped parameter models are simplified representations of groundwater systems they illustrate that assuming piston flow and certainly ignoring the long term variation in atmospheric 14c contents will most likely underestimate mean residence times additionally because it is difficult to ascertain the geometry of the groundwater flow paths or the degree of dispersion the difference in estimated mean residence times between plausible lumped parameter models represents an additional uncertainty on the calculated residence times in the example above the uncertainty resulting from varying the dispersion parameter is 5 3 ka for a residence time of 14 5 ka calculated as midway between the highest and lowest estimates this translates to a relative uncertainty of 20 which is larger than the total uncertainty in 14c residence times reported in many studies adopting a wider range of lumped parameter models will increase this uncertainty 4 macroscopic mixing diffusion and heterogenous flow lumped parameter models are valuable in exploring the range of residence times that may correspond to measured 14c activities which is important for attempts to understand the behaviour of groundwater in the context of other palaeoclimate archives while this is probably an improvement on calculating groundwater ages in radiocarbon years lumped parameter models still make several major simplifying assumptions namely uniform aquifer thickness steady state flow and homogenous aquifer properties maloszewski and zuber 1992 cook and bohlke 2000 jurgens et al 2012 additionally most lumped parameter models use analytical solutions that assume a smooth distribution of residence times in the groundwater samples which is very difficult to validate in many aquifers these conditions may not be realised hydraulic conductivities of most aquifers are heterogeneous on scales ranging from millimetres to hundreds of metres sudicky 1986 rehfeldt et al 1992 bohling et al 2012 flow through heterogeneous aquifers may mix waters with different mean residence times macroscopic mixing or aggregation may result in groundwater samples having irregular and unpredictable residence time distributions kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 especially where mixing of waters with significantly different residence times occurs the simple calculation of mean residence times from radioisotopes may be impracticable mccallum et al 2014 suckow 2014 mccallum et al 2015 jasechko 2016 iverach et al 2017 stewart et al 2017 the impacts of mixing of multiple aliquots of water with a range of residence times may however produce groundwater samples with residence time distributions similar to those predicted by the lumped parameter models cartwright and morgenstern 2016 due to the availability of infrastructure many studies of regional groundwater systems have utilised samples from long screened production wells if these wells extract water from several discrete higher permeability layers this may also cause the mixing of water of different residence times during sampling that hampers the determination of residence times additional complications in estimating residence times arise in dual porosity and fractured media e g neretnieks 1981 maloszewski and zuber 1985 groundwater located in isolated pores in fractured rocks may have a long residence time and consquently low 14c contents fig 7 diffusion of dic between the isolated pores the fractures may result in residence times estimated from 14c being far longer than the residence time of the water flowing through the fractures with the discrpency increasing as the fracture spacing decreases neretnieks 1981 similarly diffusion of old dic from low permeability clays may reduce the 14c content of the groundwater in adjacent high permeability lithologies which also increases the apparent mean residence times of the groundwater extracted from those units davidson and airey 1982 sanford 1997 bethke and johnson 2008 adsorption of solute tracers such as dic onto minerals in the aquifer matrix may also occur in low porosity media which may cause decoupling of 14c and o and h isotopes which are part of the water molecule maloszewski and zuber 1985 in many instances it may be more realistic to consider that the groundwater is comprised of multiple fractions of waters of different broad ages estimating the fraction of water younger than a threshold residence time at which the impacts of aggregation do not significantly impact the shape of the residence time distribution may be possible e g kirchner 2016 alternatively the presence of short timescale tracers such as 3h or the cfcs in groundwater with relatively low 14c contents may be used to identify and estimate the fractions of younger and older water jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 however while these issues are broadly recognised the desire to estimate residence times will probably continue as they are perceived as being useful for assessing practical issues such as sustainability of groundwater extraction or recharge rates at the very least the potential effects of mixing and dispersion on groundwater residence times need to be acknowledged employing multiple radioactive tracers or other relative residence time indicators such as stable isotopes or noble gases may highlight that mixing has occurred maloszewski and zuber 1985 le gal la salle et al 2001 cartwright et al 2007 mccallum et al 2014 2015 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 5 implications for estimating groundwater residence times the processes discussed above have implications for whether and how realistic residence times may be estimated in groundwater from arid and semi arid regions where 14c contents have been used to estimate residence times e g supplement table 1 most studies have used the δ13c values of dic to assess processes that may affect the 14c contents either via isotope mass balance calculations or as part of a broader geochemical analysis via programs such as netpath while it is generally recognised that assessment of the 14c contents is needed to derive groundwater residence times several assumptions are commonly made firstly few studies consider processes other than closed system calcite dissolution while some degree of closed system calcite dissolution is probably ubiquitous in groundwater systems open system calcite dissolution and methanogenesis may also be locally important relatively few studies have measured the δ13c values of calcite in the aquifer matrix in some cases there may be measurements of calcite δ13c values from similar sediments to those that form the aquifers however many studies assume that δ13c values of the calcite are close to 0 while a δ13c value of 0 for marine sediments is defensible the global average δ13c of marine carbonates over the last 600 ma has varied from approximately 2 to 6 veizer et al 1999 additionally individual sediment sequences may have a range of δ13c values due to secular variations in ocean δ13c values metabolic and or kinetic processes in the ocean biosphere diagenesis or post depositional alteration carpenter and lohmann 1997 for example authigenic calcite in late permian coal measures of the bowen basin qld australia have δ13c values between 19 and 10 9 uysal et al 2000 sediments in semi arid and arid areas also commonly contain calcite veins and cements formed by the circulation of evaporated groundwater that is close to saturation with calcite as outlined above this calcite is likely to have variable δ13c values thus if it forms a significant part of the calcite in the aquifer matrix the extent of closed system calcite dissolution will be difficult to predict from the δ13c values of dic unless aquifer carbonate δ13c values are also analysed unlike marine calcite that formed during sedimentation this calcite may contain above background 14c contents i e if it was formed in the last 40 ka if that is the case the impacts of dissolution on the 14c contents of groundwater are more difficult to predict still fewer studies have direct constraints on the δ13c values of co2 in the unsaturated zone some studies report δ13c values of organic matter in the soil pessenda et al 1998 cartwright et al 2010 hagedorn and bushner 2015 or pedogenic carbonates cendón et al 2014 but few report δ13c values of soil co2 or the dic in soil water many studies assume δ13c values of soil co2 of c 23 and assign a δ13c value of c 19 to 18 to dic formed in the soil zone based on the expected 13c 12c fractionations in the carbon cycle fig 1 even where the soil carbon pool is derived only from c3 vegetation the potential range of δ13c values is still several per mil kohn 2010 additionally open system calcite dissolution or recharge by flood waters may result in the δ13c values of the recharging water being variable and difficult to predict chemical mass balance based on the major ion geochemistry is potentially an alternative method of determining closed system calcite dissolution that does not depend on interpreting δ13c values however especially in environments where evapotranspiration rates are high precipitation of calcite or other ca bearing minerals such as gypsum may make such calculations difficult determining the δ13c values of more of the carbon sources e g organic matter dic in soil water and surface water and calcite from the soils or aquifers and ensuring that groundwater with a range of 14c contents from throughout the flow system has been sampled may allow the dominant processes impacting dic contents to be determined e g via the graphical techniques discussed by han et al 2012 and han and plummer 2016 this approach is likely to yield most information where the potential sources of dic have a restricted range of δ13c values and where there is a small number of geochemical processes impacting dic concentrations and isotopic ratios not accounting for variations in the 14c content of the atmosphere fig 4 makes a significant yet largely unremarked upon difference to the calculated mean residence times for water recharged greater than 15 000 years ago the 14c content of the atmosphere was likely 120 pmc which results in calculated mean residence times being c 20 longer regardless of which method is used this difference is a similar magnitude to the uncertainties often quoted from uncertainties in the degree of closed system calcite dissolution it is more difficult to assess whether macroscopic mixing and diffusion are sufficiently significant that defining a residence time is unreasonable however this is obviously a critical issue as it dictates whether the results of residence time calculations are fundamentally valid the effects of diffusion and mixing may be identified by using 14c in conjunction with other residence time indicators e g kronfeld et al 1993 plummer et al 2004 dassi et al 2005b cartwright et al 2007 2010 2017a kulongoski et al 2008 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 iverach et al 2017 priestley et al 2017 discordant concentrations of radioisotopes with widely different half lives e g 3h 14c 4he and 36cl may indicate diffusive input from low porosity lithologies the leaking of young water into older regional groundwater or other complexities in the flow systems cartwright et al 2007 2010 bethke and johnson 2008 kulongoski et al 2008 eberts et al 2012 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 iverach et al 2017 howcroft et al 2017 even where the flow system is reasonably simple uncertainties in its geometry or the degree of dispersion can result in substantial uncertainties in mean transit times atkinson et al 2014 howcroft et al 2017 concentrations of multiple radioactive tracers can potentially be used in models that employ particle tracking and or direct simulation of ages suckow 2014 such analysis can help to constrain flow and mixing and provide greater constraints on possible residence times although the use of multiple tracer concentration data may result in non unique solutions determining an increasing number of age tracer concentrations in a given sample will also amplify the impact of uncertainties embedded in each method for example 36cl has uncertainties relating to the input function that is poorly known over time the degree of in situ 36cl production and the possibility that cl is recycled through salt lakes and playas in enclosed semi arid basins phillips 2000 cartwright et al 2017b dissolved noble gas radioisotopes will likely have different diffusivities and adsorption coefficients to dic e g maloszewski and zuber 1985 6 conclusions this review has highlighted the important role that estimating groundwater residence time using 14c plays in understanding the hydrogeology of semi arid and arid regions perhaps because of the improvements in analytical techniques such studies are becoming more commonplace which is improving our understanding of these critical environments the application of 14c is not always straightforward however and many studies including several of the authors have not considered many of the possible problems in its application commonly studies have focussed on estimating residence times and have generally considered the closed system dissolution of 14c calcite however this neglects other processes that impact the 14c content of dic and the treatment of calcite dissolution is sometimes formulaic in many cases it may not be possible to estimate a meaningful mean residence time and even where it is uncertainties in the geometry of the flow path or degree of dispersion introduce considerable uncertainties in the mean residence times that are rarely considered estimating broad ranges of residence times or fractions of younger and older water using 14c in conjunction with other tracers will generally be robust and perhaps is the only realistic outcome in many situations while attempts to calculate residence times and the parameters that stem from these such as recharge rates groundwater fluxes or sustainable groundwater use may be desirable the limitations need to be recognised and the assumptions tested a more critical appraisal of radiocarbon will increase confidence in the results

5945,groundwater is an important resource in arid and semi arid regions and determining its residence times is critical for sustainable use radiocarbon 14c is currently the primary geochemical tracer for determining residence times of regional groundwater systems the analysis of 14c contents of dissolved inorganic carbon dic became more straightforward following the development of accelerator mass spectrometry which has led to an increase in the number of studies using 14c however the interpretation of 14c data is not always straightforward and many studies consider relatively few of the multiple processes that may affect the 14c contents of dic in groundwater commonly studies have focussed on correcting 14c contents for closed system dissolution of 14c free calcite which is a near ubiquitous process however especially in semi arid and arid areas uncertainties in the initial 14c contents and δ13c values of recharge due to the presence of low 14c soil co2 in the deep unsaturated zone recharge by rivers or open system calcite dissolution pose problems for mass balance calculations additionally processes such as methanogenesis and mineralisation of organic carbon may be locally important most studies also assume a constant atmospheric 14c content and non dispersive piston flow in aquifers which results in residence times being underestimated and makes it difficult to compare the groundwater archive to other palaeoclimate or palaeoenvironment records additionally mixing of water within aquifers diffusion of 14c between low and high permeability layers and sampling from multiple units in long screen wells may limit whether a meaningful residence time can be determined overall while it is relatively straightforward to estimate broad ranges of residence times or determine general patterns of groundwater flow the quest to quantify residence times flow rates and recharge remains a challenge the use of multiple radioactive tracers better characterisation of δ13c values and 14c contents of the potential sources of dic and more critical assessment of flow systems will improve the utilisation of this important tracer keywords radiocarbon groundwater residence times ages semi arid arid 1 introduction determining the residence time the time since the aliquots of water in a sample were recharged of groundwater is critical for understanding hydrogeological

et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 haddeland et al 2014 gleeson et al 2016 given that surface water supplies are often limited and may diminish further because of climate change groundwater represents a critical resource in these areas and thus understanding residence times is vital for its sustainable use this paper reviews the application of radiocarbon to determine residence times of regional groundwater in arid and semi arid environments we examine issues relating to the interpretation of radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope data and also assess problems relating to estimating residence times that result from mixing and dispersion understanding residence times is vitally important given the worldwide dependence of people in such areas on groundwater and the depletion of groundwater resources that has occurred disproportionately in arid and semi arid regions over recent decades currell et al 2012 gleeson et al 2012 with a half life of 5730 years 14c is one of the cosmogenic isotopes that mainly originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases 14c is produced in the troposphere and stratosphere by neutron activation of 14n and is incorporated into atmospheric gases e g co2 co and ch4 dissolved inorganic carbon dic is ubiquitous in groundwater with dic concentrations ranging from a few to several thousand mg l the common presence of dic has led to the widespread use of radiocarbon 14c to estimate residence times of groundwater in regional aquifers clark and fritz 1997 kalin 2000 there is a progression from earlier studies that utilised liquid scintillation counting and baco3 precipitation followed by benzene synthesis fontes 1971 stuiver and polach 1977 to a predominance of studies using accelerator mass spectrometry ams since the late 1990s the development of ams techniques allow precise commonly c 1 determinations of 14c 12c or 14c 13c ratios to be made from a few milligrams of c synal 2013 kutschera 2016 this transition also reduced the need to collect and process large often in excess of 100 l volumes of water in the field that aside from not always being practical was prone to contamination by atmospheric co2 aggarwal et al 2014 the increase in the number of facilities globally together with the ease of measurement has contributed to the increased number of 14c studies of groundwater for example published studies listed on the scopus database increased from less than 20 per year before 1990 to more than 50 per year since 2010 conventions for the reporting of 14c data are discussed by stuiver and polach 1977 kalin 2000 plummer and glynn 2013 for ams the international standard is the national bureau of standards nbs oxalic acid normalisation of 14c 12c or 14c 13c ratios to 14c activities a14c in percent modern carbon pmc is common this normalisation commonly assumes that the δ13c values of dic are 25 which is generally appropriate for archaeology and tree ring studies by contrast the range of geochemical processes that occur in the unsaturated zone and below the water table commonly results in groundwater dic having a range of δ13c values because these processes may affect the 14c contents and δ13c values differently clark and fritz 1997 han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 meredith et al 2016 several authors e g kalin 2000 plummer and glynn 2013 han and plummer 2016 recommend that 14c values not be normalised un normalised 14c ratios are denoted as a14c in pmc however this recommendation is not commonly adhered to with many publications reporting normalised values received from the analytical facilities or not reporting whether normalisation has been carried out additionally pmc pmc and pmc and other variations such as mc notations are used interchangeably supplement table 1 the errors in calculated residence times introduced by incorrect normalisation are small relative to the other uncertainties in radiocarbon dating however more complete reporting is desirable especially for subsequent comparison or compilation of data here we use the generic term 14c contents meredith et al 2016 for the 14c of dic in groundwater while 14c contents of groundwater may be used as a qualitative indicator of residence time or mixing of older and younger water in aquifers dassi et al 2005a hamed et al 2008 iverach et al 2017 miller et al 2017 priestley et al 2017 many studies use this tracer to estimate residence times supplement table 1 the detection limit of 14c contents determined by ams are 1 pmc and precision is typically 1 2 plummer and glynn 2013 thus under ideal circumstances where the flow system is simple with little large scale mixing the initial 14c content of recharge is known and the sources of dic in the groundwater are well understood 14c could be used to determine residence times as old as 40 ka with an uncertainty of less than a few thousand years however potential contamination with atmospheric co2 during sampling and uncertainties in quantifying the sources of dic in groundwater result in large uncertainties in waters with low 14c contents plummer and glynn 2013 han and plummer 2016 an upper limit of 25 to 30 ka is probably more realistic kalin 2000 clark 2015 which still encompasses the residence times of groundwater in many regional aquifers due to the magnitude of the half life and the elevated atmospheric 14c contents of up to 200 pmc produced by atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s the bomb pulse it is difficult to use 14c to estimate residence times of regional groundwater where these are less than one or two thousand years clark and fritz 1997 kalin 2000 clark 2015 however estimating the residence times of post bomb pulse recharge using 14c in combination with other tracers such as 3h or the chlorofluorocarbons cfcs is sometimes possible le gal la salle et al 2001 cartwright et al 2007 following recharge the groundwater is isolated from the atmosphere and 14c decays to the common isotope of nitrogen 14n as groundwater commonly contains significant non radiogenic 14n the use of 14c to determine residence times relies on determining the loss of the parent isotope rather than the accumulation of the daughter in most studies of regional groundwater supplement table 1 residence times t are calculated assuming that atmospheric 14c contents have been constant over time this yields conventional radiocarbon ages in years before present bp where 1950 ce 0 years bp the assumption of constant atmospheric 14c contents allows residence times to be calculated from the measured 14c of dic 14ct using the decay equation 1 t 8267 l n 14 c t 14 c i q clark and fritz 1997 where q is the proportion of dic introduced via recharge and 14ci is the initial 14c of dic in the recharging water some authors vengosh et al 2007 burg et al 2013 huang et al 2017 combine the 14ci and q terms into a single term often denoted as a0 that accounts for processes such as carbonate dissolution that affect 14c contents post recharge however because both 14ci and q can vary it is useful to separate them 1 1 the terrestrial carbon cycle and carbon isotope ratios the use of 14c contents to determine residence times relies on understanding the changes to carbon isotope ratios in the terrestrial carbon cycle fig 1 a major challenge in using 14c to estimate residence times results from estimating the proportion of dic that originates as recharge q in eq 1 rather than being derived from within the aquifers most groundwater originates as direct recharge by rainfall that infiltrates through the soils and regolith to the water table although in arid and semi arid regions recharge from ephemeral rivers may also be important scanlon et al 2002 2006 healy 2010 dic in the recharging groundwater is derived from a combination of atmospheric co2 dic in surface waters dissolution of co2 from the soil zone and weathering of carbonate minerals in the unsaturated zone clark and fritz 1997 fig 2 the fractionations of 13c 12c and 14c 12c ratios in the terrestrial carbon cycle are described below prior to the significant combustion of fossil fuels the atmosphere had a pco2 of 10 3 5 atm and the δ13c value of atmospheric co2 was c 6 5 clark and fritz 1997 fig 1 the concentration of co2 in the soil zone is considerably higher pco2 commonly 10 3 to 10 1 atm than the atmosphere hence soil zone co2 is generally more important as a source of dic in the recharging groundwater the uptake of co2 by plants via photosynthesis fractionates the 13c 12c ratios with the degree of fractionation varying with the photosynthetic pathway o leary 1981 farquhar et al 1982 o leary 1988 farquhar et al 1989 around 80 of plant species use the c3 photosynthetic pathway still et al 2003 and the resultant plant material typically has δ13c values between 37 and 20 with a modal value of c 27 kohn 2010 fig 1 c4 plants which account for approximately 15 of species and include common crops such as maize and sugar cane as well as many grasses have δ13c values that are generally between 16 and 10 approximately 6 of plant species mainly in desert environments use cam photosynthesis which involves both c3 daytime and c4 night pathways smith and winter 1996 the resultant biomass δ13c values are intermediate between those of c3 and c4 plants bacteriologically mediated aerobic decay of plant matter in soils converts the biomass c back to co2 due to outgassing this process fractionates the 13c 12c ratios by c 4 cerling et al 1991 hence the δ13c of co2 produced from the decay of typical c3 vegetation δ13c 27 is c 23 and the δ13c of soil co2 produced from the decay of c4 vegetation δ13c 12 5 is c 8 5 however although these values are often quoted the range of possible δ13c values within the c3 and c4 plant classes are several per mil kohn 2010 the dissolved co2 dissociates into hco3 and co3 2 with the relative proportion of each c species varying proportional to ph vogel et al 1970 deines et al 1974 mook et al 1974 in low ph waters aqueous co2 dominates hco3 is dominant at circumneutral ph and co3 2 at high ph as each species has a different fractionation factor the δ13c of the dic varies with ph and temperature at ph 6 5 and 20 c the dic in equilibrium with co2 gas with a δ13c 23 has a δ13c of c 19 fig 1 carbonate minerals especially calcite may precipitate from the dic due to evapotranspiration in the soil and the formation of pedogenic carbonates as either nodules or calcrete layers is particularly common in semi arid and arid areas quade et al 1995 breecker et al 2009 takeuchi et al 2010 pedogenic calcite formed in equilibrium with soil co2 that has a δ13c of 23 at 20 c has a δ13c of c 12 bottinga 1968 the internationally accepted radiocarbon dating reference of 100 pmc is 95 of the 1950 ce content of 14c in the nbs oxalic acid normalised to δ13c 19 3 the factor of 0 95 adjusts the 14c content of the oxalic acid to that of pre industrial 1840 to 1860 wood from c3 vegetation due to the higher mass difference processes in the carbon cycle fractionate 14c 12c ratios by c 2 3 times the 13c 12c fractionations saliege and fontes 1984 cerling et al 1991 thus the 14c content of atmospheric co2 in equilibrium with that vegetation is c 104 pmc the aerobic decay of pre industrial c3 vegetation results in soil zone co2 having a 14c content of 100 5 pmc the corresponding 14c content of dic at ph 6 5 and 20 c is c 101 4 pmc as with the stable carbon isotopes differences in vegetation type and ph or temperatures in the soil zone result in differences in the 14c content of the dic however these differences are minor compared with some of uncertainties that are inherent in using 14c discussed below 1 2 carbon 14 as a residence time tracer an ideal groundwater residence time tracer would be non reactive be derived only from recharging water have well defined input functions and be easily and cheaply measured the utility of 14c to determine groundwater residence times largely stems from its convenient half life ubiquitous presence of dic and relative ease of measurement rather than it being an ideal tracer issues affecting the use of 14c include the several potential sources of 14c free carbon contained in aquifers that may be difficult to estimate and processes that affect the 14c contents of dic in the recharging water relatively little attention has also been paid to the long term variability of 14c contents of atmospheric co2 and adopting more realistic conceptualisations of flow in aquifers thus despite its wide use deriving groundwater residence times from 14c is not always straightforward and is prone to oversimplification supplement table 1 summarises a range of 14c residence time studies in arid and semi arid groundwater illustrating the wide use of 14c in these environments where possible we have indicated the methods used in the studies for analysis of 14c reporting of the carbon isotope ratios and correction for the input of 14c free dic in groundwater for residence time calculations 2 concentrations and isotopic ratios of dic in arid and semi arid regions this section summarises key issues that affect the use of 14c to estimate the residence times of groundwater some of these are common to groundwater from all environments however several are more important in semi arid and arid regions there are several potential sources of 14c free dic in aquifers which result in values of q in eq 1 being 1 if unaccounted for the addition of 14c free dic results in the overestimation of groundwater residence times understanding the input of 14c free dic is a major challenge in interpreting radiocarbon data in groundwater from all environments fontes 1992 aravena et al 1995 clark and fritz 1997 kalin 2000 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 cartwright 2010b han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 han and plummer 2016 closed system dissolution of carbonates in the aquifer matrix is a likely source of 14c free carbon and is the process most commonly considered in determining groundwater residence times values of q may be calculated from major ion geochemistry or the δ13c values of dic in groundwater via mass balance geochemical modelling using programs such as phreeqc or netpath or graphical techniques pearson and hanshaw 1970 vogel 1970 tamers 1975 fontes and garnier 1979 clark and fritz 1997 geyh 2000 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 clark 2015 salmon et al 2015 han and plummer 2016 the simplest form of the isotope mass balance equation 2 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c calcite δ 13 c recharge δ 13 c calcite estimates q from the measured δ13c values of groundwater dic δ13cdic calcite in the aquifers δ13ccalcite and the dic of groundwater recharge δ13crecharge this mass balance approach assumes that the δ13c values of the components are well known and that closed system calcite dissolution is the major process affecting 14c contents of groundwater dic while some studies discuss these assumptions and they are well explained in reference texts such as fontes 1992 clark and fritz 1997 and kalin 2000 it is not uncommon for isotope mass balances to be carried out with little discussion while the δ13c of dic is routinely measured many studies assume values of the δ13c of calcite commonly using a typical marine value of 0 and very few directly constrain the δ13c of the recharging water 2 1 other sources of 14c free dic in anoxic groundwater from all environments bacteria may use carbon as an electron acceptor and produce ch4 and or co2 aravena et al 1995 valentine et al 2004 leybourne et al 2006 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 cartwright 2010b abiogenic methanogenesis is also recorded but is probably more common at higher temperatures than that recorded in most groundwater sherwood lollar et al 2006 currell et al 2017 so4 2 is a more efficient electron acceptor than co2 and in the presence of so4 2 anaerobic bacteria will oxidise organic carbon represented as ch2o via reactions of the form 2ch2o so4 2 h2s 2hco3 because the organic carbon has low δ13c values this pathway of methanogenesis produces dic with low δ13c values and due to the 34s 32s fractionations between so4 2 and h2s the residual so4 2 has elevated δ34s values in the absence of so4 2 and no3 bacteria may produce methane from organic carbon via acetate fermentation 2ch2o 2h2o ch4 co2 due to the fractionation of 13c between ch4 and co2 50 80 valentine et al 2004 leybourne et al 2006 the co2 produced by this reaction has high δ13c values direct reduction of dic whiticar et al 1986 also results in the residual dic having high δ13c values while methanogenesis resulting from the direct reduction of dic does not appreciably change the 14c contents clark and fritz 1997 cartwright 2010b methanogenesis resulting from the breakdown of old organic material that is part of the aquifer matrix results in the dilution of 14c aravena et al 1995 mayo et al 2007 coetsiers and walraevens 2009 the diffusion of exogenic ch4 from deep organic rich formations can be accompanied by aerobic or anaerobic methanotrophic oxidation currell et al 2017 iverach et al 2017 this process can also result in dilution of 14c in the receiving aquifers the occurrence and pathway of methanogenesis may be inferred from groundwater geochemistry e g lack of dissolved oxygen low nitrate and or sulphate concentrations high δ34s and or δ13c values and the presence of dissolved methane leybourne et al 2006 cheung et al 2009 currell et al 2017 locally geogenic co2 derived from volcanic outgassing or deep crustal sources such as metamorphic devolatilisation may also be a source of 14c free dic cartwright et al 2002 caliro et al 2005 genereux et al 2009 koh et al 2017 co2 derived from the mantle and many igneous rocks has a δ13c of c 6 javoy et al 1986 clark and fritz 1997 which contrasts with those of marine limestones and the dic derived from the soil zone during recharge correction for methanotropic reactions methanogenesis or geogenic co2 input may again be made via a sequence of mass balance equations reactive transport models graphical techniques and or geochemical models however in the case of methanogenesis the pathways vary with the geochemistry of the waters and the types of bacteria present which results in the geochemical changes being difficult to predict in detail 2 2 14c content of unsaturated zone co2 commonly the interpretation of groundwater 14c data implicitly assumes that the co2 in the unsaturated zone has 14c contents that are similar to those of the atmosphere this may be appropriate for temperate zones with high recharge rates and relatively shallow unsaturated zones however the 14c content of co2 from the deep unsaturated zone in semi arid or arid regions may be significantly lower than that of the atmosphere bacon and keller 1998 thorstenson et al 1998 wood et al 2015 haas et al 2016 thorstenson et al 2016 the 14c contents of unsaturated zone co2 commonly systematically decrease from near atmospheric values at the surface to lower values near the water table for example the 14c content of co2 at ti tree central australia decreases from 100 pmc at shallower than 10 m below ground surface to as low as 50 pmc at the base of the unsaturated zone generally between 20 and 35 m in this area wood et al 2015 the 14c content of co2 from 7 m depth in the unsaturated zone at saskatoon canada is as low as 20 pmc bacon and keller 1998 and as low as 50 pmc at 8 5 m in the unsaturated zone in north dakota usa haas et al 2016 co2 at the base of the thick unsaturated zone c 110 m in nevada usa has a 14c content of 20 pmc walvoord et al 2005 the high 14c contents of the co2 in the shallow unsaturated zone probably results from plant root respiration and or the decay of recent organic matter although the latter is likely only within the root zone which may be up to a few metres thick in the case of deep rooted trees the low 14c contents of the deeper co2 most likely result from the oxidation of old organic matter below the root zone where there is no contribution of co2 from root respiration a decrease of po2 with depth thorstenson et al 1998 is also consistent with the oxidation of organic matter changes to the relative importance of root zone respiration vs organic matter oxidation increasing ages of organic material with depth and diffusion within the unsaturated zone produce the observed gradients in 14c contents of co2 while the 14c contents of unsaturated zone co2 are rarely measured the few studies that have measured it in semi arid to arid regions illustrate that automatically ascribing low 14c contents of dic largely to decay in groundwater may significantly overestimate groundwater residence times wood et al 2014 wood et al 2015 2 3 sources of recharge recharge of aquifers in high rainfall areas is dominantly by the direct infiltration of rainfall scanlon et al 2002 healy 2010 by contrast especially in low relief areas substantial recharge in arid and semi arid regions may occur through flooding of ephemeral rivers allison et al 1985 scanlon et al 2002 scanlon et al 2006 morin et al 2009 cendón et al 2010 meredith et al 2016 the dic concentrations in river water are generally substantially higher than those in rainfall since arid zone soils commonly have low organic carbon concentrations that result in low pco2 much of the dic in groundwater may originate from river recharge cendón et al 2010 meredith et al 2016 the δ13c values of dic in rivers are governed by in river processes such as mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon dissolution of particulate inorganic carbon in river respiration and photosynthesis and exchange with the atmosphere quay et al 1992 aucour et al 1999 telmer and veizer 1999 raymond and bauer 2001 striegl et al 2007 cartwright 2010a the balance of these processes results in variable δ13c values for example δ13c values of dic in the murray darling river system in semi arid southeast australia are 10 to 5 cartwright 2010a meredith et al 2016 dic in other major river systems from a variety of environments are similarly variable for example the ottawa river in canada has δ13c values of between 16 and 8 telmer and veizer 1999 δ13c values in the okavango delta range from 8 to 2 at low water levels to 12 to 6 at higher flows akoko et al 2013 while aucour et al 1999 reported that dic in the rhone river western europe had δ13c values of between 11 and 5 the δ13c values of dic in river recharge are generally significantly higher than those in equilibrium with soil co2 and are likely to vary between recharge events as the relative importance of the individual in river processes will also vary identifying the initial δ13c value of dic for the mass balance corrections of the type in eq 2 may be difficult likewise where recharge is episodic following major rainfall events the δ13c values of dic in the infiltrating water may be variable meredith et al 2018 where samples with a range of 14c contents are present trends in δ13c values 14c concentrations and dic concentrations may help constrain the composition of the end members generalised graphical techniques to determine the contribution of dic from different sources were discussed by han et al 2012 and han and plummer 2016 these techniques are likely to yield most information where there is a dominant source of dic and where the end members have well constrained and restricted geochemistry e g meredith et al 2016 2 4 evapotranspiration and open system carbonate dissolution semi arid and arid areas commonly have high potential evapotranspiration rates relative to rainfall totals supplement table 1 consequently the salinity of water in the soils and regolith can be high and calcite precipitation may occur in the soils or on the surface herczeg et al 2001 hacini et al 2008 gocke et al 2012 ephemeral water bodies such as small lakes or pools on the floodplain commonly have salt crusts that contain calcite together with gypsum and locally halite episodic recharge water may subsequently dissolve these near surface carbonates and consequently they may be the source of significant volumes of dic in the groundwater as the water table is commonly relatively deep in arid or semi arid areas much of this calcite dissolution may occur under open system conditions in an ideal case the δ13c values of the biomass and the temperature of evaporation will govern the δ13c values of pedogenic carbonate however as discussed above dic in surface water may have a wide range of δ13c values resulting from the relative rates of mineralisation of organic matter exchange with the atmosphere and photosynthesis by aquatic plants or algae consequently calcite formed by evapotranspiration of that dic will also have variable δ13c values calcite precipitated from small volumes of surface or soil water may occur under conditions approximating rayleigh crystallisation which will result in the progressive decrease of calcite δ13c values as evapotranspiration proceeds not suprisngly the δ13c values of soil and surface carbonates are variable quade et al 1989 quade et al 1995 landi et al 2003 breecker et al 2009 cartwright 2010a cartwright et al 2013 meredith et al 2016 the δ13c values of pedogenic calcite may also be temporally variable δ13c values of calcite deposited by evaporating flood waters from the darling river central australia were c 1 lower than the calcite present prior to the floods meredith et al 2016 where calcite is present in the unsaturated zone open system calcite dissolution may take place during recharge if the calcite δ13c values are known the changes to dic concentrations δ13c values and 14c contents caused by open system calcite dissolution may be predicted clark and fritz 1997 gillon et al 2009 cartwright et al 2013 the dissolution of calcite increases the ph of the water in the unsaturated zone if the reservoir of c in the soil co2 is large compared to that of c in the dic the exchange of c between the dic and co2 increases both δ13c values and 14c contents as ph increases this reflects the change in proportion of the aqueous co2 hco3 and co3 2 species in dic and the 13c 12c fractionation factors between those species and co2 fig 3 a shows the changes to ph and dic concentrations in water that initially has a ph of 5 5 and which contains c as its only dissolved component the calculations assumed t 20 c and pco2 values of 10 2 5 or 10 1 fig 3b shows the corresponding changes in the δ13c values and 14c contents of dic assuming that the calcite had a δ13c value of 0 and the 14c content of soil zone co2 was 100 pmc 13c fractionations may be calculated from vogel et al 1970 and mook et al 1974 and 14c 12c fractionations were assumed to be 2 3 times the 13c 12c fractionations saliege and fontes 1984 for an initial pco2 of 10 2 5 calcite saturation is achieved at ph c 7 5 resulting in a δ13c of 15 and a 14c content of c 104 pmc for an initial pco2 of 10 1 0 calcite saturation is achieved at ph c 6 7 resulting in a δ13c of 18 and a 14c content of c 102 pmc most groundwater studies utilise wells that are screened below the water table and relatively few studies have also directly studied processes in the unsaturated zone by sampling the infiltrating water nevertheless open system calcite dissolution may be evident from the presence of high 14c groundwater that also has relatively high δ13c values carmi et al 2009 gillon et al 2009 cartwright et al 2013 3 carbon 14 input and flow path geometry as noted above the decay equation eq 1 yields residence times in radiocarbon years however to compare the groundwater residence times with other datasets such as palaeoclimate records weninger and jöris 2008 conversion to calendar years is desirable calculation of residence times in calendar years requires that the variation in atmospheric 14c contents over time to be considered aside from the elevated 14c contents resulting from the atmospheric nuclear tests there have been long term variations in the rate of production of 14c due to variations in cosmic ray activity reimer et al 2009 comparisons with tree ring chronologies and u th ages of corals indicate that the 14c content of atmospheric co2 was as high as 170 pmc between 28 000 and 30 000 years ago the use of eq 1 also implicitly assumes one dimensional non dispersive flow piston flow such that all the groundwater collected at the well was recharged at the same time i e that it has a definite age this is obviously an oversimplification as groundwater flows along paths of varying lengths and undergoes hydrodynamic dispersion and diffusion which affects the solutes such as dic thus a groundwater sample contains aliquots of water that have a range of residence times rather than being of a specific and definable age maloszewski and zuber 1982 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 suckow 2014 in the absence of preferential flow and large scale mixing mean residence times may be estimated using lumped parameter models maloszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski and zuber 1992 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 jurgens et al 2012 lumped parameter models allow the variability of the 14c input more realistic flow path geometries and the effects of dispersion may be taken into account the 14c content of groundwater at time 14ct is related to the 14c content of dic in the recharging water over time 14ci via the convolution integral 3 14 c t 0 14 c i q t τ g τ e λ τ d τ where τ is the mean residence time t τ is the time when the water recharged λ is the decay constant and g τ is the response function that describes the distribution of flow paths and residence times in the aquifer there are several lumped parameter models that may be applied to different aquifer geometries maloszewski and zuber 1982 maloszewski and zuber 1992 amin and campana 1996 cook and bohlke 2000 maloszewski 2000 jurgens et al 2012 the dispersion model which is derived from the one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation is applicable to regional groundwater flow systems with layer parallel flow and is used here to illustrate the effects on calculated mean residence times similar results would be apparent from the other lumped parameter models atkinson et al 2014 howcroft et al 2017 calculations were made using the tracerlpm program jurgens et al 2012 the input function is the 14c record for atmospheric co2 reimer et al 2009 adjusted for the fractionation between atmospheric co2 and soil zone co2 fig 1 for this illustration all dic was assumed to originate from recharge i e q 1 the dispersion model requires the dispersion parameter that is the inverse of the more commonly reported peclet number and which describes the relative importance of dispersion relative to advection to be specified in regional scale groundwater systems the dispersion parameter is likely to be between 0 05 and 0 1 maloszewski 2000 equation 3 may also be applied to piston flow in which case it accounts for the temporal variations in the 14c content of the recharging water howcroft et al 2017 even where piston flow is assumed longer mean residence times are estimated using the 14c record in fig 4 as the input function than using the decay equation with a constant initial 14c content of 100 pmc fig 5 for example groundwater with a 14c content of 30 pmc yields mean residence times of 10 9 vs 9 4 ka from eq 1 this is due to the generally higher 14c content of atmospheric co2 over the last 30 ka than the present day values the mean residence times calculated from the dispersion lumped parameter model increase as dispersivity increases i e as the dispersion parameter increases again for a 14c content of 30 pmc the mean residence times are between 11 8 dispersion parameter of 0 05 and 12 4 ka dispersion parameter of 0 01 for a more highly dispersive system dispersion parameter of 0 5 a 14c content of 30 pmc yields a mean residence time of 17 7 ka the width of the residence time distribution i e the frequency distribution of the ages of the individual aliquots of water in the sample also increases with increasing dispersivity fig 6 since the decay of 14c is exponential the presence of a significant fraction of water with shorter residence times than the mean results in higher 14c contents at any given mean residence time while the lumped parameter models are simplified representations of groundwater systems they illustrate that assuming piston flow and certainly ignoring the long term variation in atmospheric 14c contents will most likely underestimate mean residence times additionally because it is difficult to ascertain the geometry of the groundwater flow paths or the degree of dispersion the difference in estimated mean residence times between plausible lumped parameter models represents an additional uncertainty on the calculated residence times in the example above the uncertainty resulting from varying the dispersion parameter is 5 3 ka for a residence time of 14 5 ka calculated as midway between the highest and lowest estimates this translates to a relative uncertainty of 20 which is larger than the total uncertainty in 14c residence times reported in many studies adopting a wider range of lumped parameter models will increase this uncertainty 4 macroscopic mixing diffusion and heterogenous flow lumped parameter models are valuable in exploring the range of residence times that may correspond to measured 14c activities which is important for attempts to understand the behaviour of groundwater in the context of other palaeoclimate archives while this is probably an improvement on calculating groundwater ages in radiocarbon years lumped parameter models still make several major simplifying assumptions namely uniform aquifer thickness steady state flow and homogenous aquifer properties maloszewski and zuber 1992 cook and bohlke 2000 jurgens et al 2012 additionally most lumped parameter models use analytical solutions that assume a smooth distribution of residence times in the groundwater samples which is very difficult to validate in many aquifers these conditions may not be realised hydraulic conductivities of most aquifers are heterogeneous on scales ranging from millimetres to hundreds of metres sudicky 1986 rehfeldt et al 1992 bohling et al 2012 flow through heterogeneous aquifers may mix waters with different mean residence times macroscopic mixing or aggregation may result in groundwater samples having irregular and unpredictable residence time distributions kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 especially where mixing of waters with significantly different residence times occurs the simple calculation of mean residence times from radioisotopes may be impracticable mccallum et al 2014 suckow 2014 mccallum et al 2015 jasechko 2016 iverach et al 2017 stewart et al 2017 the impacts of mixing of multiple aliquots of water with a range of residence times may however produce groundwater samples with residence time distributions similar to those predicted by the lumped parameter models cartwright and morgenstern 2016 due to the availability of infrastructure many studies of regional groundwater systems have utilised samples from long screened production wells if these wells extract water from several discrete higher permeability layers this may also cause the mixing of water of different residence times during sampling that hampers the determination of residence times additional complications in estimating residence times arise in dual porosity and fractured media e g neretnieks 1981 maloszewski and zuber 1985 groundwater located in isolated pores in fractured rocks may have a long residence time and consquently low 14c contents fig 7 diffusion of dic between the isolated pores the fractures may result in residence times estimated from 14c being far longer than the residence time of the water flowing through the fractures with the discrpency increasing as the fracture spacing decreases neretnieks 1981 similarly diffusion of old dic from low permeability clays may reduce the 14c content of the groundwater in adjacent high permeability lithologies which also increases the apparent mean residence times of the groundwater extracted from those units davidson and airey 1982 sanford 1997 bethke and johnson 2008 adsorption of solute tracers such as dic onto minerals in the aquifer matrix may also occur in low porosity media which may cause decoupling of 14c and o and h isotopes which are part of the water molecule maloszewski and zuber 1985 in many instances it may be more realistic to consider that the groundwater is comprised of multiple fractions of waters of different broad ages estimating the fraction of water younger than a threshold residence time at which the impacts of aggregation do not significantly impact the shape of the residence time distribution may be possible e g kirchner 2016 alternatively the presence of short timescale tracers such as 3h or the cfcs in groundwater with relatively low 14c contents may be used to identify and estimate the fractions of younger and older water jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 however while these issues are broadly recognised the desire to estimate residence times will probably continue as they are perceived as being useful for assessing practical issues such as sustainability of groundwater extraction or recharge rates at the very least the potential effects of mixing and dispersion on groundwater residence times need to be acknowledged employing multiple radioactive tracers or other relative residence time indicators such as stable isotopes or noble gases may highlight that mixing has occurred maloszewski and zuber 1985 le gal la salle et al 2001 cartwright et al 2007 mccallum et al 2014 2015 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 5 implications for estimating groundwater residence times the processes discussed above have implications for whether and how realistic residence times may be estimated in groundwater from arid and semi arid regions where 14c contents have been used to estimate residence times e g supplement table 1 most studies have used the δ13c values of dic to assess processes that may affect the 14c contents either via isotope mass balance calculations or as part of a broader geochemical analysis via programs such as netpath while it is generally recognised that assessment of the 14c contents is needed to derive groundwater residence times several assumptions are commonly made firstly few studies consider processes other than closed system calcite dissolution while some degree of closed system calcite dissolution is probably ubiquitous in groundwater systems open system calcite dissolution and methanogenesis may also be locally important relatively few studies have measured the δ13c values of calcite in the aquifer matrix in some cases there may be measurements of calcite δ13c values from similar sediments to those that form the aquifers however many studies assume that δ13c values of the calcite are close to 0 while a δ13c value of 0 for marine sediments is defensible the global average δ13c of marine carbonates over the last 600 ma has varied from approximately 2 to 6 veizer et al 1999 additionally individual sediment sequences may have a range of δ13c values due to secular variations in ocean δ13c values metabolic and or kinetic processes in the ocean biosphere diagenesis or post depositional alteration carpenter and lohmann 1997 for example authigenic calcite in late permian coal measures of the bowen basin qld australia have δ13c values between 19 and 10 9 uysal et al 2000 sediments in semi arid and arid areas also commonly contain calcite veins and cements formed by the circulation of evaporated groundwater that is close to saturation with calcite as outlined above this calcite is likely to have variable δ13c values thus if it forms a significant part of the calcite in the aquifer matrix the extent of closed system calcite dissolution will be difficult to predict from the δ13c values of dic unless aquifer carbonate δ13c values are also analysed unlike marine calcite that formed during sedimentation this calcite may contain above background 14c contents i e if it was formed in the last 40 ka if that is the case the impacts of dissolution on the 14c contents of groundwater are more difficult to predict still fewer studies have direct constraints on the δ13c values of co2 in the unsaturated zone some studies report δ13c values of organic matter in the soil pessenda et al 1998 cartwright et al 2010 hagedorn and bushner 2015 or pedogenic carbonates cendón et al 2014 but few report δ13c values of soil co2 or the dic in soil water many studies assume δ13c values of soil co2 of c 23 and assign a δ13c value of c 19 to 18 to dic formed in the soil zone based on the expected 13c 12c fractionations in the carbon cycle fig 1 even where the soil carbon pool is derived only from c3 vegetation the potential range of δ13c values is still several per mil kohn 2010 additionally open system calcite dissolution or recharge by flood waters may result in the δ13c values of the recharging water being variable and difficult to predict chemical mass balance based on the major ion geochemistry is potentially an alternative method of determining closed system calcite dissolution that does not depend on interpreting δ13c values however especially in environments where evapotranspiration rates are high precipitation of calcite or other ca bearing minerals such as gypsum may make such calculations difficult determining the δ13c values of more of the carbon sources e g organic matter dic in soil water and surface water and calcite from the soils or aquifers and ensuring that groundwater with a range of 14c contents from throughout the flow system has been sampled may allow the dominant processes impacting dic contents to be determined e g via the graphical techniques discussed by han et al 2012 and han and plummer 2016 this approach is likely to yield most information where the potential sources of dic have a restricted range of δ13c values and where there is a small number of geochemical processes impacting dic concentrations and isotopic ratios not accounting for variations in the 14c content of the atmosphere fig 4 makes a significant yet largely unremarked upon difference to the calculated mean residence times for water recharged greater than 15 000 years ago the 14c content of the atmosphere was likely 120 pmc which results in calculated mean residence times being c 20 longer regardless of which method is used this difference is a similar magnitude to the uncertainties often quoted from uncertainties in the degree of closed system calcite dissolution it is more difficult to assess whether macroscopic mixing and diffusion are sufficiently significant that defining a residence time is unreasonable however this is obviously a critical issue as it dictates whether the results of residence time calculations are fundamentally valid the effects of diffusion and mixing may be identified by using 14c in conjunction with other residence time indicators e g kronfeld et al 1993 plummer et al 2004 dassi et al 2005b cartwright et al 2007 2010 2017a kulongoski et al 2008 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 iverach et al 2017 priestley et al 2017 discordant concentrations of radioisotopes with widely different half lives e g 3h 14c 4he and 36cl may indicate diffusive input from low porosity lithologies the leaking of young water into older regional groundwater or other complexities in the flow systems cartwright et al 2007 2010 bethke and johnson 2008 kulongoski et al 2008 eberts et al 2012 jasechko 2016 jasechko et al 2017 iverach et al 2017 howcroft et al 2017 even where the flow system is reasonably simple uncertainties in its geometry or the degree of dispersion can result in substantial uncertainties in mean transit times atkinson et al 2014 howcroft et al 2017 concentrations of multiple radioactive tracers can potentially be used in models that employ particle tracking and or direct simulation of ages suckow 2014 such analysis can help to constrain flow and mixing and provide greater constraints on possible residence times although the use of multiple tracer concentration data may result in non unique solutions determining an increasing number of age tracer concentrations in a given sample will also amplify the impact of uncertainties embedded in each method for example 36cl has uncertainties relating to the input function that is poorly known over time the degree of in situ 36cl production and the possibility that cl is recycled through salt lakes and playas in enclosed semi arid basins phillips 2000 cartwright et al 2017b dissolved noble gas radioisotopes will likely have different diffusivities and adsorption coefficients to dic e g maloszewski and zuber 1985 6 conclusions this review has highlighted the important role that estimating groundwater residence time using 14c plays in understanding the hydrogeology of semi arid and arid regions perhaps because of the improvements in analytical techniques such studies are becoming more commonplace which is improving our understanding of these critical environments the application of 14c is not always straightforward however and many studies including several of the authors have not considered many of the possible problems in its application commonly studies have focussed on estimating residence times and have generally considered the closed system dissolution of 14c calcite however this neglects other processes that impact the 14c content of dic and the treatment of calcite dissolution is sometimes formulaic in many cases it may not be possible to estimate a meaningful mean residence time and even where it is uncertainties in the geometry of the flow path or degree of dispersion introduce considerable uncertainties in the mean residence times that are rarely considered estimating broad ranges of residence times or fractions of younger and older water using 14c in conjunction with other tracers will generally be robust and perhaps is the only realistic outcome in many situations while attempts to calculate residence times and the parameters that stem from these such as recharge rates groundwater fluxes or sustainable groundwater use may be desirable the limitations need to be recognised and the assumptions tested a more critical appraisal of radiocarbon will increase confidence in the results

5946,in this study we provide a simplified equation with a new concise set of parameters defining the approximate interface profile in stratified coastal aquifers we derive the solution directly by applying the dupuit forchheimer approximation at the outset and mathematically prove its sameness for the uniform flow in a vertical plane with the interface profile computed using the comprehensive discharge potential theory by strack and ausk 2015 we present a surprising result that interface elevation in the case with a seepage and outflow face at the coastal boundary turns out to be same as in which water table and interface coincides with the coastline the interface profile is a function of the transmissivity field centroid elevation and the total transmissivity of the freshwater flow domain above the interface we found that the boundary potential at the coast in the discharge potential theory solution represents the first moment of the transmissivity we also analyzed the differences in the interface profiles in aquifers with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts for two sets of boundary conditions constant head and constant flux for a given flux boundary interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts converge in the upper part of the aquifer and diverge at the aquifer bottom leading to different toe positions conversely for a given head boundary interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts significantly differ in the upper part of the aquifer while converge at the aquifer bottom resulting in the same toe position we provide explicit solutions for the toe position and freshwater discharge in unconfined aquifers an extension to our previous work for confined aquifers insights from the newly identified parameters can also potentially help in reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the real world swi extent and optimize the requirement of the extent of the hydraulic conductivity field characterization keywords groundwater coastal aquifers seawater intrusion stratified aquifers analytical solution 1 introduction delineation of the seawater freshwater interface is one of the critical tasks for investigating coastal hydrogeological systems many studies have assumed the existence of an interface separating freshwater and seawater in coastal aquifers and provided analytical solutions for the interface profile under different hydrogeological settings including the interface in steady homogeneous aquifers bakker 2006 bear 1972 strack 1976 and transient homogeneous aquifers bear 1972 bear and dagan 1964 bear et al 1985 isaacs and hunt 1986 vappicha and nagaraja 1976 and the stochastic solution for steady random hydraulic conductivity fields dagan and zeitoun 1998 naji et al 1998 in coastal areas heterogeneity often exhibits a pattern of horizontal layering or stratification as shown in many field investigations of sedimentary aquifers dagan and zeitoun 1998 lu et al 2013 demonstrated through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations in a three layer aquifer that the toe position and shape of the mixing zone vary significantly with different layer placements even with same hydraulic conductivities collins and gelhar 1971 and mualem and bear 1974 provided analyses to predict the interface shape in a homogeneous system divided into two layers by a semi pervious layer for a more general layered case rumer and shiau 1968 provided the first analytical solution which however was proved to be erroneous by strack 2016 as it did not satisfy the flow continuity recently strack and ausk 2015 provided an analytical solution for the interface profile for three dimensional flow using the dupuit forchheimer approximation based on the comprehensive discharge potential in layered coastal aquifers their solution included series summation of combinations of layer properties i e hydraulic conductivity elevation and thickness of each layer we present a concise equation with new parameters which improves our understanding of the stratification effects on the interface and allows us to make more general conclusions strack et al 2016 proposed an artificial reduction of the hydraulic conductivity by injecting a precipitate in the upper part of the coastal aquifer as a measure to reduce seawater intrusion rathore et al 2018b explained the effectiveness of this strategy through their transmissivity centroid elevation tce concept and commented that reducing the conductivity of the top part of the aquifer essentially lowers the tce thus reducing the swi werner and simmons 2009 studied the different impact of sea level rise on swi due to two different landward boundary types namely constant head boundary and constant flux boundary and suggested that flux is the fundamental parameter controlling swi and even in constant head boundary case resulting flux would be the key chang et al 2011 and chang and clement 2012 confirmed the sensitivity of swi in response to sea level rise to the boundary type in this study we derive a more concise equation for the interface profile taking advantage of the restriction to flow in the vertical plane in stratified coastal aquifers by using dupuit forchheimer approximation at the outset the proposed new parameters make it convenient to analyze the effects of stratification on the interface profile we also prove mathematically that the proposed equation represents the same interface solution as obtained from the vertically integrated flow solution by strack and ausk 2015 we further provide a new interpretation of the discharge potential at the coast by comparing our equation with the vertically integrated flow solution strack and ausk 2015 we study and explain the difference in interface profile in aquifer configurations with hydraulic conductivity contrasts in two sets of boundary conditions namely constant head and constant flux boundary we then discuss the implications of the insights obtained from the new parameters on the uncertainties in the estimation of swi extent for random hydraulic conductivity fields 2 conceptual model we consider a stationary interface in a two dimensional confined and unconfined aquifer with horizontal stratification in the hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 1 the seaward freshwater discharge q x l 2 t is assumed to be in a vertical plane with no recharge or pumping uniform flow in the case of pumping we need to perform 3d analysis as the vertical slice of the aquifer if not a representative of flow field which varies along the coastline however based on governing equation eq 2 we can expect steeper interface on the landward side of the pumping well and gradual slop of the interface on the coastal side uniform recharge can be modeled through a linearly increasing discharge in the flow direction in the region of recharge which will be an additional factor one factor is decreasing thickness of freshwater flow domain causing increase in steepness of the interface in the flow direction however elegant explicit solution is not possible in either case we assume a constant head in the vertical plane by adopting dupuit dupuit 1863 and forchheimer forchheimer 1886 approximation the aquifer is underlain by an impermeable layer and bounded by vertical boundaries at the inland and coastal ends the flow domain can be divided into two zones an interface zone consisting of both freshwater and seawater zone 1 and zone consisting only freshwater and no interface zone 2 let the origin be at the point where the aquifer base meets coastline the x axis along the top of the underlying impervious layer pointing towards inland and the y axis along the vertical coastline pointing upwards l l h s l and x t l represent the distance of the inland boundary from the coastal boundary seawater head at the coastal boundary and interface toe position respectively the inland boundary can be a constant total flux q x in a flux controlled system or constant head h f l in a head controlled system although in fig 1 we have only depicted a constant head boundary note that the total boundary flux redistributes in proportion to transmissivities in each layer the interface profile is described by ζ l which represents the y coordinate of the interface as a function of x in a confined aquifer the layers are indexed from 1 to n from bottom to top where n is the total number of layers for a particular ith layer the thickness center elevation base elevation and hydraulic conductivity are represented by b i l y i l d i l and k i l t respectively note that the elevations are with respect to the base of the aquifer unless mentioned otherwise h l is the freshwater head above sea level b l and t l 2 t represent the total aquifer thickness and transmissivity respectively 1 b i 1 n b i t i 1 n t i in an unconfined aquifer n is the index for the highest layer below the sea level it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of the part of the aquifer containing the water table is uniform denoted by k n 1 i e the water table is contained within a single layer which is a reasonable assumption given the elevation of the water above the sea level is fairly small relative to the layer thicknesses for most practical cases we can expect k n k n 1 the h l is the water table elevation above the sea level 3 theory 3 1 confined aquifer the freshwater flowrate per unit width of the aquifer at any cross section can be given by darcy s law after adopting dupuit forchheimer approximation as 2 q x t ζ dh dx t ζ l 2 t is the total transmissivity of the flow domain above the interface we evaluate h using the ghyben herzberg relation badon ghyben

the index of the layer containing the interface at any aquifer cross section after substituting t ζ in eq 5 and rearranging we get 7 d ζ dx q x α k m d m 1 ζ m 1 n t j it should be noted that the index m in the above equation is also a function of ζ for a particular i th layer x can be evaluated by integration 8 d x 1 α q x k i d i 1 ζ i 1 n t j d ζ which results in 9 x ζ α q x k i d i 1 ζ 2 t ui c i where i is the layer index in which ζ lies t ui i 1 n t j l 2 t represents the total transmissivity of the flow domain above the i th layer to evaluate c i we adopt an assumption which was also used in bear 1972 to evaluate the interface profile in a homogenous aquifer the interface meets the top of the aquifer at the coastal boundary x 0 ζ b we apply this boundary condition in eq 9 for the n th layer to get 10 c n k n b 2 2 q x α we find the relation between consecutive c i s by satisfying the continuity of the interface across the layers we evaluate x at ζ d i using eq 9 in both i th and i 1 th layers 11 x d i α q x k i d i 1 d i 2 t ui c i d i α q x k i 1 d i d i 2 t u i 1 c i 1 after rearranging eq 11 we get 12 c i c i 1 d i 2 2 α q x k i k i 1 from eqs 10 and 12 we derive the equation for a general c i as see appendix a 13 c i 1 α q x i 1 n t j y j k i d i 1 2 2 by substituting c i from eq 13 into 9 and rearranging the equation we thus obtain the equation for the interface profile in a fully explicit form as 14 x 1 α q x t ui y ci ζ k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 where y ci l is the elevation of the centroid of the transmissivity referred henceforth as transmissivity centroid elevation or tce in the flow domain above the i th layer computed as 15 y ci i 1 n t j y j t ui to extend the above solution to the continuously varying hydraulic conductivity field we conceptualize it by a large number of very thin layers thus the term k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 approaches zero and the term t ui y ci ζ can be replaced by t ζ y c ζ ζ where t ζ and y c ζ represents the transmissivity and tce respectively for the aquifer above ζ freshwater flow domain 16 x 1 α q x t ζ y c ζ ζ 17 t ζ ζ b k y d y y c ζ ζ b k y d y t ζ eqs 14 and 16 reveal the new parameters namely local transmissivity t ζ

conductivity k t ζ and y c ζ can be evaluated as k b ζ and b ζ 2 respectively which when substituted in eq 16 results in the interface profile as 18 x 1 2 α q x b 2 ζ 2 which is well known dupuit parabola bear 1979 in many swi studies like the transience of swi chang and clement 2012 lu and werner 2013 rathore et al 2018a watson et al 2010 we are more concerned about the toe position than the whole interface profile we get the equation of the toe position by putting ζ 0 in eqs 14 or 16 19 x t t y c α q x where y c is the tce of the whole flow domain computed as 20 y c 1 n t j y j t the toe position eq 19 is exactly the same as that reported by rathore et al 2018b derived using the comprehensive discharge potential theory strack and ausk 2015 we derive the interface profile equation for the head controlled system by substituting the solution for q x given by rathore et al 2018b in terms of the tce for a stratified interface flow 21 q x t l h f h s where h s is the corrected coastal head given as h s h s 1 1 α y c α and y c represents the tce of the aquifer interface solution for the head controlled system therefore is given as 22 x l α t h f h s t ui y ci ζ k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 3 2 unconfined aquifer using a similar method we derive an explicit solution for the interface profile in the unconfined coastal aquifer t u for the unconfined aquifer is expressed as 23 t u ζ h s h k y d y k m d m 1 ζ m 1 n t j k n 1 h h l in this case represents the water table elevation above the sea level which can be approximated using the ghyben herzberg approximation badon ghyben 1888 as h s ζ α

rearranging eq 28 results in 29 c i c i 1 d i 2 2 α q x k i k i 1 from eqs 27 and 29 we derive an equation for a general c i similar to the confined case 30 c i 1 α q x i 1 n t j y j k i d i 1 2 2 k n

the flow domain between the ith layer and the sea level computed using the same equation as in the confined case eq 15 rathore et al 2018b discovered that tce is the key parameter accounting for the stratification effects on swi in coastal aquifers and provided solutions for the toe position and freshwater discharge in terms of the tce for the confined aquifers using the derived interface profile in eq 31 we can easily find such solutions to the unconfined aquifers which were not provided previously by putting ζ 0 we get x t as 32 x t t q x α y c k n 1 h s 2 2 α t where y c is the tce of the flow domain below sea level computed as in eq 20 the solution for the discharge is provided in eq 33 and the derivation is provided in appendix b for the sake of brevity the first term of the solution

x t l h f h s 1 1 α y c α k n 1 2 l h f h s 2 it is important to note here that the solutions for the interface profile toe position and discharge derived for the unconfined aquifer eqs 31 33 can also be presented as general solutions applicable to both confined and unconfined cases for the impermeable confining bed in confined aquifers setting the k values of the top layer to zero in eqs 31 33 results in the solutions for the confined cases these equations reveal a new approach to analyzing stratification effects in coastal aquifers with the discovery of the centroid of the transmissivity field and the transmissivity of the region containing freshwater flow above the seawater wedge also referred as local transmissivity parameters as key parameters controlling the interface profile at the interface toe local tce is same as the tce for the whole depth which allows us to directly compute exact freshwater discharge and approximate toe position rathore et al 2018b tce based approach provides a better understanding of stratification effects with much fewer parameters for a large number of layers in appendix c starting from the strack s solution strack and ausk 2015 for the interface elevation which is based on the potential theory and dupuit approximation we arrive at our equation we thus showed that our concise equation represents the same solution as strack s but restricted to flow in the vertical plane as opposed to the three dimensional flow considered by strack and not applicable to a vertical coastline with seepage and outflow faces taken into account to our surprise the interface elevation in the case with a seepage and outflow face at the coastal boundary as considered by strack and ausk 2015 turns out to be same in the case where we assume water table interface coinciding with the coastline 4 discussion 4 1 the proposed equation in the context of the existing comprehensive discharge potential theory strack and ausk 2015 strack et al 2016 strack s solution strack and ausk 2015 is more general as it is applicable to three dimensional vertically integrated flow and allows the inclusion of recharge and pumping as well our equation although with stricter assumptions allows us to gain some critical insights about stratification effects on the interface profile in this section we discuss how the new parameters in the proposed equations correspond to the comprehensive discharge potential for vertically integrated groundwater flow by strack and ausk 2015 we will limit our discussion to confined aquifers strack s solution for the interface in terms of comprehensive discharge potential is of the form 34 x 1 q x φ φ 0 where φ is the comprehensive discharge potential referred henceforth as potential at x obtained in terms of interface elevation ζ after adopting dupuit approximation φ 0 is the potential at the coastal boundary which is only a function of aquifer parameters we rearrange our equation eq 14 into a form similar to eq 34 so as to delineate a term independent of ζ 35 x 1 q x 1 α ζ i 1 n t j 1 i t j y j k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 1 α 1 n t j y j comparing eqs 34 and 35 we can identify ζ dependent terms as φ and the terms independent of ζ as φ 0 36 φ 1 α ζ i 1 n t j 1 i t j y j k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 37 φ 0 1 α 1 n t j y j with the assumption of no seepage face h s b we verified that the above φ and φ 0 are mathematically the same as presented in strack and ausk 2015 therefore the boundary potential in the comprehensive discharge potential theory essentially represents the first moment of the transmissivity 4 2 interface profile in layer configurations with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts using the derived interface profile solutions we examine the interface in different aquifer configurations of hydraulic conductivity contrasts between layers for two boundary types namely constant head and constant flux boundary note that for a given aquifer configuration the interface profile solution will be identical in the case of a given discharge as boundary or a fixed boundary head resulting in the same discharge eq 22 also in stratified aquifers with constant head boundary the toe position is independent of the hydraulic conductivity values and controlled by aquifer tce spatial arrangement of conductivities rathore et al 2018b here we consider a simple three layer aquifer representing an aquifer system with a layer of different hydraulic conductivity embedded in a homogeneous aquifer the thickness of each layer is equal to 4 m h s 12 m the density of the freshwater is ρ f 1000 kg m3 and the density of seawater is ρ s 1025 kg m3 for both boundary types different aquifer configurations corresponding to different hydraulic conductivity contrasts represented by λ k 2 k 1 are solved where k 2 represents the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer and k 1 of the top and bottom layers k 1 is equal to 10 m d in all the cases and k 2 is varied to vary λ for a given discharge boundary value q x 0 4 m2 d five λ values namely 0 1 1 10 50 and 100 are considered for a head boundary value h f 12 5 m and l 100 m three λ values namely 0 01 1 and 100 are considered it is important to note that for the considered symmetric aquifers different k contrasts results in different total transmissivities but same tce which is the centroid elevation of the transmissivity field fig 2 a shows that in given flux boundary case the interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts converge in the top layer of the aquifer and diverge at the bottom resulting in significantly different toe positions because of different k 2 or t eq 14 for a constant flux higher λ implying higher t results in lower head gradient in the aquifer darcy s law thus leading to a gentler slope of the interface and longer toe length close to the coastal boundary all the freshwater flow exit into the sea from the top layer resulting in the same discharge in the top layer in all aquifer configurations hence the same discharge and the same top layer k leads to the same head gradients and overlapping interface profiles in the top layer for a given head boundary fig 2b the interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts are significantly different in the upper part of the aquifer however converge to the same point at the bottom of the aquifer i e the same toe position it is important to realize that in a for a given head boundary the shrinking freshwater flow domain due to seawater wedge results in a steeper head gradient closer to the coastal boundary to generate higher flow velocities for the flow continuity this is distinct from the single density flow where the head gradient is uniform throughout the length of the aquifer in aquifer configurations with higher λ values there is a higher discharge in the middle layer and eventually in the upper layer as an outflow resulting in the rapid increase in the interface slope closer to the coast however in the lower part of the layer the freshwater flowrate remains unchanged with changing λ s because of fixed k and boundary heads thus resulting in the overlapping interface profiles and the same toe position 4 3 implications of the dependence of the interface on the local transmissivity parameters the proposed equation implies that the extent of swi at any elevation is governed by the transmissivity field only above the interface elevation described by parameters local transmissivity t ζ and local tce y c ζ eq 16 this result has significant implications on the estimation of the swi extent in stratified coastal aquifers in a stratified coastal aquifer if the layer arrangement of a certain set of layers in the aquifer is altered the part of interface profile above the rearranged layers will remain unaffected and only the profile within and below the rearranged layer will be altered we demonstrate this through numerical simulation of a simple three layer case the hydraulic conductivity of the 20 m thick top layer is assumed to be 50 m d and of 15 m thick lower layers as 10 m d and 100 m d two cases are considered in which placements of lower two layers are switched case 1 in which 10 m d layer is placed above 100 m d layer and case 2 in which 100 m d layer placed above the 10 m d layer other aquifer parameters are listed in table 1 as expected due to dependence of the interface profile on the local transmissivity parameters interface profiles plotted for both the cases in fig 3 overlap in the top layer and are separated in bottom two layers with the interface toe at around 200 m in case 1 and 275 m in case 2 we can extend the conclusion from the above analysis to the case of random heterogeneity the uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity in a particular stratum of the aquifer will results in the uncertain interface profile in that stratum and the domain below it however the profile in the part above the uncertain stratum will still be deterministic furthermore we can also conclude that if the uncertain stratum is placed at the top of the aquifer it will result in the higher variance of the toe position and if placed at the bottom of the aquifer will result in the lower variance of the toe position with a more detailed study these insights could be used to optimize the field characterization extent to meet the budget constraints and uncertainty requirements 5 conclusion by applying the dupuit forchheimer approximation at the outset we directly derived the explicit analytical solution for the seawater freshwater interface profile in stratified coastal aquifers we mathematically showed that the proposed equation represents the solution computed from the vertically integrated groundwater flow solution by strack and ausk 2015 for the special case of flow in the vertical plane we also revealed that the interface elevation will be same in the cases with two fundamentally different coastal boundaries namely the boundary with seepage and outflow face and the one with coinciding interface water table and coastline the proposed equation is concise compared to the existing solution and provides new parameters governing the interface profile the interface profile is found to be a function of the elevation of the transmissivity field centroid and the total transmissivity of the freshwater flow domain above a given point on the interface we discussed our equation in the context of the comprehensive discharge potential theory and showed that the coastal boundary potential essentially represents the first moment of the transmissivity based on the derived equation we examined differences in the interface profiles in the aquifer configurations with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts in cases with given head and given flux boundaries we found that with a given flux boundary the interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts have different toe positions but converge and overlap in the upper part of the aquifer conversely when we consider a given head boundary we found interface profiles very different interface profiles in the upper part of the aquifer but the same toe position in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts the dependence of interface profile on local transmissivity parameters can potentially help in optimizing the extent of the field characterization for the hydraulic conductivity the simplicity of our equation makes way for much other theoretical analysis for stratified coastal aquifers for example the equation for the interface profile can be integrated to calculate the volume of the intruded seawater and analyze the transience of the seawater intrusion and retreat analytically in

5946,in this study we provide a simplified equation with a new concise set of parameters defining the approximate interface profile in stratified coastal aquifers we derive the solution directly by applying the dupuit forchheimer approximation at the outset and mathematically prove its sameness for the uniform flow in a vertical plane with the interface profile computed using the comprehensive discharge potential theory by strack and ausk 2015 we present a surprising result that interface elevation in the case with a seepage and outflow face at the coastal boundary turns out to be same as in which water table and interface coincides with the coastline the interface profile is a function of the transmissivity field centroid elevation and the total transmissivity of the freshwater flow domain above the interface we found that the boundary potential at the coast in the discharge potential theory solution represents the first moment of the transmissivity we also analyzed the differences in the interface profiles in aquifers with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts for two sets of boundary conditions constant head and constant flux for a given flux boundary interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts converge in the upper part of the aquifer and diverge at the aquifer bottom leading to different toe positions conversely for a given head boundary interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different conductivity contrasts significantly differ in the upper part of the aquifer while converge at the aquifer bottom resulting in the same toe position we provide explicit solutions for the toe position and freshwater discharge in unconfined aquifers an extension to our previous work for confined aquifers insights from the newly identified parameters can also potentially help in reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the real world swi extent and optimize the requirement of the extent of the hydraulic conductivity field characterization keywords groundwater coastal aquifers seawater intrusion stratified aquifers analytical solution 1 introduction delineation of the seawater freshwater interface is one of the critical tasks for investigating coastal hydrogeological systems many studies have assumed the existence of an interface separating freshwater and seawater in coastal aquifers and provided analytical solutions for the interface profile under different hydrogeological settings including the interface in steady homogeneous aquifers bakker 2006 bear 1972 strack 1976 and transient homogeneous aquifers bear 1972 bear and dagan 1964 bear et al 1985 isaacs and hunt 1986 vappicha and nagaraja 1976 and the stochastic solution for steady random hydraulic conductivity fields dagan and zeitoun 1998 naji et al 1998 in coastal areas heterogeneity often exhibits a pattern of horizontal layering or stratification as shown in many field investigations of sedimentary aquifers dagan and zeitoun 1998 lu et al 2013 demonstrated through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations in a three layer aquifer that the toe position and shape of the mixing zone vary significantly with different layer placements even with same hydraulic conductivities collins and gelhar 1971 and mualem and bear 1974 provided analyses to predict the interface shape in a homogeneous system divided into two layers by a semi pervious layer for a more general layered case rumer and shiau 1968 provided the first analytical solution which however was proved to be erroneous by strack 2016 as it did not satisfy the flow continuity recently strack and ausk 2015 provided an analytical solution for the interface profile for three dimensional flow using the dupuit forchheimer approximation based on the comprehensive discharge potential in layered coastal aquifers their solution included series summation of combinations of layer properties i e hydraulic conductivity elevation and thickness of each layer we present a concise equation with new parameters which improves our understanding of the stratification effects on the interface and allows us to make more general conclusions strack et al 2016 proposed an artificial reduction of the hydraulic conductivity by injecting a precipitate in the upper part of the coastal aquifer as a measure to reduce seawater intrusion rathore et al 2018b explained the effectiveness of this strategy through their transmissivity centroid elevation tce concept and commented that reducing the conductivity of the top part of the aquifer essentially lowers the tce thus reducing the swi werner and simmons 2009 studied the different impact of sea level rise on swi due to two different landward boundary types namely constant head boundary and constant flux boundary and suggested that flux is the fundamental parameter controlling swi and even in constant head boundary case resulting flux would be the key chang et al 2011 and chang and clement 2012 confirmed the sensitivity of swi in response to sea level rise to the boundary type in this study we derive a more concise equation for the interface profile taking advantage of the restriction to flow in the vertical plane in stratified coastal aquifers by using dupuit forchheimer approximation at the outset the proposed new parameters make it convenient to analyze the effects of stratification on the interface profile we also prove mathematically that the proposed equation represents the same interface solution as obtained from the vertically integrated flow solution by strack and ausk 2015 we further provide a new interpretation of the discharge potential at the coast by comparing our equation with the vertically integrated flow solution strack and ausk 2015 we study and explain the difference in interface profile in aquifer configurations with hydraulic conductivity contrasts in two sets of boundary conditions namely constant head and constant flux boundary we then discuss the implications of the insights obtained from the new parameters on the uncertainties in the estimation of swi extent for random hydraulic conductivity fields 2 conceptual model we consider a stationary interface in a two dimensional confined and unconfined aquifer with horizontal stratification in the hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 1 the seaward freshwater discharge q x l 2 t is assumed to be in a vertical plane with no recharge or pumping uniform flow in the case of pumping we need to perform 3d analysis as the vertical slice of the aquifer if not a representative of flow field which varies along the coastline however based on governing equation eq 2 we can expect steeper interface on the landward side of the pumping well and gradual slop of the interface on the coastal side uniform recharge can be modeled through a linearly increasing discharge in the flow direction in the region of recharge which will be an additional factor one factor is decreasing thickness of freshwater flow domain causing increase in steepness of the interface in the flow direction however elegant explicit solution is not possible in either case we assume a constant head in the vertical plane by adopting dupuit dupuit 1863 and forchheimer forchheimer 1886 approximation the aquifer is underlain by an impermeable layer and bounded by vertical boundaries at the inland and coastal ends the flow domain can be divided into two zones an interface zone consisting of both freshwater and seawater zone 1 and zone consisting only freshwater and no interface zone 2 let the origin be at the point where the aquifer base meets coastline the x axis along the top of the underlying impervious layer pointing towards inland and the y axis along the vertical coastline pointing upwards l l h s l and x t l represent the distance of the inland boundary from the coastal boundary seawater head at the coastal boundary and interface toe position respectively the inland boundary can be a constant total flux q x in a flux controlled system or constant head h f l in a head controlled system although in fig 1 we have only depicted a constant head boundary note that the total boundary flux redistributes in proportion to transmissivities in each layer the interface profile is described by ζ l which represents the y coordinate of the interface as a function of x in a confined aquifer the layers are indexed from 1 to n from bottom to top where n is the total number of layers for a particular ith layer the thickness center elevation base elevation and hydraulic conductivity are represented by b i l y i l d i l and k i l t respectively note that the elevations are with respect to the base of the aquifer unless mentioned otherwise h l is the freshwater head above sea level b l and t l 2 t represent the total aquifer thickness and transmissivity respectively 1 b i 1 n b i t i 1 n t i in an unconfined aquifer n is the index for the highest layer below the sea level it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of the part of the aquifer containing the water table is uniform denoted by k n 1 i e the water table is contained within a single layer which is a reasonable assumption given the elevation of the water above the sea level is fairly small relative to the layer thicknesses for most practical cases we can expect k n k n 1 the h l is the water table elevation above the sea level 3 theory 3 1 confined aquifer the freshwater flowrate per unit width of the aquifer at any cross section can be given by darcy s law after adopting dupuit forchheimer approximation as 2 q x t ζ dh dx t ζ l 2 t is the total transmissivity of the flow domain above the interface we evaluate h using the ghyben herzberg relation badon ghyben 1888 3 h h s ζ α where α is the ratio of the freshwater density to the density difference between seawater and freshwater differentiating eq 3 with respect to x we get 4 dh dx d ζ α d x substituting dh dx from eq 4 into 2 we get the discharge as a function of the slope of the interface as 5 q x t ζ α d ζ dx t ζ a function of ζ is given as 6 t ζ ζ b k y d y k m d m 1 ζ m 1 n t j where m denotes the index of the layer containing the interface at any aquifer cross section after substituting t ζ in eq 5 and rearranging we get 7 d ζ dx q x α k m d m 1 ζ m 1 n t j it should be noted that the index m in the above equation is also a function of ζ for a particular i th layer x can be evaluated by integration 8 d x 1 α q x k i d i 1 ζ i 1 n t j d ζ which results in 9 x ζ α q x k i d i 1 ζ 2 t ui c i where i is the layer index in which ζ lies t ui i 1 n t j l 2 t represents the total transmissivity of the flow domain above the i th layer to evaluate c i we adopt an assumption which was also used in bear 1972 to evaluate the interface profile in a homogenous aquifer the interface meets the top of the aquifer at the coastal boundary x 0 ζ b we apply this boundary condition in eq 9 for the n th layer to get 10 c n k n b 2 2 q x α we find the relation between consecutive c i s by satisfying the continuity of the interface across the layers we evaluate x at ζ d i using eq 9 in both i th and i 1 th layers 11 x d i α q x k i d i 1 d i 2 t ui c i d i α q x k i 1 d i d i 2 t u i 1 c i 1 after rearranging eq 11 we get 12 c i c i 1 d i 2 2 α q x k i k i 1 from eqs 10 and 12 we derive the equation for a general c i as see appendix a 13 c i 1 α q x i 1 n t j y j k i d i 1 2 2 by substituting c i from eq 13 into 9 and rearranging the equation we thus obtain the equation for the interface profile in a fully explicit form as 14 x 1 α q x t ui y ci ζ k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 where y ci l is the elevation of the centroid of the transmissivity referred henceforth as transmissivity centroid elevation or tce in the flow domain above the i th layer computed as 15 y ci i 1 n t j y j t ui to extend the above solution to the continuously varying hydraulic conductivity field we conceptualize it by a large number of very thin layers thus the term k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 approaches zero and the term t ui y ci ζ can be replaced by t ζ y c ζ ζ where t ζ and y c ζ represents the transmissivity and tce respectively for the aquifer above ζ freshwater flow domain 16 x 1 α q x t ζ y c ζ ζ 17 t ζ ζ b k y d y y c ζ ζ b k y d y t ζ eqs 14 and 16 reveal the new parameters namely local transmissivity t ζ

conductivity k t ζ and y c ζ can be evaluated as k b ζ and b ζ 2 respectively which when substituted in eq 16 results in the interface profile as 18 x 1 2 α q x b 2 ζ 2 which is well known dupuit parabola bear 1979 in many swi studies like the transience of swi chang and clement 2012 lu and werner 2013 rathore et al 2018a watson et al 2010 we are more concerned about the toe position than the whole interface profile we get the equation of the toe position by putting ζ 0 in eqs 14 or 16 19 x t t y c α q x where y c is the tce of the whole flow domain computed as 20 y c 1 n t j y j t the toe position eq 19 is exactly the same as that reported by rathore et al 2018b derived using the comprehensive discharge potential theory strack and ausk 2015 we derive the interface profile equation for the head controlled system by substituting the solution for q x given by rathore et al 2018b in terms of the tce for a stratified interface flow 21 q x t l h f h s where h s is the corrected coastal head given as h s h s 1 1 α y c α and y c represents the tce of the aquifer interface solution for the head controlled system therefore is given as 22 x l α t h f h s t ui y ci ζ k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 3 2 unconfined aquifer using a similar method we derive an explicit solution for the interface profile in the unconfined coastal aquifer t u for the unconfined aquifer is expressed as 23 t u ζ h s h k y d y k m d m 1 ζ m 1 n t j k n 1 h h l in this case represents the water table elevation above the sea level which can be approximated using the ghyben herzberg approximation badon ghyben 1888 as h s ζ α

rearranging eq 28 results in 29 c i c i 1 d i 2 2 α q x k i k i 1 from eqs 27 and 29 we derive an equation for a general c i similar to the confined case 30 c i 1 α q x i 1 n t j y j k i d i 1 2 2 k n

the flow domain between the ith layer and the sea level computed using the same equation as in the confined case eq 15 rathore et al 2018b discovered that tce is the key parameter accounting for the stratification effects on swi in coastal aquifers and provided solutions for the toe position and freshwater discharge in terms of the tce for the confined aquifers using the derived interface profile in eq 31 we can easily find such solutions to the unconfined aquifers which were not provided previously by putting ζ 0 we get x t as 32 x t t q x α y c k n 1 h s 2 2 α t where y c is the tce of the flow domain below sea level computed as in eq 20 the solution for the discharge is provided in eq 33 and the derivation is provided in appendix b for the sake of brevity the first term of the solution is same as that for the confined aquifer which here represents the discharge in the aquifer below the sea level and the second term represents the discharge in the flow domain above the sea level 33 q x t l h f h s 1 1 α y c α k n 1 2 l h f h s 2 it is important to note here that the solutions for the interface profile toe position and discharge derived for the unconfined aquifer eqs 31 33 can also be presented as general solutions applicable to both confined and unconfined cases for the impermeable confining bed in confined aquifers setting the k values of the top layer to zero in eqs 31 33 results in the solutions for the confined cases these equations reveal a new approach to analyzing stratification effects in coastal aquifers with the discovery of the centroid of the transmissivity field and the transmissivity of the region containing freshwater flow above the seawater wedge also referred as local transmissivity parameters as key parameters controlling the interface profile at the interface toe local tce is same as the tce for the whole depth which allows us to directly compute exact freshwater discharge and approximate toe position rathore et al 2018b tce based approach provides a better understanding of stratification effects with much fewer parameters for a large number of layers in appendix c starting from the strack s solution strack and ausk 2015 for the interface elevation which is based on the potential theory and dupuit approximation we arrive at our equation we thus showed that our concise equation represents the same solution as strack s but restricted to flow in the vertical plane as opposed to the three dimensional flow considered by strack and not applicable to a vertical coastline with seepage and outflow faces taken into account to our surprise the interface elevation in the case with a seepage and outflow face at the coastal boundary as considered by strack and ausk 2015 turns out to be same in the case where we assume water table interface coinciding with the coastline 4 discussion 4 1 the proposed equation in the context of the existing comprehensive discharge potential theory strack and ausk 2015 strack et al 2016 strack s solution strack and ausk 2015 is more general as it is applicable to three dimensional vertically integrated flow and allows the inclusion of recharge and pumping as well our equation although with stricter assumptions allows us to gain some critical insights about stratification effects on the interface profile in this section we discuss how the new parameters in the proposed equations correspond to the comprehensive discharge potential for vertically integrated groundwater flow by strack and ausk 2015 we will limit our discussion to confined aquifers strack s solution for the interface in terms of comprehensive discharge potential is of the form 34 x 1 q x φ φ 0 where φ is the comprehensive discharge potential referred henceforth as potential at x obtained in terms of interface elevation ζ after adopting dupuit approximation φ 0 is the potential at the coastal boundary which is only a function of aquifer parameters we rearrange our equation eq 14 into a form similar to eq 34 so as to delineate a term independent of ζ 35 x 1 q x 1 α ζ i 1 n t j 1 i t j y j k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 1 α 1 n t j y j comparing eqs 34 and 35 we can identify ζ dependent terms as φ and the terms independent of ζ as φ 0 36 φ 1 α ζ i 1 n t j 1 i t j y j k i 2 d i 1 ζ 2 37 φ 0 1 α 1 n t j y j with the assumption of no seepage face h s b we verified that the above φ and φ 0 are mathematically the same as presented in strack and ausk 2015 therefore the boundary potential in the comprehensive discharge potential theory essentially represents the first moment of the transmissivity 4 2 interface profile in layer configurations with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts using the derived interface profile solutions we examine the interface in different aquifer configurations of hydraulic conductivity contrasts between layers for two boundary types namely constant head and constant flux boundary note that for a given aquifer configuration the interface profile solution will be identical in the case of a given discharge as boundary or a fixed boundary head resulting in the same discharge eq 22 also in stratified aquifers with constant head boundary the toe position is independent of the hydraulic conductivity values and controlled by aquifer tce spatial arrangement of conductivities rathore et al 2018b here we consider a simple three layer aquifer representing an aquifer system with a layer of different hydraulic conductivity embedded in a homogeneous aquifer the thickness of each layer is equal to 4 m h s 12 m the density of the freshwater is ρ f 1000 kg m3 and the density of seawater is ρ s 1025 kg m3 for both boundary types different aquifer configurations corresponding to different hydraulic conductivity contrasts represented by λ k 2 k 1 are solved where k 2 represents the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer and k 1 of the top and bottom layers k 1 is equal to 10 m d in all the cases and k 2 is varied to vary λ for a given discharge boundary value q x 0 4 m2 d five λ values namely 0 1 1 10 50 and 100 are considered for a head boundary value h f 12 5 m and l 100 m three λ values namely 0 01 1 and 100 are considered it is important to note that for the considered symmetric aquifers different k contrasts results in different total transmissivities but same tce which is the centroid elevation of the transmissivity field fig 2 a shows that in given flux boundary case the interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts converge in the top layer of the aquifer and diverge at the bottom resulting in significantly different toe positions because of different k 2 or t eq 14 for a constant flux higher λ implying higher t results in lower head gradient in the aquifer darcy s law thus leading to a gentler slope of the interface and longer toe length close to the coastal boundary all the freshwater flow exit into the sea from the top layer resulting in the same discharge in the top layer in all aquifer configurations hence the same discharge and the same top layer k leads to the same head gradients and overlapping interface profiles in the top layer for a given head boundary fig 2b the interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts are significantly different in the upper part of the aquifer however converge to the same point at the bottom of the aquifer i e the same toe position it is important to realize that in a for a given head boundary the shrinking freshwater flow domain due to seawater wedge results in a steeper head gradient closer to the coastal boundary to generate higher flow velocities for the flow continuity this is distinct from the single density flow where the head gradient is uniform throughout the length of the aquifer in aquifer configurations with higher λ values there is a higher discharge in the middle layer and eventually in the upper layer as an outflow resulting in the rapid increase in the interface slope closer to the coast however in the lower part of the layer the freshwater flowrate remains unchanged with changing λ s because of fixed k and boundary heads thus resulting in the overlapping interface profiles and the same toe position 4 3 implications of the dependence of the interface on the local transmissivity parameters the proposed equation implies that the extent of swi at any elevation is governed by the transmissivity field only above the interface elevation described by parameters local transmissivity t ζ and local tce y c ζ eq 16 this result has significant implications on the estimation of the swi extent in stratified coastal aquifers in a stratified coastal aquifer if the layer arrangement of a certain set of layers in the aquifer is altered the part of interface profile above the rearranged layers will remain unaffected and only the profile within and below the rearranged layer will be altered we demonstrate this through numerical simulation of a simple three layer case the hydraulic conductivity of the 20 m thick top layer is assumed to be 50 m d and of 15 m thick lower layers as 10 m d and 100 m d two cases are considered in which placements of lower two layers are switched case 1 in which 10 m d layer is placed above 100 m d layer and case 2 in which 100 m d layer placed above the 10 m d layer other aquifer parameters are listed in table 1 as expected due to dependence of the interface profile on the local transmissivity parameters interface profiles plotted for both the cases in fig 3 overlap in the top layer and are separated in bottom two layers with the interface toe at around 200 m in case 1 and 275 m in case 2 we can extend the conclusion from the above analysis to the case of random heterogeneity the uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity in a particular stratum of the aquifer will results in the uncertain interface profile in that stratum and the domain below it however the profile in the part above the uncertain stratum will still be deterministic furthermore we can also conclude that if the uncertain stratum is placed at the top of the aquifer it will result in the higher variance of the toe position and if placed at the bottom of the aquifer will result in the lower variance of the toe position with a more detailed study these insights could be used to optimize the field characterization extent to meet the budget constraints and uncertainty requirements 5 conclusion by applying the dupuit forchheimer approximation at the outset we directly derived the explicit analytical solution for the seawater freshwater interface profile in stratified coastal aquifers we mathematically showed that the proposed equation represents the solution computed from the vertically integrated groundwater flow solution by strack and ausk 2015 for the special case of flow in the vertical plane we also revealed that the interface elevation will be same in the cases with two fundamentally different coastal boundaries namely the boundary with seepage and outflow face and the one with coinciding interface water table and coastline the proposed equation is concise compared to the existing solution and provides new parameters governing the interface profile the interface profile is found to be a function of the elevation of the transmissivity field centroid and the total transmissivity of the freshwater flow domain above a given point on the interface we discussed our equation in the context of the comprehensive discharge potential theory and showed that the coastal boundary potential essentially represents the first moment of the transmissivity based on the derived equation we examined differences in the interface profiles in the aquifer configurations with different hydraulic conductivity contrasts in cases with given head and given flux boundaries we found that with a given flux boundary the interface profiles in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts have different toe positions but converge and overlap in the upper part of the aquifer conversely when we consider a given head boundary we found interface profiles very different interface profiles in the upper part of the aquifer but the same toe position in aquifer configurations with different k contrasts the dependence of interface profile on local transmissivity parameters can potentially help in optimizing the extent of the field characterization for the hydraulic conductivity the simplicity of our equation makes way for much other theoretical analysis for stratified coastal aquifers for example the equation for the interface profile can be integrated to calculate the volume of the intruded seawater and analyze the transience of the seawater intrusion and retreat analytically in

5947,the study of solute transport in rivers is of environmental significance since solute transported in river flows may affect the river water quality conditions solute transport in natural flows is a challenging process to be investigated given natural flows usually indicate uncertainty in space and time two dimensional models are more preferable to one dimensional models especially when the underlying flow field is complex in this study a stochastic horizontally two dimensional solute transport model is developed the proposed model can account for the effect of uncertain two dimensional flow field and solute loading conditions on the uncertainty of the solute transport the governing equation of the proposed model is in the form of fokker planck equation which characterizes the spatiotemporal evolution of the probability density function of the state variables of the solute transport process consequently the mean and standard deviation behavior of the ensemble solute

fokker planck equation upscaling monte carlo simulation 1 introduction solute transport in open channel flows under natural environment is a complex process in which the open channel flow dynamics plays a vital role zhang 2011 the flow dynamics within unsteady open channel flows such as river flows is under great uncertainties due to the large spatiotemporal variability of the channel physical properties initial and boundary flow conditions and sink source terms gates and al zahrani 1996 consequently solute transport by such an uncertain flow field would also be stochastic given additional uncertainties that come from the physical chemical and biological properties of solute traditional deterministic numerical methods that are applied under these uncertain parameters failed to explain the gap between observed phenomena and simulation results in some solute transport processes liang and kavvas 2008 some stochastic longitudinal solute transport models in open channel flows based on stochastic differential equations sdes or monte carlo simulations have been developed in the literature aiming to better represent the solute transport behavior under uncertain conditions thayer and krutchkoff 1967 whitehead and young 1979 ferreira and costa 2002 yoshioka et al 2012 yoshioka and unami 2013 cox et al 2015 higashino and stefan 2017 ferreira and costa 2002 modeled solute particle displacement probability by using the fokker planck equation fpe together with markov processes yoshioka et al 2012 developed a stochastic model for solute particle transport in open channel flows based on sde whitehead and young 1979 evaluated the uncertainty in the transport system which is subject to stochastic upstream influents by employing monte carlo analysis more recently cox et al 2015 conducted monte carlo simulations to assess the potential effect of climate change on water quality of an impaired river by adding stochastic inputs to the simulations as summarized in liang and kavvas 2008 most of these models focus on the randomness induced by the solute properties such as point non point loadings and solute reactions and only a limited number of them consider the uncertainty due to the underlying flow field cox et al 2015 took critical low flow scenarios in their monte carlo simulations but they treated the transport system as steady state yoshioka et al 2012 incorporated turbulent flows into the stochastic solute particle model but the model did not explicitly provide a probabilistic description of the solute transport processes to account for the effect of the stochastic flow field on the solute transport process liang and kavvas 2008 introduced a one dimensional stochastic solute transport model by the ensemble averaging approach based on the work of kavvas 2003 however only the ensemble mean behavior of solute concentration was considered in liang and kavvas 2008 as to solute transport the mean and variance alone of the solute concentration may not be adequate in terms of pollution risk assessment where the solute conditions may be compared with certain water quality standards targets and the probability of some extreme cases may be particularly needed wang 2011 kavvas 2003 proposed a general framework for providing spatiotemporal probabilistic description of a random variable function under a given dynamical system not only the mean and variance standard deviation of the targeted state variable of a system but also the probability density function pdf in space and time can be obtained under this general framework considering the randomness of the flow field tu et al 2019 showed the derivation of a one dimensional stochastic solute transport model which can provide the evolution of the pdf of the solute concentration in space and time under the cross sectionally averaged flow field based on the formulation in kavvas 2003 the spatiotemporal pdf can be obtained by one single numerical realization in this model instead of thousands of simulations in the monte carlo simulations however the one dimensional cross sectionally averaged model may not be able to adequately characterize the stochastic transport behavior especially under complex flow structures where two dimensional flow models are more preferable benjankar et al 2015 the depth averaged two dimensional flow equations are generally valid for describing the open channel hydrodynamics with acceptable accuracy and efficiency since shallow water requirements are satisfied in many open channel flow problems and flow in the vertical direction insignificantly affects the flow process therefore in this study a stochastic solute transport model is proposed to account for the effect of the horizontally two dimensional stochastic flow field the proposed stochastic model is developed based on the formulations in kavvas 2003 in which an upscaling transformation was proposed to upscale the sde through its corresponding nonlocal fpe in mixed eulerian lagrangian form the resulting fpe is expected to illustrate the stochastic two dimensional solute transport behavior via the associated complete description of the spatiotemporal evolution of the pdf of the solute concentration 2 methodology 2 1 derivation of a fpe corresponding to the equation for point scale two dimensional solute transport 2 1 1 point scale two dimensional solute transport the governing equation for two dimensional solute transport process proposed here is horizontally two dimensional and assumes little or no effect from lateral inflow and the transport is convection dominated and local dispersion or mixing are ignored this assumption is generally valid when a river receives continuous pollutant loadings ji 2008 and it is also identified in zhang and neuman 1996 that the local scale dispersion can be ignored for practical purposes if the local scale dispersion is much smaller than the marcodispersion then the governing two dimensional solute transport equation can be written as follows 1 c t u c x v c y 1 h s 2 d where c the depth averaged solute concentration t time u flow velocity in the longitudinal direction along the river v flow

represent the effects of fluctuations of the two dimensional flow velocity field and randomness of solute loadings on the solute transport process yoshitani and kavvas 1997 as noted by sharma and kavvas 2005 these macroscale dispersion coefficients are different from the traditional local scale dispersion coefficients and these two types of dispersion coefficients are defined in different time and space scales the probability of the concentration c in the x y space through time can be obtained based on the solution of this nonlocal lagrangian eulerian fpe the mean and standard deviation behavior of solute concentration c in horizontal two dimensional x y space can also be easily obtained through the spatiotemporal evolution of the solute concentration probability density function 2 2 numerical experiments 2 2 1 numerical experiment 1 to illustrate the capability of the proposed stochastic model for two dimensional solute transport under an uncertain flow field the first numerical experiment is conducted as follows the numerical case here is similar to that used by manson and wallis 1998 a straight uniform rectangular channel is assumed the channel length l is 2 000 m and the width b is 1 m the upstream and boundary conditions are set to generate stable and uniform flows the transverse y direction velocity profile fig 1 a is assumed to be parabolic and is symmetrical to the channel central line y b 2 where the maximum velocity in the longitudinal direction x direction locates the maximum velocity umax at the channel central line is normally distributed with mean 2 5 m s and standard deviation 0 25 m s no slip boundary i e zero velocity is specified for both banks initial solute concentration c0 is 10 mg l in the channel fig 1 b local mixing and dispersion is neglected in this experiment the total simulation time is 3000 s based on eq 16 if y directional velocity is negligible and no source sink terms are considered the governing fokker planck equation of this numerical experiment is reduced to the following 17 p c x y t t x p c x y t u x y t 1 2 2 x 2 2 p c x y t 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s where u x y t and 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s are drift and diffusion coefficients related to the uncertainty of the underlying flow field a dirac delta correlation relationship of the velocity is used here the resulting governing fokker planck equation here is essentially in the form of an advection dispersion equation utimate quickest which is a third order upwind scheme proposed for pure advective or advection dominated transport problems and is satisfactorily applied in a number of advection dispersion transport problems in fluid dynamics leonard 1991 lin and falconer 1997 wu and falconer 2000 neumann et al 2011 is employed to solve the governing fokker planck equation in this study details about the numerical solutions can be found in the supplementary information 2 2 2 numerical experiment 2 cche2d model jia et al 2013 is used in this numerical application to simulate a two dimensional depth averaged flow field cche2d model has been successfully used in many hydrodynamic applications tu et al 2017 carr et al 2018 the governing equations for continuity and momentum equations of two dimensional hydrodynamics are given as jia et al 2013 18 h t h u x h ν y 0 19 h u t h u u x h u ν y g h z x 1 ρ h t xx x h t yy x d xx

indicate water surface shear stresses usually due to wind this numerical experiment is implemented in a rectangular channel with length l 100 m and width b 1 m the mean flow field as shown in figs 2 a and 2 b is obtained under a channel roughness of 0 025 and constant inflow of 0 2 m3 s no slip boundary at both channel banks is applied then it is assumed that the flow velocities in the channel fluctuate around the mean flow field following a ratio that is uniformly distributed between 0 9 and 1 1 in fact one can assume any random flow field or a more realistic flow conditions in nature the relatively simple random flow field adopted here is just for the illustration of the capabilities of the proposed fpe approach the upstream concentration profile is given in fig 2 c where c0 10 mg l the governing fokker planck equation for this numerical experiment with no solute source sink is as follows 18 p c x y t t x p c x y t u x y t 1 2 2 x 2 2 p c x y t 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s y p c x y t v x y t 1 2 2 y 2 2 p c x y t 0 t ds c o v o v x y t v x y t s where u x y t and v x y t are drift coefficients and 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s and 0 t ds c o v o v x y t v x y t s are dispersion coefficients due to the uncertain flow field 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical experiment 1 to validate the applicability of the proposed horizontally two dimensional stochastic solute transport model the monte carlo simulation which consists of 5000 realizations is performed figs 3 and 4 where four cross sections x l 4 2 l 4 3 l 4 l are chosen show the mean and standard deviation through simulation time of solute concentration of the ensemble solute transport behavior obtained by the monte carlo simulation and the proposed approach respectively the mean and standard deviation profiles of the monte carlo simulation are computed based on the ensemble realizations of the results from the coupled flow and solute transport process for the proposed approach the mean and standard deviation are obtained based on the probability densities that are directly obtained from the solution of the governing fokker planck equation the mean and standard deviation behavior indicate an excellent match between the results by the monte carlo simulation and the fokker planck equation approach for the mean solute concentration profiles as the cross section moves further away from the upstream an increase in the mean concentration occurs at later time instances due to the transverse velocity distribution at the same cross section the mean solute concentration profiles can be different through time as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from this figure that the profile of the mean solute concentration has curves for different layers of the concentration solute concentration at both channel banks y 0 y b is zero because of the no slip boundary condition figs 5 and 6 show a closer look at the mean and standard deviation of the ensemble solute concentration at the four cross sections x l 4 2 l 4 3 l 4 l the variations within each cross section are provided in figs 5 and 6 at five locations y 0 1b 0 2b 0 3b 0 4b 0 5b within each cross section as shown in fig 5 the mean solute concentrations at select locations indicate perfect match between the monte carlos simulation results and the fokker planck equation approach results each column in fig 5 denotes a different cross section and illustrates how the mean solute concentration evolves through the channel each row in fig 5 represents a different location within the same cross section and the variations cannot be observed if a one dimensional model is applied as shown in fig 6 the standard deviation profile of the ensemble solute concentration obtained by the proposed fokker planck equation approach shows sufficiently good match with the results by the monte carlo simulation although slight differences do exist between these two methods the standard deviation behavior by the fokker planck equation solution and by the monte carlo simulation demonstrate similar trends and the transition points of the profiles are almost identical for these two methods initially the standard deviations by the monte carlo simulations are slightly larger than those by the proposed approach as the flow moves downstream the gap between the standard deviations of these two methods decreases and even vanishes the discrepancy could be caused by numerical methods used to solve the governing equations in this study and the assumptions made in the derivation of the governing equations and in solving the equations may also contribute to the existence of the difference compared with fig 5 the standard deviation profile in fig 6 demonstrates more noticeable variability at the locations within the same cross section through the channel and at different cross sections through time a detailed comparison regarding the performance of the probability density function pdf obtained by these two methods is shown in figs 7 and 8 where two cross sections x l 2 l are chosen for the monte carlo simulation the pdfs are constructed based on the histograms of the results of the monte carlo simulation for each cross section the probability density contours at five locations y 1 10 b 1 5 b 3 10 b 2 5 b 1 2 b along the channel width at six selected time instances t t 6 2 t 6 3 t 6 4 t 6 5 t 6 t are plotted since the transverse velocity distribution is symmetrical with respect to the centerline of the channel the pdf evolution of respective symmetrical locations can be obtained as well it can be seen that the results given by the fokker planck equation approach match those obtained by the monte carlo simulation very well only slight discrepancies can be observed although slight discrepancies in the pdfs by the two methods occur the fokker planck equation approach does perform adequately well the pdfs obtained by the monte carlo simulation and the proposed approach present very similar patterns the occurrence of the peak probability density and the rising and falling limbs of the pdfs between these two methods show no significant differences in fact some complicated shapes of the pdfs such as the last graph at the first row and the second subplot at the third row in fig 7 and the third graph at the third row in fig 8 are all captured by the proposed approach figs 7 and 8 clearly illustrate the variability which is due to the transverse velocity distribution of solute concentration pdf within each cross section as discussed earlier such variability cannot be seen if a one dimensional model is used while the proposed two dimensional model can characterize the detailed variations within each cross section therefore the results here further confirm the need for two dimensional models when the underlying flow field is complex and the variations within the cross sections are of interest figs 7 and 8 illustrate the capability of the proposed approach that can provide a complete probabilistic description of the evolution of the underlying solute transport system by the spatiotemporal pdf of solute concentration the results obtained so far clearly indicate that the fokker planck equation approach has great potential to be a powerful methodology for modeling the stochastic solute transport under a random flow field in this numerical experiment the velocity along the channel width and solute loadings from lateral inflow are set to be zero hence only the random flow field that is caused by the uncertain flow conditions along the channel in x direction is considered the mean and covariance of the random flow field can be regarded as drift and diffusion coefficients of the probability transport equation respectively then the effect of the random flow field on the evolution of the pdf in space and time of the solute transport process can be well captured by the governing fokker planck equation moreover as suggested in su 2004 for a certain transport process the type of pdf related to the state variable of the process may switch from one to another if any parameter in the modeling system changes and different pdfs may be needed to represent the evolution of the transport process in this numerical experiment the flow field is random consequently the drift and diffusion coefficients of the fokker planck equation are changing during the transport process the proposed fokker planck equation approach can explicitly illustrate and quantify the evolution of the system by the corresponding drift and diffusion coefficients in terms of the spatiotemporal pdf of the state variable of a given dynamical system furthermore the proposed approach requiring one single solution of the governing fokker planck equation system with its initial and boundary conditions is computationally efficient compared to thousands of simulations that are needed to formulate an ensemble of the transport process in the monte carlo method 3 2 numerical experiment 2 for this experiment monte carlo simulations are performed by solving the solute transport equations deterministically under a flow field sample 5000 times in each monte carlo simulation the total simulation duration is 30 min some of the results by mc and fpe are provided in figs 9 12 fig 9 shows the mean solute concentration by mc and fpe at the middle cross section x l 2 and downstream cross section x l the standard deviation profiles of the solute concentration at the corresponding cross sections are plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that results by mc match very well with those by fpe at the two cross sections due to the two dimensional flow field and non uniform inflow solute concentration the variation along channel width is quite obvious which may be neglected if a one dimensional model is used the shapes of the mean concentration profile at two cross sections in fig 9 are very similar and the downstream profile shows a later time of the occurrence of higher mean concentration because of the travel time between the two cross sections since the upstream solute inflow concentration is constant for some time followed by an increase to the peak and then remains constant afterwards the standard deviation of the solute concentration at these two cross sections in fig 10 clearly shows the effect of such inflow concentration the standard deviation at a given location starts to increase from 0 and eventually decreases to 0 as shown in fig 10 the maximum standard deviation at a given time decreases at locations with increasing distance from the bank at y 0 the mean and standard deviation of the solute concentration at both banks are zero since the no flux boundary conditions are applied to the channel banks fig 11 shows the mean solute concentration profiles by mc and fpe along the channel from upstream to downstream through time at transverse locations y 0 4b and y 0 6b fig 11 clearly indicates an excellent match regarding the mean solute concentration profiles between results by mc and fpe the corresponding standard deviation profiles are provided in fig 12 the shapes of the standard deviation profiles by mc in fig 12 are very similar to those by fpe at the same location the standard deviation profiles by fpe are wider than the corresponding profiles by mc the probability profiles of solute concentration at two locations at the middle of the channel are shown in fig 13 in general fpe approach captures the spatiotemporal evolution of the solute concentration as obtained by mc the discrepancy between fpe and mc may be caused by the numerical diffusion in solving the fpe the proposed fpe approach in this study is developed to account for the effect of the uncertain two dimensional flow field on the solute transport the numerical experiments conducted are just for illustration purposes and the flow field is relatively simple and general in these examples where the causes of the random flow field is not explicitly indicated however it clearly shows that the proposed approach is capable and promising in handling uncertainties of the solute transport behaviors that are caused by the stochastic flow field as discussed earlier due to the uncertainties in the channel properties for example channel roughness can be stochastic in space and time the associated solute transport processes can render stochastic behavior accordingly moreover even when the flow field at a point scale is deterministic the flow and solute transport governing equations are based on certain point local scales and such scales may not be adequate to capture the underlying dynamics of the transport processes on a larger scale in other words the deterministic governing equations at local point scale cannot fully represent the flow and solute transport processes in the upscaled areas such as river reaches the fpe approach in this study offers a new angle in dealing with the uncertainty in the governing equations therefore the proposed fpe approach can serve as a way that can incorporate scale effects in applying the transport governing equations to larger scales the governing fpe provides a general framework that considers the uncertainty in the flow field and solute source sink in quantitatively modeling the stochastic behavior of solute transport process by offering the evolving solute concentration probability profile in space and time it should be noted that mismatch of the results still exists between mc and the proposed fpe although results by fpe approach obtained in these illustrative numerical experiments are fairly good when compared to those by mc more robust numerical algorithms are needed to better solve the proposed fpe furthermore numerical experiments in this study mostly focus on the effect of the stochastic flow field on the solute transport process future studies can be conducted to investigate the conditions when solute source sink is random which can be more desirable in forecasting pollutant related risks 4 conclusion the governing equations for the horizontally two dimensional stochastic solute transport process in terms of the fokker planck equation for the solute transport state variables are developed in this study the governing equations are obtained by upscaling the point scale two dimensional solute transport model to larger scales such as river reach scale based on the approach introduced by kavvas 2003 the developed model can account for the effects of the uncertain flow field and solute loading conditions on the uncertainty in the transport of solute the advantage of the proposed model is that it can provide the mean and standard deviation behavior of the state variables of the solute transport process and it can further offer the spatiotemporal evolution of the probability distribution of the state variables compared with the traditional monte carlo method the proposed model has another advantage in that it can clearly express the individual effect of flow velocity in different directions and the uncertain solute loading conditions on the evolution of the probability distributions by their corresponding representative drift and diffusion coefficients in the governing equations furthermore the proposed approach is computationally efficient that the complete time space evolution of probability distributions can be obtained in one solution numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the capability of the proposed horizontally two dimensional stochastic solute transport model monte carlo simulations are performed to validate the results by the proposed approach the numerical experiments also confirm the need of a two dimensional stochastic solute transport model to quantify the uncertainty in the transport process when the underlying flow field is complex and the variations within each cross section are concerned moreover the comparison of numerical results by both methods indicates that the proposed fokker planck equation approach is capable of characterizing the stochastic behavior of the solute transport process under uncertain flow conditions by one single numerical

5947,the study of solute transport in rivers is of environmental significance since solute transported in river flows may affect the river water quality conditions solute transport in natural flows is

displacement probability by using the fokker planck equation fpe together with markov processes yoshioka et al 2012 developed a stochastic model for solute particle transport in open channel flows based on sde whitehead and young 1979 evaluated the uncertainty in the transport system which is subject to stochastic upstream influents by employing monte carlo analysis more recently cox et al 2015 conducted monte carlo simulations to assess the potential effect of climate change on water quality of an impaired river by adding stochastic inputs to the simulations as summarized in liang and kavvas 2008 most of these models focus on the randomness induced by the solute properties such as point non point loadings and solute reactions and only a limited number of them consider the uncertainty due to the underlying flow field cox et al 2015 took critical low flow scenarios in their monte carlo simulations but they treated the transport system as steady state yoshioka et al 2012 incorporated turbulent flows into the stochastic solute particle model but the model did not explicitly provide a probabilistic description of the solute transport processes to account for the effect of the stochastic flow field on the solute transport process liang and kavvas 2008 introduced a one dimensional stochastic solute transport model by the ensemble averaging approach based on the work of kavvas 2003 however only the ensemble mean behavior of solute concentration was considered in liang and kavvas 2008 as to solute transport the mean and variance alone of the solute concentration may not be adequate in terms of pollution risk assessment where the solute conditions may be compared with certain water quality standards targets and the probability of some extreme cases may be particularly needed wang 2011 kavvas 2003 proposed a general framework for providing spatiotemporal probabilistic description of a random variable function under a given dynamical system not only the mean and variance standard deviation of the targeted state variable of a system but also the probability density function pdf in space and time can be obtained under this general framework considering the randomness of the flow field tu et al 2019 showed the derivation of a one dimensional stochastic solute transport model which can provide the evolution of the pdf of the solute concentration in space and time under the cross sectionally averaged flow field based on the formulation in kavvas 2003 the spatiotemporal pdf can be obtained by one single numerical realization in this model instead of thousands of simulations in the monte carlo simulations however the one dimensional cross sectionally averaged model may not be able to adequately characterize the stochastic transport behavior especially under complex flow structures where two dimensional flow models are more preferable benjankar et al 2015 the depth averaged two dimensional flow equations are generally valid for describing the open channel hydrodynamics with acceptable accuracy and efficiency since shallow water requirements are satisfied in many open channel flow problems and flow in the vertical direction insignificantly affects the flow process therefore in this study a stochastic solute transport model is proposed to account for the effect of the horizontally two dimensional stochastic flow field the proposed stochastic model is developed based on the formulations in kavvas 2003 in which an upscaling transformation was proposed to upscale the sde through its corresponding nonlocal fpe in mixed eulerian lagrangian form the resulting fpe is expected to illustrate the stochastic two dimensional solute transport behavior via the associated complete description of the spatiotemporal evolution of the pdf of the solute concentration 2 methodology 2 1 derivation of a fpe corresponding to the equation for point scale two dimensional solute transport 2 1 1 point scale two dimensional solute transport the governing equation for two dimensional solute transport process proposed here is horizontally two dimensional and assumes little or no effect from lateral inflow and the transport is convection dominated and local dispersion or mixing are ignored this assumption is generally valid when a river receives continuous pollutant loadings ji 2008 and it is also identified in zhang and neuman 1996 that the local scale dispersion can be ignored for practical purposes if the local scale dispersion is much smaller than the marcodispersion then the governing two dimensional solute transport equation can be written as follows 1 c t u c x v c y 1 h s 2 d where c the depth averaged solute concentration t time u flow velocity in the longitudinal direction along the river v flow

represent the effects of fluctuations of the two dimensional flow velocity field and randomness of solute loadings on the solute transport process yoshitani and kavvas 1997 as noted by sharma and kavvas 2005 these macroscale dispersion coefficients are different from the traditional local scale dispersion coefficients and these two types of dispersion coefficients are defined in different time and space scales the probability of the concentration c in the x y space through time can be obtained based on the solution of this nonlocal lagrangian eulerian fpe the mean and standard deviation behavior of solute concentration c in horizontal two dimensional x y space can also be easily obtained through the spatiotemporal evolution of the solute concentration probability density function 2 2 numerical experiments 2 2 1 numerical experiment 1 to illustrate the capability of the proposed stochastic model for two dimensional solute transport under an uncertain flow field the first numerical experiment is conducted as follows the numerical case here is similar to that used by manson and wallis 1998 a straight uniform rectangular channel is assumed the channel length l is 2 000 m and the width b is 1 m the upstream and boundary conditions are set to generate stable and uniform flows the transverse y direction velocity profile fig 1 a is assumed to be parabolic and is symmetrical to the channel central line y b 2 where the maximum velocity in the longitudinal direction x direction locates the maximum velocity umax at the channel central line is normally distributed with mean 2 5 m s and standard deviation 0 25 m s no slip boundary i e zero velocity is specified for both banks initial solute concentration c0 is 10 mg l in the channel fig 1 b local mixing and dispersion is neglected in this experiment the total simulation time is 3000 s based on eq 16 if y directional velocity is negligible and no source sink terms are considered the governing fokker planck equation of this numerical experiment is reduced to the following 17 p c x y t t x p c x y t u x y t 1 2 2 x 2 2 p c x y t 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s where u x y t and 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s are drift and diffusion coefficients related to the uncertainty of the underlying flow field a dirac delta correlation relationship of the velocity is used here the resulting governing fokker planck equation here is essentially in the form of an advection dispersion equation utimate quickest which is a third order upwind scheme proposed for pure advective or advection dominated transport problems and is satisfactorily applied in a number of advection dispersion transport problems in fluid dynamics leonard 1991 lin and falconer 1997 wu and falconer 2000 neumann et al 2011 is employed to solve the governing fokker planck equation in this study details about the numerical solutions can be found in the supplementary information 2 2 2 numerical experiment 2 cche2d model jia et al 2013 is used in this numerical application to simulate a two dimensional depth averaged flow field cche2d model has been successfully used in many hydrodynamic applications tu et al 2017 carr et al 2018 the governing equations for continuity and momentum equations of two dimensional hydrodynamics are given as jia et al 2013 18 h t h u x h ν y 0 19 h u t h u u x h u ν y g h z x 1 ρ h t xx x h t yy x d xx

indicate water surface shear stresses usually due to wind this numerical experiment is implemented in a rectangular channel with length l 100 m and width b 1 m the mean flow field as shown in figs 2 a and 2 b is obtained under a channel roughness of 0 025 and constant inflow of 0 2 m3 s no slip boundary at both channel banks is applied then it is assumed that the flow velocities in the channel fluctuate around the mean flow field following a ratio that is uniformly distributed between 0 9 and 1 1 in fact one can assume any random flow field or a more realistic flow conditions in nature the relatively simple random flow field adopted here is just for the illustration of the capabilities of the proposed fpe approach the upstream concentration profile is given in fig 2 c where c0 10 mg l the governing fokker planck equation for this numerical experiment with no solute source sink is as follows 18 p c x y t t x p c x y t u x y t 1 2 2 x 2 2 p c x y t 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s y p c x y t v x y t 1 2 2 y 2 2 p c x y t 0 t ds c o v o v x y t v x y t s where u x y t and v x y t are drift coefficients and 0 t ds c o v o u x y t u x y t s and 0 t ds c o v o v x y t v x y t s are dispersion coefficients due to the uncertain flow field 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical experiment 1 to validate the applicability of the proposed horizontally two dimensional stochastic solute transport model the monte carlo simulation which consists of 5000 realizations is performed figs 3 and 4 where four cross sections x l 4 2 l 4 3 l 4 l are chosen show the mean and standard deviation through simulation time of solute concentration of the ensemble solute transport behavior obtained by the monte carlo simulation and the proposed approach respectively the mean and standard deviation profiles of the monte carlo simulation are computed based on the ensemble realizations of the results from the coupled flow and solute transport process for the proposed approach the mean and standard deviation are obtained based on the probability densities that are directly obtained from the solution of the governing fokker planck equation the mean and standard deviation behavior indicate an excellent match between the results by the monte carlo simulation and the fokker planck equation approach for the mean solute concentration profiles as the cross section moves further away from the upstream an increase in the mean concentration occurs at later time instances due to the transverse velocity distribution at the same cross section the mean solute concentration profiles can be different through time as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from this figure that the profile of the mean solute concentration has curves for different layers of the concentration solute concentration at both channel banks y 0 y b is zero because of the no slip boundary condition figs 5 and 6 show a closer look at the mean and standard deviation of the ensemble solute concentration at the four cross sections x l 4 2 l 4 3 l 4 l the variations within each cross section are provided in figs 5 and 6 at five locations y 0 1b 0 2b 0 3b 0 4b 0 5b within each cross section as shown in fig 5 the mean solute concentrations at select locations indicate perfect match between the monte carlos simulation results and the fokker planck equation approach results each column in fig 5 denotes a different cross section and illustrates how the mean solute concentration evolves through the channel each row in fig 5 represents a different location within the same cross section and the variations cannot be observed if a one dimensional model is applied as shown in fig 6 the standard deviation profile of the ensemble solute concentration obtained by the proposed fokker planck equation approach shows sufficiently good match with the results by the monte carlo simulation although slight differences do exist between these two methods the standard deviation behavior by the fokker planck equation solution and by the monte carlo simulation demonstrate similar trends and the transition points of the profiles are almost identical for these two methods initially the standard deviations by the monte carlo simulations are slightly larger than those by the proposed approach as the flow moves downstream the gap between the standard deviations of these two methods decreases and even vanishes the discrepancy could be caused by numerical methods used to solve the governing equations in this study and the assumptions made in the derivation of the governing equations and in solving the equations may also contribute to the existence of the difference compared with fig 5 the standard deviation profile in fig 6 demonstrates more noticeable variability at the locations within the same cross section through the channel and at different cross sections through time a detailed comparison regarding the performance of the probability density function pdf obtained by these two methods is shown in figs 7 and 8 where two cross sections x l 2 l are chosen for the monte carlo simulation the pdfs are constructed based on the histograms of the results of the monte carlo simulation for each cross section the probability density contours at five locations y 1 10 b 1 5 b 3 10 b 2 5 b 1 2 b along the channel width at six selected time instances t t 6 2 t 6 3 t 6 4 t 6 5 t 6 t are plotted since the transverse velocity distribution is symmetrical with respect to the centerline of the channel the pdf evolution of respective symmetrical locations can be obtained as well it can be seen that the results given by the fokker planck equation approach match those obtained by the monte carlo simulation very well only slight discrepancies can be observed although slight discrepancies in the pdfs by the two methods occur the fokker planck equation approach does perform adequately well the pdfs obtained by the monte carlo simulation and the proposed approach present very similar patterns the occurrence of the peak probability density and the rising and falling limbs of the pdfs between these two methods show no significant differences in fact some complicated shapes of the pdfs such as the last graph at the first row and the second subplot at the third row in fig 7 and the third graph at the third row in fig 8 are all captured by the proposed approach figs 7 and 8 clearly illustrate the variability which is due to the transverse velocity distribution of solute concentration pdf within each cross section as discussed earlier such variability cannot be seen if a one dimensional model is used while the proposed two dimensional model can characterize the detailed variations within each cross section therefore the results here further confirm the need for two dimensional models when the underlying flow field is complex and the variations within the cross sections are of interest figs 7 and 8 illustrate the capability of the proposed approach that can provide a complete probabilistic description of the evolution of the underlying solute transport system by the spatiotemporal pdf of solute concentration the results obtained so far clearly indicate that the fokker planck equation approach has great potential to be a powerful methodology for modeling the stochastic solute transport under a random flow field in this numerical experiment the velocity along the channel width and solute loadings from lateral inflow are set to be zero hence only the random flow field that is caused by the uncertain flow conditions along the channel in x direction is considered the mean and covariance of the random flow field can be regarded as drift and diffusion coefficients of the probability transport equation respectively then the effect of the random flow field on the evolution of the pdf in space and time of the solute transport process can be well captured by the governing fokker planck equation moreover as suggested in su 2004 for a certain transport process the type of pdf related to the state variable of the process may switch from one to another if any parameter in the modeling system changes and different pdfs may be needed to represent the evolution of the transport process in this numerical experiment the flow field is random consequently the drift and diffusion coefficients of the fokker planck equation are changing during the transport process the proposed fokker planck equation approach can explicitly illustrate and quantify the evolution of the system by the corresponding drift and diffusion coefficients in terms of the spatiotemporal pdf of the state variable of a given dynamical system furthermore the proposed approach requiring one single solution of the governing fokker planck equation system with its initial and boundary conditions is computationally efficient compared to thousands of simulations that are needed to formulate an ensemble of the transport process in the monte carlo method 3 2 numerical experiment 2 for this experiment monte carlo simulations are performed by solving the solute transport equations deterministically under a flow field sample 5000 times in each monte carlo simulation the total simulation duration is 30 min some of the results by mc and fpe are provided in figs 9 12 fig 9 shows the mean solute concentration by mc and fpe at the middle cross section x l 2 and downstream cross section x l the standard deviation profiles of the solute concentration at the corresponding cross sections are plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that results by mc match very well with those by fpe at the two cross sections due to the two dimensional flow field and non uniform inflow solute concentration the variation along channel width is quite obvious which may be neglected if a one dimensional model is used the shapes of the mean concentration profile at two cross sections in fig 9 are very similar and the downstream profile shows a later time of the occurrence of higher mean concentration because of the travel time between the two cross sections since the upstream solute inflow concentration is constant for some time followed by an increase to the peak and then remains constant afterwards the standard deviation of the solute concentration at these two cross sections in fig 10 clearly shows the effect of such inflow concentration the standard deviation at a given location starts to increase from 0 and eventually decreases to 0 as shown in fig 10 the maximum standard deviation at a given time decreases at locations with increasing distance from the bank at y 0 the mean and standard deviation of the solute concentration at both banks are zero since the no flux boundary conditions are applied to the channel banks fig 11 shows the mean solute concentration profiles by mc and fpe along the channel from upstream to downstream through time at transverse locations y 0 4b and y 0 6b fig 11 clearly indicates an excellent match regarding the mean solute concentration profiles between results by mc and fpe the corresponding standard deviation profiles are provided in fig 12 the shapes of the standard deviation profiles by mc in fig 12 are very similar to those by fpe at the same location the standard deviation profiles by fpe are wider than the corresponding profiles by mc the probability profiles of solute concentration at two locations at the middle of the channel are shown in fig 13 in general fpe approach captures the spatiotemporal evolution of the solute concentration as obtained by mc the discrepancy between fpe and mc may be caused by the numerical diffusion in solving the fpe the proposed fpe approach in this study is developed to account for the effect of the uncertain two dimensional flow field on the solute transport the numerical experiments conducted are just for illustration purposes and the flow field is relatively simple and general in these examples where the causes of the random flow field is not explicitly indicated however it clearly shows that the proposed approach is capable and promising in handling uncertainties of the solute transport behaviors that are caused by the stochastic flow field as discussed earlier due to the uncertainties in the channel properties for example channel roughness can be stochastic in space and time the associated solute transport processes can render stochastic behavior accordingly moreover even when the flow field at a point scale is deterministic the flow and solute transport governing equations are based on certain point local scales and such scales may not be adequate to capture the underlying dynamics of the transport processes on a larger scale in other words the deterministic governing equations at local point scale cannot fully represent the flow and solute transport processes in the upscaled areas such as river reaches the fpe approach in this study offers a new angle in dealing with the uncertainty in the governing equations therefore the proposed fpe approach can serve as a way that can incorporate scale effects in applying the transport governing equations to larger scales the governing fpe provides a general framework that considers the uncertainty in the flow field and solute source sink in quantitatively modeling the stochastic behavior of solute transport process by offering the evolving solute concentration probability profile in space and time it should be noted that mismatch of the results still exists between mc and the proposed fpe although results by fpe approach obtained in these illustrative numerical experiments are fairly good when compared to those by mc more robust numerical algorithms are needed to better solve the proposed fpe furthermore numerical experiments in this study mostly focus on the effect of the stochastic flow field on the solute transport process future studies can be conducted to investigate the conditions when solute source sink is random which can be more desirable in forecasting pollutant related risks 4 conclusion the governing equations for the horizontally two dimensional stochastic solute transport process in terms of the fokker planck equation for the solute transport state variables are developed in this study the governing equations are obtained by upscaling the point scale two dimensional solute transport model to larger scales such as river reach scale based on the approach introduced by kavvas 2003 the developed model can account for the effects of the uncertain flow field and solute loading conditions on the uncertainty in the transport of solute the advantage of the proposed model is that it can provide the mean and standard deviation behavior of the state variables of the solute transport process and it can further offer the spatiotemporal evolution of the probability distribution of the state variables compared with the traditional monte carlo method the proposed model has another advantage in that it can clearly express the individual effect of flow velocity in different directions and the uncertain solute loading conditions on the evolution of the probability distributions by their corresponding representative drift and diffusion coefficients in the governing equations furthermore the proposed approach is computationally efficient that the complete time space evolution of probability distributions can be obtained in one solution numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the capability of the proposed horizontally two dimensional stochastic solute transport model monte carlo simulations are performed to validate the results by the proposed approach the numerical experiments also confirm the need of a two dimensional stochastic solute transport model to quantify the uncertainty in the transport process when the underlying flow field is complex and the variations within each cross section are concerned moreover the comparison of numerical results by both methods indicates that the proposed fokker planck equation approach is capable of characterizing the stochastic behavior of the solute transport process under uncertain flow conditions by one single numerical

5948,diaphragm walls are commonly used as cut off walls to prevent water from entering dewatered excavation pits landfills and downstream water however due to the geometrical imperfections such as the positioning error of grab during trenching small seepage passages through the diaphragm wall may occasionally occur which will undermine its water tightness and lead to significant leakages this study therefore used a reliability based approach to quantitatively estimate the effect of geometrical imperfections on the water tightness of diaphragm walls using a three dimensional discretised algorithm tda this algorithm enables a rigorous examination of penetration of seepage passages and it further quantitatively estimates the flow rate through the diaphragm wall under certain circumstances finally detailed design procedures and design graphs were provided which may facilitate the choice of a rational grab model and construction parameters in the design of diaphragm walls keywords

collapse of an adjacent masonry house texplor 2013 to date the quality control of diaphragm walls are usually done during and after wall construction during trenching the koden sensors and inverse pendulum floaters are used to monitor the verticality of grabs bruce et al 1989 spruit et al 2013 after wall construction the cross hole logging csl electrical resistivity tomography ert and pumping

the last defence line of defect control is the instant remedial measures after leakages are observed the remedial measures include surface grouting backfilling and jet grouting the above detection measures are effective approaches to evaluate the water tightness of diaphragm wall however these measures can only be taken after the wall construction is finished at this stage the leakages might have already occurred and therefore subsequent remedial works may be excessively expensive and time consuming moreover in cases with piping triggered by sudden inflows of water texplor 2013 tan and lu 2017 such remedial works may not be effective therefore it is of engineering interest to provide a risk based guideline in the design stage before the construction as a rational conservatism in design is usually more economical than remedies after leakages or failures occur possible causes of leakage in diaphragm walls involve the defects 1 in the panel itself 2 through joints the former is due to the soil or slurry inclusions the latter is attributed to the influencing factors such as inclination of panel castaldo et al 2018 and particular shape of joints previous statistics van tol et al 2010 showed that 0 16 of the joints have severe leakages as noted by spruit et al 2013 the leakage becomes increasingly more serious and more frequent with more panels and deeper diaphragm walls castaldo et al 2018 conducted a probabilistic assessment of groundwater leakage in this study the positioning error and trench collapse were identified as the two major causes of geometric imperfections of diaphragm walls the probability of leakage occurrence was evaluated using a two dimensional analysis with monte carlo simulations this study provided significant reference for the risk of leakage given certain design parameters however it only reflected occurrence of the defects and did not quantitatively evaluate the severity of leakages on the other hand it is worth noting that the leakage of diaphragm wall is a three dimensional problem which means the inclination of a panel could occur along both transverse and longitudinal directions of the wall fig 3 a and b to gain probabilistic insights into seepage problems random finite element method is extensively used e g fenton and griffiths 1993 1994 griffiths and fenton 1998 srivastava et al 2010 li et al 2016 however most of the previous studies assumed a two dimensional condition due to the high computation cost given the large scale of a diaphragm wall and relatively smaller dimensions of seepage passages the finite element modelling of a diaphragm wall problem considering seepage passages usually involves millions of elements worse still this issue is aggravated by large volumes of monte carlo simulations involving hundreds of thousands of realisations hence to quantitatively evaluate the water tightness of diaphragm walls in a full three dimensional scenario is imperative pan et al 2017 2019a b proposed approaches using a three dimensional digitalised algorithm tda to evaluate the steady state flow rate through geometrically imperfect jet grouted cut off walls and earth plugs pan et al 2019b showed that the tda gives a reasonably close estimation of flow rate to the fem though the calculation duration of the tda is only 1 102 1 104 that of the fem however these approaches were particularly developed for jet grouted cut off walls consisting of overlapping columns with strong diametric variation to apply the algorithm in the problem of diaphragm wall more particular details about the diaphragm walls need to be rigorously considered in this study the tda was implemented to quantitatively evaluate the flow rate through the diaphragm wall monte carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the probabilistic distribution of flow rate with given statistics of grab inclinations 2 methodology 2 1 statistical characteristics previous studies bruce et al 1989 puller 1994 spruit et al 2013 hannink and thumann 2013 showed that geometric imperfections of diaphragm walls are related to the following factors 1 verticality of excavation 2 soil collapse during trenching or concreting 3 particular shape of connections 4 inclusion of bentonite in the concrete while the four factors are all very significant only the geometric imperfection due to insufficient verticality is investigated the random orientations of grab axis is usually described by two independent parameters e g eramo et al 2011 flora et al 2011 liu et al 2015 modoni et al 2016 pan et al 2019a namely azimuth α and inclination angle β fig 4 a it is assumed that the azimuth follows a uniform distribution within 0 2π this being reasonable given that the grab axis can incline to any direction following previous studies on geometric imperfection croce et al 2004 arroyo et al 2012 the inclination angle β is assumed to be normally distributed around zero negative inclination angle indicates that the axis is oriented to the opposite direction it is interpreted from hannink and thumann 2013 s field test data that the mean and standard deviation of the inclination angle of the wall built under the allowable inclination of 0 5 are around 0 03 and 0 1 respectively the mean value is actually close to zero as the grab is allowed to tilt at both sides of the wall with equal probability intuitively lower standard deviation indicates a better quality control during trenching on the other hand the panel itself may also rotate in the horizontal plane fig 4 b this rotation is not probable when the grab is restricted by the guide wall near the ground surface however in deeper depths where the grab is off the control of the guide wall the rotation is still possible given that the soil strength and stiffness may vary locally phoon and kulhawy 1999 zhu and zhang 2013 and the stiff zones may push away the grab during the lowering down of grabs the rotation angle of the panel itself is designated as θ similar to the inclination angle β the rotation angle follows a normal distribution with a zero mean deviation and a standard deviation of 0 1 due to the scarcity of data about rotation angle a parametric study is done to investigate the effect of rotation angle in cases where the clamshell grab is used one element consists of multiple bites as the clamshell needs to be lifted up and lowered down multiple times to remove the loosen soil fig 5 a and b after each bite the grab is relocated and the random inclination and rotation angle may be different as a result independent variables are used to simulate the angles α β and θ for each bite the width and thickness of a bite conform to the corresponding dimensions of the clamshell the height of one bite is roughly 1 5 m 2 5 m in sum the inclination angle and rotation angle are simulated as random variables following a normal distribution of zero mean deviation and a standard deviation of 0 1 they are regenerated for each bite and are mutually independent 2 2 a discretised algorithm for geometric imperfection evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the water tightness of diaphragm wall the whole ground is firstly discretised into identical eight node cuboid elements fig 6 a the horizontal planes parallel to x y plane are called layers and the vertical planes parallel to x z plane are called slices the coordinates of each node are examined to ensure that it is in the range of any adjacent bite fig 6 b and c if a node is not included in any bite it is then marked as an untreated node otherwise it is marked as a concrete node the examination of penetration of untreated zones through the diaphragm wall is significant because the flow rate would increase sharply if untreated zones form continuous seepage passages it can be done by scanning the succession of untreated zones along the possible seepage passages fig 6 b if any two arbitrarily selected successive slices have overlapped the untreated zones the untreated zone is said to penetrate the diaphragm wall fig 6 d provides three scenarios to clarify the exact definition of penetration as can be seen no penetration occurs in the first two scenarios the first one is not penetrated because there is no overlap between the two highlighted adjacent slices or layers whilst the second one is due to the discontinuous untreated zones on the other hand only the third scenario shows the penetration behaviour it should be noted that the cross sectional area of the untreated zone on a slice is proportional to the number of nodes located within the untreated zone fig 6 c each node corresponds to an area that is equivalent to the area of the cuboid s cross section for cases with seepage penetration in the diaphragm wall the flow rate could be estimated for cases with no penetration the minimum thickness of the diaphragm wall could be acquired croce and modoni 2007 2 3 estimation of flow rate the principle of flow rate estimation is to estimate the flow rate based on the amount of penetrating seepage passages in the untreated zones in the estimation the flow in the intact concrete zones is excluded due to the concrete s low permeability coefficient following pan et al 2017 2019a one needs to consider the following factors 1 the dimensions of the penetrating untreated zones wall length l width w and thickness t 2 the site conditions including the permeability coefficient of untreated zones k u water head difference between two sides of the diaphragm wall h overlapping distance δb and nominal thickness of the wall without considering the geometrical imperfections t fig 2 the flow rate of groundwater through the seepage passage was treated as a one dimensional steady state flow for simplicity the one dimensional flow assumption is acceptable because the transversal dimensions in x and z directions in fig 9 b of the seepage passage are usually smaller than that in the longitudinal direction y direction as a result the flow rate component in the transversal directions is much smaller than that in the longitudinal direction of the seepage passage it is worth noting that the transient flow is not considered in this study following pan et al 2019a b the flow rate through the seepage passage can be expressed as 1 q k u h t a t where a t 1 1 t 0 t 1 a y d y is the harmonic average of the area along the seepage passage the value of harmonic average is often small for instance if the minimum area of a potential seepage passage approaches zero then the corresponding harmonic average value equals almost zeroimplying a near zero flow rate the discretised form of harmonic average a t can be written as 2 a t 1 1 n j 1 n 1 a s j where a sj is the cross sectional area of the untreated zone on the j th slice and the seepage passage is equally discretised into n slices since the untreated zones are recorded and the continuous seepage passages are marked the flow rate at each seepage passage can be therefore estimated in cases with multiple seepage passages the flow rate through all seepage passages should be summed up 2 4 estimation of minimum thickness when the diaphragm wall is not penetrated in the seepage direction e g scenario 1 or 2 in fig 6 d the minimum thickness t min will act as a key indicator of the cut off performance croce and modoni 2007 the thickness can be evaluated by the number of concrete nodes along the seepage direction y direction fig 7 then the minimum thickness in the diaphragm wall can be evaluated by taking the minimum value the flow rate through the wall can be conservatively estimated as 3 q k t h t min a where k t is the permeability coefficient of concrete and a is the area of the diaphragm wall 2 5 finite element method validation the tda has been verified in pan et al 2019b using a realisation by realisation comparison with random finite element analysis in this study a simple deterministic finite element model was established to compare with the tda fig 8 a a unit cubic zone with lateral dimension of 1 m was modelled using both fem and tda a tapering seepage passage with a maximum and minimum cross section of 1 m2 and 0 04 m2 respectively were simulated fig 8 b the same discretisation mesh was used for both fem and tda i e 0 01 m 0 01 m 0 04 m fig 8 c hence the fem model consists of 250 000 identical cuboidal elements and 265 226 nodes the water head boundaries of 1 m and 0 were applied on the front and back faces respectively the other four boundaries were kept closed hence it can be expected that the seepage is along the y direction the permeability coefficient of the concrete and the untreated soil are assumed to be 1 10 9 m s and 1 10 5 m s respectively the centre coordinates of each element were calculated if the centre was inside the scope of untreated zone dotted zone in fig 8 b then a permeability coefficient of 1 10 5 m s was assigned to this element otherwise a permeability coefficient of 1 10 9 m s was assigned the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg iterative solver with a tolerance of 1 10 15 was adopted to obtain a convergent solution for the linear equation series the fem analysis was conducted on a matlab code which calculates the total steady state flow rate across the cube cross section fig 8 d shows the flow velocity and vectors in the middle layer z 0 5 m expectedly the flow is mainly concentrated in the untreated zone since this study involves a steady state seepage analysis the resultant flow rate in the y direction is constant along the seepage direction the fem result of flow rate through the unit cube was 1 74 10 6 m3 s taking around 29 600 s to run on a single core with a cpu clock speed of 3 4 ghz on the other hand the tda analysis was used to evaluate the flow rate in the same problem with same meshes the obtained tda result of flow rate equalled to 1 73 10 6 m3 s taking only 6 7 s to run under the same condition in the fem analysis this shows that the tda obtains a similar estimation as fem at the expense of around 1 4000 calculation time there are two reasons for the significantly higher calculation speed of tda than fem 1 the large volume of intact concrete zones contributes little to the resultant flow rate but consumes the majority of the calculation cost 2 the tda does not involve the assembly of global stiffness matrices and solution of large linear equation series it only counts the untreated nodes along the penetrating seepage passage and then calculate the flow rate via eqs 1 and 2 although a comparison between the fem and tda in a fully random scenario is desirable it will cost a great volume of work to cover all the details in both fem and tda analysis and cannot be fully covered in this study 3 results and discussion in this section a reference case is established based on configurations of typical diaphragm walls a typical realisation is analysed to provide a visualised understanding of the problem then a convergence study on the mesh size and model scale is conducted this is followed by a detailed parametric study to explore the effect of each parameter 3 1 reference case the reference case parameters are selected according to the statistical characteristics summarised in table 1 table 2 lists the reference cases configuration parameters the centre to centre distance between two adjacent panels b are fixed at 2 m which is within the typical range of a panel in diaphragm wall 1 5 4 m the incremental depth of each bite is around 1 5 2 5 m hence an average value of 2 m is assumed in this study the width w thickness t and length l of the wall are assumed to be 20 m 1 m and 40 m respectively indicating the scale of a typical deep excavation for cases with smaller length or width the problem caused by the geometric imperfections are unlikely to happen in trenching stage the grab width is usually larger than the centre to centre distance creating an overlap between adjacent panels fig 2 b this overlap is used to ensure that all the soils are excavated during trenching larger overlapping distance reduces the occurrence of untreated soil in the trench however this increases the operation duration and hence the cost in the reference case the overlapping distance of 0 2 m is used as mentioned above the standard deviation of the inclination angle and rotation angle are assumed to be 0 1 corresponding to an allowable inclination of around 1 200 the water head difference and permeability of the in situ soil varies from case to case and can be evaluated from site investigation data the water head difference of deep excavations landfill and dams ranges from 100 to 101 m tan and lu 2017 sembenelli and sembenelli 1999 zhan et al 2017 the 20 m 40 m 1 m model was discretised into 2 5 million cuboidal elements each element with horizontal and vertical element sizes of 0 04 m and 0 2 m respectively the configurations of the reference case are listed in table 2 fig 9 shows a typical random realisation of the numerical model of diaphragm wall fig 9 a shows the elevation view of the numerical model each panel consists of multiple bites and each bite has the dimension of 2 2 m 1 0 m 2 0 m in x y and z directions the longitudinal x deviation resembles the shape predicted by the koden record in bruce et al 1989 a penetrating seepage passage is shown at the lower left corner of the diaphragm wall this is captured by the blue dots marking untreated nodes as shown in the three dimensional view in fig 9 b although these untreated zones may finally collapse due to subsequent bites or by its self weight it is conservative to consider the effect of those untreated zone the existence of such suspending untreated zone is understandable because the density of the bentonite slurry is close to the soil itself to maintain stability of the trench this gives a large buoyancy to hold the seepage passage fig 9 c shows the transversal y direction deviation of the diaphragm wall at each depth which resembles the field report in hannick and thumann 2013 following modoni et al 2016 and pan et al 2017 2019a 1000 realizations are considered to obtain a statistically convergent result the cumulative distribution normalised flow rate ω for all 1000 realisations is plotted 3 2 convergence study the convergence studies with respect to the mesh size and the number of monte carlo simulations were conducted with the configuration of the reference case in table 1 fig 10 a shows that a large portion of cumulative probability falls in a near zero normalised flow rate when the horizontal mesh is coarser than 0 1 m this is unsurprising since seepage passages with smaller sizes cannot be detected the results basically converge when the mesh size is finer than 0 04 m since the bites are basically straight in the z direction a coarser mesh in z direction vertical can be used fig 10 b shows that if a z direction mesh size of 0 2 m is used while keeping the meshes in x and y directions to be 0 04 m the results basically converge fig 10 c shows that 1000 realisations are sufficient to obtain a convergent cumulative distribution of the normalised flow rate 3 3 parametric study a detailed parametric study is conducted to explore the effect of each influencing factor and potentially shortlist relevant design parameters the influencing factors are summarised in table 2 the factors are divided into three groups 1 the excavation dimensions which are basically determined as per the owner s requests or ground conditions they are wall length l and wall width w 2 the statistical parameters i e standard deviation of inclination angle std β and rotation angle std θ 3 design parameters of the diaphragm wall that can be controlled by the designers they are overlapping distance between adjacent panels δb and thickness t the effect of incremental depth per bite is also investigated fig 11 a and b show that smaller height of each bite δ bite as shown in fig 5 leads to higher probability of penetration the result shows that treating the panels as a single cuboidal body without considering the zigzags caused by multiple bites is not conservative with the random zigzags along the vertical direction untreated zone are more likely to occur e g fig 9 a for grabs with cutting drums and pumps systems that evacuate loosen soils continuously only one bite is involved though the zigzags still exist due to the occasional deviation bruce et al 1989 figs 12 14 a and b show the effect of geometric dimensions of the diaphragm wall on the cut off performance specifically the penetration probability increases with the normalised width fig 12 this is reasonable because a wider wall involves more joints and hence higher chance of penetration on the other hand the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate reduces with larger width indicating that assuming a smaller width of the wall is on the conservative side if the 95 fractile is used as the design reference fig 13 shows that the usage of a thicker wall does not effectively reduce the occurrence of penetration though it reduces the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate this is reasonable because the majority of penetration is caused by the deviation of panel axis in the wall plane fig 3 a which is less likely to be influenced by the thickness of the wall as expected longer walls lead to significantly poorer cut off performance of the wall as the deviation of the grab accumulates with depth fig 14 fig 15 shows that a slightly larger overlapping distance greatly improves the performance of the diaphragm wall i e it reduces both the probability of penetration and the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate figs 16 and 17 show that the effect of inclination angle seems to be much more pronounced than the rotation angle this is because the effect of the former factor is amplified by the depth or length of wall 4 engineering implications in engineering practice it is very difficult for engineers to conduct random analysis with such a complex code hence it is of engineering interest to provide design charts that are easy to follow in this section design charts are plotted based on production runs with a wide range of parameters the parameter ranges are determined in accordance with the engineering practice finally an illustrative example is provided to facilitate the usage of the design charts it should be noted that in the analysis only the effect of geometric imperfection caused by the inclination of grab is considered other effects due to soil collapse inclusion of soil are not considered in the study 4 1 parameter range the previous parametric study reveals that the cut off performance is sensitive to the wall length width thickness overlapping distance and the standard deviation of the inclination angle hence these parameters are considered in the production runs statistical parameters the allowable verticality tolerance ranges from 1 200 to 1 100 according to various codes and standards table 1 if the specified tolerance corresponds to an exceeding probability of 0 3 then the tolerance of 1 200 corresponds to a standard deviation of inclination angle std β of 0 1 this is consistent with the field data in hannink and thumann 2013 since most codes specify a verticality tolerance of 1 200 1 100 the std β of 0 1 and 0 2 are used a standard deviation of rotation angle of std θ 0 1 is used though it does not affect the result geometric parameters three levels of normalised wall length l b are used namely 10 20 and 30 four levels of normalised overlapping distance δb b are used namely 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 three levels of normalised wall thickness t b are considered namely 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 these values are selected as per the normal range of engineering practice the centre to centre distance b is assumed to be 2 m which is close to the lower bound this is because a smaller centre to centre distance leads to a more conservative result the wall width varies greatly in different projects 101 102 m given that the 95 fractile increases with smaller wall width a wall width of 20 m is used for conservatism which is close to the lower bound of the wall width in sum 72 combinations of normalised wall length l b 10 20 and 30 thickness t b 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 normalised overlapping distance δb b 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and standard deviation of inclination angle std β 0 1 and 0 2 were examined in the design charts in design the wall length l width w and water head difference h are determined by the site condition the verticality is influenced by the workmanship soil type and the action standard used once the above parameters are determined the designers only need to consider the overlapping distance δb and the wall thickness t this helps the designers to make informed decisions on the choice of grab models 4 2 dimensionless design parameters as the dimensions of diaphragm wall vary greatly from case to case dimensionless design parameters can be used reformulating eq 1 gives the normalised flow rate ω 4 ω qt k u h a a t a where a is the area of the diaphragm wall the normalised flow rate is actually equal to the harmonic average of cross sectional area along the seepage passage normalised by the unit cell s area according to eurocode 7 a cautious estimate should be conducted to ensure that the selected value is more pessimistic than 95 of all cases hence the 95 fractile of normalised flow rate is chosen one can optimise the design according to the estimated flow rate and available drainage capacity with the 95 fracitle of the normalised flow rate ω one can evaluate the total flow rate through the wall via 5 q k u h a t ω in reality a limitation of flow rate δ is applied to conform to various codes and action standards for a typical deep excavation project the drainage capability is limited by 0 5 l s per 1000 m2 of plan area to ensure that the drainage machines can be readily deployed modoni et al 2016 for coffer dams or buried waste the discharge rate is also limited as per the corresponding standards or owner s requests following pan et al 2019 a dimensionless parameter ω b t is used as the y coordinate of the design chart to ensure the unknown value t is separated from the known values in the limit state the flow rate is equal to limit flow rate δ and we have 6 ω b t δ b k u h a the ω b t corresponding to the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate ω is plotted against the normalised wall length l b to ensure that the design values correspond to cases more pessimistic than 95 of all cases fig 18 a and b are design charts with two verticality levels i e 1 200 and 1 100 respectively 4 3 design procedures and an illustrative example the following procedures are provided to evaluate the design values 1 determine all design parameters the wall length l and wall width w can be determined as per the owner s requests the water head difference between both sides of the wall h and the permeability of untreated soil k u can be roughly evaluated by the site investigation and laboratory tests of coring samples in cases where multiple soil layers exist a weighted average of permeability coefficient with respect to layer thickness can be used in reality the centre to centre spacing b is equal to the grab width minus the overlapping distance δb the grab width conforms to the standard grab model type which usually ranges from 2 2 m to 4 2 m however the overlapping distance is unknown before design to circumvent this difficulty the centre to centre spacing b can be roughly estimated as 0 8 times the width of the grab this is to ensure a slightly larger normalised wall length is used in the design which is on the conservative side as it means higher normalised length evaluate the limit flow rate δ should be set according to the local or professional codes or action standards calculate the δ b k u h a and l b 2 draw a horizontal line of ω b t δ b k u h a and intersect a vertical line at the desired normalised wall length interpolate the overlapping distance for each thickness t 3 change the b and repeat 1 and 2 until one finds the satisfactory design with the lowest cost the following illustrative example is provided to facilitate the use of the design charts a diaphragm wall is constructed to hinder the adjacent river water from coming into an adjacent deep excavation pit wall dimension length 40 m width 30 m pit dimension length 20 m width 30 m the water head difference is 10 m between the two sides of the wall site investigation shows that a thick layer 40 m of alluvial deposit mainly sandy soil with a permeability coefficient k u up to 1 10 5 m s exists all the way down to an impermeable layer the designer is required to select a suitable grab with certain grab width and thickness as well as the overlapping distance if the verticality can be controlled within 1 200 fig 18 a should be used assuming a centre to centre distance b of 2 m the normalised total length l b and normalised wall width w b are 20 and 15 respectively since w b is larger than 10 the 95 fractile calculated using w b 10 is on the conservative side as shown in fig 12 given a drainage capability is limited by 0 5 l s per 1000 m2 of plan area modoni et al 2016 the limit flow rate δ 0 5 l s 1000 m 2 20 m 30 m 0 3 l s therefore the value δ b k u h a is equal to 0 05 and a horizontal line with ω d t 0 05 is drawn in fig 18 a this is intersected by a vertical line l b 20 for a normalised overlapping distance of 0 05 the point is between t 1 m and t 1 5 m a linear interpolation gives a thickness of around 1 25 m alternatively a normalised overlapping distance of 0 1 and a thickness of 0 6 m are also valid and slightly more conservative hence the configurations are written as 1 b 2 m t b 0 625 δb b 0 05 2 b 2 m t b 0 6 δb b 0 10 assuming a b of 3 m and 4 m gives intersection points well above the design curves implying that these options 1 b 4 m t b 0 3 δb b 0 05 2 b 3 m t b 0 3 δb b 0 05 are overly conservative with the current verticality control when the verticality is controlled within 1 100 the following configurations are selected 1 b 4 m t b 0 3 δb b 0 1 2 b 3 m t b 0 5 δb b 0 1 3 b 2 m t b 0 8 δb b 0 2 expectedly poorer quality control over verticality requires more conservativeness in either thickness or overlapping distance 5 concluding remarks geometrical imperfections led by construction errors is widely observed and may greatly undermine the overall cut off performance of diaphragm walls more often than not only remedial works can be taken when leakage problems are observed after excavation or detected after construction and before excavation in this study the geometrical imperfections led by off verticality of grab axis during trenching was considered and its impact on the overall cut off performance of the diaphragm wall was quantitatively evaluated this enables a reliability based design approach with a pre set safety margin to rationally counterbalance the effect of geometric imperfections in the subsequent construction stage it should be noted that the current study only deals with the geometric imperfections caused by the off verticality of grabs and only considers the steady state seepage scenario other influencing factors such as collapse of trench and inclusion of soil in concrete have not been investigated and requires further study in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5948,diaphragm walls are commonly used as cut off walls to prevent water from entering dewatered excavation pits landfills and downstream water however due to the geometrical imperfections such as the positioning error of grab during trenching small seepage passages through the diaphragm wall may occasionally occur which will undermine its water tightness and lead to significant leakages this study therefore used a reliability based approach to quantitatively estimate the effect of geometrical imperfections on the water tightness of diaphragm walls using a three dimensional discretised algorithm tda this algorithm enables a rigorous examination of penetration of seepage passages and it further quantitatively estimates the flow rate through the diaphragm wall under certain circumstances finally detailed design procedures and design graphs were provided which may facilitate the choice of a rational grab model and construction parameters in the design of diaphragm walls keywords seepage geometrical imperfection reliability cut off wall dewatering leakage 1 introduction cut off or curtain walls are usually used to hinder groundwater from seeping into dewatered excavation pits

wall jet grouted deep mixed wall depending on the specific engineering scenarios budget and availability of equipment diaphragm wall is one of the most widely used and reliable types of cut off wall in various applications the diaphragm wall is constructed by replacing slurry with reinforced concrete in pre excavated trenches which forms water proof overlapping panels fig 2 a despite the efforts taken to ensure the continuity of diaphragm walls defective diaphragm walls were frequently reported shin et al 2006 haack 2009 rowson 2009 chien et al 2011 hwang 2016 tan and lu 2017 fig 2 b such defects would give rise to excessive groundwater flow followed by a series of consequences such as drawdown of local water tables excessive surface settlement and cracks of adjacent buildings ni et al

collapse of an adjacent masonry house texplor 2013 to date the quality control of diaphragm walls are usually done during and after wall construction during trenching the koden sensors and inverse pendulum floaters are used to monitor the verticality of grabs bruce et al 1989 spruit et al 2013 after wall construction the cross hole logging csl electrical resistivity tomography ert and pumping well tests are utilised to detect wall defects particularly the pumping well test was reported to be effective in detecting the existing leakages through the wall pujades et al 2012 wu et al 201a b the last defence line of defect control is the instant remedial measures after leakages are observed the remedial measures include surface grouting backfilling and jet grouting the above detection measures are effective approaches to evaluate the water tightness of diaphragm wall however these measures can only be taken after the wall construction is finished at this stage the leakages might have already occurred and therefore subsequent remedial works may be excessively expensive and time consuming moreover in cases with piping triggered by sudden inflows of water texplor 2013 tan and lu 2017 such remedial works may not be effective therefore it is of engineering interest to provide a risk based guideline in the design stage before the construction as a rational conservatism in design is usually more economical than remedies after leakages or failures occur possible causes of leakage in diaphragm walls involve the defects 1 in the panel itself 2 through joints the former is due to the soil or slurry inclusions the latter is attributed to the influencing factors such as inclination of panel castaldo et al 2018 and particular shape of joints previous statistics van tol et al 2010 showed that 0 16 of the joints have severe leakages as noted by spruit et al 2013 the leakage becomes increasingly more serious and more frequent with more panels and deeper diaphragm walls castaldo et al 2018 conducted a probabilistic assessment of groundwater leakage in this study the positioning error and trench collapse were identified as the two major causes of geometric imperfections of diaphragm walls the probability of leakage occurrence was evaluated using a two dimensional analysis with monte carlo simulations this study provided significant reference for the risk of leakage given certain design parameters however it only reflected occurrence of the defects and did not quantitatively evaluate the severity of leakages on the other hand it is worth noting that the leakage of diaphragm wall is a three dimensional problem which means the inclination of a panel could occur along both transverse and longitudinal directions of the wall fig 3 a and b to gain probabilistic

that the tda gives a reasonably close estimation of flow rate to the fem though the calculation duration of the tda is only 1 102 1 104 that of the fem however these approaches were particularly developed for jet grouted cut off walls consisting of overlapping columns with strong diametric variation to apply the algorithm in the problem of diaphragm wall more particular details about the diaphragm walls need to be rigorously considered in this study the tda was implemented to quantitatively evaluate the flow rate through the diaphragm wall monte carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the probabilistic distribution of flow rate with given statistics of grab inclinations 2 methodology 2 1 statistical characteristics previous studies bruce et al 1989 puller 1994 spruit et al 2013 hannink and thumann 2013 showed that geometric imperfections of diaphragm walls are related to the following factors 1 verticality of excavation 2 soil collapse during trenching or concreting 3 particular shape of connections 4 inclusion of bentonite in the concrete while the four factors are all very significant only the geometric imperfection due to insufficient verticality is investigated the random orientations of grab axis is usually described by two independent parameters e g eramo et al 2011 flora et al 2011 liu et al 2015 modoni et al 2016 pan et al 2019a namely azimuth α and inclination angle β fig 4 a it is assumed that the azimuth follows a uniform distribution within 0 2π this being reasonable given that the grab axis can incline to any direction following previous studies on geometric imperfection croce et al 2004 arroyo et al 2012 the inclination angle β is assumed to be normally distributed around zero negative inclination angle indicates that the axis is oriented to the opposite direction it is interpreted from hannink and thumann 2013 s field test data that the mean and standard deviation of the inclination angle of the wall built under the allowable inclination of 0 5 are around 0 03 and 0 1 respectively the mean value is actually close to zero as the grab is allowed to tilt at both sides of the wall with equal probability intuitively lower standard deviation indicates a better quality control during trenching on the other hand the panel itself may also rotate in the horizontal plane fig 4 b this rotation is not probable when the grab is restricted by the guide wall near the ground surface however in deeper depths where the grab is off the control of the guide wall the rotation is still possible given that the soil strength and stiffness may vary locally phoon and kulhawy 1999 zhu and zhang 2013 and the stiff zones may push away the grab during the lowering down of grabs the rotation angle of the panel itself is designated as θ similar to the inclination angle β the rotation angle follows a normal distribution with a zero mean deviation and a standard deviation of 0 1 due to the scarcity of data about rotation angle a parametric study is done to investigate the effect of rotation angle in cases where the clamshell grab is used one element consists of multiple bites as the clamshell needs to be lifted up and lowered down multiple times to remove the loosen soil fig 5 a and b after each bite the grab is relocated and the random inclination and rotation angle may be different as a result independent variables are used to simulate the angles α β and θ for each bite the width and thickness of a bite conform to the corresponding dimensions of the clamshell the height of one bite is roughly 1 5 m 2 5 m in sum the inclination angle and rotation angle are simulated as random variables following a normal distribution of zero mean deviation and a standard deviation of 0 1 they are regenerated for each bite and are mutually independent 2 2 a discretised algorithm for geometric imperfection evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the water tightness of diaphragm wall the whole ground is firstly discretised into identical eight node cuboid elements fig 6 a the horizontal planes parallel to x y plane are called layers and the vertical planes parallel to x z plane are called slices the coordinates of each node are examined to ensure that it is in the range of any adjacent bite fig 6 b and c if a node is not included in any bite it is then marked as an untreated node otherwise it is marked as a concrete node the examination of penetration of untreated zones through the diaphragm wall is significant because the flow rate would increase sharply if untreated zones form continuous seepage passages it can be done by scanning the succession of untreated zones along the possible seepage passages fig 6 b if any two arbitrarily selected successive slices have overlapped the untreated zones the untreated zone is said to penetrate the diaphragm wall fig 6 d provides three scenarios to clarify the exact definition of penetration as can be seen no penetration occurs in the first two scenarios the first one is not penetrated because there is no overlap between the two highlighted adjacent slices or layers whilst the second one is due to the discontinuous untreated zones on the other hand only the third scenario shows the penetration behaviour it should be noted that the cross sectional area of the untreated zone on a slice is proportional to the number of nodes located within the untreated zone fig 6 c each node corresponds to an area that is equivalent to the area of the cuboid s cross section for cases with seepage penetration in the diaphragm wall the flow rate could be estimated for cases with no penetration the minimum thickness of the diaphragm wall could be acquired croce and modoni 2007 2 3 estimation of flow rate the principle of flow rate estimation is to estimate the flow rate based on the amount of penetrating seepage passages in the untreated zones in the estimation the flow in the intact concrete zones is excluded due to the concrete s low permeability coefficient following pan et al 2017 2019a one needs to consider the following factors 1 the dimensions of the penetrating untreated zones wall length l width w and thickness t 2 the site conditions including the permeability coefficient of untreated zones k u water head difference between two sides of the diaphragm wall h overlapping distance δb and nominal thickness of the wall without considering the geometrical imperfections t fig 2 the flow rate of groundwater through the seepage passage was treated as a one dimensional steady state flow for simplicity the one dimensional flow assumption is acceptable because the transversal dimensions in x and z directions in fig 9 b of the seepage passage are usually smaller than that in the longitudinal direction y direction as a result the flow rate component in the transversal directions is much smaller than that in the longitudinal direction of the seepage passage it is worth noting that the transient flow is not considered in this study following pan et al 2019a b the flow rate through the seepage passage can be expressed as 1 q k u h t a t where a t 1 1 t 0 t 1 a y d y is the harmonic average of the area along the seepage passage the value of harmonic average is often small for instance if the minimum area of a potential seepage passage approaches zero then the corresponding harmonic average value equals almost zeroimplying a near zero flow rate the discretised form of harmonic average a t can be written as 2 a t 1 1 n j 1 n 1 a s j where a sj is the cross sectional area of the untreated zone on the j th slice and the seepage passage is equally discretised into n slices since the untreated zones are recorded and the continuous seepage passages are marked the flow rate at each seepage passage can be therefore estimated in cases with multiple seepage passages the flow rate through all seepage passages should be summed up 2 4 estimation of minimum thickness when the diaphragm wall is not penetrated in the seepage direction e g scenario 1 or 2 in fig 6 d the minimum thickness t min will act as a key indicator of the cut off performance croce and modoni 2007 the thickness can be evaluated by the number of concrete nodes along the seepage direction y direction fig 7 then the minimum thickness in the diaphragm wall can be evaluated by taking the minimum value the flow rate through the wall can be conservatively estimated as 3 q k t h t min a where k t is the permeability coefficient of concrete and a is the area of the diaphragm wall 2 5 finite element method validation the tda has been verified in pan et al 2019b using a realisation by realisation comparison with random finite element analysis in this study a simple deterministic finite element model was established to compare with the tda fig 8 a a unit cubic zone with lateral dimension of 1 m was modelled using both fem and tda a tapering seepage passage with a maximum and minimum cross section of 1 m2 and 0 04 m2 respectively were simulated fig 8 b the same discretisation mesh was used for both fem and tda i e 0 01 m 0 01 m 0 04 m fig 8 c hence the fem model consists of 250 000 identical cuboidal elements and 265 226 nodes the water head boundaries of 1 m and 0 were applied on the front and back faces respectively the other four boundaries were kept closed hence it can be expected that the seepage is along the y direction the permeability coefficient of the concrete and the untreated soil are assumed to be 1 10 9 m s and 1 10 5 m s respectively the centre coordinates of each element were calculated if the centre was inside the scope of untreated zone dotted zone in fig 8 b then a permeability coefficient of 1 10 5 m s was assigned to this element otherwise a permeability coefficient of 1 10 9 m s was assigned the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg iterative solver with a tolerance of 1 10 15 was adopted to obtain a convergent solution for the linear equation series the fem analysis was conducted on a matlab code which calculates the total steady state flow rate across the cube cross section fig 8 d shows the flow velocity and vectors in the middle layer z 0 5 m expectedly the flow is mainly concentrated in the untreated zone since this study involves a steady state seepage analysis the resultant flow rate in the y direction is constant along the seepage direction the fem result of flow rate through the unit cube was 1 74 10 6 m3 s taking around 29 600 s to run on a single core with a cpu clock speed of 3 4 ghz on the other hand the tda analysis was used to evaluate the flow rate in the same problem with same meshes the obtained tda result of flow rate equalled to 1 73 10 6 m3 s taking only 6 7 s to run under the same condition in the fem analysis this shows that the tda obtains a similar estimation as fem at the expense of around 1 4000 calculation time there are two reasons for the significantly higher calculation speed of tda than fem 1 the large volume of intact concrete zones contributes little to the resultant flow rate but consumes the majority of the calculation cost 2 the tda does not involve the assembly of global stiffness matrices and solution of large linear equation series it only counts the untreated nodes along the penetrating seepage passage and then calculate the flow rate via eqs 1 and 2 although a comparison between the fem and tda in a fully random scenario is desirable it will cost a great volume of work to cover all the details in both fem and tda analysis and cannot be fully covered in this study 3 results and discussion in this section a reference case is established based on configurations of typical diaphragm walls a typical realisation is analysed to provide a visualised understanding of the problem then a convergence study on the mesh size and model scale is conducted this is followed by a detailed parametric study to explore the effect of each parameter 3 1 reference case the reference case parameters are selected according to the statistical characteristics summarised in table 1 table 2 lists the reference cases configuration parameters the centre to centre distance between two adjacent panels b are fixed at 2 m which is within the typical range of a panel in diaphragm wall 1 5 4 m the incremental depth of each bite is around 1 5 2 5 m hence an average value of 2 m is assumed in this study the width w thickness t and length l of the wall are assumed to be 20 m 1 m and 40 m respectively indicating the scale of a typical deep excavation for cases with smaller length or width the problem caused by the geometric imperfections are unlikely to happen in trenching stage the grab width is usually larger than the centre to centre distance creating an overlap between adjacent panels fig 2 b this overlap is used to ensure that all the soils are excavated during trenching larger overlapping distance reduces the occurrence of untreated soil in the trench however this increases the operation duration and hence the cost in the reference case the overlapping distance of 0 2 m is used as mentioned above the standard deviation of the inclination angle and rotation angle are assumed to be 0 1 corresponding to an allowable inclination of around 1 200 the water head difference and permeability of the in situ soil varies from case to case and can be evaluated from site investigation data the water head difference of deep excavations landfill and dams ranges from 100 to 101 m tan and lu 2017 sembenelli and sembenelli 1999 zhan et al 2017 the 20 m 40 m 1 m model was discretised into 2 5 million cuboidal elements each element with horizontal and vertical element sizes of 0 04 m and 0 2 m respectively the configurations of the reference case are listed in table 2 fig 9 shows a typical random realisation of the numerical model of diaphragm wall fig 9 a shows the elevation view of the numerical model each panel consists of multiple bites and each bite has the dimension of 2 2 m 1 0 m 2 0 m in x y and z directions the longitudinal x deviation resembles the shape predicted by the koden record in bruce et al 1989 a penetrating seepage passage is shown at the lower left corner of the diaphragm wall this is captured by the blue dots marking untreated nodes as shown in the three dimensional view in fig 9 b although these untreated zones may finally collapse due to subsequent bites or by its self weight it is conservative to consider the effect of those untreated zone the existence of such suspending untreated zone is understandable because the density of the bentonite slurry is close to the soil itself to maintain stability of the trench this gives a large buoyancy to hold the seepage passage fig 9 c shows the transversal y direction deviation of the diaphragm wall at each depth which resembles the field report in hannick and thumann 2013 following modoni et al 2016 and pan et al 2017 2019a 1000 realizations are considered to obtain a statistically convergent result the cumulative distribution normalised flow rate ω for all 1000 realisations is plotted 3 2 convergence study the convergence studies with respect to the mesh size and the number of monte carlo simulations were conducted with the configuration of the reference case in table 1 fig 10 a shows that a large portion of cumulative probability falls in a near zero normalised flow rate when the horizontal mesh is coarser than 0 1 m this is unsurprising since seepage passages with smaller sizes cannot be detected the results basically converge when the mesh size is finer than 0 04 m since the bites are basically straight in the z direction a coarser mesh in z direction vertical can be used fig 10 b shows that if a z direction mesh size of 0 2 m is used while keeping the meshes in x and y directions to be 0 04 m the results basically converge fig 10 c shows that 1000 realisations are sufficient to obtain a convergent cumulative distribution of the normalised flow rate 3 3 parametric study a detailed parametric study is conducted to explore the effect of each influencing factor and potentially shortlist relevant design parameters the influencing factors are summarised in table 2 the factors are divided into three groups 1 the excavation dimensions which are basically determined as per the owner s requests or ground conditions they are wall length l and wall width w 2 the statistical parameters i e standard deviation of inclination angle std β and rotation angle std θ 3 design parameters of the diaphragm wall that can be controlled by the designers they are overlapping distance between adjacent panels δb and thickness t the effect of incremental depth per bite is also investigated fig 11 a and b show that smaller height of each bite δ bite as shown in fig 5 leads to higher probability of penetration the result shows that treating the panels as a single cuboidal body without considering the zigzags caused by multiple bites is not conservative with the random zigzags along the vertical direction untreated zone are more likely to occur e g fig 9 a for grabs with cutting drums and pumps systems that evacuate loosen soils continuously only one bite is involved though the zigzags still exist due to the occasional deviation bruce et al 1989 figs 12 14 a and b show the effect of geometric dimensions of the diaphragm wall on the cut off performance specifically the penetration probability increases with the normalised width fig 12 this is reasonable because a wider wall involves more joints and hence higher chance of penetration on the other hand the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate reduces with larger width indicating that assuming a smaller width of the wall is on the conservative side if the 95 fractile is used as the design reference fig 13 shows that the usage of a thicker wall does not effectively reduce the occurrence of penetration though it reduces the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate this is reasonable because the majority of penetration is caused by the deviation of panel axis in the wall plane fig 3 a which is less likely to be influenced by the thickness of the wall as expected longer walls lead to significantly poorer cut off performance of the wall as the deviation of the grab accumulates with depth fig 14 fig 15 shows that a slightly larger overlapping distance greatly improves the performance of the diaphragm wall i e it reduces both the probability of penetration and the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate figs 16 and 17 show that the effect of inclination angle seems to be much more pronounced than the rotation angle this is because the effect of the former factor is amplified by the depth or length of wall 4 engineering implications in engineering practice it is very difficult for engineers to conduct random analysis with such a complex code hence it is of engineering interest to provide design charts that are easy to follow in this section design charts are plotted based on production runs with a wide range of parameters the parameter ranges are determined in accordance with the engineering practice finally an illustrative example is provided to facilitate the usage of the design charts it should be noted that in the analysis only the effect of geometric imperfection caused by the inclination of grab is considered other effects due to soil collapse inclusion of soil are not considered in the study 4 1 parameter range the previous parametric study reveals that the cut off performance is sensitive to the wall length width thickness overlapping distance and the standard deviation of the inclination angle hence these parameters are considered in the production runs statistical parameters the allowable verticality tolerance ranges from 1 200 to 1 100 according to various codes and standards table 1 if the specified tolerance corresponds to an exceeding probability of 0 3 then the tolerance of 1 200 corresponds to a standard deviation of inclination angle std β of 0 1 this is consistent with the field data in hannink and thumann 2013 since most codes specify a verticality tolerance of 1 200 1 100 the std β of 0 1 and 0 2 are used a standard deviation of rotation angle of std θ 0 1 is used though it does not affect the result geometric parameters three levels of normalised wall length l b are used namely 10 20 and 30 four levels of normalised overlapping distance δb b are used namely 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 three levels of normalised wall thickness t b are considered namely 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 these values are selected as per the normal range of engineering practice the centre to centre distance b is assumed to be 2 m which is close to the lower bound this is because a smaller centre to centre distance leads to a more conservative result the wall width varies greatly in different projects 101 102 m given that the 95 fractile increases with smaller wall width a wall width of 20 m is used for conservatism which is close to the lower bound of the wall width in sum 72 combinations of normalised wall length l b 10 20 and 30 thickness t b 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 normalised overlapping distance δb b 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and standard deviation of inclination angle std β 0 1 and 0 2 were examined in the design charts in design the wall length l width w and water head difference h are determined by the site condition the verticality is influenced by the workmanship soil type and the action standard used once the above parameters are determined the designers only need to consider the overlapping distance δb and the wall thickness t this helps the designers to make informed decisions on the choice of grab models 4 2 dimensionless design parameters as the dimensions of diaphragm wall vary greatly from case to case dimensionless design parameters can be used reformulating eq 1 gives the normalised flow rate ω 4 ω qt k u h a a t a where a is the area of the diaphragm wall the normalised flow rate is actually equal to the harmonic average of cross sectional area along the seepage passage normalised by the unit cell s area according to eurocode 7 a cautious estimate should be conducted to ensure that the selected value is more pessimistic than 95 of all cases hence the 95 fractile of normalised flow rate is chosen one can optimise the design according to the estimated flow rate and available drainage capacity with the 95 fracitle of the normalised flow rate ω one can evaluate the total flow rate through the wall via 5 q k u h a t ω in reality a limitation of flow rate δ is applied to conform to various codes and action standards for a typical deep excavation project the drainage capability is limited by 0 5 l s per 1000 m2 of plan area to ensure that the drainage machines can be readily deployed modoni et al 2016 for coffer dams or buried waste the discharge rate is also limited as per the corresponding standards or owner s requests following pan et al 2019 a dimensionless parameter ω b t is used as the y coordinate of the design chart to ensure the unknown value t is separated from the known values in the limit state the flow rate is equal to limit flow rate δ and we have 6 ω b t δ b k u h a the ω b t corresponding to the 95 fractile of the normalised flow rate ω is plotted against the normalised wall length l b to ensure that the design values correspond to cases more pessimistic than 95 of all cases fig 18 a and b are design charts with two verticality levels i e 1 200 and 1 100 respectively 4 3 design procedures and an illustrative example the following procedures are provided to evaluate the design values 1 determine all design parameters the wall length l and wall width w can be determined as per the owner s requests the water head difference between both sides of the wall h and the permeability of untreated soil k u can be roughly evaluated by the site investigation and laboratory tests of coring samples in cases where multiple soil layers exist a weighted average of permeability coefficient with respect to layer thickness can be used in reality the centre to centre spacing b is equal to the grab width minus the overlapping distance δb the grab width conforms to the standard grab model type which usually ranges from 2 2 m to 4 2 m however the overlapping distance is unknown before design to circumvent this difficulty the centre to centre spacing b can be roughly estimated as 0 8 times the width of the grab this is to ensure a slightly larger normalised wall length is used in the design which is on the conservative side as it means higher normalised length evaluate the limit flow rate δ should be set according to the local or professional codes or action standards calculate the δ b k u h a and l b 2 draw a horizontal line of ω b t δ b k u h a and intersect a vertical line at the desired normalised wall length interpolate the overlapping distance for each thickness t 3 change the b and repeat 1 and 2 until one finds the satisfactory design with the lowest cost the following illustrative example is provided to facilitate the use of the design charts a diaphragm wall is constructed to hinder the adjacent river water from coming into an adjacent deep excavation pit wall dimension length 40 m width 30 m pit dimension length 20 m width 30 m the water head difference is 10 m between the two sides of the wall site investigation shows that a thick layer 40 m of alluvial deposit mainly sandy soil with a permeability coefficient k u up to 1 10 5 m s exists all the way down to an impermeable layer the designer is required to select a suitable grab with certain grab width and thickness as well as the overlapping distance if the verticality can be controlled within 1 200 fig 18 a should be used assuming a centre to centre distance b of 2 m the normalised total length l b and normalised wall width w b are 20 and 15 respectively since w b is larger than 10 the 95 fractile calculated using w b 10 is on the conservative side as shown in fig 12 given a drainage capability is limited by 0 5 l s per 1000 m2 of plan area modoni et al 2016 the limit flow rate δ 0 5 l s 1000 m 2 20 m 30 m 0 3 l s therefore the value δ b k u h a is equal to 0 05 and a horizontal line with ω d t 0 05 is drawn in fig 18 a this is intersected by a vertical line l b 20 for a normalised overlapping distance of 0 05 the point is between t 1 m and t 1 5 m a linear interpolation gives a thickness of around 1 25 m alternatively a normalised overlapping distance of 0 1 and a thickness of 0 6 m are also valid and slightly more conservative hence the configurations are written as 1 b 2 m t b 0 625 δb b 0 05 2 b 2 m t b 0 6 δb b 0 10 assuming a b of 3 m and 4 m gives intersection points well above the design curves implying that these options 1 b 4 m t b 0 3 δb b 0 05 2 b 3 m t b 0 3 δb b 0 05 are overly conservative with the current verticality control when the verticality is controlled within 1 100 the following configurations are selected 1 b 4 m t b 0 3 δb b 0 1 2 b 3 m t b 0 5 δb b 0 1 3 b 2 m t b 0 8 δb b 0 2 expectedly poorer quality control over verticality requires more conservativeness in either thickness or overlapping distance 5 concluding remarks geometrical imperfections led by construction errors is widely observed and may greatly undermine the overall cut off performance of diaphragm walls more often than not only remedial works can be taken when leakage problems are observed after excavation or detected after construction and before excavation in this study the geometrical imperfections led by off verticality of grab axis during trenching was considered and its impact on the overall cut off performance of the diaphragm wall was quantitatively evaluated this enables a reliability based design approach with a pre set safety margin to rationally counterbalance the effect of geometric imperfections in the subsequent construction stage it should be noted that the current study only deals with the geometric imperfections caused by the off verticality of grabs and only considers the steady state seepage scenario other influencing factors such as collapse of trench and inclusion of soil in concrete have not been investigated and requires further study in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5949,measurement of regional water resource variations is significant for understanding water cycle and water management this is especially true for transboundary river basins this study investigated the terrestrial water storage dynamics of the lancang mekong river basin which has a total area of 795 000 km2 and distributed between six countries in southeast asia based on the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites and the global land data assimilation system gldas model a spatial weighted centroid analysis concept from geographical information science was introduced to track the movement of terrestrial water storage centroid of the basin and the response of terrestrial water storage dynamics to climate variations throughout the basin was examined by quantifying the correlations of twsa with a multi scalar drought index results show that during 2003 to 2016 the upstream basin lancang river basin experienced slight decreasing trends ranging from 2 45 to 0 km3 yr revealed by five different grace solutions and the downstream basin mekong river basin generally did not express statistically significant trends five grace solutions are more consistent in the downstream basin than the upstream basin and the mascons based twsa processed at jet propulsion laboratory jpl produced quite different results with the other four solutions generally there are good correlations between grace observations and gldas model the twsa is 1 2 month lagged correlated with precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff anomalies because water from precipitation may take a long period to loss from evapotranspiration and infiltrate into the soil in general water storage dynamics are closely correlated with climatic dry and wet conditions at middle long periods 6 12 months in the basin and the correlation coefficients in wet season are generally higher than those in dry season however a different pattern was found since 2010 in the 2010 2016 period correlations between twsa and the multi scalar drought index in lancang river basin reduced relative to the 2003 2009 period but became stronger in mekong river basin after 2009 the results of this study highlight the differentiation of water storage dynamics response to the climate variation between upstream and downstream of lancang mekong basin in the period 2010 2016 and the possibility of examining basin storage disturbed by human activities in the basin keywords grace terrestrial water storage lancang mekong river basin water balance 1 introduction understanding the dynamics of land water storage is significant for regional water resource management food security and climate variability research seyoum and milewski 2017 yang et al 2017 this is especially true for the international rivers kuenzer et al 2012 voss et al 2013 the transboundary lancang mekong river which has a length of about 4 350 km is the longest river in southeast asia the 7th longest in asia and the 12th longest in the world the lancang mekong river basin has a total area of 795 000 km2 and is distributed between six countries the river feeds over 60 million people in china cambodia thailand vietnam lao pdr and myanmar given the relatively high frequency of severe drought in the lower mekong basin potential water resources conflicts often arise among the six countries haddeland lettenmaier and skaugen 2006 adamson and bird 2010 thus monitoring the water resources balance in the lancang mekong river basin is significant to the regional water and food security and is beneficial for addressing the comprehensive cooperation in management and development of water and related resources in the basin hydrological stations can provide multiple information on hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation surface runoff soil water content and groundwater level and play an important role in water resource monitoring and hydrological simulations rodell 2004 tang et al 2010 rodell et al 2011 but stations only can provide hydrological information at point scales water reserve balance over large basin could not be surveyed based on the distributive stations another challenge is the lack of available hydrological records for the transboundary region inconsistent monitoring combined with a lack of data transparency and accessibility is a problem that plagues water managers around the globe voss et al 2013 and the lancang mekong river basin is no exception although some observation data exist the datasets are often government controlled and access to complete datasets requires the permission and cooperation of multi party government this limitation is especially serious in a river basin that covers so many countries consequently few observation based studies of water budget have been conducted throughout the lancang mekong river basin despite its importance pokhrel et al 2018 feng et al 2019 various global land surface models lsms and global hydrological and water resource models ghwrms also model hydrological variables such as streamflow soil water content schewe et al 2014 bierkens 2015 but the model outputs do not include all water reservoirs and reliability of the outputs still remain questionable scanlon et al 2018 especially in regions that lack ground based observations remote sensing techniques have provided valuable resources for monitoring natural resources variabilities over large scales on the earth tucker 1980 gao 1996 surface water resource can be detected by deriving water body or snow glacier covered area from optical remote sensing images immerzeel et al 2009 feng et al 2016 microwave based remote sensing sensors can measure rainfall intensity and water content in swallow soil layer ulaby batlivala and dobson 1978 njoku et al 2002 zhan et al 2006 huffman et al 2007 because microwave sensors are not subject to weather conditions they can produce precipitation and soil moisture data products at high temporal resolutions those products are widely used for drought and flood monitoring and extreme weather events detection rhee im and carbone 2010 du et al 2013 nicolai shaw et al 2017 however neither optical nor microwave sensors can obtain variations on regional terrestrial water storage balance because root zone soil water content and groundwater storage which are main components of terrestrial water storage tws cannot be estimated from optical or microwave sensors terrestrial water storage is defined as sum of the water stored on land surface e g rivers and lakes in snow water

seyoum and milewski 2017 and have provided more direct estimations than global hydrological models and land surface models in twsa the released versions of grace twsa products include spherical harmonic data versions and mascon data versions the spherical harmonic data versions are processed by using a standard spherical harmonic approach landerer and swenson 2012 and the mascon data

university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl release different solutions by using different approaches and parameters these grace twsa solutions produced using different approaches by different centers have been widely used for the evaluation of changes in water resources over regions and basins tang et al 2010 huang et al 2012 scanlon longuevergne and long 2012 dieng et al 2015 mo et al 2016 yao et al 2016 such products have been proved to have great potential in monitoring tws balance in response to droughts and floods the object of this study is to provide an overview of the total water storage dynamics in the lancang mekong river basin during 2003 to 2016 to evaluate the variabilities between different grace solutions and compare terrestrial water storage balance from grace and global land data assimilation system gldas model the specific issues addressed through this study include three aspects 1 how has the terrestrial water storage changed during the past years in upstream and downstream regions in the lancang mekong river basin 2 what are the differences of the twsa trends deriving from grace solutions and land surface model 3 what is the relation between water storage dynamics and climate condition in the basin 2 study area and data resources 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river originates from the northeast slope of tanggula mountain in china it is called lancang river in china and the mekong river when flowing into the indo china peninsula the total length of the lancang mekong river is 4 350 km and the total area is 795 000 km2 the lancang mekong river is the most important transnational water system in asia and the twelfth longest river in the world the main source of the river is zhaqu originated from zaduo county yushu tibetan autonomous prefecture qinghai province china it flows through china laos myanmar thailand cambodia and vietnam and flows into south china sea in ho chi minh city vietnam the river basin can be divided into two parts the upper basin in china where the river is called lancang and the lower mekong basin from yunnan china downstream to the south china sea fig 1 note that in this study to differentiate the upstream and downstream we refer to the upstream as lancang and downstream as mekong table 1 summarizes the basin area in each country although the river length in china is 2162 km accounting for about 44 of the total length of the river the basin area of lancang river in china is only 20 of the total area of the whole basin because of the narrow basin pattern of mountainous areas in southwest china the lancang mekong river basin is located in the center of the tropical monsoon regions in asia the whole basin is dominated by a single wet season flow peak in august and september and the rainy season is from may to october from november to april of the following year is the dry season as is shown in fig 1 b the average annual rainfall in the basin which is derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm product huffman et al 2010 increases from less than 1000 mm in northeastern thailand to more than 4000 mm in the mountainous areas in southern laos cambodia and vietnam fig 1 a shows terrain elevation map of the basin and the digital elevation model dem data is from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission strm fig 1 c shows the land cover map of the basin the land cover data is from the european space agency esa globcover version 2 3 2009 300 m resolution land cover map http due esrin esa int page globcover php as shown in fig 1 a and c lancang river basin is dominated by mountainous area and the plain areas of mekong river basin are dominated by croplands according to mekong river commission rodriguez 2015 rice is the main crop in the basin and over 10 million hectares of cultivated land is dedicated to rice production approximately 60 of the lancang mekong river basin s population is fed by agriculture but the total basin area is not heavily irrigated fig 1 c because rain fed cultivation is the most prevalent irrigation method throughout the basin 2 2 grace data 2 2 1 the rl05 spherical harmonics the grace satellites provide global monthly total water storage anomalies by measuring earth s gravity field changes the standard spherical harmonic approach ssh is the standard for the first decade of grace observations landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 the official grace science data system continuously released monthly grace solution for three different processing centers geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz center for space research at university of texas austin csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl these three solutions used different parameter choices and solution strategies the current solutions are the release 05 gravity field solutions rl05 the three grace terrestrial water storage tws solutions jpl csr and gfz were downloaded from https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the original data were provided at 1 in both latitude and longitude and resampled at 0 5 using nearest neighbor approach to keep consistent with the twsa of grace mascons solution 2 2 2 the global mascons mass concentration blocks mascons are another form of gravity field basis function the mascons make the implementation of geophysical constraints much easier and is a much more rigorous approach when comparing with the standard spherical harmonic approach of empirical post processing filtering watkins et al 2015b wiese landerer and watkins 2016 the jpl mascons jpl m and csr mascons csr m solutions were provided at 0 5 at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land in this study we compared the grace twsa solutions during 2003 to 2016 2 3 the gldas data in this study we used auxiliary hydrological fluxes data from the global land data assimilation system gldas in order to analyze the water balance of the basin for comparison purpose the gldas includes four different models i e community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic and noah rodell et al 2004 the data products of version 2 of the gldas gldas 2 noah model were used in this study gldas 2 noah model contain thirty six parameters and we used eleven of them for analyzing water balance in this study which is listed in table 2 these parameters are the components for calculating terrestrial water storage and water balance the precipitation and air temperature in the gldas product listed in table 2 are forcing data from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global data assimilation system gdas atmospheric analysis fields the disaggregated global precipitation climatology project gpcp precipitation fields and the air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modeling system agrmet radiation fields the precipitation is 3 hour averaged precipitation rate unit kg m 2 s 1 and the surface runoff and subsurface runoff are 3 hour accumulated unit kg m 2 per 3 hour monthly precipitation was calculated via the following formula 1 p p 3600 sec 3 hour 8 3 h o u r d a y d a y s where p is the monthly total precipitation unit kg m 2 or mm p is the 3 hour averaged precipitation rate and days is the number of days in the month monthly accumulation runoff was calculated based on the formula 2 q q 8 3 h o u r d a y d a y s where q is the monthly accumulation runoff unit kg m 2 or mm and days is the number of days in the month to keep consistent with the footprints of grace twsa products the monthly average or accumulations were calculated for the mid month 2 4 the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei database is based on monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia the spei is calculated based on a climatic water balance and can be used for determining the onset duration and magnitude of drought conditions with respect to normal conditions in a variety of natural and managed systems such as crops ecosystems rivers water resources vicente serrano beguería and lópez moreno 2010 the spei can identify different drought types because its calculation is on a multi temporal scales basis 1 12 months or longer short time scales are mainly related to soil water content and river discharge medium to long time scales are related to reservoir storages and variations in groundwater storage we used the spei series from 1 to 12 months during 2003 to 2015 to investigate the response of twsa to the climate fluctuation of dry and wet in the basin the spei dataset was downloaded from the global spei database https spei csic es database html 3 methods 3 1 time series decomposition and trend estimations the twsa outputs reveal the monthly variations of total water storage therefore seasonality should be firstly removed from the original twsa series in order to estimate twsa trends andrew guan and batelaan 2017a the seasonal trend decomposition using local regression stl proposed by cleveland et al cleveland et al 1990 was reported to be a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series lu 2003 scanlon et al 2018 in this study we used the stl to decompose twsa monthly time series key to the stl approach is local regression loess smoothing the loess fits a smoothed series x j to an input time series x j x tj where tj is a sequence of discrete sampling times the smoothed value at each point j is given by the value at time tj of a polynomial fitted to the sampled values of x over a window j q j q with decreasing weight assigned to points in this window as their distance from point j increases the stl consists of outer and inner loops with a sequence of smoothing operator loess and generates three components from a time series cleveland and cleveland 1990 3 s total s long t e r m s seasonal s residual the long term signal is then detrended into linear and non linear trends by fitting a least squares linear regression and a cubic spline regression respectively the residuals reflect sub seasonal signal and noise details of stl decomposition approach can be found in related publications cleveland et al 1990 lu 2003 the twsa trends as a result refer to the linear trends estimated from the long term deseasonalized twsa after stl analysis moreover we also implemented the mann kendall trend test m k test to identify trends from deseasonalized twsa series m k test proposed by mann 1945 and furtherly studied by kendall 1955 is a nonparametric and robust test for identifying a trend in a time series it has been widely used to detect trends in hydrologic data hamed 2008 details about the m k test can be found in yue pilon and cavadias 2002 shadmani marofi and roknian 2012 3 2 centroid analysis spatial centroid analysis is a spatial analysis approach from geographical information science that commonly used for tracking the spatial evolution of population economy and urban extent in a region bracken and martin 1989 small pozzi and elvidge 2005 in this study we implement the weighted centroid to analyze the movements of centroid of annual terrestrial water storage anomalies in the basin firstly we scale the annual average twsa into a standard range of 0 1 0 4 stws a i atws a i a t w s a min atws a max a t w s a min where stws a i is the scaled annual averaged twsa of each pixel i is the year i 2003 2004 2005 2016 atws a i is annual averaged twsa of each pixel the atws a max and atws a min stand for the maximum and minimum annual averaged twsa in the period from 2003 to 2016 then the stwsa is used as weights to calculate weighted centroid of twsa 5 c i k w i l o n i i k w i i k w i l a t i i k w i where c indicates coordinates of the weighted centroid w i is the stwsa at pixel ith k is the number of pixels in the basin lo n i and la t i are the longitude and latitude of the ith pixel s center point to quantify the shift of the weighted centroids distance and bearing of the centroid of each year relative to the previous year were calculated based on the following equations 6 d i 2 r sin 1 si n 2 la t i l a t i 1 2 cos la t i 1 cos la t i s i n 2 lo n i l o n i 1 2 7 θ i a t a n 2 sin l o n i l o n i 1 cos la t i cos l a t i 1 s i n la t i s i n la t i 1 cos la t i c o s lo n i l o n i 1 where d i θ i are the distance and bearing of i th year relative to the i 1 th year la t i lo n i are the latitude and longitude of the centroid of i th year and la t i 1 and lo n i 1 are the latitude and longitude of the centroid of i 1 th year i 2004 2005 2006 2016 3 3 water storage equations terrestrial total water storage tws includes five components 8 tws snws cws sws sms gws where snws is snow water storage cws is canopy water storage sws is surface water storage sms is soil moisture storage and gws is groundwater storage the gws and sws are not simulated in gldas noah model we computed gldas tws by using the sum of soil moisture in all layers sms accumulated snow snws and plant canopy surface water cws in this study according to the data interpretation in the document for nasa gldas version 2 data products beaudoing 2018 and the gldas twsa is calculated by using the same way as grace twsa subtracting average value of 2004 to 2009 from original time series 9 twsa i t w s i tws where twsa i is the gldas twsa at i th month tw s i is the gldas tws at i th month and tws is the mean value of gldas tws from january 2004 to december 2009 as was confirmed by previous researches the noah model exhibits a better correlation with grace twsa than clm mosaic and vic model leblanc et al 2009 grippa et al 2011 yang et al 2013 and the noah is also recommended by jet propulsion laboratory who released the grace products to be used for comparison studies jpl 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 grace twsa trends 4 1 1 temporal twsa trends from different grace solutions fig 2 shows the comparison of deseasonalized twsa linear trends between five grace solutions dashed black line is the standard deviation of five grace twsa solutions in lancang river basin the jpl m solution may give an overestimated decreasing trend relative to other twsa solutions which would lead to high variations of the grace twsa solutions the twsa of lancang river basin tends to increase from 2006 to 2008 and then decrease in a fluctuation way the twsa generally decreased slightly during the entire period in lancang river basin the twsa time series in mekong river basin derived from five grace solutions are highly consistent according to fig 2 overall the twsa have no significant trends specifically the twsa increased during 2005 to 2009 and drastically declined from 2009 to 2010 and then experienced an increasing trend during 2010 to 2012 after then declined in a fluctuation way during september 2009 to may 2010 southeast china and the mekong river basin experienced a severe drought event the drought event process is consistent with the continuous decline of precipitation anomalies from 2009 to 2010 in both lancang river and mekong river basin son et al 2012 zeng li and li 2012 table 3 summarizes the trends of twsa derived from different grace solutions there are discrepancies of twsa trends between different grace solutions although slight decreasing trends were detected by jpl and csr solution in lancang river basin the m k test results however show that three ssh based grace solutions jpl csr and gfz all reveal no significant change during the period two mascons based solutions show that lancang river basin experienced a significant decreasing trend in twsa in addition the decreasing magnitude revealed by jpl m slope 2 45 km3 yr is much larger than that of csr m slope 0 64 km3 yr the twsa trends derived by using stl method from five grace solutions are all equal to 0 0 km3 yr in mekong river basin the m k test results for jpl gfz and csr m are decreasing and are non trend for csr and jpl m in summary the lancang river basin experienced a slight decreasing trend of twsa during 2003 to 2016 the twsa trends revealed by five different grace solutions range within 2 45 to 0 km3 yr generally there is no significant trend of twsa detected by the grace solutions during the investigated period in mekong river basin but the twsa shows dramatic temporal fluctuations 4 1 2 spatial pattern of grace twsa trends fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of twsa trends derived from different grace solutions it can be found that upstream of lancang river basin witnessed a significant water storage loss during the entire period this intensive decreasing trends of twsa can be observed in the indian monsoon dominated himalayas this regional trend are partly caused by the rising temperature and decreased precipitation in the himalayas yao et al 2012 in addition since groundwater depletion in northwest nw india remained profound rodell velicogna and famiglietti 2009 chen et al 2014 lapworth et al 2015 leakage from the nw india probably is another major source causing the reductions in the lancang river basin for mekong river basin no significant trends were observed from grace twsa in most parts of the basin except for jpl m solution and slight twsa increasing trends can be found around the borderof two basins where is dominated by forest cover and is of low human activity intensity the downstream of mekong river basin according to fig 1 c is the main agricultural area in the region although the agriculture is largely rain fed räsänen and kummu 2013 increasing irrigation area and the under developed irrigation management efficiency probably lead to the slight water storage loss in the downstream of mekong river basin molle foran and kakonen 2012 on basin average level five solutions produced more consistent twsa trends in mekong river basin than in lancang river basin according to the correlation maps and scatter matrix maps in fig 4 as revealed in previous studies grace measurement uncertainties and discrepancies between solutions increase with decreasing basin size scanlon et al 2016a moreover it can be inferred from fig 4 a and fig 4 c that the jpl m solution produced deviated twsa series compared with other four solutions in lancang river basin this finding is also consistent with previous finding that decreasing and increasing twsa trends of jpl m solution are larger than those from csr m globally scanlon et al 2018 discrepancies between temporal series of twsa in lancang river basin may partly relate to the different processing approaches of the grace solutions and the jpl m used global 3 equal area spherical cap mascons while the csr m used a collection of hexagonal tiles with about 1 equatorial longitudinal distance watkins et al 2015a scanlon et al 2016b this would lead to more differences along longitude another reason may be the uncertainties from the glacial isostatic adjustment gia the jpl m solution used a gia correction model differing from other four solutions a wahr and zhong 2012 purcell tregoning and dehecq 2016 and uncertainties still exist due to leakage from outside the region and glacier melt in the upstream of lancang river basin despite correction by provided scaling factors 4 2 comparison between grace and gldas figs 5 and 6 depict comparisons of grace twsa and the hydrological fluxes anomalies in lancang and mekong river basin the hydrological fluxes anomalies were obtained by using the same way as grace twsa subtracting average value of 2004 to 2009 from original time series swenson 2012 save bettadpur and tapley 2016 in this section the grace twsa was calculated by averaging the twsa from grace solutions of csr jpl gfz and csr m considering twsa from jpl m shows notable deviations from twsa of other four solutions according to the above analysis the total runoff is the sum of surface and subsurface runoff and the soil moisture is the sum of soil moisture of all the soil profiles table 4 presents the temporal trends of grace twsa and the twsa estimated from terrestrial water storage equation based on gldas components gldas twsa eq 9 air temperature anomalies tempa evapotranspiration anomalies evapa precipitation anomalies prcpa total runoff anomalies roa and soil moisture anomalies sma as shown in fig 5 and table 4 the air temperature in lancang river basin experienced statistically significant increasing at a trend of 0 087 yr during the period the precipitation declined with a trend of 0 074 cm yr but was not statistically significant the evapotranspiration and runoff both did not have significant temporal trends the decreasing of precipitation and increasing of temperature may partly contribute the reduction of terrestrial water storage in lancang river basin severe drought attacked southwest china during 2009 2010 which is revealed from the reduction of precipitation runoff anomalies from 2009 to 2011 fig 5 c e southwest china is a typical karst region where soils are shallow and highly permeable therefore the soil moisture is susceptible to water stress yang et al 2019 the sma experienced a significant decline with a trend of 0 481 cm yr according the trend estimations from gldas soil moisture layers table 4 the temporal characteristic of sma is agreed with that of grace twsa in mekong river basin there is no significant change of precipitation during the investigation period so is the surface runoff the tempa increased with a trend of 0 095 c yr marginally larger than that of lancang river basin consequently the evapotranspiration has an increasing trend of 0 148 cm yr the soil water content in mekong river basin according to fig 6 e and table 4 did not present significant trends fig 7 a and b present the comparison of temporal series between grace twsa and gldas twsa the trends of gldas twsa are consistent with those of grace twsa specifically the gldas twsa in lancang river basin declined with a trend of 0 471 cm yr according to table 4 while there was no significant trend of gldas twsa in mekong river basin however the gldas noah model overestimates twsa declining trend relative to the grace twsa the gldas twsa is well correlated to grace twsa with high correlation coefficients cc 0 96 in lancang river basin and cc 0 88 in mekong river basin see table 5 as shown in figs 5 and 6 terrestrial water storage variations have lagged correlations with hydrological fluxes to quantify those lagged correlations we calculated lagged correlation coefficients between twsa and hydrological flux anomalies and the results are shown in fig 8 generally the gldas twsa is best correlated with grace twsa at no time lag in lancang river basin and grace twsa and gldas twsa show a one month lag in mekong river basin the lagged correlations of soil moisture with grace are almost same as those of gldas twsa because soil moisture is the main components of tws in this study this implies that the sum of soil moisture through all profiles can well indicate the temporal change of terrestrial water storage in lancang mekong river basin specifically twsa and precipitation anomalies show a two month lag in both lancang cc 0 89 and mekong river basin cc 0 92 this indicates that twsa in the lancang mekong river basin peak about two months later than the corresponding peak of precipitation highest correlations between grace twsa and roa are obtained at one month lag in the lancang cc 0 82 and mekong river basin cc 0 86 and highest correlations between grace twsa and evapa obtained a lag of one month in lancang river basin cc 0 86 and two month lag in mekong river basin cc 0 80 the hydrologic fluxes always peak earlier than twsa in lancang mekong river basin and this is most conspicuous in the case of precipitation the lagged response of twsa towards hydrologic fluxes is expected because the water that falls as precipitation may travel vertically and horizontally before contributing to groundwaters part of precipitation is lost from basin as runoff or evaporation only the part which infiltrates into soil become soil moisture and some of the water may infiltrate deeper recharging groundwater aquifers and the entire cycle would take long periods sala lauenroth and parton 1992 milly 1994 andrew guan and batelaan 2017b this can also explain the reason why soil moisture anomalies are highly correlated with twsa in a basin current gldas models do not simulate surface water storage sws and groundwater storage gws which are important components of land water storage as is pointed by yang et al 2013 and sun chen and donges 2015 gldas s inability to involve surface water and groundwater components is one of the main points that lead to poor coherence between grace and gldas twsa the discrepancies are especially remarkable in arid regions where groundwater dynamics contribute more to tws changes than soil moisture and the regions with heavily groundwater withdrawals yang et al 2013 this doesn t fit in lancang mekong river basin therefore soil moisture anomalies well correlated to grace twsa and gldas and grace result generally have good agreements in the basin however some seasonal discrepancies between grace and gldas results can be seen from fig 7 great seasonal variation of precipitation is one of the main climatic characteristics in lancang mekong river basin we further compared the differences between grace and gldas results during dry and wet season to address those discrepancies the wet season in lancang mekong river basin lasts from may to october and november to april is the dry season table 6 lists the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and mean error me between grace twsa and gldas twsa in lancang and mekong river basin in dry and wet season respectively the cc between grace and gldas in wet season of mekong river basin is the lowest cc 0 87 compared with those in dry season cc 0 94 and in lancang river basin the lower cc between grace and gldas in mekong river basin is mainly attributed to the low cc values in wet season in mekong river basin gldas twsa underestimates grace twsa in dry season me 8 88 cm and overestimates grace twsa in wet season me 6 05 cm the large mean error of gldas twsa against grace twsa in mekong river basin may attributed to the missing of sws and gws components in gldas model precipitation has stronger intra annual variability in mekong river basin than lancang river basin and surface water and groundwater variations are more vulnerable in regions with frequent extreme climatic events yang et al 2013 but according to the trends of twsa in the basin the twsa trends estimated from gldas closely match with grace twsa trends hence missing of sws and gws may lead to larger magnitude of gldas twsa than grace twsa in mekong river basin but these differences did not raise significant differences in trend estimation of twsa between grace and gldas in the basin 4 3 centroid footprints of twsa above analysis reveal the temporal patterns and trends of terrestrial water storage and the hydrological fluxes in lancang mekong river basin at basin average level in addition quantification of the spatial pattern of twsa would furtherly help to understand the water cycle in the basin the weighted centroids of twsa as well as the precipitation anomalies were calculated based on the method presented in section 3 2 attempting to outline the water balance drifts in the basin and its connection with precipitation the centroids of the twsa in lancang mekong river basin of each year are displayed in fig 9 the centroids swing alongside the central line of the lancang mekong river basin the locations of the grace twsa centroids are concentrated around the boundary of upstream lancang river and downstream mekong river the grace twsa centroids are in mekong river basin except for individual years such a distribution pattern is consistent with the weighted centroids of gldas twsa and precipitation anomalies fig 9 f and g similarity between centroids of gldas and precipitation anomalies is expected because the glads model is driven by climate data since uncertainties come from scaling factors and large grid scales 100 300 km would lead to the spatial variations of centroid in single year of each solution it is not proper to interpret centroids with individual years therefore to quantify the movements of the weighted centroids we calculated the moving direction and distance of twsa in each year relative to the previous year the results are shown in fig 10 in general the centroids move back and forth alongside northwest around 150 and southeast direction 30 20 in a period of one to two years according to fig 10 a the centroids of prcpa show a similar motion regularity with those of twsa the distances between weighted centroids of prcpa and twsa also show same pattern during period as can be seen from fig 10 b suggesting that balance of water reserves between upstream and downstream of the basin is related to the centroid shift of annual precipitation this is consistent with previous findings that long term variability in river flow and floods of the basin is likely linked to the climatic factors delgado apel and merz 2010 ward et al 2010 delgado merz and apel 2012 räsänen and kummu 2013 4 4 relationships between twsa and spei since water storage variations could be governed by dual effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration further analysis was conducted by introducing the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei is able to identify duration and magnitude of drought conditions with respect to normal conditions at different temporal scales fig 11 plots the time series of grace twsa and spei at scale of 3 6 9 and 12 month higher correlation can be found between middle long scales spei and grace twsa and the spei better correlates with twsa in mekong basin than in the lancang river basin the droughts indicated by spei during 2004 to 2006 2010 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016 are consistent with the declining twsa in those periods in mekong river basin fig 12 presents changes of correlation coefficients between spei of 1 to 12 month scales and the twsa in each sub basin we divided the whole period into two sub periods 2003 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016 correlation coefficients for each period in dry and wet season were calculated respectively for the 2003 to 2009 period the twsa and spei have comparable correlations in lancang and mekong basin in wet season the correlation increases with spei scale and peaks at 7 month scale for lancang river basin and 10 month scale for mekong river basin for the 2010 to 2016 period the correlation between twsa and spei show much different pattern with that of the 2003 to 2009 period in general the twsa and spei have higher correlations in mekong than in lancang basin in both dry and wet seasons suggesting that climatic condition has a significant impact on the dynamics of tws in mekong basin and the impacts are more notable in long term period than in short term as the correlation coefficient peaks at 8 month scale in dry season and 6 month scales in wet season this is rational because long term drought condition can change the water storage in sub surface and groundwater levels vicente serrano et al 2010 however low correlation coefficient can be found in lancang river basin in this period and a sharp decline of correlation can be seen between twsa and spei beyond 5 month scale of dry season in lancang river basin this implies that the water storage dynamics in dry season have weaker correlations with middle long term drought condition in lancang river basin than in the mekong river basin in the 2010 to 2016 period one possible influence may come from the water management in lancang river basin following the completion of the first major dams in the basin around 2010 large reservoirs hold water during wet season and release it during the dry season altering the dynamics of tws and maintaining groundwater levels this can be beneficial for basin flood and drought management pokhrel et al 2012 felfelani et al 2017 several studies have examined the potential impacts of existing and planned dams in the lancang mekong river basin räsänen et al 2012 cochrane arias and piman 2014 li et al 2017 however it is still largely unclear of how water storage dynamics will response to the mixed influence of climate change and growing human impacts pokhrel et al 2018 existing hydropower projects according to previous studies have already caused impacts throughout the lancang mekong river basin stone 2016 in recent years countries in the downstream have also been accelerating dam construction those hydropower projects have potential to well manage drought in dry season and flood in wet season benefiting the agriculture and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people however negative influences on the ecosystem in the basin and surrounding areas could not be neglected in particular dams in the basin are expected to alter sediment transport and block fish migration irreversibly seriously threating riverine ecosystem grumbine and xu 2011 enref 21 keskinen et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 winemiller et al 2016 this study is expected to provide a new perspective for investigating potential impacts of dams upon water storage dynamics and their correlations with climatic condition in the lancang mekong river basin since major hydropower projects only went into operation in recent years and some large dams under construction are expected to be completed in the next decade their impacts and long term implications for water resources in the basin need further investigation by considering multiple sources from satellites ground based observations and land surface and hydrology models 5 conclusion monitoring water resources across international river basins is important not only for understanding climate change impacts and global water cycle but also for water resources management and development in transboundary river basins in this paper we analyzed the terrestrial water storage variations in the lancang mekong river basin which is distributed among six countries in south asia the twsa trends in upstream basin lancang river basin and the downstream mekong river basin were both examined based on grace observations and land surface model outputs we implemented a spatial weighted centroid concept from geographical information science to analyze the spatial evolution pattern of the tws dynamics in the basin additionally a multi scalar drought index was introduced to examine the correlation between tws dynamics and climatic variations at different temporal scales in summary during the investigated period 2003 2016 the grace twsa in lancang river basin experienced decreasing trends ranging from 2 45 to 0 km3 yr revealed by five different grace solutions and intensive water storage loss existed in the upstream of the lancang river basin there are no significant trends of twsa detected by grace solutions in mekong river basin five grace solutions are more consistent in the mekong river basin than in the lancang river basin and the twsa from jpl m solution is deviated from other four solutions especially in lancang river basin the gldas noah twsa are well correlated to grace results in the basins and water storage trends estimated from gldas have good agreement with those of grace results although the magnitude of gldas twsa is larger than grace twsa in mekong river basin this discrepancy dose not lead to significant differences in twsa trends estimation shift pattern of annual twsa centroids in lancang mekong river basin are generally consistent with the moving of precipitation anomalies centroids dynamics of terrestrial water storage in the lancang mekong river basin are largely governed by middle to long temporal scale 6 12 months climatic conditions and their correlations are higher in wet season than dry season however low connections between terrestrial water storage trends and precipitation evapotranspiration condition were found in lancang river basin during dry season especially in the 2010 2016 period in general the correlation between twsa and spei arised after 2010 relative to the 2003 2009 period in mekong river basin but decreased in lancang river basin this diversification between upstream and downstream probably is partly related to the water management of hydropower projects but more reliable conclusion is expected since additional investigations considering more observations and experiments of

5949,measurement of regional water resource variations is significant for understanding water cycle and water management this is especially true for transboundary river basins this study investigated the terrestrial water storage dynamics of the lancang mekong river basin which has a total area of 795 000 km2 and distributed between six countries in southeast asia based on the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites and the global land data assimilation system gldas model a spatial weighted centroid analysis concept from geographical information science was introduced to track the movement of terrestrial water storage centroid of the basin and the response of terrestrial water storage dynamics to climate variations throughout the basin was examined by quantifying the correlations of twsa with a multi scalar drought index results show that during 2003 to 2016 the upstream basin lancang river basin experienced slight decreasing trends ranging from 2 45 to 0 km3 yr revealed by five different grace solutions and the downstream basin mekong river basin generally did not express statistically significant trends five grace solutions are more consistent in the downstream basin than the upstream basin and the mascons based twsa processed at jet propulsion laboratory jpl produced quite different results with the other four solutions generally there are good correlations between grace observations and gldas model the twsa is 1 2 month lagged correlated with precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff anomalies because water from precipitation may take a long period to loss from evapotranspiration and infiltrate into the soil in general water storage dynamics are closely correlated with climatic dry and wet conditions at middle long periods 6 12 months in the basin and the correlation coefficients in wet season are generally higher than those in dry season however a different pattern was found since 2010 in the 2010 2016 period correlations between twsa and the multi scalar drought index in lancang river basin reduced relative to the 2003 2009 period but became stronger in mekong river basin after 2009 the results of this study highlight the differentiation of water storage dynamics response to the climate variation between upstream and downstream of lancang mekong basin in the period 2010 2016 and the possibility of examining basin storage disturbed by human activities in the basin keywords grace terrestrial water storage lancang mekong river basin water balance 1 introduction understanding the dynamics of land water storage is significant for regional water resource management food security and climate variability research seyoum and milewski 2017 yang et al 2017 this is especially true for the international rivers kuenzer et al 2012 voss et al 2013 the transboundary lancang mekong river which has a length of about 4 350 km is the longest river in southeast asia the 7th longest in asia and the 12th longest in the world the lancang mekong river basin has a total area of 795 000 km2 and is distributed between six countries the river feeds over 60 million people in china cambodia thailand vietnam lao pdr and myanmar given the relatively high frequency of severe drought in the lower mekong basin potential water resources conflicts often arise among the six countries haddeland lettenmaier and skaugen 2006 adamson and bird 2010 thus monitoring the water resources balance in the lancang mekong river basin is significant to the regional water and food security and is beneficial for addressing the comprehensive cooperation in management and development of water and related resources in the basin hydrological stations can provide multiple information on hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation surface runoff soil water content and groundwater level and play an important role in water resource monitoring and hydrological simulations rodell 2004 tang et al 2010 rodell et al 2011 but stations only can provide hydrological information at point scales water reserve balance over large basin could not be surveyed based on the distributive stations another challenge is the lack of available hydrological records for the transboundary region inconsistent monitoring combined with a lack of data transparency and accessibility is a problem that plagues water managers around the globe voss et al 2013 and the lancang mekong river basin is no exception although some observation data exist the datasets are often government controlled and access to complete datasets requires the permission and cooperation of multi party government this limitation is especially serious in a river basin that covers so many countries consequently few observation based studies of water budget have been conducted throughout the lancang mekong river basin despite its importance pokhrel et al 2018 feng et al 2019 various global land surface models lsms and global hydrological and water resource models ghwrms also model hydrological variables such as streamflow soil water content schewe et al 2014 bierkens 2015 but the model outputs do not include all water reservoirs and reliability of the outputs still remain questionable scanlon et al 2018 especially in regions that lack ground based observations remote sensing techniques have provided valuable resources for monitoring natural resources variabilities over large scales on the earth tucker 1980 gao 1996 surface water resource can be detected by deriving water body or snow glacier covered area from optical remote sensing images immerzeel et al 2009 feng et al 2016 microwave based remote sensing sensors can measure rainfall intensity and water content in swallow soil layer ulaby batlivala and dobson 1978 njoku et al 2002 zhan et al 2006 huffman et al 2007 because microwave sensors are not subject to weather conditions they can produce precipitation and soil moisture data products at high temporal resolutions those products are widely used for drought and flood monitoring and extreme weather events detection rhee im and carbone 2010 du et al 2013 nicolai shaw et al 2017 however neither optical nor microwave sensors can obtain variations on regional terrestrial water storage balance because root zone soil water content and groundwater storage which are main components of terrestrial water storage tws cannot be estimated from optical or microwave sensors terrestrial water storage is defined as sum of the water stored on land surface e g rivers and lakes in snow water in soil profile and ground water rodell and famiglietti 1999 rodell et al 2004 changes of tws can reflect water storage dynamics from land surface to the deep soil and groundwater providing a comprehensive information on water storage changes landerer and swenson 2012 seyoum and milewski 2017 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites which were launched in 2002 have provided global monthly land or terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa by measuring the earth s gravity field changes landerer and swenson 2012 the twsa includes water storage anomalies of five components snow water canopy water surface water soil water and groundwater the grace twsa can reveal total water availability variations for both storage and flux at continental scales xie et al 2016 seyoum and milewski 2017 and have provided more direct estimations than global hydrological models and land surface models in twsa the released versions of grace twsa products include spherical harmonic data versions and mascon data versions the spherical harmonic data versions are processed by using a standard spherical harmonic approach landerer and swenson 2012 and the mascon data versions are produced by using mass concentration blocks mascons scanlon et al 2016b three different processing centers which are the geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz the center for space research at university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl release different solutions by using different approaches and parameters these grace twsa solutions produced using different approaches by different centers have been widely used for the evaluation of changes in water resources over regions and basins tang et al 2010 huang et al 2012 scanlon longuevergne and long 2012 dieng et al 2015 mo et al 2016 yao et al 2016 such products have been proved to have great potential in monitoring tws balance in response to droughts and floods the object of this study is to provide an overview of the total water storage dynamics in the lancang mekong river basin during 2003 to 2016 to evaluate the variabilities between different grace solutions and compare terrestrial water storage balance from grace and global land data assimilation system gldas model the specific issues addressed through this study include three aspects 1 how has the terrestrial water storage changed during the past years in upstream and downstream regions in the lancang mekong river basin 2 what are the differences of the twsa trends deriving from grace solutions and land surface model 3 what is the relation between water storage dynamics and climate condition in the basin 2 study area and data resources 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river originates from the northeast slope of tanggula mountain in china it is called lancang river in china and the mekong river when flowing into the indo china peninsula the total length of the lancang mekong river is 4 350 km and the total area is 795 000 km2 the lancang mekong river is the most important transnational water system in asia and the twelfth longest river in the world the main source of the river is zhaqu originated from zaduo county yushu tibetan autonomous prefecture qinghai province china it flows through china laos myanmar thailand cambodia and vietnam and flows into south china sea in ho chi minh city vietnam the river basin can be divided into two parts the upper basin in china where the river is called lancang and the lower mekong basin from yunnan china downstream to the south china sea fig 1 note that in this study to differentiate the upstream and downstream we refer to the upstream as lancang and downstream as mekong table 1 summarizes the basin area in each country although the river length in china is 2162 km accounting for about 44 of the total length of the river the basin area of lancang river in china is only 20 of the total area of the whole basin because of the narrow basin pattern of mountainous areas in southwest china the lancang mekong river basin is located in the center of the tropical monsoon regions in asia the whole basin is dominated by a single wet season flow peak in august and september and the rainy season is from may to october from november to april of the following year is the dry season as is shown in fig 1 b the average annual rainfall in the basin which is derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm product huffman et al 2010 increases from less than 1000 mm in northeastern thailand to more than 4000 mm in the mountainous areas in southern laos cambodia and vietnam fig 1 a shows terrain elevation map of the basin and the digital elevation model dem data is from nasa s shuttle radar topography mission strm fig 1 c shows the land cover map of the basin the land cover data is from the european space agency esa globcover version 2 3 2009 300 m resolution land cover map http due esrin esa int page globcover php as shown in fig 1 a and c lancang river basin is dominated by mountainous area and the plain areas of mekong river basin are dominated by croplands according to mekong river commission rodriguez 2015 rice is the main crop in the basin and over 10 million hectares of cultivated land is dedicated to rice production approximately 60 of the lancang mekong river basin s population is fed by agriculture but the total basin area is not heavily irrigated fig 1 c because rain fed cultivation is the most prevalent irrigation method throughout the basin 2 2 grace data 2 2 1 the rl05 spherical harmonics the grace satellites provide global monthly total water storage anomalies by measuring earth s gravity field changes the standard spherical harmonic approach ssh is the standard for the first decade of grace observations landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 the official grace science data system continuously released monthly grace solution for three different processing centers geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz center for space research at university of texas austin csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl these three solutions used different parameter choices and solution strategies the current solutions are the release 05 gravity field solutions rl05 the three grace terrestrial water storage tws solutions jpl csr and gfz were downloaded from https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the original data were provided at 1 in both latitude and longitude and resampled at 0 5 using nearest neighbor approach to keep consistent with the twsa of grace mascons solution 2 2 2 the global mascons mass concentration blocks mascons are another form of gravity field basis function the mascons make the implementation of geophysical constraints much easier and is a much more rigorous approach when comparing with the standard spherical harmonic approach of empirical post processing filtering watkins et al 2015b wiese landerer and watkins 2016 the jpl mascons jpl m and csr mascons csr m solutions were provided at 0 5 at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land in this study we compared the grace twsa solutions during 2003 to 2016 2 3 the gldas data in this study we used auxiliary hydrological fluxes data from the global land data assimilation system gldas in order to analyze the water balance of the basin for comparison purpose the gldas includes four different models i e community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic mosaic and noah rodell et al 2004 the data products of version 2 of the gldas gldas 2 noah model were used in this study gldas 2 noah model contain thirty six parameters and we used eleven of them for analyzing water balance in this study which is listed in table 2 these parameters are the components for calculating terrestrial water storage and water balance the precipitation and air temperature in the gldas product listed in table 2 are forcing data from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global data assimilation system gdas atmospheric analysis fields the disaggregated global precipitation climatology project gpcp precipitation fields and the air force weather agency s agricultural meteorological modeling system agrmet radiation fields the precipitation is 3 hour averaged precipitation rate unit kg m 2 s 1 and the surface runoff and subsurface runoff are 3 hour accumulated unit kg m 2 per 3 hour monthly precipitation was calculated via the following formula 1 p p 3600 sec 3 hour 8 3 h o u r d a y d a y s where p is the monthly total precipitation unit kg m 2 or mm p is the 3 hour averaged precipitation rate and days is the number of days in the month monthly accumulation runoff was calculated based on the formula 2 q q 8 3 h o u r d a y d a y s where q is the monthly accumulation runoff unit kg m 2 or mm and days is the number of days in the month to keep consistent with the footprints of grace twsa products the monthly average or accumulations were calculated for the mid month 2 4 the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei database is based on monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia the spei is calculated based on a climatic water balance and can be used for determining the onset duration and magnitude of drought conditions with respect to normal conditions in a variety of natural and managed systems such as crops ecosystems rivers water resources vicente serrano beguería and lópez moreno 2010 the spei can identify different drought types because its calculation is on a multi temporal scales basis 1 12 months or longer short time scales are mainly related to soil water content and river discharge medium to long time scales are related to reservoir storages and variations in groundwater storage we used the spei series from 1 to 12 months during 2003 to 2015 to investigate the response of twsa to the climate fluctuation of dry and wet in the basin the spei dataset was downloaded from the global spei database https spei csic es database html 3 methods 3 1 time series decomposition and trend estimations the twsa outputs reveal the monthly variations of total water storage therefore seasonality should be firstly removed from the original twsa series in order to estimate twsa trends andrew guan and batelaan 2017a the seasonal trend decomposition using local regression stl proposed by cleveland et al cleveland et al 1990 was reported to be a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series lu 2003 scanlon et al 2018 in this study we used the stl to decompose twsa monthly time series key to the stl approach is local regression loess smoothing the loess fits a smoothed series x j to an input time series x j x tj where tj is a sequence of discrete sampling times the smoothed value at each point j is given by the value at time tj of a polynomial fitted to the sampled values of x over a window j q j q with decreasing weight assigned to points in this window as their distance from point j increases the stl consists of outer and inner loops with a sequence of smoothing operator loess and generates three components from a time series cleveland and cleveland 1990 3 s total s long t e r m s seasonal s residual the long term signal is then detrended into linear and non linear trends by fitting a least squares linear regression and a cubic spline regression respectively the residuals reflect sub seasonal signal and noise details of stl decomposition approach can be found in related publications cleveland et al 1990 lu 2003 the twsa trends as a result refer to the linear trends estimated from the long term deseasonalized twsa after stl analysis moreover we also implemented the mann kendall trend test m k test to identify trends from deseasonalized twsa series m k test proposed by mann 1945 and furtherly studied by kendall 1955 is a nonparametric and robust test for identifying a trend in a time series it has been widely used to detect trends in hydrologic data hamed 2008 details about the m k test can be found in yue pilon and cavadias 2002 shadmani marofi and roknian 2012 3 2 centroid analysis spatial centroid analysis is a spatial analysis approach from geographical information science that commonly used for tracking the spatial evolution of population economy and urban extent in a region bracken and martin 1989 small pozzi and elvidge 2005 in this study we implement the weighted centroid to analyze the movements of centroid of annual terrestrial water storage anomalies in the basin firstly we scale the annual average twsa into a standard range of 0 1 0 4 stws a i atws a i a t w s a min atws a max a t w s a min where stws a i is the scaled annual averaged twsa of each pixel i is the year i 2003 2004 2005 2016 atws a i is annual averaged twsa of each pixel the atws a max and atws a min stand for the maximum and minimum annual averaged twsa in the period from 2003 to 2016 then the stwsa is used as weights to calculate weighted centroid of twsa 5 c i k w i l o n i i k w i i k w i l a t i i k w i where c indicates coordinates of the weighted centroid w i is the stwsa at pixel ith k is the number of pixels in the basin lo n i and la t i are the longitude and latitude of the ith pixel s center point to quantify the shift of the weighted centroids distance and bearing of the centroid of each year relative to the previous year were calculated based on the following equations 6 d i 2 r sin 1 si n 2 la t i l a t i 1 2 cos la t i 1 cos la t i s i n 2 lo n i l o n i 1 2 7 θ i a t a n 2 sin l o n i l o n i 1 cos la t i cos l a t i 1 s i n la t i s i n la t i 1 cos la t i c o s lo n i l o n i 1 where d i θ i are the distance and bearing of i th year relative to the i 1 th year la t i lo n i are the latitude and longitude of the centroid of i th year and la t i 1 and lo n i 1 are the latitude and longitude of the centroid of i 1 th year i 2004 2005 2006 2016 3 3 water storage equations terrestrial total water storage tws includes five components 8 tws snws cws sws sms gws where snws is snow water storage cws is canopy water storage sws is surface water storage sms is soil moisture storage and gws is groundwater storage the gws and sws are not simulated in gldas noah model we computed gldas tws by using the sum of soil moisture in all layers sms accumulated snow snws and plant canopy surface water cws in this study according to the data interpretation in the document for nasa gldas version 2 data products beaudoing 2018 and the gldas twsa is calculated by using the same way as grace twsa subtracting average value of 2004 to 2009 from original time series 9 twsa i t w s i tws where twsa i is the gldas twsa at i th month tw s i is the gldas tws at i th month and tws is the mean value of gldas tws from january 2004 to december 2009 as was confirmed by previous researches the noah model exhibits a better correlation with grace twsa than clm mosaic and vic model leblanc et al 2009 grippa et al 2011 yang et al 2013 and the noah is also recommended by jet propulsion laboratory who released the grace products to be used for comparison studies jpl 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 grace twsa trends 4 1 1 temporal twsa trends from different grace solutions fig 2 shows the comparison of deseasonalized twsa linear trends between five grace solutions dashed black line is the standard deviation of five grace twsa solutions in lancang river basin the jpl m solution may give an overestimated decreasing trend relative to other twsa solutions which would lead to high variations of the grace twsa solutions the twsa of lancang river basin tends to increase from 2006 to 2008 and then decrease in a fluctuation way the twsa generally decreased slightly during the entire period in lancang river basin the twsa time series in mekong river basin derived from five grace solutions are highly consistent according to fig 2 overall the twsa have no significant trends specifically the twsa increased during 2005 to 2009 and drastically declined from 2009 to 2010 and then experienced an increasing trend during 2010 to 2012 after then declined in a fluctuation way during september 2009 to may 2010 southeast china and the mekong river basin experienced a severe drought event the drought event process is consistent with the continuous decline of precipitation anomalies from 2009 to 2010 in both lancang river and mekong river basin son et al 2012 zeng li and li 2012 table 3 summarizes the trends of twsa derived from different grace solutions there are discrepancies of twsa trends between different grace solutions although slight decreasing trends were detected by jpl and csr solution in lancang river basin the m k test results however show that three ssh based grace solutions jpl csr and gfz all reveal no significant change during the period two mascons based solutions show that lancang river basin experienced a significant decreasing trend in twsa in addition the decreasing magnitude revealed by jpl m slope 2 45 km3 yr is much larger than that of csr m slope 0 64 km3 yr the twsa trends derived by using stl method from five grace solutions are all equal to 0 0 km3 yr in mekong river basin the m k test results for jpl gfz and csr m are decreasing and are non trend for csr and jpl m in summary the lancang river basin experienced a slight decreasing trend of twsa during 2003 to 2016 the twsa trends revealed by five different grace solutions range within 2 45 to 0 km3 yr generally there is no significant trend of twsa detected by the grace solutions during the investigated period in mekong river basin but the twsa shows dramatic temporal fluctuations 4 1 2 spatial pattern of grace twsa trends fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of twsa trends derived from different grace solutions it can be found that upstream of lancang river basin witnessed a significant water storage loss during the entire period this intensive decreasing trends of twsa can be observed in the indian monsoon dominated himalayas this regional trend are partly caused by the rising temperature and decreased precipitation in the himalayas yao et al 2012 in addition since groundwater depletion in northwest nw india remained profound rodell velicogna and famiglietti 2009 chen et al 2014 lapworth et al 2015 leakage from the nw india probably is another major source causing the reductions in the lancang river basin for mekong river basin no significant trends were observed from grace twsa in most parts of the basin except for jpl m solution and slight twsa increasing trends can be found around the borderof two basins where is dominated by forest cover and is of low human activity intensity the downstream of mekong river basin according to fig 1 c is the main agricultural area in the region although the agriculture is largely rain fed räsänen and kummu 2013 increasing irrigation area and the under developed irrigation management efficiency probably lead to the slight water storage loss in the downstream of mekong river basin molle foran and kakonen 2012 on basin average level five solutions produced more consistent twsa trends in mekong river basin than in lancang river basin according to the correlation maps and scatter matrix maps in fig 4 as revealed in previous studies grace measurement uncertainties and discrepancies between solutions increase with decreasing basin size scanlon et al 2016a moreover it can be inferred from fig 4 a and fig 4 c that the jpl m solution produced deviated twsa series compared with other four solutions in lancang river basin this finding is also consistent with previous finding that decreasing and increasing twsa trends of jpl m solution are larger than those from csr m globally scanlon et al 2018 discrepancies between temporal series of twsa in lancang river basin may partly relate to the different processing approaches of the grace solutions and the jpl m used global 3 equal area spherical cap mascons while the csr m used a collection of hexagonal tiles with about 1 equatorial longitudinal distance watkins et al 2015a scanlon et al 2016b this would lead to more differences along longitude another reason may be the uncertainties from the glacial isostatic adjustment gia the jpl m solution used a gia correction model differing from other four solutions a wahr and zhong 2012 purcell tregoning and dehecq 2016 and uncertainties still exist due to leakage from outside the region and glacier melt in the upstream of lancang river basin despite correction by provided scaling factors 4 2 comparison between grace and gldas figs 5 and 6 depict comparisons of grace twsa and the hydrological fluxes anomalies in lancang and mekong river basin the hydrological fluxes anomalies were obtained by using the same way as grace twsa subtracting average value of 2004 to 2009 from original time series swenson 2012 save bettadpur and tapley 2016 in this section the grace twsa was calculated by averaging the twsa from grace solutions of csr jpl gfz and csr m considering twsa from jpl m shows notable deviations from twsa of other four solutions according to the above analysis the total runoff is the sum of surface and subsurface runoff and the soil moisture is the sum of soil moisture of all the soil profiles table 4 presents the temporal trends of grace twsa and the twsa estimated from terrestrial water storage equation based on gldas components gldas twsa eq 9 air temperature anomalies tempa evapotranspiration anomalies evapa precipitation anomalies prcpa total runoff anomalies roa and soil moisture anomalies sma as shown in fig 5 and table 4 the air temperature in lancang river basin experienced statistically significant increasing at a trend of 0 087 yr during the period the precipitation declined with a trend of 0 074 cm yr but was not statistically significant the evapotranspiration and runoff both did not have significant temporal trends the decreasing of precipitation and increasing of temperature may partly contribute the reduction of terrestrial water storage in lancang river basin severe drought attacked southwest china during 2009 2010 which is revealed from the reduction of precipitation runoff anomalies from 2009 to 2011 fig 5 c e southwest china is a typical karst region where soils are shallow and highly permeable therefore the soil moisture is susceptible to water stress yang et al 2019 the sma experienced a significant decline with a trend of 0 481 cm yr according the trend estimations from gldas soil moisture layers table 4 the temporal characteristic of sma is agreed with that of grace twsa in mekong river basin there is no significant change of precipitation during the investigation period so is the surface runoff the tempa increased with a trend of 0 095 c yr marginally larger than that of lancang river basin consequently the evapotranspiration has an increasing trend of 0 148 cm yr the soil water content in mekong river basin according to fig 6 e and table 4 did not present significant trends fig 7 a and b present the comparison of temporal series between grace twsa and gldas twsa the trends of gldas twsa are consistent with those of grace twsa specifically the gldas twsa in lancang river basin declined with a trend of 0 471 cm yr according to table 4 while there was no significant trend of gldas twsa in mekong river basin however the gldas noah model overestimates twsa declining trend relative to the grace twsa the gldas twsa is well correlated to grace twsa with high correlation coefficients cc 0 96 in lancang river basin and cc 0 88 in mekong river basin see table 5 as shown in figs 5 and 6 terrestrial water storage variations have lagged correlations with hydrological fluxes to quantify those lagged correlations we calculated lagged correlation coefficients between twsa and hydrological flux anomalies and the results are shown in fig 8 generally the gldas twsa is best correlated with grace twsa at no time lag in lancang river basin and grace twsa and gldas twsa show a one month lag in mekong river basin the lagged correlations of soil moisture with grace are almost same as those of gldas twsa because soil moisture is the main components of tws in this study this implies that the sum of soil moisture through all profiles can well indicate the temporal change of terrestrial water storage in lancang mekong river basin specifically twsa and precipitation anomalies show a two month lag in both lancang cc 0 89 and mekong river basin cc 0 92 this indicates that twsa in the lancang mekong river basin peak about two months later than the corresponding peak of precipitation highest correlations between grace twsa and roa are obtained at one month lag in the lancang cc 0 82 and mekong river basin cc 0 86 and highest correlations between grace twsa and evapa obtained a lag of one month in lancang river basin cc 0 86 and two month lag in mekong river basin cc 0 80 the hydrologic fluxes always peak earlier than twsa in lancang mekong river basin and this is most conspicuous in the case of precipitation the lagged response of twsa towards hydrologic fluxes is expected because the water that falls as precipitation may travel vertically and horizontally before contributing to groundwaters part of precipitation is lost from basin as runoff or evaporation only the part which infiltrates into soil become soil moisture and some of the water may infiltrate deeper recharging groundwater aquifers and the entire cycle would take long periods sala lauenroth and parton 1992 milly 1994 andrew guan and batelaan 2017b this can also explain the reason why soil moisture anomalies are highly correlated with twsa in a basin current gldas models do not simulate surface water storage sws and groundwater storage gws which are important components of land water storage as is pointed by yang et al 2013 and sun chen and donges 2015 gldas s inability to involve surface water and groundwater components is one of the main points that lead to poor coherence between grace and gldas twsa the discrepancies are especially remarkable in arid regions where groundwater dynamics contribute more to tws changes than soil moisture and the regions with heavily groundwater withdrawals yang et al 2013 this doesn t fit in lancang mekong river basin therefore soil moisture anomalies well correlated to grace twsa and gldas and grace result generally have good agreements in the basin however some seasonal discrepancies between grace and gldas results can be seen from fig 7 great seasonal variation of precipitation is one of the main climatic characteristics in lancang mekong river basin we further compared the differences between grace and gldas results during dry and wet season to address those discrepancies the wet season in lancang mekong river basin lasts from may to october and november to april is the dry season table 6 lists the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and mean error me between grace twsa and gldas twsa in lancang and mekong river basin in dry and wet season respectively the cc between grace and gldas in wet season of mekong river basin is the lowest cc 0 87 compared with those in dry season cc 0 94 and in lancang river basin the lower cc between grace and gldas in mekong river basin is mainly attributed to the low cc values in wet season in mekong river basin gldas twsa underestimates grace twsa in dry season me 8 88 cm and overestimates grace twsa in wet season me 6 05 cm the large mean error of gldas twsa against grace twsa in mekong river basin may attributed to the missing of sws and gws components in gldas model precipitation has stronger intra annual variability in mekong river basin than lancang river basin and surface water and groundwater variations are more vulnerable in regions with frequent extreme climatic events yang et al 2013 but according to the trends of twsa in the basin the twsa trends estimated from gldas closely match with grace twsa trends hence missing of sws and gws may lead to larger magnitude of gldas twsa than grace twsa in mekong river basin but these differences did not raise significant differences in trend estimation of twsa between grace and gldas in the basin 4 3 centroid footprints of twsa above analysis reveal the temporal patterns and trends of terrestrial water storage and the hydrological fluxes in lancang mekong river basin at basin average level in addition quantification of the spatial pattern of twsa would furtherly help to understand the water cycle in the basin the weighted centroids of twsa as well as the precipitation anomalies were calculated based on the method presented in section 3 2 attempting to outline the water balance drifts in the basin and its connection with precipitation the centroids of the twsa in lancang mekong river basin of each year are displayed in fig 9 the centroids swing alongside the central line of the lancang mekong river basin the locations of the grace twsa centroids are concentrated around the boundary of upstream lancang river and downstream mekong river the grace twsa centroids are in mekong river basin except for individual years such a distribution pattern is consistent with the weighted centroids of gldas twsa and precipitation anomalies fig 9 f and g similarity between centroids of gldas and precipitation anomalies is expected because the glads model is driven by climate data since uncertainties come from scaling factors and large grid scales 100 300 km would lead to the spatial variations of centroid in single year of each solution it is not proper to interpret centroids with individual years therefore to quantify the movements of the weighted centroids we calculated the moving direction and distance of twsa in each year relative to the previous year the results are shown in fig 10 in general the centroids move back and forth alongside northwest around 150 and southeast direction 30 20 in a period of one to two years according to fig 10 a the centroids of prcpa show a similar motion regularity with those of twsa the distances between weighted centroids of prcpa and twsa also show same pattern during period as can be seen from fig 10 b suggesting that balance of water reserves between upstream and downstream of the basin is related to the centroid shift of annual precipitation this is consistent with previous findings that long term variability in river flow and floods of the basin is likely linked to the climatic factors delgado apel and merz 2010 ward et al 2010 delgado merz and apel 2012 räsänen and kummu 2013 4 4 relationships between twsa and spei since water storage variations could be governed by dual effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration further analysis was conducted by introducing the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spei is able to identify duration and magnitude of drought conditions with respect to normal conditions at different temporal scales fig 11 plots the time series of grace twsa and spei at scale of 3 6 9 and 12 month higher correlation can be found between middle long scales spei and grace twsa and the spei better correlates with twsa in mekong basin than in the lancang river basin the droughts indicated by spei during 2004 to 2006 2010 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016 are consistent with the declining twsa in those periods in mekong river basin fig 12 presents changes of correlation coefficients between spei of 1 to 12 month scales and the twsa in each sub basin we divided the whole period into two sub periods 2003 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016 correlation coefficients for each period in dry and wet season were calculated respectively for the 2003 to 2009 period the twsa and spei have comparable correlations in lancang and mekong basin in wet season the correlation increases with spei scale and peaks at 7 month scale for lancang river basin and 10 month scale for mekong river basin for the 2010 to 2016 period the correlation between twsa and spei show much different pattern with that of the 2003 to 2009 period in general the twsa and spei have higher correlations in mekong than in lancang basin in both dry and wet seasons suggesting that climatic condition has a significant impact on the dynamics of tws in mekong basin and the impacts are more notable in long term period than in short term as the correlation coefficient peaks at 8 month scale in dry season and 6 month scales in wet season this is rational because long term drought condition can change the water storage in sub surface and groundwater levels vicente serrano et al 2010 however low correlation coefficient can be found in lancang river basin in this period and a sharp decline of correlation can be seen between twsa and spei beyond 5 month scale of dry season in lancang river basin this implies that the water storage dynamics in dry season have weaker correlations with middle long term drought condition in lancang river basin than in the mekong river basin in the 2010 to 2016 period one possible influence may come from the water management in lancang river basin following the completion of the first major dams in the basin around 2010 large reservoirs hold water during wet season and release it during the dry season altering the dynamics of tws and maintaining groundwater levels this can be beneficial for basin flood and drought management pokhrel et al 2012 felfelani et al 2017 several studies have examined the potential impacts of existing and planned dams in the lancang mekong river basin räsänen et al 2012 cochrane arias and piman 2014 li et al 2017 however it is still largely unclear of how water storage dynamics will response to the mixed influence of climate change and growing human impacts pokhrel et al 2018 existing hydropower projects according to previous studies have already caused impacts throughout the lancang mekong river basin stone 2016 in recent years countries in the downstream have also been accelerating dam construction those hydropower projects have potential to well manage drought in dry season and flood in wet season benefiting the agriculture and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people however negative influences on the ecosystem in the basin and surrounding areas could not be neglected in particular dams in the basin are expected to alter sediment transport and block fish migration irreversibly seriously threating riverine ecosystem grumbine and xu 2011 enref 21 keskinen et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 winemiller et al 2016 this study is expected to provide a new perspective for investigating potential impacts of dams upon water storage dynamics and their correlations with climatic condition in the lancang mekong river basin since major hydropower projects only went into operation in recent years and some large dams under construction are expected to be completed in the next decade their impacts and long term implications for water resources in the basin need further investigation by considering multiple sources from satellites ground based observations and land surface and hydrology models 5 conclusion monitoring water resources across international river basins is important not only for understanding climate change impacts and global water cycle but also for water resources management and development in transboundary river basins in this paper we analyzed the terrestrial water storage variations in the lancang mekong river basin which is distributed among six countries in south asia the twsa trends in upstream basin lancang river basin and the downstream mekong river basin were both examined based on grace observations and land surface model outputs we implemented a spatial weighted centroid concept from geographical information science to analyze the spatial evolution pattern of the tws dynamics in the basin additionally a multi scalar drought index was introduced to examine the correlation between tws dynamics and climatic variations at different temporal scales in summary during the investigated period 2003 2016 the grace twsa in lancang river basin experienced decreasing trends ranging from 2 45 to 0 km3 yr revealed by five different grace solutions and intensive water storage loss existed in the upstream of the lancang river basin there are no significant trends of twsa detected by grace solutions in mekong river basin five grace solutions are more consistent in the mekong river basin than in the lancang river basin and the twsa from jpl m solution is deviated from other four solutions especially in lancang river basin the gldas noah twsa are well correlated to grace results in the basins and water storage trends estimated from gldas have good agreement with those of grace results although the magnitude of gldas twsa is larger than grace twsa in mekong river basin this discrepancy dose not lead to significant differences in twsa trends estimation shift pattern of annual twsa centroids in lancang mekong river basin are generally consistent with the moving of precipitation anomalies centroids dynamics of terrestrial water storage in the lancang mekong river basin are largely governed by middle to long temporal scale 6 12 months climatic conditions and their correlations are higher in wet season than dry season however low connections between terrestrial water storage trends and precipitation evapotranspiration condition were found in lancang river basin during dry season especially in the 2010 2016 period in general the correlation between twsa and spei arised after 2010 relative to the 2003 2009 period in mekong river basin but decreased in lancang river basin this diversification between upstream and downstream probably is partly related to the water management of hydropower projects but more reliable conclusion is expected since additional investigations considering more observations and experiments of
