14880,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are high profile environmental contaminants many having long persistence in the environment and widespread presence in humans and wildlife following phase out of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in north america and restrictions in europe pfas replacements are now widely found in the environment while liquid chromatography lc mass spectrometry ms is typically used for measurement much of the pfas is missed to more comprehensively capture organic fluorine we developed sensitive and robust methods using activated carbon adsorption solid phase extraction and combustion ion chromatography cic to measure total organic fluorine tof in industrial wastewaters river water and air two extraction techniques adsorbable organic fluorine aof and extractable organic fluorine eof were optimized and compared using 39 different pfas including replacements such as genx and perfluorobutanesulfonate our aof method achieves 46 112 and 87 recovery for individual pfas and pfas mixtures respectively with 0 5 µg l limit of detection lod for a 50 ml sample volume and a 0 3 μg l lod for a 500 ml sample volume our eof method achieves 72 99 and 91 recovery for individual pfas and pfas mixtures respectively with 0 2 µg l lod for a 500 ml sample volume and 0 1 μg l lod for 1200 ml in addition to 39 anionic pfas two zwitterionic pfas and two neutral pfas were evaluated using the optimized tof methods substantially higher tof values were measured in industrial wastewater river water and air samples compared to lc ms ms demonstrating how tof methods provided a more comprehensive measurement of the total pfas present capturing known and unknown organic fluorine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

pfas are of interest because most have long persistence in the environment and widespread presence in humans and wildlife evich et al 2022 wang et al 2017 bach et al 2017 buck et al 2011 d agostino et al 2017 houde et al 2006 armitage et al 2009 schultz et al 2004 giesy et al 2002 pfas have been used in many products since the 1950s including food packaging nonstick cooking pans electronics carpets fabrics paints adhesives personal care products and firefighting foams richardson and ternes 2022 more than 8000 unique pfas structures have been identified and that number is likely to continue to grow as more are discovered including transformation products and metabolites from parent compounds manufactured evich et al 2022 studies have linked pfas to adverse effects including decreased birth weight testicular and kidney cancer and thyroid dysfunction ankley et al 2021 fenton et al 2021 lau et al 2007 coperchini et al 2017 apelberg et al 2007 the two most studied pfos and pfoa are phased out of products in north america and are restricted in europe under the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach program european chemical agency 2020 buck et al 2011 u s epa 2000 2006 pfas replacements including genx and perfluorobutane sulfonate are now found in the environment including drinking water sources sun et al 2016 mccord et al 2019 strynar et al 2015 richardson and ternes 2022 li et al 2022 lc ms is the most popular tool for measuring pfas schultz et al 2004 mccord et al 2019 higgins et al 2005 but this is limited to those with available standards and analytical methods thus much of the organic fluorine present can be missed for a more comprehensive measure of pfas contamination tof can be used cic is a popular technology for capturing tof wagner et al 2013 han et al 2021 u s epa 2022 germany din 2022 aro et al 2021 as well as total organic chlorine tocl bromine tobr and iodine toi allen et al 2022 cuthbertson et al 2019 kimura et al 2011 smith et al 2010 li et al 2011 sayess et al 2017 cic methods involve sample extraction concentration combustion collection of generated gasses in an aqueous absorbing solution and analysis of resulting anions by ion chromatography ic in this way organic fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are extracted and converted into inorganic fluoride chloride bromide and iodide which are measured by ic for tof previous extraction methods include eof and aof which differ in how samples are extracted eof uses solid phase extraction spe with a solid stationary phase and aof uses an activated carbon ac column both methods effectively extract and concentrate organic fluorine while removing inorganic fluorine from aqueous and other samples such as sludge food packaging and cosmetics us epa 2022 germany din 2022 wagner et al 2013 willach et al 2016 bransma et al 2019 miyake et al 2007 han et al 2021 yeung et al 2009 kaiser et al 2021 schultes et al 2018 analytes extracted with either aof or eof methods can be quantified for tof using cic other tof total fluorine quantitative methods include the total oxidizable precursor top assay mcdonough et al 2019 particle induced gamma ray emission spectroscopy pige ritter et al 2017 schultes et al 2019 instrumental neutron activation analysis inaa schultes et al 2019 and 19f nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy mcdonough et al 2019 however each has issues for tof analysis for example because the top assay selects only for compounds that can be oxidized into target pfas it will miss newer fluorinated compounds like hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da and dodecafluoro 3h 4 8 dioxanoate adona that either do not oxidize or do not oxidize into familiar perfluoroalkyl acids mcdonough et al 2019 also because the top assay relies on reversed phase lc short chain compounds not retained by traditional lc columns are lost pige is a surface analysis technique that uses an accelerated beam of protons to excite 19f nuclei which emit gamma rays proportional to the number of fluorine atoms however pige does not allow inorganic fluorine to be distinguished from organic fluorine mcdonough et al 2019 ritter et al 2017 inaa is another nuclear technique recently used to measure total fluorine in biological environmental and food packaging samples schultes et al 2019 however it cannot distinguish between inorganic and organic fluorine and suffers from interferences with aluminum finally 19f nmr can be used to quantify tof by integrating multiple organic fluorine peaks with the addition of structural information and the ability to distinguish between inorganic and organic fluorine but it is not often applied to water due to high detection limits 10 µg l for 100 ml water samples mcdonough et al 2019 camdzic et al 2021 a recent comparison of cic pige and inaa showed lowest detection limits for cic in measuring total fluorine in food packaging schultes et al 2019 the u s environmental protecting agency epa recently published a draft method for aof epa method 1621 with method detection limits of 2 4 µg l us epa 2022 and the german institute for standardization registered association recently published a method for aof with method detection limits of 2 0 µg l germany din 2022 however this is likely not low enough to capture most environmental levels of pfas including river water quantified in this study earlier this year a new cic method reported 0 3 µg l detection limits for aof using custom packed ac columns and 300 ml sample volumes han et al 2021 while this offered lower detection limits there were still aspects that could be improved to further optimize performance cic is limited in the inability to distinguish between organic and inorganic fluorine so we chose to focus on optimizing analyte extraction methods aof and eof for higher percent recoveries availability of extraction materials and removal of inorganic fluorine we report a new tof method with improved recovery detection limits and quantity of pfas studied 39 total to our knowledge this is the first study to optimize and directly compare aof and eof methods for tof using an extensive group of 43 pfas standards table s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and water quality river water congaree river columbia sc was collected and spiked with stock solutions containing 39 pfas to evaluate aof and eof methods process wastewater and air samples extracted in methanol using impingers were collected from a pfas manufacturing facility along with nearby impacted river water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles filtered 0 22 µm using glass fiber filters and stored at 3 4⁰c until extraction and analysis filtration can lower pfas recovery but is necessary to remove non dissolved nom so glass fiber filters were chosen for the highest percent recovery when compared to other filter materials similar to epa method 533 after filtration sample bottles were rinsed with ultrapure water and passed through the filter filters were not rinsed with methanol since methanol has been shown to decrease the recovery of pfoa by 7 28 lath et al 2019 water samples were analyzed for ph dissolved organic carbon doc inorganic

of 400 and 200 ml min were used respectively through the furnace ultrapure water was supplied to the furnace at 100 µl min to help the dissolution of the hydrogen fluoride from the quartz tube target

scan range and gradient lc program table s4 our method was similar to mccord and strynar 2019 and used several isotopically labeled pfas standards for quantification table s3 2 4 lods and loqs lods were calculated using three times the standard deviation of the procedural blank plus the mean value of the calculated tof n 10 limits of quantification loqs were calculated using nine times the standard deviation of the procedural blank plus mean value of the calculated tof n 10 for comparison of method lod and loqs to previously published methods values were calculated using a sample of ultrapure water containing sodium fluoride as 1 mg l of fluoride since background fluoride cannot be completely removed han et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of aof method several key parameters were evaluated to maximize recovery of organic fluorine minimize co extraction of inorganic fluorine and optimize linearity of calibration curves detection limits precision and accuracy tof in the original samples was calculated using 1 t o f f v f v i b k g where f is the fluoride concentration µg l analyzed by ic vf is the final volume ml of the absorption solution and vi ml is the volume of loaded water sample bkg is the concentration of background fluorine µg l in the procedural blank determined by using ultrapure water with the optimized methods procedural blank signals averaged 81 ng l for aof and 66 ng l for eof lower than previously reported 91 ng l 440 ng l and 6500 ng l han et al 2021 wagner et al 2013 aro et al 2021 tof recovery was calculated using 2 p e r c e n t r e c o v e r y m e a s u r e d t o f t h e o r e t i c a l t o f 100 where measured tof is calculated based on eq 1 and theoretical tof is calculated based on pfas concentrations and fluorine mass fractions in the pfas chemical formulas key parameters tested follow activated carbon choice and pretreatment ic cannot distinguish between combusted organic analytes and inorganic fluorine therefore background inorganic fluorine must be removed as efficiently as possible to minimize an artificially high signal to lower background fluoride the adsorption unit was flushed at ten times the sample volume with ultrapure water until signals were non detect different commercial pre packed ac columns were evaluated for inorganic fluorine impurities table s5 before and after rinsing with 10 ml of 5000 mg l potassium nitrate for this cosa xentaur mitsubishi chemical analytech and enviroscience acs were directly combusted and analyzed for fluoride using ic mitsubishi ac columns had lowest background fluoride and were chosen for further method optimization pre packed ac columns also avoid the need for analysts to pack columns themselves with loose ac han et al 2021 which can introduce error and requires a clean room to avoid sorption of interfering airborne organics onto the fine ac material dressman et al 1983 inorganic fluoride naturally occurs in environmental waters up to 1 mg l fawell et al 2006 and was detected in processed wastewaters at 3 mg l table s2 to lower inorganic fluoride background in real samples an ac pre rinse using 10 ml potassium nitrate 5000 mg l nitrate was evaluated with a solution of ultrapure water containing 5 mg l fluoride to assess the effect of a pre rinse on adsorption of organics a separate experiment was conducted using ultrapure water containing a standard mix of 39 pfas results show that an ac pre rinse can lower inorganic fluoride to non detect however it also lowered organic fluorine recovery by 21 table s6 decreased recovery could be from adsorption of pre rinse ions onto the ac leaving less surface area for organics to adsorb for this reason a pre rinse was omitted from this method sample ph ph adjustment can increase adsorption affinity of organics by making ionic compounds neutral at a ph lower than the pka for example if these compounds are anions or cations they will be more polar and less likely to adsorb to the ac thus passing through and not retained although the pka of many pfas are unknown the main 39 evaluated in this study all contain carboxylic acid and or sulfonic acid hydrophilic head groups as well as electronegative fluorine atoms so it was predicted that a ph 1 is necessary to deionize them a similar approach was taken in published tocl tobr and toi methods e g kimura et al 2011 to evaluate the effect of ph a mix of pfas standards 1 14 table s1 at 50 µg l fluorine in ultrapure water hereafter referred to as the 14 pfas mix which had known high purity at the time of these analyses was adjusted to ph 1 3 5 or 11 using concentrated nitric acid or sodium hydroxide figure s1 because recoveries decreased above ph 3 pfas standards were evaluated at ph 1 and 2 for recovery figure s2 while ph 1 0 improved overall recovery of organic fluorine because the pka of hf is 3 1 theoretically inorganic fluorine f will convert to hf which has higher affinity to ac german din 2020 however a previous aof method also showed that increasing concentrations of acidic nitrate increases the exchange efficiency to displace halogens wagner et al 2013 thus ph adjustment was also evaluated for inorganic fluoride retention pure water containing two realistic fluoride concentrations 0 5 and 1 0 mg l and the 14 pfas mix was either adjusted to ph 1 or not adjusted and evaluated for fluoride retention and fluorine recovery table s7 ph 1 showed lowest levels of fluoride retained as well as highest organic fluorine recovery sample dilution factor and volume larger sample volumes can increase concentration factor and improve detection limits for trace analysis but volumes must also be optimized to prevent breakthrough of analytes kristiana et al 2015 breakthrough and recovery were evaluated for the 14 pfas mix at varying volumes of ultrapure water 50 100 150 250 350 and 500 ml samples were loaded onto two ac columns in series with each ac combusted separately for fluorine decreased recovery and increased breakthrough was observed with increasing sample volumes figure s3a while these experiments only contained organics from spiked pfas real environmental samples would contain additional organics which could increase breakthrough when larger volumes are analyzed previous research has shown that doc levels up to 10 mg l does not negatively impact pfas adsorption han et al 2021 however wastewater used in this study contained 25 250 times more doc table s2 to evaluate a more complex environmental matrix with higher levels of doc ultrapure water containing 100 mg l of suwannee river doc was spiked with the 14 pfas mix at 50 µg l organic fluorine and evaluated for recovery and breakthrough four dilution factors 1 10 50 and 100 at four volumes 50 100 250 and 500 ml were passed through two ac columns in series with each ac combusted individually to monitor breakthrough with increasing volumes figure s3 increased sample volume from 50 to 500 ml shows a trend of increased breakthrough 13 25 to 33 50 and decreased total recovery 82 92 to 62 80 overall a dilution factor of 10 showed the higher percent recovery 79 92 with minimal breakthrough 13 for environmental samples containing 100 mg l of doc a sample dilution factor of 10 and sample volume of 50 ml should be used to minimize breakthrough and increase percent recovery samples containing higher levels of doc e g 1000 mg l might need to be further diluted inorganic fluoride rinse as mentioned previously removing fluoride is key to avoid an artificially high tof measurement although fluoride interferences may be impossible to avoid they can be lessened using an ion exchange rinse after loading the sample onto the ac li et al 2011 samples containing varying concentrations of fluoride in ultrapure water 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 mg l were adsorbed onto the ac then 10 ml of different rinsing solutions sodium nitrate sodium sulfate and ammonium hydroxide were evaluated for fluoride removal figure s4 rinsing solutions were also evaluated for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix ammonium hydroxide showed highest removal of fluoride while recovering the highest percent of organic fluorine figure s5 concentration 0 01 and 0 1 of ammonium hydroxide and volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml were then evaluated for fluoride removal in samples containing 5 mg l fluoride and also for recovery of organic fluorine using the 14 pfas mix ammonium hydroxide removes 30 more inorganic fluoride than a solution containing nitrate although ammonium hydroxide is a basic solution that could desorb acidic target analytes similar to an eof method published by miyake et al a rinsing solution of 0 01 ammonium hydroxide can still achieve recovery of organic fluorine up to 92 in ultrapure water figure s15 fifteen ml of 0 01 ammonium hydroxide was optimal for both pfas recovery and inorganic fluoride removal figure s6 3 2 combustion after extraction acs are placed into ceramic boats for combustion to break the carbon fluorine bonds ceramic boats are pre baked before combustion to minimize carryover pre bake times were evaluated at varying times 0 5 and 10 min using empty ceramic boats and analyzing the absorption solution for fluoride using ic a pre bake time of 10 min lowered background levels to below detection 1 µg l table s8 combustion time was then optimized by directly combusting the 14 pfas mix at two different concentrations 50 and 100 µg l as fluorine in ultrapure water at 5 10 and 15 min combustion times 15 min could not be evaluated due to manufacturer safety settings highest recovery was achieved at 10 and 15 min figure s7 so for a shorter analysis time 10 min was chosen to ensure the most complete combustion for pfas a combustion temperature of 1000 c highest possible temperature due to safety precautions was implemented absorption of effluent gasses after combustion effluent gasses are bubbled into an absorption solution because combustion by product emission studies of pfas compounds are lacking in the ability to comprehensively characterize fluorinated and mixed halogenated organic compounds several different additives in absorption solutions were tested for highest recovery of fluorine if pfas compounds undergo complete combustion off gasses will contain hf in equilibrium with fluoride in an aqueous solution eq 3 and as the concentration of fluoride increases polymerization can occur forming hf2 eq 4 giguere et al 1980 to drive the equilibrium toward fluoride for ic analysis a buffer can be added to the absorption solution miyake et al 2007 3 h f h f 4 hf f h f 2 to oxidize hf2 and in the case that fluorine interacts with other species during combustion such as oxygen to form o2f2 mills 1991 an oxidizing and reducing agent can be added to the absorption solution to convert over oxidized reduced fluorine back to fluoride buffer solutions containing sodium carbonate ammonium hydroxide and sodium phosphate were evaluated at different concentrations 0 1 and 1 mm with and without hydrogen peroxide 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 in 1 mm which can act as both an oxidant and reductant for fluoride recovery also checking potential coelution of buffer ions with fluoride by ic an absorption solution of 1 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer containing 0 01 h2o2 achieved highest recovery figure s8 3 3 ic analysis of fluoride eluent two eluents carbonate and hydroxide were compared for ic analysis using conductivity detection carbonate produces a baseline signal higher than water causing a characteristic water dip at the beginning of the chromatogram near the fluoride peak figure s9a as the analytical and guard columns use and lifetime increases the fluoride peak moves closer to the water dip and can eventually coelute to avoid this the eluent was switched to sodium hydroxide for improved chromatography figure s9b the water dip is not observed with hydroxide eluent because the baseline signal is at a low conductivity similar to water another advantage for hydroxide is that an eluent generator can be used to create an eluent gradient for better separation of peaks without the use of a binary pump system or mixing valve column several ic columns as16 as19 and as20 were evaluated for maximum signal intensity and chromatographic separation of fluoride from potential interfering peaks e g nitrate sulfate phosphate acetate using congaree river water samples and ultrapure water samples both spiked with a mixture of pfas standards extracted using acs and combusted for the two ic columns best for analysis of anions with hydroxide eluent as20 and as16 the as20 column demonstrated complete separation of fluoride from other anions figure s10 3 4 final aof method recovery lod and loq the efficiency of the final aof method was evaluated using 39 individual pfas standards table s1 and a 39 pfas mix as 50 µg l fluorine in ultrapure and river water doc of 2 4 mg l at volumes of 50 ml and 500 ml figs 2 3 for river water containing background aof measured aof was corrected by subtracting the background level recoveries in river water and ultrapure water ranged from 55 98 to 46 112 respectively trends between compounds show a slight decrease in river water compared to ultrapure water likely due to other organics outcompeting pfas for sorption sites on the ac in general branched ether compounds such as pmpa c4 hpfo da c6 and pfeca g c7 yielded somewhat lower recoveries 46 89 and 87 respectively than linear ethers pepa c4 pfo4da c6 and pfo5da c7 with the same number of carbons 65 89 and 92 respectively perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas such as pfba c4 pfbs c4 pfhxa c6 and pfhpa c7 generally yielded higher recoveries 64 90 92 92 respectively when compared to ethers of similar chain length while in general shorter chain pfas compounds yielded lower recoveries compared to longer chain pfas no consistent trend was observed lods of 0 5 and 0 3 µg l and loqs of 1 6 and 1 0 µg l can be achieved with a 50 ml or 500 ml sample respectively 3 5 final optimized aof procedure the final optimized aof method follows fig 1 s11 filter samples with 0 22 µm glass fiber filters analyze filtered samples for background inorganic fluorine and adjust to ph 1 with concentrated nitric acid to increase adsorption of organics onto the ac pass samples 50 ml or 500 ml through two ac columns in series then rinse columns with 15 ml of 0 01 nh4oh to remove inorganic fluorine by anion exchange load two ac columns from each sample into a pre baked 1000⁰c for 5 min ceramic boat and combust at 1000⁰c for 10 min using a mitsubishi quick furnace with automatic solid sampler collect effluent gasses in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes containing 5 ml of 1 mm sodium bicarbonate and 0 01 h2o2 absorption solution using a gas absorption unit weigh centrifuge tubes before and after each run to obtain the exact mass of each sample and analyze the absorption solution for fluoride using ion chromatography with as20 analytical and guard column hydroxide eluent and gradient elution 5 mm from 0 to 5 min 30 mm for 5 15 min and 20 mm for 15 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min 3 6 optimization of eof method spe cartridge selection because many pfas are acidic in nature weak anion exchange wax phases and a universal reverse phase sorbent were evaluated for inorganic fluoride removal and organic fluorine recovery these included wax oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb and a wax containing an extra graphitized carbon black gcb layer to evaluate fluoride removal samples containing 1 mg l fluoride in ultrapure water were loaded onto the cartridges for recovery evaluation ultrapure water was spiked with the 14 pfas mix and loaded onto cartridges phenomenex strata wax gcb cartridges showed highest recovery of organic fluorine table s10 and removed background fluoride to non detect levels the strata gcb material has been shown to strongly adsorb long chain pfas analytes patterson et al 2020 the extra gcb layer in wax gcb spe cartridges eliminates the need for multiple sorbent phases in series or elution in fractions miyake et al 2007 to capture a wide range of pfas pretreatment and conditioning sample ph should be adjusted to increase binding efficiency of pfas to the spe sorbent for weak anion exchange sorbents optimal ph is typically two units above the target analyte s pka of the different phs 3 5 6 9 and 11 evaluated using the 14 pfas mix in ultrapure water ph 5 was optimal figure s12 before loading samples spe cartridges must be conditioned and equilibrated to remove background contamination and prepare the sorbent with a matrix like the sample conditioning and equilibration steps were tested at various volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml using the 14 pfas mix solutions used for conditioning and equilibration were chosen based on results from elution composition experiments discussed below results show that a conditioning and equilibration volume of 10 ml is optimal figures s13 sample volume like aof optimization sample volume was optimized to avoid breakthrough and have sufficient volume for trace analysis samples of the 14 pfas mix were loaded onto cartridges at varying volumes 100 2000 ml based on the amount of sorbent in the cartridge 200 mg 50 mg or 500 mg 50 mg both cartridges showed decreased tof recovery with increasing sample volume figure s14 however the newer large volume spe cartridges 500 mg 50 mg allow increased sample volume 1200 ml which lowers the lod and loq to 0 1 and 0 3 µg l respectively wash step to remove inorganic fluoride an aqueous wash step is employed after sample loading ammonium hydroxide was added to ultrapure water at various concentrations 1 0 0 1 and 0 01 and evaluated for fluoride removal using a 5 mg l inorganic fluoride solution in ultrapure water ammonium hydroxide concentrations of 1 0 and 0 1 offered best f removal figure s15a and were further evaluated at various volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix higher percent ammonium hydroxide proved most effective for fluoride removal but the opposite was true for organic fluorine recovery figure s15b ten ml of 0 1 ammonium hydroxide wash solution yielded highest recovery of organic fluorine 92 drying time spe cartridges must then be dried under nitrogen gas to remove residual water from the wash step before eluting the analytes since pure organic solvent is needed to elute strongly sorbed pfas compounds because drying of the spe cartridges could lead to loss of volatile and semi volatile compounds drying times of 5 10 15 and 20 min were evaluated using the 14 pfas mix a drying time of 10 min yielded highest recovery of organic fluorine 95 figure s16 elution when choosing an organic solvent for elution of organics solvent polarity should be similar to the target analyte polarity because pfas compounds contain polar head groups a strong polar organic solvent should be used thus methanol and acetonitrile were considered with various percent organic to aqueous using the 14 pfas mix to evaluate organic fluorine recovery highest recoveries were obtained with 100 methanol figures s17 adding a counter ion to the eluent can help displace target analytes by selectively replacing the analyte on the sorbent bed to further increase the elution of pfas various concentrations of ammonium hydroxide 0 1 0 3 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 were added to methanol and evaluated for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix highest organic fluorine recovery 89 was achieved with 0 3 ammonium hydroxide in methanol figure s18 a pre soak step and eluent volume were also evaluated a pre soak of the eluent allows longer interaction with the sorbent to displace organics pre soak times 0 1 5 and 10 min and elution volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml were evaluated for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix highest recovery was achieved when cartridges were soaked with elution solution for 5 min and eluted with 10 ml of 0 3 nh4oh in methanol figures s20 s21 cic combustion of organic fluorine absorption of effluent gasses and ic analysis are as described in section 3 2 3 3 however instead of acs placed in ceramic boats spe eluents were directly injected into ceramic boats containing quartz wool for combustion 3 7 final eof method recovery lod and loq the efficiency of the final eof method was evaluated using the 39 individual pfas standards and 39 pfas mix as 50 µg l fluorine in ultrapure and river water doc of 2 4 mg l at volumes of 50 ml and 500 ml figs 5 6 measured eof was corrected by subtracting background eof from river water as observed for aof recoveries for eof also decreased slightly in river water 66 98 compared to ultrapure water 72 99 and shorter chain pfas generally yielded lower recoveries compared to longer chain pfas but no consistent trend was observed branched ether compound pmpa c4 yielded a lower recovery 87 than its linear ether pfca and pfsa counterparts pepa 95 pfba 88 and pfbs 94 however branched ether compounds hpfo da c6 and pfeca g c7 yielded higher recoveries 91 and 89 respectively than their linear ether pfca and pfsa counterparts pfo4da 91 pfhxa 89 pfo5da 86 and pfhpa 88 when compared to the aof trends the difference in the higher recoveries of longer chain pfas could be explained by the extra gcb layer for extraction an lod and loq of 0 2 and 0 5 µg l can be achieved respectively with a 500 ml sample 3 8 final optimized eof procedure the final optimized eof method follows fig 4 filter samples 0 22 µm analyze for background inorganic fluorine and adjust to ph 5 with concentrated nitric acid condition strata wax gcb spe cartridges with 10 ml of 0 3 nh4oh in methanol followed by 10 ml of methanol equilibrate solid phase with 10 ml of ultrapure water at ph 5 samples with a volume of 500 ml are then loaded onto the spe cartridge at a flow rate of 4 ml min wash cartridges with 10 ml of 0 1 nh4oh in ultrapure water and dry for 10 min under nitrogen gas elute organics with 0 3 nh4oh in methanol after the eluent is allowed to soak for 5 min on the cartridge concentrate eluted organics under nitrogen gas from 10 ml to 200 µl directly inject a 100 µl aliquot into a ceramic boat containing quartz wool and combust in the furnace at 1000 c for 10 min collect effluent gasses in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes containing 5 ml of 1 mm sodium bicarbonate and 0 01 h2o2 absorption solution using a gas adsorption unit weigh centrifuge tubes before and after each run to obtain the exact mass of each sample and analyze the absorption solution for fluoride using ion chromatography with as20 analytical and guard column hydroxide eluent and gradient elution 5 mm from 0 to 5 min 30 mm for 5 15 min and 20 mm for 15 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min the method loq is 0 5 µg l 500 ml sample and 0 3 µg l 1200 ml sample 3 9 comparison of aof and eof methods both aof and eof methods can be used to quantify tof in river water and industrial process wastewater compared to aof eof extractions have higher overall recoveries and lower lods and loqs table 1 when considering which technique is suitable for analysis sample volume analysis time sample size availability and cost should also be considered compared to previous methods we report higher recoveries 72 91 for a larger mix of pfas 39 than previously evaluated in ultrapure water and river water highest recoveries for a previous aof method with an lod and loq of 300 and 400 ng l respectively was 64 86 for a mixture of 29 pfas compounds in different water matrices han et al 2021 this method also requires that acs be packed manually in the lab rather than purchasing pre packed acs our optimized aof and eof methods also have much lower lods than the epa draft method for aof 2 4 µg l u s epa draft method 1621 to our knowledge there is no previously published eof method using the strata wax gcb spe cartridges or utilizing a mix containing as many as 39 pfas compounds to further demonstrate optimized eof and aof methods for nonionic fluorotelomer pfas and zwitterionic pfas 4 pfas previously reported in river water were analyzed for tof recovery table 2 mahmoud et al 2009 backe et al 2013 these include 4 2 ftoh 10 2 ftoh 5 3 ftb and n tamp fhxsa each standard was spiked in ultrapure water and congaree river water at 50 µg l organic fluorine and analyzed for tof recovery with the optimized aof and eof cic methods consistent with other classes of pfas compounds in this study eof extractions have higher overall recoveries 46 87 versus aof 44 77 fluorotelomer compounds 4 2 ftoh and 10 2 ftoh have lower recoveries than zwitterionic compounds 5 3 ftb and n tamp fhxsa this can be explained by their non ionic characteristics which could lower their adsorption to ac or a wax polymer the recoveries of the two alcohols 4 2 ftoh and 10 2 ftoh 44 55 are lower than the average recoveries for all other compounds figs 2 3 5 and 6 the recoveries of the two zwitterionic compounds 5 2 ftb and n tamp fhxsa 70 87 are comparable to the recoveries of all other studied compounds figs 2 3 5 and 6 consistent with another aof method published the zwitterionic compounds showed lower aof and eof recoveries 70 87 than pfcas with the same number of carbons e g pfhxa 71 92 and pfoa 92 98 table s9 han et al 2021 3 10 quantification of tof in industrial wastewater air and river water and comparison with lc ms ms industrial wastewater optimized aof and eof methods were applied to four locations at a pfas manufacturing plant for method comparison and validation table 3 industrial wastewater samples were first analyzed without dilution but this led to overloading the ic column since doc levels were greater than 100 mg l thus samples were reprocessed with a dilution of 1 50 and a sample volume of 50 ml for aof analysis and 500 ml for eof analysis to further avoid overloading the column the absorption solution was also diluted by 1 100 before ic analysis the two optimized methods were built for trace analysis however process wastewater had elevated organic fluorine levels therefore dilution may be necessary when analyzing concentrated process wastewaters further experiments should be done using a more complex matrix with a higher doc value e g 1000 mg l comparison of aof and eof results to lc ms ms reveals how target lc ms ms analysis can vastly underestimate the amount of organic fluorine in environmental samples even with an extensive number of pfas measured fig 7 table 3 table s11 while we did not include a broader group of pfas similar to those included in epa method 533 the 14 pfas that we measured were highly relevant to pfas contaminants expected for this particular industrial site for example while lc ms ms detected 14 of the target pfas in industrial wastewater total levels 0 1 150 ng l only provide a partial picture less than 1 6 of the total organic fluorine present air air samples extracted in methanol using an impinger were collected near an industrial plant along a granular activated carbon gac treatment site at the industrial plant samples a represent inlet locations to the gac and samples b represent outlet locations corresponding to the inlet locations table 4 these samples contained an internal standard used for target lc ms ms analysis of hfpo da genx samples were analyzed for background inorganic fluoride and then directly combusted and analyzed for organic fluorine by ic table 4 since the organics were already extracted tof concentrations were calculated for the volume of sample by subtracting the theoretical organic fluorine value of the internal standard results show that inlet locations before gac filters had higher tof than outlet locations following gac filtration table 4 demonstrating substantial removal of organic fluorine from process wastewater hfpo da genx was measured in these extracted air samples table 5 with concentrations converted to concentrations of known organic fluorine using a mass balance approach to determine unknown organic fluorine results again demonstrate how target analysis using lc ms ms can vastly underestimate the amount of organic fluorine in real samples with 99 of organic fluorine unaccounted for by target analysis in these air samples river water tof and target lc ms ms analyses were applied to 8 sampling locations along a river impacted by a pfas manufacturing plant for further method comparison and validation four river water samples contained tof above detection limits table 4 and although target lc ms ms will allow quantification at lower limits aof and eof show values much higher than lc ms ms fig 8 thus as with other real samples tof captures a more comprehensive picture of organic fluorine 4 conclusions two new sensitive methods aof and eof were developed to quantify tof in industrial wastewater river water and air compared to previous methods we achieved higher recoveries for a larger mix of 43 pfas compounds and our aof method utilizes commercial pre packed acs rather than manual packing in a clean room our eof method also utilizes a new type of spe cartridge which combines benefits of a wax phase with gcb to more efficiently extract a wide range of pfas classes with varying size and polarity comparing our optimized aof and eof methods eof showed slightly higher recovery for the 43 pfas standards and lower lods and loqs when considering which technique is most suitable for analysis sample volume analysis time sample size availability and cost should also be considered future research should continue to push lods and loqs lower for tof measurements of river water as they were sometimes below detection as the list of identified pfas compounds continues to expand methods will need to be continually optimized in order to capture as many classes of compounds possible nontarget lc ms ms analysis can also be combined with target analysis in future work to identify unknown organic fluorine especially in samples with high tof such as the industrial wastewater samples for volatile and semi volatile pfas target and nontarget gc ms ms can also be used in future work for identification of organofluorine compounds finally while target lc ms ms can achieve lower loqs for pfas our

out of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in north america and restrictions in europe pfas replacements are now widely found in the environment while liquid chromatography lc mass spectrometry ms is typically used for measurement much of the pfas is missed to more comprehensively capture organic fluorine we developed sensitive and robust methods using activated carbon adsorption solid phase extraction and combustion ion chromatography cic to measure total organic fluorine tof in industrial wastewaters river water and air two extraction techniques adsorbable organic fluorine aof and extractable organic fluorine eof were optimized and compared using 39 different pfas including replacements such as genx and perfluorobutanesulfonate our aof method achieves 46 112

and two neutral pfas were evaluated using the optimized tof methods substantially higher tof values were measured in industrial wastewater river water and air samples compared to lc ms ms

pfas are of interest because most have long persistence in the environment and widespread presence in humans and wildlife evich et al 2022 wang et al 2017 bach et al 2017 buck et al 2011 d agostino et al 2017 houde et al 2006 armitage et al 2009 schultz et al 2004 giesy et al 2002 pfas have been used in many products since the 1950s including food packaging nonstick cooking pans electronics carpets fabrics paints adhesives personal care products and firefighting foams richardson and ternes 2022 more than 8000 unique pfas structures have been identified and that number is likely to continue to grow as more are discovered including transformation products and metabolites from parent compounds manufactured evich et al 2022 studies have linked pfas to adverse effects including decreased birth weight testicular and kidney cancer and thyroid dysfunction ankley et al 2021 fenton et al 2021 lau et al 2007 coperchini et al 2017 apelberg et al 2007 the two most studied pfos and pfoa are phased out of products in north america and are restricted in europe under the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach program european chemical agency 2020 buck et al 2011 u s epa 2000 2006 pfas replacements including genx and perfluorobutane sulfonate are now found in the environment including drinking water sources sun et al 2016 mccord et al 2019 strynar et al 2015 richardson and ternes 2022 li et al 2022 lc ms is the most popular tool for measuring pfas schultz et al 2004 mccord et al 2019 higgins et al 2005 but this is limited to those with available standards and analytical methods thus much of the organic fluorine present can be missed for a more comprehensive measure of pfas contamination tof can be used cic is a popular technology for capturing tof wagner et al 2013 han et al 2021 u s epa 2022 germany din 2022 aro et al 2021 as well as total organic chlorine tocl bromine tobr and iodine toi allen et al 2022 cuthbertson et al 2019 kimura et al 2011 smith et al 2010 li et al 2011 sayess et al 2017 cic methods involve sample extraction concentration combustion collection of generated gasses in an aqueous absorbing solution and analysis of resulting anions by ion chromatography ic in this way organic fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are extracted and converted into inorganic fluoride chloride bromide and iodide which are measured by ic for tof previous extraction methods include eof and aof which differ in how samples are extracted eof uses solid phase extraction spe with a solid stationary phase and aof uses an activated carbon ac column both methods effectively extract and concentrate organic fluorine while removing inorganic fluorine from aqueous and other samples such as sludge food packaging and cosmetics us epa 2022 germany din 2022 wagner et al 2013 willach et al 2016 bransma et al 2019 miyake et al 2007 han et al 2021 yeung et al 2009 kaiser et al 2021 schultes et al 2018 analytes extracted with either aof or eof methods can be quantified for tof using cic other tof total fluorine quantitative methods include the total oxidizable precursor top assay mcdonough et al 2019 particle induced gamma ray emission spectroscopy pige ritter et al 2017 schultes et al 2019 instrumental neutron activation analysis inaa schultes et al 2019 and 19f nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy mcdonough et al 2019 however each has issues for tof analysis for example because the top assay selects only for compounds that can be oxidized into target pfas it will miss newer fluorinated compounds like hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da and dodecafluoro 3h 4 8 dioxanoate adona that either do not oxidize or do not oxidize into familiar perfluoroalkyl acids mcdonough et al 2019 also because the top assay relies on reversed phase lc short chain compounds not retained by traditional lc columns are lost pige is a surface analysis technique that uses an accelerated beam of protons to excite 19f nuclei which emit gamma rays proportional to the number of fluorine atoms however pige does not allow inorganic fluorine to be distinguished from organic fluorine mcdonough et al 2019 ritter et al 2017 inaa is another nuclear technique recently used to measure total fluorine in biological environmental and food packaging samples schultes et al 2019 however it cannot distinguish between inorganic and organic fluorine and suffers from interferences with aluminum finally 19f nmr can be used to quantify tof by integrating multiple organic fluorine peaks with the addition of structural information and the ability to distinguish between inorganic and organic fluorine but it is not often applied to water due to high detection limits 10 µg l for 100 ml water samples mcdonough et al 2019 camdzic et al 2021 a recent comparison of cic pige and inaa showed lowest detection limits for cic in measuring total fluorine in food packaging schultes et al 2019 the u s environmental protecting agency epa recently published a draft method for aof epa method 1621 with method detection limits of 2 4 µg l us epa 2022 and the german institute for standardization registered association recently published a method for aof with method detection limits of 2 0 µg l germany din 2022 however this is likely not low enough to capture most environmental levels of pfas including river water quantified in this study earlier this year a new cic method reported 0 3 µg l detection limits for aof using custom packed ac columns and 300 ml sample volumes han et al 2021 while this offered lower detection limits there were still aspects that could be improved to further optimize performance cic is limited in the inability to distinguish between organic and inorganic fluorine so we chose to focus on optimizing analyte extraction methods aof and eof for higher percent recoveries availability of extraction materials and removal of inorganic fluorine we report a new tof method with improved recovery detection limits and quantity of pfas studied 39 total to our knowledge this is the first study to optimize and directly compare aof and eof methods for tof using an extensive group of 43 pfas standards table s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and water quality river water congaree river columbia sc was collected and spiked with stock solutions containing 39 pfas to evaluate aof and eof methods process wastewater and air samples extracted in methanol using impingers were collected from a pfas manufacturing facility along with nearby impacted river water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles filtered 0 22 µm using glass fiber filters and stored at 3 4⁰c until extraction and analysis filtration can lower pfas recovery but is necessary to remove non dissolved nom so glass fiber filters were chosen for the highest percent recovery when compared to other filter materials similar to epa method 533 after filtration sample bottles were rinsed with ultrapure water and passed through the filter filters were not rinsed with methanol since methanol has been shown to decrease the recovery of pfoa by 7 28 lath et al 2019 water samples were analyzed for ph dissolved organic carbon doc inorganic

standard deviation of the procedural blank plus mean value of the calculated tof n 10 for comparison of method lod and loqs to previously published methods values were calculated using a sample of ultrapure water containing sodium fluoride as 1 mg l of fluoride since background fluoride cannot be completely removed han et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of aof method several key parameters were evaluated to maximize recovery of organic fluorine minimize co extraction of inorganic fluorine and optimize linearity of calibration curves detection limits precision and accuracy tof in the original samples was calculated using 1 t o f f v f v i b k g where f is the fluoride concentration µg l analyzed by ic vf is the final volume ml of the absorption solution and vi ml is the volume of loaded water sample bkg is the concentration of background fluorine µg l in the procedural blank determined by using ultrapure water with the optimized methods procedural blank signals averaged 81 ng l for aof and 66 ng l for eof lower than previously reported 91 ng l 440 ng l and 6500 ng l han et al 2021 wagner et al 2013 aro et al 2021 tof recovery was calculated using 2 p e r c e n t r e c o v e r y m e a s u r e d t o f t h e o r e t i c a l t o f 100 where measured tof is calculated based on eq 1 and theoretical tof is calculated based on pfas concentrations and fluorine mass fractions in the pfas chemical formulas key parameters tested follow activated carbon choice and pretreatment ic cannot distinguish between combusted organic analytes and inorganic fluorine therefore background inorganic fluorine must be removed as efficiently as possible to minimize an artificially high signal to lower background fluoride the adsorption unit was flushed at ten times the sample volume with ultrapure water until signals were non detect different commercial pre packed ac columns were evaluated for inorganic fluorine impurities table s5 before and after rinsing with 10 ml of 5000 mg l potassium nitrate for this cosa xentaur mitsubishi chemical analytech and enviroscience acs were directly combusted and analyzed for fluoride using ic mitsubishi ac columns had lowest background fluoride and were chosen for further method optimization pre packed ac columns also avoid the need for analysts to pack columns themselves with loose ac han et al 2021 which can introduce error and requires a clean room to avoid sorption of interfering airborne organics onto the fine ac material dressman et al 1983 inorganic fluoride naturally occurs in environmental waters up to 1 mg l fawell et al 2006 and was detected in processed wastewaters at 3 mg l table s2 to lower inorganic fluoride background in real samples an ac pre rinse using 10 ml potassium nitrate 5000 mg l nitrate was evaluated with a solution of ultrapure water containing 5 mg l fluoride to assess the effect of a pre rinse on adsorption of organics a separate experiment was conducted using ultrapure water containing a standard mix of 39 pfas results show that an ac pre rinse can lower inorganic fluoride to non detect however it also lowered organic fluorine recovery by 21 table s6 decreased recovery could be from adsorption of pre rinse ions onto the ac leaving less surface area for organics to adsorb for this reason a pre rinse was omitted from this method sample ph ph adjustment can increase adsorption affinity of organics by making ionic compounds neutral at a ph lower than the pka for example if these compounds are anions or cations they will be more polar and less likely to adsorb to the ac thus passing through and not retained although the pka of many pfas are unknown the main 39 evaluated in this study all contain carboxylic acid and or sulfonic acid hydrophilic head groups as well as electronegative fluorine atoms so it was predicted that a ph 1 is necessary to deionize them a similar approach was taken in published tocl tobr and toi methods e g kimura et al 2011 to evaluate the effect of ph a mix of pfas standards 1 14 table s1 at 50 µg l fluorine in ultrapure water hereafter referred to as the 14 pfas mix which had known high purity at the time of these analyses was adjusted to ph 1 3 5 or 11 using concentrated nitric acid or sodium hydroxide figure s1 because recoveries decreased above ph 3 pfas standards were evaluated at ph 1 and 2 for recovery figure s2 while ph 1 0 improved overall recovery of organic fluorine because the pka of hf is 3 1 theoretically inorganic fluorine f will convert to hf which has higher affinity to ac german din 2020 however a previous aof method also showed that increasing concentrations of acidic nitrate increases the exchange efficiency to displace halogens wagner et al 2013 thus ph adjustment was also evaluated for inorganic fluoride retention pure water containing two realistic fluoride concentrations 0 5 and 1 0 mg l and the 14 pfas mix was either adjusted to ph 1 or not adjusted and evaluated for fluoride retention and fluorine recovery table s7 ph 1 showed lowest levels of fluoride retained as well as highest organic fluorine recovery sample dilution factor and volume larger sample volumes can increase concentration factor and improve detection limits for trace analysis but volumes must also be optimized to prevent breakthrough of analytes kristiana et al 2015 breakthrough and recovery were evaluated for the 14 pfas mix at varying volumes of ultrapure water 50 100 150 250 350 and 500 ml samples were loaded onto two ac columns in series with each ac combusted separately for fluorine decreased recovery and increased breakthrough was observed with increasing sample volumes figure s3a while these experiments only contained organics from spiked pfas real environmental samples would contain additional organics which could increase breakthrough when larger volumes are analyzed previous research has shown that doc levels up to 10 mg l does not negatively impact pfas adsorption han et al 2021 however wastewater used in this study contained 25 250 times more doc table s2 to evaluate a more complex environmental matrix with higher levels of doc ultrapure water containing 100 mg l of suwannee river doc was spiked with the 14 pfas mix at 50 µg l organic fluorine and evaluated for recovery and breakthrough four dilution factors 1 10 50 and 100 at four volumes 50 100 250 and 500 ml were passed through two ac columns in series with each ac combusted individually to monitor breakthrough with increasing volumes figure s3 increased sample volume from 50 to 500 ml shows a trend of increased breakthrough 13 25 to 33 50 and decreased total recovery 82 92 to 62 80 overall a dilution factor of 10 showed the higher percent recovery 79 92 with minimal breakthrough 13 for environmental samples containing 100 mg l of doc a sample dilution factor of 10 and sample volume of 50 ml should be used to minimize breakthrough and increase percent recovery samples containing higher levels of doc e g 1000 mg l might need to be further diluted inorganic fluoride rinse as mentioned previously removing fluoride is key to avoid an artificially high tof measurement although fluoride interferences may be impossible to avoid they can be lessened using an ion exchange rinse after loading the sample onto the ac li et al 2011 samples containing varying concentrations of fluoride in ultrapure water 0 5 1 0 and 5 0 mg l were adsorbed onto the ac then 10 ml of different rinsing solutions sodium nitrate sodium sulfate and ammonium hydroxide were evaluated for fluoride removal figure s4 rinsing solutions were also evaluated for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix ammonium hydroxide showed highest removal of fluoride while recovering the highest percent of organic fluorine figure s5 concentration 0 01 and 0 1 of ammonium hydroxide and volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml were then evaluated for fluoride removal in samples containing 5 mg l fluoride and also for recovery of organic fluorine using the 14 pfas mix ammonium hydroxide removes 30 more inorganic fluoride than a solution containing nitrate although ammonium hydroxide is a basic solution that could desorb acidic target analytes similar to an eof method published by miyake et al a rinsing solution of 0 01 ammonium hydroxide can still achieve recovery of organic fluorine up to 92 in ultrapure water figure s15 fifteen ml of 0 01 ammonium hydroxide was optimal for both pfas recovery and inorganic fluoride removal figure s6 3 2 combustion after extraction acs are placed into ceramic boats for combustion to break the carbon fluorine bonds ceramic boats are pre baked before combustion to minimize carryover pre bake times were evaluated at varying times 0 5 and 10 min using empty ceramic boats and analyzing the absorption solution for fluoride using ic a pre bake time of 10 min lowered background levels to below detection 1 µg l table s8 combustion time was then optimized by directly combusting the 14 pfas mix at two different concentrations 50 and 100 µg l as fluorine in ultrapure water at 5 10 and 15 min combustion times 15 min could not be evaluated due to manufacturer safety settings highest recovery was achieved at 10 and 15 min figure s7 so for a shorter analysis time 10 min was chosen to ensure the most complete combustion for pfas a combustion temperature of 1000 c highest possible temperature due to safety precautions was implemented absorption of effluent gasses after combustion effluent gasses are bubbled into an absorption solution because combustion by product emission studies of pfas compounds are lacking in the ability to comprehensively characterize fluorinated and mixed halogenated organic compounds several different additives in absorption solutions were tested for highest recovery of fluorine if pfas compounds undergo complete combustion off gasses will contain hf in equilibrium with fluoride in an aqueous solution eq 3 and as the concentration of fluoride increases polymerization can occur forming hf2 eq 4 giguere et al 1980 to drive the equilibrium toward fluoride for ic analysis a buffer can be added to the absorption solution miyake et al 2007 3 h f h f 4 hf f h f 2 to oxidize hf2 and in the case that fluorine interacts with other species during combustion such as oxygen to form o2f2 mills 1991 an oxidizing and reducing agent can be added to the absorption solution to convert over oxidized reduced fluorine back to fluoride buffer solutions containing sodium carbonate ammonium hydroxide and sodium phosphate were evaluated at different concentrations 0 1 and 1 mm with and without hydrogen peroxide 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 in 1 mm which can act as both an oxidant and reductant for fluoride recovery also checking potential coelution of buffer ions with fluoride by ic an absorption solution of 1 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer containing 0 01 h2o2 achieved highest recovery figure s8 3 3 ic analysis of fluoride eluent two eluents carbonate and hydroxide were compared for ic analysis using conductivity detection carbonate produces a baseline signal higher than water causing a characteristic water dip at the beginning of the chromatogram near the fluoride peak figure s9a as the analytical and guard columns use and lifetime increases the fluoride peak moves closer to the water dip and can eventually coelute to avoid this the eluent was switched to sodium hydroxide for improved chromatography figure s9b the water dip is not observed with hydroxide eluent because the baseline signal is at a low conductivity similar to water another advantage for hydroxide is that an eluent generator can be used to create an eluent gradient for better separation of peaks without the use of a binary pump system or mixing valve column several ic columns as16 as19 and as20 were evaluated for maximum signal intensity and chromatographic separation of fluoride from potential interfering peaks e g nitrate sulfate phosphate acetate using congaree river water samples and ultrapure water samples both spiked with a mixture of pfas standards extracted using acs and combusted for the two ic columns best for analysis of anions with hydroxide eluent as20 and as16 the as20 column demonstrated complete separation of fluoride from other anions figure s10 3 4 final aof method recovery lod and loq the efficiency of the final aof method was evaluated using 39 individual pfas standards table s1 and a 39 pfas mix as 50 µg l fluorine in ultrapure and river water doc of 2 4 mg l at volumes of 50 ml and 500 ml figs 2 3 for river water containing background aof measured aof was corrected by subtracting the background level recoveries in river water and ultrapure water ranged from 55 98 to 46 112 respectively trends between compounds show a slight decrease in river water compared to ultrapure water likely due to other organics outcompeting pfas for sorption sites on the ac in general branched ether compounds such as pmpa c4 hpfo da c6 and pfeca g c7 yielded somewhat lower recoveries 46 89 and 87 respectively than linear ethers pepa c4 pfo4da c6 and pfo5da c7 with the same number of carbons 65 89 and 92 respectively perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas such as pfba c4 pfbs c4 pfhxa c6 and pfhpa c7 generally yielded higher recoveries 64 90 92 92 respectively when compared to ethers of similar chain length while in general shorter chain pfas compounds yielded lower recoveries compared to longer chain pfas no consistent trend was observed lods of 0 5 and 0 3 µg l and loqs of 1 6 and 1 0 µg l can be achieved with a 50 ml or 500 ml sample respectively 3 5 final optimized aof procedure the final optimized aof method follows fig 1 s11 filter samples with 0 22 µm glass fiber filters analyze filtered samples for background inorganic fluorine and adjust to ph 1 with concentrated nitric acid to increase adsorption of organics onto the ac pass samples 50 ml or 500 ml through two ac columns in series then rinse columns with 15 ml of 0 01 nh4oh to remove inorganic fluorine by anion exchange load two ac columns from each sample into a pre baked 1000⁰c for 5 min ceramic boat and combust at 1000⁰c for 10 min using a mitsubishi quick furnace with automatic solid sampler collect effluent gasses in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes containing 5 ml of 1 mm sodium bicarbonate and 0 01 h2o2 absorption solution using a gas absorption unit weigh centrifuge tubes before and after each run to obtain the exact mass of each sample and analyze the absorption solution for fluoride using ion chromatography with as20 analytical and guard column hydroxide eluent and gradient elution 5 mm from 0 to 5 min 30 mm for 5 15 min and 20 mm for 15 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min 3 6 optimization of eof method spe cartridge selection because many pfas are acidic in nature weak anion exchange wax phases and a universal reverse phase sorbent were evaluated for inorganic fluoride removal and organic fluorine recovery these included wax oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb and a wax containing an extra graphitized carbon black gcb layer to evaluate fluoride removal samples containing 1 mg l fluoride in ultrapure water were loaded onto the cartridges for recovery evaluation ultrapure water was spiked with the 14 pfas mix and loaded onto cartridges phenomenex strata wax gcb cartridges showed highest recovery of organic fluorine table s10 and removed background fluoride to non detect levels the strata gcb material has been shown to strongly adsorb long chain pfas analytes patterson et al 2020 the extra gcb layer in wax gcb spe cartridges eliminates the need for multiple sorbent phases in series or elution in fractions miyake et al 2007 to capture a wide range of pfas pretreatment and conditioning sample ph should be adjusted to increase binding efficiency of pfas to the spe sorbent for weak anion exchange sorbents optimal ph is typically two units above the target analyte s pka of the different phs 3 5 6 9 and 11 evaluated using the 14 pfas mix in ultrapure water ph 5 was optimal figure s12 before loading samples spe cartridges must be conditioned and equilibrated to remove background contamination and prepare the sorbent with a matrix like the sample conditioning and equilibration steps were tested at various volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml using the 14 pfas mix solutions used for conditioning and equilibration were chosen based on results from elution composition experiments discussed below results show that a conditioning and equilibration volume of 10 ml is optimal figures s13 sample volume like aof optimization sample volume was optimized to avoid breakthrough and have sufficient volume for trace analysis samples of the 14 pfas mix were loaded onto cartridges at varying volumes 100 2000 ml based on the amount of sorbent in the cartridge 200 mg 50 mg or 500 mg 50 mg both cartridges showed decreased tof recovery with increasing sample volume figure s14 however the newer large volume spe cartridges 500 mg 50 mg allow increased sample volume 1200 ml which lowers the lod and loq to 0 1 and 0 3 µg l respectively wash step to remove inorganic fluoride an aqueous wash step is employed after sample loading ammonium hydroxide was added to ultrapure water at various concentrations 1 0 0 1 and 0 01 and evaluated for fluoride removal using a 5 mg l inorganic fluoride solution in ultrapure water ammonium hydroxide concentrations of 1 0 and 0 1 offered best f removal figure s15a and were further evaluated at various volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix higher percent ammonium hydroxide proved most effective for fluoride removal but the opposite was true for organic fluorine recovery figure s15b ten ml of 0 1 ammonium hydroxide wash solution yielded highest recovery of organic fluorine 92 drying time spe cartridges must then be dried under nitrogen gas to remove residual water from the wash step before eluting the analytes since pure organic solvent is needed to elute strongly sorbed pfas compounds because drying of the spe cartridges could lead to loss of volatile and semi volatile compounds drying times of 5 10 15 and 20 min were evaluated using the 14 pfas mix a drying time of 10 min yielded highest recovery of organic fluorine 95 figure s16 elution when choosing an organic solvent for elution of organics solvent polarity should be similar to the target analyte polarity because pfas compounds contain polar head groups a strong polar organic solvent should be used thus methanol and acetonitrile were considered with various percent organic to aqueous using the 14 pfas mix to evaluate organic fluorine recovery highest recoveries were obtained with 100 methanol figures s17 adding a counter ion to the eluent can help displace target analytes by selectively replacing the analyte on the sorbent bed to further increase the elution of pfas various concentrations of ammonium hydroxide 0 1 0 3 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 were added to methanol and evaluated for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix highest organic fluorine recovery 89 was achieved with 0 3 ammonium hydroxide in methanol figure s18 a pre soak step and eluent volume were also evaluated a pre soak of the eluent allows longer interaction with the sorbent to displace organics pre soak times 0 1 5 and 10 min and elution volumes 5 10 15 and 20 ml were evaluated for organic fluorine recovery using the 14 pfas mix highest recovery was achieved when cartridges were soaked with elution solution for 5 min and eluted with 10 ml of 0 3 nh4oh in methanol figures s20 s21 cic combustion of organic fluorine absorption of effluent gasses and ic analysis are as described in section 3 2 3 3 however instead of acs placed in ceramic boats spe eluents were directly injected into ceramic boats containing quartz wool for combustion 3 7 final eof method recovery lod and loq the efficiency of the final eof method was evaluated using the 39 individual pfas standards and 39 pfas mix as 50 µg l fluorine in ultrapure and river water doc of 2 4 mg l at volumes of 50 ml and 500 ml figs 5 6 measured eof was corrected by subtracting background eof from river water as observed for aof recoveries for eof also decreased slightly in river water 66 98 compared to ultrapure water 72 99 and shorter chain pfas generally yielded lower recoveries compared to longer chain pfas but no consistent trend was observed branched ether compound pmpa c4 yielded a lower recovery 87 than its linear ether pfca and pfsa counterparts pepa 95 pfba 88 and pfbs 94 however branched ether compounds hpfo da c6 and pfeca g c7 yielded higher recoveries 91 and 89 respectively than their linear ether pfca and pfsa counterparts pfo4da 91 pfhxa 89 pfo5da 86 and pfhpa 88 when compared to the aof trends the difference in the higher recoveries of longer chain pfas could be explained by the extra gcb layer for extraction an lod and loq of 0 2 and 0 5 µg l can be achieved respectively with a 500 ml sample 3 8 final optimized eof procedure the final optimized eof method follows fig 4 filter samples 0 22 µm analyze for background inorganic fluorine and adjust to ph 5 with concentrated nitric acid condition strata wax gcb spe cartridges with 10 ml of 0 3 nh4oh in methanol followed by 10 ml of methanol equilibrate solid phase with 10 ml of ultrapure water at ph 5 samples with a volume of 500 ml are then loaded onto the spe cartridge at a flow rate of 4 ml min wash cartridges with 10 ml of 0 1 nh4oh in ultrapure water and dry for 10 min under nitrogen gas elute organics with 0 3 nh4oh in methanol after the eluent is allowed to soak for 5 min on the cartridge concentrate eluted organics under nitrogen gas from 10 ml to 200 µl directly inject a 100 µl aliquot into a ceramic boat containing quartz wool and combust in the furnace at 1000 c for 10 min collect effluent gasses in 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes containing 5 ml of 1 mm sodium bicarbonate and 0 01 h2o2 absorption solution using a gas adsorption unit weigh centrifuge tubes before and after each run to obtain the exact mass of each sample and analyze the absorption solution for fluoride using ion chromatography with as20 analytical and guard column hydroxide eluent and gradient elution 5 mm from 0 to 5 min 30 mm for 5 15 min and 20 mm for 15 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min the method loq is 0 5 µg l 500 ml sample and 0 3 µg l 1200 ml sample 3 9 comparison of aof and eof methods both aof and eof methods can be used to quantify tof in river water and industrial process wastewater compared to aof eof extractions have higher overall recoveries and lower lods and loqs table 1 when considering which technique is suitable for analysis sample volume analysis time sample size availability and cost should also be considered compared to previous methods we report higher recoveries 72 91 for a larger mix of pfas 39 than previously evaluated in ultrapure water and river water highest recoveries for a previous aof method with an lod and loq of 300 and 400 ng l respectively was 64 86 for a mixture of 29 pfas compounds in different water matrices han et al 2021 this method also requires that acs be packed manually in the lab rather than purchasing pre packed acs our optimized aof and eof methods also have much lower lods than the epa draft method for aof 2 4 µg l u s epa draft method 1621 to our knowledge there is no previously published eof method using the strata wax gcb spe cartridges or utilizing a mix containing as many as 39 pfas compounds to further demonstrate optimized eof and aof methods for nonionic fluorotelomer pfas and zwitterionic pfas 4 pfas previously reported in river water were analyzed for tof recovery table 2 mahmoud et al 2009 backe et al 2013 these include 4 2 ftoh 10 2 ftoh 5 3 ftb and n tamp fhxsa each standard was spiked in ultrapure water and congaree river water at 50 µg l organic fluorine and analyzed for tof recovery with the optimized aof and eof cic methods consistent with other classes of pfas compounds in this study eof extractions have higher overall recoveries 46 87 versus aof 44 77 fluorotelomer compounds 4 2 ftoh and 10 2 ftoh have lower recoveries than zwitterionic compounds 5 3 ftb and n tamp fhxsa this can be explained by their non ionic characteristics which could lower their adsorption to ac or a wax polymer the recoveries of the two alcohols 4 2 ftoh and 10 2 ftoh 44 55 are lower than the average recoveries for all other compounds figs 2 3 5 and 6 the recoveries of the two zwitterionic compounds 5 2 ftb and n tamp fhxsa 70 87 are comparable to the recoveries of all other studied compounds figs 2 3 5 and 6 consistent with another aof method published the zwitterionic compounds showed lower aof and eof recoveries 70 87 than pfcas with the same number of carbons e g pfhxa 71 92 and pfoa 92 98 table s9 han et al 2021 3 10 quantification of tof in industrial wastewater air and river water and comparison with lc ms ms industrial wastewater optimized aof and eof methods were applied to four locations at a pfas manufacturing plant for method comparison and validation table 3 industrial wastewater samples were first analyzed without dilution but this led to overloading the ic column since doc levels were greater than 100 mg l thus samples were reprocessed with a dilution of 1 50 and a sample volume of 50 ml for aof analysis and 500 ml for eof analysis to further avoid overloading the column the absorption solution was also diluted by 1 100 before ic analysis the two optimized methods were built for trace analysis however process wastewater had elevated organic fluorine levels therefore dilution may be necessary when analyzing concentrated process wastewaters further experiments should be done using a more complex matrix with a higher doc value e g 1000 mg l comparison of aof and eof results to lc ms ms reveals how target lc ms ms analysis can vastly underestimate the amount of organic fluorine in environmental samples even with an extensive number of pfas measured fig 7 table 3 table s11 while we did not include a broader group of pfas similar to those included in epa method 533 the 14 pfas that we measured were highly relevant to pfas contaminants expected for this particular industrial site for example while lc ms ms detected 14 of the target pfas in industrial wastewater total levels 0 1 150 ng l only provide a partial picture less than 1 6 of the total organic fluorine present air air samples extracted in methanol using an impinger were collected near an industrial plant along a granular activated carbon gac treatment site at the industrial plant samples a represent inlet locations to the gac and samples b represent outlet locations corresponding to the inlet locations table 4 these samples contained an internal standard used for target lc ms ms analysis of hfpo da genx samples were analyzed for background inorganic fluoride and then directly combusted and analyzed for organic fluorine by ic table 4 since the organics were already extracted tof concentrations were calculated for the volume of sample by subtracting the theoretical organic fluorine value of the internal standard results show that inlet locations before gac filters had higher tof than outlet locations following gac filtration table 4 demonstrating substantial removal of organic fluorine from process wastewater hfpo da genx was measured in these extracted air samples table 5 with concentrations converted to concentrations of known organic fluorine using a mass balance approach to determine unknown organic fluorine results again demonstrate how target analysis using lc ms ms can vastly underestimate the amount of organic fluorine in real samples with 99 of organic fluorine unaccounted for by target analysis in these air samples river water tof and target lc ms ms analyses were applied to 8 sampling locations along a river impacted by a pfas manufacturing plant for further method comparison and validation four river water samples contained tof above detection limits table 4 and although target lc ms ms will allow quantification at lower limits aof and eof show values much higher than lc ms ms fig 8 thus as with other real samples tof captures a more comprehensive picture of organic fluorine 4 conclusions two new sensitive methods aof and eof were developed to quantify tof in industrial wastewater river water and air compared to previous methods we achieved higher recoveries for a larger mix of 43 pfas compounds and our aof method utilizes commercial pre packed acs rather than manual packing in a clean room our eof method also utilizes a new type of spe cartridge which combines benefits of a wax phase with gcb to more efficiently extract a wide range of pfas classes with varying size and polarity comparing our optimized aof and eof methods eof showed slightly higher recovery for the 43 pfas standards and lower lods and loqs when considering which technique is most suitable for analysis sample volume analysis time sample size availability and cost should also be considered future research should continue to push lods and loqs lower for tof measurements of river water as they were sometimes below detection as the list of identified pfas compounds continues to expand methods will need to be continually optimized in order to capture as many classes of compounds possible nontarget lc ms ms analysis can also be combined with target analysis in future work to identify unknown organic fluorine especially in samples with high tof such as the industrial wastewater samples for volatile and semi volatile pfas target and nontarget gc ms ms can also be used in future work for identification of organofluorine compounds finally while target lc ms ms can achieve lower loqs for pfas our results demonstrate how tof methods provided a more comprehensive measurement of the total pfas present capturing known and unknown organic fluorine declaration of competing interest the authors

14881,peroxymonosulfate pms activation is a promising technology for water purification but the removal performance of multiple pollutant matrices and the mechanism for reactive species transformation in the heterogeneous catalytic system remain ambiguous herein a novel cufe2o4 diatomite was fabricated for pms activation to achieve efficient removal of typical pesticides uniform distribution of

the degradation pathways and the evolution of intermediates were proposed by hplc qtof ms ms and dft calculations qsar analysis illustrated that the toxicity became lower with the reaction process

abstract keywords cufe2o4 diatomite peroxymonosulfate activation pesticides anti interference capability active species transformation degradation pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although pesticides are indispensable for food security and production their abuse inevitably results in potential water pollution due to surface runoff tudi et al 2021 posing a threat to water security and thus arousing health risks for human beings and other organisms schulz et al 2021 conventional treatments used in water treatment plants are ineffective in removing these compounds due to their low biodegradability fenner et al 2013 hence effective technologies must be explored as alternatives to provide proper degradation of these contaminants either for discharge onto surface water or reuse in crop irrigation many advanced technologies have been explored including photocatalysis xu et al 2021 uv mediated degradation badi et al 2019 he et al 2021 fenton or fenton like processes dong et al 2020b etc in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops based on peroxymonosulfate pms have attracted increasing interest due to their effectiveness in the degradation and the potential for mineralization of refractory contaminants zhao et al 2020 various transition metal ions co2 fe2 cu2 mn2 etc have been studied to activate pms tian et al 2022 but post separation and inevitable secondary contamination inhibit their applications zhong et al 2022 although cobalt based catalysts are considered the most efficient pms activators the high toxicity of cobalt still restricts their application ding et al 2020 to mitigate these problems developing efficient and eco friendly catalysts for activating pms is highly desirable toward this end copper and iron based catalysts are appropriate substitutions because of their low toxicity and economy among which cufe2o4 is an efficient pms activator with stable structure and effortless separation property due to magnetism wei et al 2019 however magnetic cufe2o4 is subject to agglomeration leading to reduced reactive sites and restricted catalytic performance dong et al 2019 hence a suitable strategy for synthesizing highly dispersive cufe2o4 nanoparticles should be explored to improve its catalytic performance diatomite one of the abundant natural minerals is mainly composed of amorphous sio2 diatomite has been widely used as catalyst support template material adsorbent etc ascribed to its 3d porous structure abundant functional groups excellent chemical stability eco friendly and low cost li et al 2018 hence diatomite is a suitable carrier to fabricate well dispersed cufe2o4 nanoparticles to enhance its capability for pms activation an excellent catalytic system should have superior performance and anti interference ability whether caused by internal or external interference the active species in pms based systems mainly consist of hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 electron transfer high valence metal etc wang et al 2018 among these 1o2 has attracted more attention due to its strong selectivity toward electron rich substances and better resistance to water interference zhou et al 2017 an increasing number of studies focus on regularizing catalyst structures or system conditions to selectively generate 1o2 miao et al 2021 however what 1o2 origins from is still blurry hence exploring the origin of 1o2 can help understand the mechanism for the selective generation of 1o2 to improve the anti interference ability of systems further for external interference on the one hand wastewater often contains various pollutants hence except for the study on the effect of coexisting substances inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom the anti interference ability towards wastewater containing multiple pollutants should also be valued moreover the derivation of pollutants and their intermediates should also be investigated to assess the degradation effects on the other hand the effect of dissolved oxygen do on systems should also be a concern although do has a positive effect on some systems zhu et al 2022 low solubility 8 1 8 5 mg l 1 at 25 c and slow diffusion rate of o2 1 96 2 56 10 9 m2 s 1 at 25 c in aqueous solution remain a challenge zhang et al 2019 hence it is desirable if the influence of do on systems is negligible to this end the prerequisite is studying the influence of do on the formation of various reactive oxygen species ros which helps understand how do affects the system in depth in this study a series of cufe2o4 diatomite was fabricated by a facile solvothermal method for efficient pms activation to degrade typical pesticides in water first the physicochemical properties of as prepared cufe2o4 diatomite composites were characterized followed by an evaluation of the catalytic performance and the anti interference capability second the mechanism for pms activation was discussed including the influence of do on the formation of various ros and the origin of 1o2 according to x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis electrochemical analysis electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry epr detection and quenching experiments third the intermediate evolution and degradation pathways of all four target pesticides were revealed by intermediate identification and density functional

evaluated through pesticide contaminants atz dcmu acl and dmt degradation the catalytic experiments were conducted in a 250 ml glass beaker typically a certain mass of the as prepared catalyst was added to 100 ml of 10 mg l 1 atz solution the adsorption between the catalyst and atz was negligible fig s1 hence all experiments were conducted without adsorption desorption equilibrium and were triggered when adding pms into suspension during the reaction 1 5 ml reactant suspension was withdrawn at specific time intervals and filtered through 0 22 μm mixed cellulose ester filters into

cufe2o4 diatomite composite morphologies and microstructures of catalysts are observed in fig 1 pure cufe2o4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 45 170 nm agglomerated to bulk fig 1a pure diatomite looked like a petri dish 32 µm in diameter consisting of two similar valves and a girdle fig 1b chen et al 2016 on which had abundant pores 200 nm in diameter beneficial for the dispersion of cufe2o4 nanoparticles hence when coupling them fig 1c and 1d cufe2o4 nanoparticles could uniformly disperse on diatomite efficiently inhibiting agglomeration the overlapping of cu fe si and o in elemental mappings fig 1g also confirmed the uniform distribution of feco2o4 on diatomite according to the tem image fig 1e interplanar spacings of 0 302 nm 0 254 nm and 0 164 nm were observed corresponding to 220 311 and 511 planes of cufe2o4 jcpds 25 0823 the clear symmetric diffraction rings of 220 311 and 400 planes of cufe2o4 were also observed in the sead pattern fig 1f crystal

511 440 and 533 planes of cufe2o4 jcpds 25 0283 consistent with tem results fig 1 pure diatomite had a robust characteristic peak at 21 8 corresponding to 101 plane of sio2 jcpds 39 1425 fig s2 although the characteristic peak of diatomite was extremely weak in cfd composites ascribed to low addition its intensity gradually strengthened as the diatomite content increased the partially enlarged detail in fig 2a fig 2b displays ftir spectra of diatomite cufe2o4 and 5 cfd the peaks at 420 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 in cufe2o4 and 5 cfd spectra were derived from stretching vibration of cu o and fe o bonds respectively chen et al 2020 the peaks at 799 cm 1 and 1096 cm 1 in diatomite and 5 cfd spectra originated from si o al and si o si bonds tan et al 2020 and the intensities increased with the diatomite content fig s3 xps spectra indicated that the addition of diatomite did not affect the chemical states of fe cu and o in the catalyst fig s4 and fig 5 these results confirmed that cufe2o4 diatomite was successfully fabricated since specific surface area and pore characteristics significantly affect the catalytic performance of catalysts especially the number of reactive sites on catalysts n2 adsorption desorption curves were performed fig 2c the isotherm curve of diatomite was assigned as a typical iii curve with an h3 type hysteresis loop deng et al 2013 verifying the existence of macropores derived from the vertical and smooth holes in diatomite the isotherm curves of 5 cfd and cufe2o4 were categorized as typical iv curves with type h3 hysteresis loops li et al 2017 illustrating that they owned mesoporous structures helpful for enhancing catalytic efficiency in addition the pore size distribution of 5 cfd mainly focused on 5 50 nm much smaller than that of cufe2o4 mainly concentrated on 50 100 nm among a series of cfd composites 5 cfd had the largest specific surface area 57 20 m2 g 1 3 8 fold larger than cufe2o4 largest pore volume 0 29 cm3 g 1 3 2 fold larger than cufe2o4 and smallest pore diameter 20 19 nm reduced 14 than cufe2o4 fig s5 and table s2 indicating that the combination between cufe2o4 and diatomite could efficiently inhibit the agglomeration of cufe2o4 nanoparticles magnetic properties of cufe2o4 and 5 cfd were conducted by magnetic hysteresis m h measurements at room temperature fig 2d the coercivity hc and remnant magnetization mr of pure cufe2o4 were zero exhibiting that cufe2o4 owned superparamagnetism with saturation magnetization of 30 16 emu g 1 in comparison 5 cfd showed ferromagnetic behavior mr 11 2 emu g 1 hc 1171 5 oe with less saturation magnetization of 24 76 emu g 1 a decrease of 22 attributed to the addition of nonmagnetic diatomite with large sizes azari et al 2021 hashemi et al 2020 the strong magnetism could be conducive to the post separation of catalysts from treated water 3 2 performance for pms activation pms activation experiments were performed to examine the removal of typical pesticides by the as prepared catalysts fig 3 only 5 cfd or pms could not efficiently remove atz with removal efficiency of 1 7 and 9 6 respectively fig 3a when both pms and catalysts were added the atz removal efficiency was increased remarkably in the order of 5 cfd pms 100 cufe2o4 pms 62 6 diatomite pms 14 4 the rate constant of the 5 cfd pms system 0 656 min 1 was 5 9 fold and 28 5 fold higher than that of cufe2o4 pms 0 111 min 1 and diatomite pms 0 023 min 1 systems respectively proving that 5 cfd exhibited the best pms activation performance moreover 5 cfd was not the same as the physical mixture of diatomite and cufe2o4 57 4 fig s6 and the better catalytic performance of the catalyst 5 cfd came from the synergistic effect afterward catalyst composition and degradation conditions were estimated to obtain the optimal catalytic performance fig s7a s7c the best removal efficiency 100 was achieved when diatomite content was 5 wt fig s7a less diatomite could not make cufe2o4 distribute evenly while excess diatomite reduced the catalytic performance because of the low catalytic capacity of diatomite itself in addition the removal efficiency increased with the addition of pms from 0 10 g l 1 to 0 40 g l 1 fig s7b excessive pms 0 60 g l 1 could not further improve the removal efficiency due to the radical scavenging of pms and the limitation of active sites in the catalyst miao et al 2018 the increase of 5 cfd content from 0 05 g l 1 to 0 30 g l 1 could also enhance removal performance fig s7c based on economic and environmental principles 0 10 g l 1 cfd was chosen as the optimal dosage the effect of initial ph values on removal efficiency has been conducted fig 3b when initial ph was acidic 2 6 4 removal efficiency had not been affected obviously 1 while the removal efficiency decreased by about 30 under alkaline condition 8 10 the rate constants decreased by 5 42 and 5 70 folds at ph 8 and 10 respectively both atz pk a 1 7 and pms pk a1 0 and pk a2 9 4 feng et al 2016 carried negative charges when the ph varied from 2 to 10 pms existed in different forms hso5 at ph 9 4 and mainly so5 2 at ph 9 4 as the ph changed eq 1 besides the isoelectric point phpzc of 5 cfd was approximately 10 5 fig s8 meaning that it was positively charged at ph 10 hence the electrostatic attraction benefited the contact and reaction between the catalyst and atz pms improving catalytic performance however when the initial ph was basic the amount of so5 2 increased with ph values whose weak oxidation restricted catalytic performance wang et al 2021 the ph of the solution was maintained at approximately 4 when the initial ph values were varied from 4 to 10 fig s7d indicating that the system owned buffer capacity to a certain degree 1 hso 5 so 5 2 h p k a 2 9 4 the mixed solution with four types of pesticides atz s triazine dcmu phenylurea acl acetanilide and dmt organophosphates has been utilized to evaluate the adaptability fig 3c and fig s9b 5 cfd showed poor adsorption performance for different pollutants fig s9a all these target pollutants could achieve nearly 100 removal efficiencies during 10 min with rate constants of 0 537 min 1 0 778 min 1 0 951 min 1 and 6 913 min 1 for atz dcmu acl and dmt respectively which indicated 5 cfd pms owned excellent catalytic performance table s3 especially dmt could be completely removed within 1 min as its chain structure is easy to destroy and remove while atz dcmu and acl contained relatively unbreakable six membered ring structures exhibiting 7 3 12 9 fold smaller rate constants than dmt the active sites in dmt molecule s1 f 0 346 s3 f 0 158 had larger fukui indexes than that in atz n 7 f 0 096 n 8 f 0 091 and cl 9 f 0 0 155 dcmu cl 7 f 0 0 137 cl 8 f 0 187 and acl cl 14 f 0 082 fig s20 s23 indicating that dmt was more vulnerable to attack than others furthermore the effect of coexisting substances was also investigated fig 3d and fig s10 all coexisting substances had barely any adverse effects on the removal efficiency 98 except for co3 2 90 the addition of cl no3 so4 2 h2po4 and ha would not affect the ph of the solution according to our previous study xu et al 2022 in addition the anion species in the solution were not affected fig s11a d cl didn t inhibit the removal process due to the production of cl with a high redox potential 2 4 v vs she eq 2 xu et al 2016 no3 and so4 2 had little influence on pollutant removal because they were not powerful scavengers for radicals in the system hu et al 2018 h2po4 could not suppress the reaction process by catalyzing pms decomposition li et al 2019a and ha also had a bare adverse effect on pollutant removal because of its promoted activation of pms zhang et al 2022 2 so 4 c l so 4 2 cl the addition of co3 2 would inhibit the removal of atz dcmu and acl fig s10 on the one hand the hydrolysis of co3 2 would lead to the equilibration of the h2co3 hco3 co3 2 system eq 3 4 both hco3 and co3 2 coexisted in the solution fig s11e due to that ph maintained at 9 the reaction between so4 oh and hco3 co3 2 could produce other radicals hco3 and co3 with weaker oxidation capacity so4 with k hco3 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 k co3 2 6 1 105 m 1 s 1 and oh with k hco3 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 k co3 2 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2019b resulting in lower removal capacity on the other hand adding co3 2 could change the ph of the solution when adding 1 mm co3 2 in solution the initial ph was maintained at around 9 inhibiting the removal efficiency fig 3c also different water matrices had little impact on atz removal fig s12 in general coexisting substances had minimal impacts on system efficiency indicating that the system presented the excellent anti interference ability and the potential for practical application 3 h 2 c o 3 h hco 3 p k a 1 6 38 4 hco 3 h co 3 2 p k a 2 10 38 3 3 mechanisms into pms activation for decontamination to gain in depth mechanistic insights into the 5 cfd pms system epr detection was performed to identify the generation and evolution of reactive species fig 4 no obvious signal was detected when only pms existed after adding 5 cfd catalyst the characteristic signal of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh with intensities of 1 2 2 1 emerged fig 4a the signal of dmpo oh increased with the reaction time the signal intensity at 10 min was 1 4 fold higher than that at 1 min while the signal intensity of dmpo so4 remained stable this indicated that so4 could transform into oh continuously based on eq 5 dong et al 2020b a typical temp 1o2 signal with intensities of 1 1 1 appeared in the 5 cfd pms system fig 4b analogously the signal intensity of temp 1o2 increased with reaction time the final intensity was 2 5 fold higher than the initial intensity illustrating that 1o2 could be continuously produced during the reaction process fig s13 verified that the 5 cfd pms system could produce more oh and 1o2 than cufe2o4 pms system 5 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh however previous studies mainly focused on detecting 1o2 but ignored the in depth research on the origin of 1o2 dong et al 2020a miao et al 2021 the generation of 1o2 through pms self decay involving hso5 and so5 2 was inefficient eq 6 fig 4b evans and upton 1985 hence it was speculated that 1 o2 could form 1o2 through proton promoted disproportionation eq 7 sawyer and valentine 1981 2 pms could be oxidized directly by the catalyst to produce 1o2 to test these hypotheses the existence of o2 was determined through epr detection first as expected the signal of dmpoo2 adduct with αn 14 2 g αh 11 2 g and αh 1 3 g appeared during the reaction process fig s14 its intensity reached the maximum at 3 min and then faded away to further explore the origin of o2 lsv curves were performed fig 4c the current density of the 5 cfd electrode significantly increased when adding pms into the system confirming that electrons transfer from pms to 5 cfd accompanied by the generation of o2 eq 8 to further verified the role of o2 p bq quencher was utilized during epr detection fig 4c and fig s15 the characteristic signal of dmpo p bq emerged after p bq was added and its intensity decreased with reaction time fig s15 confirming that o2 was quenched meanwhile the signal intensity of the temp 1o2 adduct was reduced by about 88 with the addition of p bq fig 4d which confirmed that the formation of 1o2 was inhibited when o2 was quenched by p bq in addition the comparable inhibiting effect 9 of p bq and ffa fig s16 also accounted for that 1o2 was derived from o2 in general pms could be oxidized to produce o2 which could further generate 1o2 6 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 7 o 2 ho 2 ho 2 1 o 2 8 cu ii 2 hso 5 cu i 2 so 4 2 o 2 2 h scavenging experiments were further conducted to analyze active species in the reaction fig 4e meoh could simultaneously quench so4 and oh with rate constants of 0 9 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 10 108 m 1 s 1 respectively while tba could selectively scavenge oh with rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2018 the contribution of 1o2 was evaluated by adding ffa due to its high selectivity for 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 mi et al 2021 the reaction rate constants declined by 10 1 fold 4 7 fold and 15 1 fold after adding meoh tba and ffa respectively fig 4e indicating that so4 oh and 1o2 were all involved in the reaction in addition aerating n2 into the system did not affect the removal efficiency fig 4e indicating that the o for ros was not derived from do but originated from pms this also verified that 5 cfd pms system would not rely on do free from the low solubility of do and slow diffusion rate of o2 in water besides the negative pmso2 signal excluded the role of fe iv specific data were not shown moreover the concentration of ros was quantified using different chemical probes to understand the catalytic mechanism deeply zheng et al 2021 the concentration of so4 oh and 1o2 was determined to be 11 8 μm 261 3 μm and 138 8 μm respectively fig 4f the concentration variations of so4 oh and 1o2 with reaction time were consistent with epr detection the concentration of so4 maintained stable due to its rapid consumption including transformation to oh and pollutant degradation these results verified that oh and 1o2 were the dominant ros in addition the production of 1o2 went through the process pms o2 1o2 and so4 could rapidly convert into oh to further explore the charge transformation mechanism between catalysts and pms electrochemical measurements were performed fig 5 a 5c a sharp negative current peak 32 7 µa could be observed in the i t curve for the 5 cfd electrode when adding 40 mg l 1 pms into the electrolyte at 60 s fig 5a indicating the substantial electron transfer between 5 cfd and pms over the course of pms contacting with 5 cfd subsequent injection of 10 mg l 1 atz at 180 s resulted in a significant current peak 32 0 µa implying the occurrence of electron transfer between atz and catalysts pms complex furthermore i t curves of diatomite and cufe2o4 electrodes showed their low electron transfer capacities compared with that of 5 cfd verifying the much stronger catalytic ability of 5 cfd than that of diatomite or cufe2o4 besides lsv curves in fig 5b also showed that current density increased when pms was added to the solution illustrating that electrons could transfer from 5 cfd to pms producing so4 and oh moreover the subsequent addition of atz further increased the current density verifying the electron transfer from the catalysts pms complex to atz du et al 2020 combining fig 4c and fig 5a b it could be confirmed that the electron transfer between 5 cfd and pms resulted in the generation of 1o2 so4 and oh further reacting with pollutant moreover the electron transfer capacity of 5 cfd pms system was much stronger than that of cufe2o4 pms or diatomite pms system moreover eis analysis fig 5c and fig s17 verified that the charge transfer resistance of 5 cfd was the lowest which was a benefit for pms activation and contaminant removal in conclusion the excellent electron transfer capacity and the lowest charge transfer resistance of 5 cfd could improve pms activation efficiency hence catalytic and decontamination performance to further reveal the electron transfer mechanism xps spectra for fresh and used catalysts were characterized fig 5d 5f and fig s18 both fresh and used catalysts contained fe cu o and si elements fig s18a transition metals cu and fe could activate pms through redox reactions to produce reactive species fang et al 2020 fig 5d showed that the fe in the fresh 5 cfd only existed in the form of fe iii is used to represent the element in solid form while fe ii 37 emerged after the catalytic reaction meanwhile cu i 19 also appeared in the used catalyst compared with fresh catalyst only cu ii existed fig 5e these phenomena confirmed that both fe iii and cu ii in 5 cfd catalyst were involved in redox reaction for pms activation specifically fe iii could be reduced by cu i to generate fe ii and cu ii eq 9 however fe iii could not react with hso5 because of the thermodynamic infeasibility while fe ii could react with hso5 to form so4 eq 10 guo et al 2020 cu ii could also react with hso5 with the production o2 eq 8 ren et al 2022 whereafter cu i could reduce hso5 and fe iii to form radicals so4 and oh and fe ii eq 11 12 in o 1 s spectra fig 5f the oxygen vacancy ov 531 4 ev decreased by 8 after the reaction 37 to 29 indicating that an ov based reaction occurred to generate o2 eq 13 dong et al 2020a in general the electron transfer between 5 cfd and pms produced various ros the circulation of fe iii fe ii and cu ii cu i allowed the reaction to proceed continuously further removing pollutants rapidly among that oh and 1o2 were the dominant ros for the contaminant degradation 1o2 was generated through pms o2 1o2 so4 not only participated in the degradation process but also converted to oh rapidly all o in ros 1o2 so4 and oh was derived from pms not dissolved oxygen 9 cu i fe iii cu ii fe ii e 0 0 60 v v s nhe 10 fe ii hso 5 fe iii so 4 o h 11 cu i hso 5 cu ii so 4 o h 12 cu i hso 5 cu ii so 4 2 oh 13 o v hso 5 hso 4 o 2 3 4 degradation pathways and toxicity assessment for intermediates to explore the degradation process during the reaction we analyzed contaminants degradation processes and intermediates evolution by hplc qtof ms ms and dft calculations fig 6 and table s4 7 during the reaction 13 kinds of intermediates of atz were detected table s4 fig 6a and fig s19 based on dft calculations n7 f 0 096 n8 f 0 091 and cl9 f 0 0 155 with the larger fukui indexes fig s20 in atz molecule were more vulnerable to electrophilic active species 1o2 or radical attack zhang et al 2021 ascribing to the production of p a1 p a4 p a8 and p a11 the electrostatic potential distribution of atz also illustrated that the corresponding regions in atz were negatively charged fig s25 vulnerable to attack in addition the relative abundances of p a1 p a2 p a3 and p a6 were higher than other intermediates tang et al 2022 which reached their maximums successively with the reaction process fig 6a this indicated that the evolutionary relationship p a1 p a2 p a3 p a6 did exist through alkyl hydroxylation and alkyl oxidation which was the primary degradation pathway of atz similarly pathways p a4 p a5 p a6 p a8 p a9 p a10 and p a11 p a12 p a9 also followed similar transformation according to the abundance variation fig s19 besides both p a8 and p a12 could turn into p a9 leading to a larger abundance than other intermediates subsequently p a7 and p a13 were produced from p a6 and p a10 and the abundance of p a13 increased with reaction time dcmu could transform into p b1 and p b2 through demethylation compared with radical attacking 1o2 was more responsible for producing p b1 and p b2 n11 in dcmu f 0 033 fig s21 followed by deamination to produce p b3 the c10 f 0 0 073 f 0 026 in p b3 would be attacked by radical due to its large f 0 hence generating p b4 fig s24 simultaneously cl8 atom with larger f 0 0 153 and f 0 187 in dcmu could be attacked to form p b6 the pathway p b6 p b7 p b8 p b9 would occur with serials attacks by active species rahmani et al 2021 the abundance of most intermediates except p b9 increased in the early process and then decreased until they disappeared fig 6b the abundance of p b9 increased obviously and then flattened the n11 f 0 015 and cl14 f 0 082 f 0 0 079 in acl were vulnerable to attack by ros to produce p c1 and p c3 fig s22 moreover p c5 could also be generated through olefination p c1 could be attacked to generate p c2 and cc bond scission in p c3 could produce p c4 after that p c6 could be formed by active species attacking p c2 p c4 and p c5 followed by the production of p c7 fig s24 villajos et al 2021 the abundance of p c1 and p c2 reached maximums successively during the reaction process fig 6c while the abundance of p c6 and p c7 increased and then flattened dmt could transform to p d1 omethoate when s1 atom with the largest f 0 0 247 and f 0 346 in the dmt molecule was attacked fig s23 the ros attacking s3 atoms in dmt f 0 0 138 f 0 156 and p d1 f 0 0 190 f 0 225 could generate a series of intermediates p d2 p d6 moreover the evolution process p d6 p d2 p d5 p d4 p d3 could also occur due to ros attack yao et al 2011 which could be confirmed by the evolution of corresponding intermediates fig 6d in addition most of the intermediates decreased until to disappear at the late stage of the reaction meanwhile p d2 and p d3 exhibited a trend that increased at first and then flattened in general most intermediates detected in the reaction process increased at first and then decreased until disappearing and a few increased at first and then flattened out this phenomenon verified that all contaminants could be efficiently removed and transformed into co2 and h2o finally moreover the acute toxicity and bioaccumulation factor of pollutants and their intermediates were predicted with the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t based on qsar fig s26 the results exhibited that the reaction process gradually relieved the toxicity and bioaccumulation factor the catalytic decontamination process efficiently removed contaminants and alleviated their adverse environmental effects conclusion in this study we prepared cufe2o4 diatomite composite by a solvothermal method for pms activation to remove pesticides efficiently among a series of cfd composites cufe2o4 5 diatomite possessed the largest specific surface area 57 20 m2 g 1 3 8 fold larger than cufe2o4 largest pore volume 0 29 cm3 g 1 3 2 fold larger than cufe2o4 and smallest pore diameter 20 19 nm reduced 14 than cufe2o4 5 cfd pms system could achieve 100 removal efficiencies towards multiple pesticides atz dcmu acl and dmt simultaneously within 10 min at 0 10 g l 1 5 cfd and 0 40 g l 1 pms in addition the adverse effect of coexisting substances on the system was 10 illustrating the excellent anti interference ability of the system the excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the excellent electron transfer capacity and the lower charge transfer resistance of 5 cfd which efficiently facilitated charge transfer between 5 cfd and pms and further generated abundant ros meanwhile the cyclic transformation between fe iii fe ii and cu ii cu i ensured continuous generation of ros in which oh 261 3 μm and 1o2 138 8 μm were dominant 1o2 was generated through pms o2 1o2 so4 would convert to oh rapidly all o in ros was derived from pms not do independent of the low solubility of do and slow diffusion rate of o2 in water a total of 35 kinds of intermediates were detected by qtof ms ms combined with dft calculations it was verified that the abundance of most intermediates reached the maximum in turn along the direction of degradation pathway the abundance of the intermediates at the front end of the degradation pathway tended to increase first and then decrease or level off while the abundance of the intermediates at the back end of the degradation pathway tended to increase gradually toxicity evaluation showed that the degradation process could effectively alleviate the adverse effects of contaminants on the environment the profound insights into mechanism for pesticide degradation and active species transformation

14881,peroxymonosulfate pms activation is a promising technology for water purification but the removal performance of multiple pollutant matrices and the mechanism for reactive species transformation in the heterogeneous catalytic system remain ambiguous herein a novel cufe2o4 diatomite was fabricated for pms activation to achieve efficient removal of typical pesticides uniform distribution of cufe2o4 on diatomite efficiently alleviated the agglomeration of cufe2o4 and increased specific surface area 57 20 m2 g 1 3 8 fold larger than cufe2o4 cufe2o4 5 diatomite 5 cfd pms system showed nearly 100 removal efficiency for mixed pesticide solution within 10 min 0 10 g l 1 5 cfd and 0 40 g l 1 pms and excellent anti interference performance towards various coexisting substances 90 removal efficiency the electrochemical measurements confirmed that the lower charge transfer resistance of 5 cfd significantly enhanced the electron transfer capacity between 5 cfd and pms

abstract keywords cufe2o4 diatomite peroxymonosulfate activation pesticides anti interference capability active species transformation degradation pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although pesticides are indispensable for food security and production their abuse inevitably results in potential water pollution due to surface runoff tudi et al 2021 posing a threat to water security and thus arousing health risks for human beings and other organisms schulz et al 2021 conventional treatments used in water treatment plants are ineffective in removing these compounds due to their low biodegradability fenner et al 2013 hence effective technologies must be explored as alternatives to provide proper degradation of these contaminants either for discharge onto surface water or reuse in crop irrigation many advanced technologies have been explored including photocatalysis xu et al 2021 uv mediated degradation badi et al 2019 he et al 2021 fenton or fenton like processes dong et al 2020b etc in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops based on peroxymonosulfate pms have attracted increasing interest due to their effectiveness in the degradation and the potential for mineralization of refractory contaminants zhao et al 2020 various transition metal ions co2 fe2 cu2 mn2 etc have been studied to activate pms tian et al 2022 but post separation and inevitable secondary contamination inhibit their applications zhong et al 2022 although cobalt based catalysts are considered the most efficient pms activators the high toxicity of cobalt still restricts their application ding et al 2020 to mitigate these problems developing efficient and eco friendly catalysts for activating pms is highly desirable toward this end copper and iron based catalysts are appropriate substitutions because of their low toxicity and economy among which cufe2o4 is an efficient pms activator with stable structure and effortless separation property due to magnetism wei et al 2019 however magnetic cufe2o4 is subject to agglomeration leading to reduced reactive sites and restricted catalytic performance dong et al 2019 hence a suitable strategy for synthesizing highly dispersive cufe2o4 nanoparticles should be explored to improve its catalytic performance diatomite one of the abundant natural minerals is mainly composed of amorphous sio2 diatomite has been widely used as catalyst support template material adsorbent etc ascribed to its 3d porous structure abundant functional groups excellent chemical stability eco friendly and low cost li et al 2018 hence diatomite is a suitable carrier to fabricate well dispersed cufe2o4 nanoparticles to enhance its capability for pms activation an excellent catalytic system should have superior performance and anti interference ability whether caused by internal or external interference the active species in pms based systems mainly consist of hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 electron transfer high valence metal etc wang et al 2018 among these 1o2 has attracted more attention due to its strong selectivity toward electron rich substances and better resistance to water interference zhou et al 2017 an increasing number of studies focus on regularizing catalyst structures or system conditions to selectively generate 1o2 miao et al 2021 however what 1o2 origins from is still blurry hence exploring the origin of 1o2 can help understand the mechanism for the selective generation of 1o2 to improve the anti interference ability of systems further for external interference on the one hand wastewater often contains various pollutants hence except for the study on the effect of coexisting substances inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom the anti interference ability towards wastewater containing multiple pollutants should also be valued moreover the derivation of pollutants and their intermediates should also be investigated to assess the degradation effects on the other hand the effect of dissolved oxygen do on systems should also be a concern although do has a positive effect on some systems zhu et al 2022 low solubility 8 1 8 5 mg l 1 at 25 c and slow diffusion rate of o2 1 96 2 56 10 9 m2 s 1 at 25 c in aqueous solution remain a challenge zhang et al 2019 hence it is desirable if the influence of do on systems is negligible to this end the prerequisite is studying the influence of do on the formation of various reactive oxygen species ros which helps understand how do affects the system in depth in this study a series of cufe2o4 diatomite was fabricated by a facile solvothermal method for efficient pms activation to degrade typical pesticides in water first the physicochemical properties of as prepared cufe2o4 diatomite composites were characterized followed by an evaluation of the catalytic performance and the anti interference capability second the mechanism for pms activation was discussed including the influence of do on the formation of various ros and the origin of 1o2 according to x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis electrochemical analysis electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry

and were used without further purification deionized di water was used throughout the experiments 2 2 fabrication of cufe2o4 diatomite cufe2o4 diatomite composites were synthesized using a solvothermal method specifically a certain mass of diatomite was added to 60 ml of ethylene glycol with ultrasonic treatment for 30 min then 0 484 g of cu no3 2 3h2o and 1 616 g of fe no3 3 9h2o were added to the above solution the mixture was ultrasonic for 30 min followed by stirring magnetically for 30 min subsequently 6 0 g naac was added to the above solution under continuous stirring for 60 min the mixed solution was sealed in a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 c for 10 h in an electric thermostatic drying oven whl 25ab after cooling naturally to room temperature the precipitate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min with di water and anhydrous ethanol separately three times and dried at 70 c overnight the cufe2o4 diatomite was finally obtained pure cufe2o4 was

spectroscopy eis linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves and i t curves were performed details in text s1 2 4 evaluation of catalytic performance the performance of catalysts for pms activation was evaluated through pesticide contaminants atz dcmu acl and dmt degradation the catalytic experiments were conducted in a 250 ml glass beaker typically a certain mass of the as prepared catalyst was added to 100 ml of 10 mg l 1 atz solution the adsorption between the catalyst and atz was negligible fig s1 hence all experiments were conducted without adsorption desorption equilibrium and were triggered when adding pms into suspension during the reaction 1 5 ml reactant suspension was withdrawn at specific time intervals and filtered through 0 22 μm mixed cellulose ester filters into autosampler vials and transferred in an ice water bath immediately to stop the reaction finally the prepared samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for further analysis expect for atz solution the mixed solution containing four pesticides catz cdcmu cacl cdmt 20 μmol l 1 was also used for evaluating catalytic performance all experiments were conducted three times to ensure the reliability of data 2 5 analytical methods the concentrations of target pollutants were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1290 with a diode array detector dad a c18 column was used for detection and the injection volume was 10 µl specific detection conditions are listed in table s1 the intermediates during the degradation process were detected with an agilent 1290 hplc coupled to a time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization and quadrupole detection esi qtof ms ms x500r ab sciex details in text s2 visual minteq 3 1 was used to simulate anion species variations with ph values the main reactive oxygen species ros were identified through trapping experiments meoh was chosen as the scavenging agent for both oh and so4 tba ffa and p bq were selected as the scavenging agents for oh 1o2 and o2 respectively except for adding scavengers other procedures were the same as degradation experiments the solution of aerated n2 was used to evaluate the effect of do on ros formation in addition epr a300e bruker was used for ros detection dmpo was used in epr to detect the spin adducts of oh so4 and o2 temp was used to detect 1o2 moreover the concentrations of oh so4 and 1o2 were determined using molecule probes benzoic acid p hydroxybenzoic acid and 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran details in text s3 pmso 0 1 mm was used to verify the existence of fe iv fe iv could react with pmso to produce pmso2 fe iv pmso2 1 1 2 6 theoretical calculation fukui function calculations and electrostatic potential distribution were utilized to analyze the degradation pathway of pollutants the fukui index describes which active sites in atz molecule are vulnerable to reactions with ros details in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of cufe2o4 diatomite composite morphologies and microstructures of catalysts are observed in fig 1 pure cufe2o4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 45 170 nm agglomerated to bulk fig 1a pure diatomite looked like a petri dish 32 µm in diameter consisting of two similar valves and a girdle fig 1b chen et al 2016 on which had abundant pores 200 nm in diameter beneficial for the dispersion of cufe2o4 nanoparticles hence when coupling them fig 1c and 1d cufe2o4 nanoparticles could uniformly disperse on diatomite efficiently inhibiting agglomeration the overlapping of cu fe si and o in elemental mappings fig 1g also confirmed the uniform distribution of feco2o4 on diatomite according to the tem image fig 1e interplanar spacings of 0 302 nm 0 254 nm and 0 164 nm were observed corresponding to 220 311 and 511 planes of cufe2o4 jcpds 25 0823 the clear symmetric diffraction rings of 220 311 and 400 planes of cufe2o4 were also observed in the sead pattern fig 1f crystal structures of catalysts were analyzed according to xrd patterns fig 2 a the characteristic peaks at 30 1 35 4 43 3 56 9 62 5 and 74 2 in patterns of serial cfd and cufe2o4 were assigned to 220 311 400 511 440 and 533 planes of cufe2o4 jcpds 25 0283 consistent with tem results fig 1 pure diatomite had a robust characteristic peak at 21 8 corresponding to 101 plane of sio2 jcpds 39 1425 fig s2 although the characteristic peak of diatomite was extremely weak in cfd composites ascribed to low addition its intensity gradually strengthened as the diatomite content increased the partially enlarged detail in fig 2a fig 2b displays ftir spectra of diatomite cufe2o4 and 5 cfd the peaks at 420 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 in cufe2o4 and 5 cfd spectra were derived from stretching vibration of cu o and fe o bonds respectively chen et al 2020 the peaks at 799 cm 1 and 1096 cm 1 in diatomite and 5 cfd spectra originated from si o al and si o si bonds tan et al 2020 and the intensities increased with the diatomite content fig s3 xps spectra indicated that the addition of diatomite did not affect the chemical states of fe cu and o in the catalyst fig s4 and fig 5 these results confirmed that cufe2o4 diatomite was successfully fabricated since specific surface area and pore characteristics significantly affect the catalytic performance of catalysts especially the number of reactive sites on catalysts n2 adsorption desorption curves were performed fig 2c the isotherm curve of diatomite was assigned as a typical iii curve with an h3 type hysteresis loop deng et al 2013 verifying the existence of macropores derived from the vertical and smooth holes in diatomite the isotherm curves of 5 cfd and cufe2o4 were categorized as typical iv curves with type h3 hysteresis loops li et al 2017 illustrating that they owned mesoporous structures helpful for enhancing catalytic efficiency in addition the pore size distribution of 5 cfd mainly focused on 5 50 nm much smaller than that of cufe2o4 mainly concentrated on 50 100 nm among a series of cfd composites 5 cfd had the largest specific surface area 57 20 m2 g 1 3 8 fold larger than cufe2o4 largest pore volume 0 29 cm3 g 1 3 2 fold larger than cufe2o4 and smallest pore diameter 20 19 nm reduced 14 than cufe2o4 fig s5 and table s2 indicating that the combination between cufe2o4 and diatomite could efficiently inhibit the agglomeration of cufe2o4 nanoparticles magnetic properties of cufe2o4 and 5 cfd were conducted by magnetic hysteresis m h measurements at room temperature fig 2d the coercivity hc and remnant magnetization mr of pure cufe2o4 were zero exhibiting that cufe2o4 owned superparamagnetism with saturation magnetization of 30 16 emu g 1 in comparison 5 cfd showed ferromagnetic behavior mr 11 2 emu g 1 hc 1171 5 oe with less saturation magnetization of 24 76 emu g 1 a decrease of 22 attributed to the addition of nonmagnetic diatomite with large sizes azari et al 2021 hashemi et al 2020 the strong magnetism could be conducive to the post separation of catalysts from treated water 3 2 performance for pms activation pms activation experiments were performed to examine the removal of typical pesticides by the as prepared catalysts fig 3 only 5 cfd or pms could not efficiently remove atz with removal efficiency of 1 7 and 9 6 respectively fig 3a when both pms and catalysts were added the atz removal efficiency was increased remarkably in the order of 5 cfd pms 100 cufe2o4 pms 62 6 diatomite pms 14 4 the rate constant of the 5 cfd pms system 0 656 min 1 was 5 9 fold and 28 5 fold higher than that of cufe2o4 pms 0 111 min 1 and diatomite pms 0 023 min 1 systems respectively proving that 5 cfd exhibited the best pms activation performance moreover 5 cfd was not the same as the physical mixture of diatomite and cufe2o4 57 4 fig s6 and the better catalytic performance of the catalyst 5 cfd came from the synergistic effect afterward catalyst composition and degradation conditions were estimated to obtain the optimal catalytic performance fig s7a s7c the best removal efficiency 100 was achieved when diatomite content was 5 wt fig s7a less diatomite could not make cufe2o4 distribute evenly while excess diatomite reduced the catalytic performance because of the low catalytic capacity of diatomite itself in addition the removal efficiency increased with the addition of pms from 0 10 g l 1 to 0 40 g l 1 fig s7b excessive pms 0 60 g l 1 could not further improve the removal efficiency due to the radical scavenging of pms and the limitation of active sites in the catalyst miao et al 2018 the increase of 5 cfd content from 0 05 g l 1 to 0 30 g l 1 could also enhance removal performance fig s7c based on economic and environmental principles 0 10 g l 1 cfd was chosen as the optimal dosage the effect of initial ph values on removal efficiency has been conducted fig 3b when initial ph was acidic 2 6 4 removal efficiency had not been affected obviously 1 while the removal efficiency decreased by about 30 under alkaline condition 8 10 the rate constants decreased by 5 42 and 5 70 folds at ph 8 and 10 respectively both atz pk a 1 7 and pms pk a1 0 and pk a2 9 4 feng et al 2016 carried negative charges when the ph varied from 2 to 10 pms existed in different forms hso5 at ph 9 4 and mainly so5 2 at ph 9 4 as the ph changed eq 1 besides the isoelectric point phpzc of 5 cfd was approximately 10 5 fig s8 meaning that it was positively charged at ph 10 hence the electrostatic attraction benefited the contact and reaction between the catalyst and atz pms improving catalytic performance however when the initial ph was basic the amount of so5 2 increased with ph values whose weak oxidation restricted catalytic performance wang et al 2021 the ph of the solution was maintained at approximately 4 when the initial ph values were varied from 4 to 10 fig s7d indicating that the system owned buffer capacity to a certain degree 1 hso 5 so 5 2 h p k a 2 9 4 the mixed solution with four types of pesticides atz s triazine dcmu phenylurea acl acetanilide and dmt organophosphates has been utilized to evaluate the adaptability fig 3c and fig s9b 5 cfd showed poor adsorption performance for different pollutants fig s9a all these target pollutants could achieve nearly 100 removal efficiencies during 10 min with rate constants of 0 537 min 1 0 778 min 1 0 951 min 1 and 6 913 min 1 for atz dcmu acl and dmt respectively which indicated 5 cfd pms owned excellent catalytic performance table s3 especially dmt could be completely removed within 1 min as its chain structure is easy to destroy and remove while atz dcmu and acl contained relatively unbreakable six membered ring structures exhibiting 7 3 12 9 fold smaller rate constants than dmt the active sites in dmt molecule s1 f 0 346 s3 f 0 158 had larger fukui indexes than that in atz n 7 f 0 096 n 8 f 0 091 and cl 9 f 0 0 155 dcmu cl 7 f 0 0 137 cl 8 f 0 187 and acl cl 14 f 0 082 fig s20 s23 indicating that dmt was more vulnerable to attack than others furthermore the effect of coexisting substances was also investigated fig 3d and fig s10 all coexisting substances had barely any adverse effects on the removal efficiency 98 except for co3 2 90 the addition of cl no3 so4 2 h2po4 and ha would not affect the ph of the solution according to our previous study xu et al 2022 in addition the anion species in the solution were not affected fig s11a d cl didn t inhibit the removal process due to the production of cl with a high redox potential 2 4 v vs she eq 2 xu et al 2016 no3 and so4 2 had little influence on pollutant removal because they were not powerful scavengers for radicals in the system hu et al 2018 h2po4 could not suppress the reaction process by catalyzing pms decomposition li et al 2019a and ha also had a bare adverse effect on pollutant removal because of its promoted activation of pms zhang et al 2022 2 so 4 c l so 4 2 cl the addition of co3 2 would inhibit the removal of atz dcmu and acl fig s10 on the one hand the hydrolysis of co3 2 would lead to the equilibration of the h2co3 hco3 co3 2 system eq 3 4 both hco3 and co3 2 coexisted in the solution fig s11e due to that ph maintained at 9 the reaction between so4 oh and hco3 co3 2 could produce other radicals hco3 and co3 with weaker oxidation capacity so4 with k hco3 1 6 105 m 1 s 1 k co3 2 6 1 105 m 1 s 1 and oh with k hco3 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 k co3 2 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2019b resulting in lower removal capacity on the other hand adding co3 2 could change the ph of the solution when adding 1 mm co3 2 in solution the initial ph was maintained at around 9 inhibiting the removal efficiency fig 3c also different water matrices had little impact on atz removal fig s12 in general coexisting substances had minimal impacts on system efficiency indicating that the system presented the excellent anti interference ability and the potential for practical application 3 h 2 c o 3 h hco 3 p k a 1 6 38 4 hco 3 h co 3 2 p k a 2 10 38 3 3 mechanisms into pms activation for decontamination to gain in depth mechanistic insights into the 5 cfd pms system epr detection was performed to identify the generation and evolution of reactive species fig 4 no obvious signal was detected when only pms existed after adding 5 cfd catalyst the characteristic signal of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh with intensities of 1 2 2 1 emerged fig 4a the signal of dmpo oh increased with the reaction time the signal intensity at 10 min was 1 4 fold higher than that at 1 min while the signal intensity of dmpo so4 remained stable this indicated that so4 could transform into oh continuously based on eq 5 dong et al 2020b a typical temp 1o2 signal with intensities of 1 1 1 appeared in the 5 cfd pms system fig 4b analogously the signal intensity of temp 1o2 increased with reaction time the final intensity was 2 5 fold higher than the initial intensity illustrating that 1o2 could be continuously produced during the reaction process fig s13 verified that the 5 cfd pms system could produce more oh and 1o2 than cufe2o4 pms system 5 so 4 o h so 4 2 oh however previous studies mainly focused on detecting 1o2 but ignored the in depth research on the origin of 1o2 dong et al 2020a miao et al 2021 the generation of 1o2 through pms self decay involving hso5 and so5 2 was inefficient eq 6 fig 4b evans and upton 1985 hence it was speculated that 1 o2 could form 1o2 through proton promoted disproportionation eq 7 sawyer and valentine 1981 2 pms could be oxidized directly by the catalyst to produce 1o2 to test these hypotheses the existence of o2 was determined through epr detection first as expected the signal of dmpoo2 adduct with αn 14 2 g αh 11 2 g and αh 1 3 g appeared during the reaction process fig s14 its intensity reached the maximum at 3 min and then faded away to further explore the origin of o2 lsv curves were performed fig 4c the current density of the 5 cfd electrode significantly increased when adding pms into the system confirming that electrons transfer from pms to 5 cfd accompanied by the generation of o2 eq 8 to further verified the role of o2 p bq quencher was utilized during epr detection fig 4c and fig s15 the characteristic signal of dmpo p bq emerged after p bq was added and its intensity decreased with reaction time fig s15 confirming that o2 was quenched meanwhile the signal intensity of the temp 1o2 adduct was reduced by about 88 with the addition of p bq fig 4d which confirmed that the formation of 1o2 was inhibited when o2 was quenched by p bq in addition the comparable inhibiting effect 9 of p bq and ffa fig s16 also accounted for that 1o2 was derived from o2 in general pms could be oxidized to produce o2 which could further generate 1o2 6 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 7 o 2 ho 2 ho 2 1 o 2 8 cu ii 2 hso 5 cu i 2 so 4 2 o 2 2 h scavenging experiments were further conducted to analyze active species in the reaction fig 4e meoh could simultaneously quench so4 and oh with rate constants of 0 9 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 10 108 m 1 s 1 respectively while tba could selectively scavenge oh with rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2018 the contribution of 1o2 was evaluated by adding ffa due to its high selectivity for 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 mi et al 2021 the reaction rate constants declined by 10 1 fold 4 7 fold and 15 1 fold after adding meoh tba and ffa respectively fig 4e indicating that so4 oh and 1o2 were all involved in the reaction in addition aerating n2 into the system did not affect the removal efficiency fig 4e indicating that the o for ros was not derived from do but originated from pms this also verified that 5 cfd pms system would not rely on do free from the low solubility of do and slow diffusion rate of o2 in water besides the negative pmso2 signal excluded the role of fe iv specific data were not shown moreover the concentration of ros was quantified using different chemical probes to understand the catalytic mechanism deeply zheng et al 2021 the concentration of so4 oh and 1o2 was determined to be 11 8 μm 261 3 μm and 138 8 μm respectively fig 4f the concentration variations of so4 oh and 1o2 with reaction time were consistent with epr detection the concentration of so4 maintained stable due to its rapid consumption including transformation to oh and pollutant degradation these results verified that oh and 1o2 were the dominant ros in addition the production of 1o2 went through the process pms o2 1o2 and so4 could rapidly convert into oh to further explore the charge transformation mechanism between catalysts and pms electrochemical measurements were performed fig 5 a 5c a sharp negative current peak 32 7 µa could be observed in the i t curve for the 5 cfd electrode when adding 40 mg l 1 pms into the electrolyte at 60 s fig 5a indicating the substantial electron transfer between 5 cfd and pms over the course of pms contacting with 5 cfd subsequent injection of 10 mg l 1 atz at 180 s resulted in a significant current peak 32 0 µa implying the occurrence of electron transfer between atz and catalysts pms complex furthermore i t curves of diatomite and cufe2o4 electrodes showed their low electron transfer capacities compared with that of 5 cfd verifying the much stronger catalytic ability of 5 cfd than that of diatomite or cufe2o4 besides lsv curves in fig 5b also showed that current density increased when pms was added to the solution illustrating that electrons could transfer from 5 cfd to pms producing so4 and oh moreover the subsequent addition of atz further increased the current density verifying the electron transfer from the catalysts pms complex to atz du et al 2020 combining fig 4c and fig 5a b it could be confirmed that the electron transfer between 5 cfd and pms resulted in the generation of 1o2 so4 and oh further reacting with pollutant moreover the electron transfer capacity of 5 cfd pms system was much stronger than that of cufe2o4 pms or diatomite pms system moreover eis analysis fig 5c and fig s17 verified that the charge transfer resistance of 5 cfd was the lowest which was a benefit for pms activation and contaminant removal in conclusion the excellent electron transfer capacity and the lowest charge transfer resistance of 5 cfd could improve pms activation efficiency hence catalytic and decontamination performance to further reveal the electron transfer mechanism xps spectra for fresh and used catalysts were characterized fig 5d 5f and fig s18 both fresh and used catalysts contained fe cu o and si elements fig s18a transition metals cu and fe could activate pms through redox reactions to produce reactive species fang et al 2020 fig 5d showed that the fe in the fresh 5 cfd only existed in the form of fe iii is used to represent the element in solid form while fe ii 37 emerged after the catalytic reaction meanwhile cu i 19 also appeared in the used catalyst compared with fresh catalyst only cu ii existed fig 5e these phenomena confirmed that both fe iii and cu ii in 5 cfd catalyst were involved in redox reaction for pms activation specifically fe iii could be reduced by cu i to generate fe ii and cu ii eq 9 however fe iii could not react with hso5 because of the thermodynamic infeasibility while fe ii could react with hso5 to form so4 eq 10 guo et al 2020 cu ii could also react with hso5 with the production o2 eq 8 ren et al 2022 whereafter cu i could reduce hso5 and fe iii to form radicals so4 and oh and fe ii eq 11 12 in o 1 s spectra fig 5f the oxygen vacancy ov 531 4 ev decreased by 8 after the reaction 37 to 29 indicating that an ov based reaction occurred to generate o2 eq 13 dong et al 2020a in general the electron transfer between 5 cfd and pms produced various ros the circulation of fe iii fe ii and cu ii cu i allowed the reaction to proceed continuously further removing pollutants rapidly among that oh and 1o2 were the dominant ros for the contaminant degradation 1o2 was generated through pms o2 1o2 so4 not only participated in the degradation process but also converted to oh rapidly all o in ros 1o2 so4 and oh was derived from

pathways and toxicity assessment for intermediates to explore the degradation process during the reaction we analyzed contaminants degradation processes and intermediates evolution by hplc qtof ms ms and dft calculations fig 6 and table s4 7 during the reaction 13 kinds of intermediates of atz were detected table s4 fig 6a and fig s19 based on dft calculations n7 f 0 096 n8 f 0 091 and cl9 f 0 0 155 with the larger fukui indexes fig s20 in atz molecule were more vulnerable to electrophilic active species 1o2 or radical attack zhang et al 2021 ascribing to the production of p a1 p a4 p a8 and p a11 the electrostatic potential distribution of atz also illustrated that the corresponding regions in atz were negatively charged fig s25 vulnerable to attack in addition the relative abundances of p a1 p a2 p a3 and p a6 were higher than other intermediates tang et al 2022 which reached their maximums successively with the reaction process fig 6a this indicated that the evolutionary relationship p a1 p a2 p a3 p a6 did exist through alkyl hydroxylation and alkyl oxidation which was the primary degradation pathway of atz similarly pathways p a4 p a5 p a6 p a8 p a9 p a10 and p a11 p a12 p a9 also followed similar transformation according to the abundance variation fig s19 besides both p a8 and p a12 could turn into p a9 leading to a larger abundance than other intermediates subsequently p a7 and p a13 were produced from p a6 and p a10 and the abundance of p a13 increased with reaction time dcmu could transform into p b1 and p b2 through demethylation compared with radical attacking 1o2 was more responsible for producing p b1 and p b2 n11 in dcmu f 0 033 fig s21 followed by deamination to produce p b3 the c10 f 0 0 073 f 0 026 in p b3 would be attacked by radical due to its large f 0 hence generating p b4 fig s24 simultaneously cl8 atom with larger f 0 0 153 and f 0 187 in dcmu could be attacked to form p b6 the pathway p b6 p b7 p b8 p b9 would occur with serials attacks by active species rahmani et al 2021 the abundance of most intermediates except p b9 increased in the early process and then decreased until they disappeared fig 6b the abundance of p b9 increased obviously and then flattened the n11 f 0 015 and cl14 f 0 082 f 0 0 079 in acl were vulnerable to attack by ros to produce p c1 and p c3 fig s22 moreover p c5 could also be generated through olefination p c1 could be attacked to generate p c2 and cc bond scission in p c3 could produce p c4 after that p c6 could be formed by active species attacking p c2 p c4 and p c5 followed by the production of p c7 fig s24 villajos et al 2021 the abundance of p c1 and p c2 reached maximums successively during the reaction process fig 6c while the abundance of p c6 and p c7 increased and then flattened dmt could transform to p d1 omethoate when s1 atom with the largest f 0 0 247 and f 0 346 in the dmt molecule was attacked fig s23 the ros attacking s3 atoms in dmt f 0 0 138 f 0 156 and p d1 f 0 0 190 f 0 225 could generate a series of intermediates p d2 p d6 moreover the evolution process p d6 p d2 p d5 p d4 p d3 could also occur due to ros attack yao et al 2011 which could be confirmed by the evolution of corresponding intermediates fig 6d in addition most of the intermediates decreased until to disappear at the late stage of the reaction meanwhile p d2 and p d3 exhibited a trend that increased at first and then flattened in general most intermediates detected in the reaction process increased at first and then decreased until disappearing and a few increased at first and then flattened out this phenomenon verified that all contaminants could be efficiently removed and transformed into co2 and h2o finally moreover the acute toxicity and bioaccumulation factor of pollutants and their intermediates were predicted with the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t based on qsar fig s26 the results exhibited that the reaction process gradually relieved the toxicity and bioaccumulation factor the catalytic decontamination process efficiently removed contaminants and alleviated their adverse environmental effects conclusion in this study we prepared cufe2o4 diatomite composite by a solvothermal method for pms activation to remove pesticides efficiently among a series of cfd composites cufe2o4 5 diatomite possessed the largest specific surface area 57 20 m2 g 1 3 8 fold larger than cufe2o4 largest pore volume 0 29 cm3 g 1 3 2 fold larger than cufe2o4 and smallest pore diameter 20 19 nm reduced 14 than cufe2o4 5 cfd pms system could achieve 100 removal efficiencies towards multiple pesticides atz dcmu acl and dmt simultaneously within 10 min at 0 10 g l 1 5 cfd and 0 40 g l 1 pms in addition the adverse effect of coexisting substances on the system was 10 illustrating the excellent anti interference ability of the system the excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the excellent electron transfer capacity and the lower charge transfer resistance of 5 cfd which efficiently facilitated charge transfer between 5 cfd and pms and further generated abundant ros meanwhile the cyclic transformation between fe iii fe ii and cu ii cu i ensured continuous generation of ros in which oh 261 3 μm and 1o2 138 8 μm were dominant 1o2 was generated through pms o2 1o2 so4 would convert to oh rapidly all o in ros was derived from pms not do independent of the low solubility of do and slow diffusion rate of o2 in water a total of 35 kinds of intermediates were detected by qtof ms ms combined with dft calculations it was verified that the abundance of most intermediates reached the maximum in turn along the direction of degradation pathway the abundance of the intermediates at the front end of the degradation pathway tended to increase first and then decrease or level off while the abundance of the intermediates at the back end of the degradation pathway tended to increase gradually toxicity evaluation showed that the

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction activated sludge technology has been widely applied in sewage treatment extracellular polymeric substances eps as the boundary between microbial cells and external environment vitally bridge the cells and affect the activated sludge s physical chemical biological functions such as pollutant absorption nutrient transfer floc formation and sludge settling and dewatering liao et al 2001 tang et al 2021 yu 2020 moreover when activated sludge treatment is combined with membrane filtration to form a membrane bioreactor mbr eps would largely influence sludge filterability and membrane fouling ding et al 2015 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2009 therefore it is significant to investigate the properties of eps for robust operation of biological wastewater treatment from the cell surface to the outer environment eps exhibits a stratified structure containing tightly bound eps tb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and soluble eps s eps such different layers of eps play different roles in activated sludge huang et al 2022 shi et al 2017 tb eps adheres to the cell surface through strong interactions liu et al 2010 affecting the

pool of soluble byproducts from microbial activities i e substrate metabolism and cell lysis noguera et al 1994 and is an important source of membrane foulants chen et al 2017 teng et al 2019 wang and waite 2009 organic matters in eps include polysaccharides ps proteins pn humic acids ha nucleic acids and other biopolymers flemming and wingender 2010 liu et al 2012 these substances are important media for sludge floc formation cell signal transmission and enzymatic hydrolysis and are nutrient sources for microorganisms flemming and wingender 2010 previous research has witnessed the chemodiversity and multifunctionality of the eps components using a range of analytical techniques including confocal laser scanning microscopy gel filtration chromatography vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry kunacheva and stuckey 2014 wang et al 2019 2009 zhang et al 2014 2021 the ps pn and ha contents as determined by chromogenic reactions of sugar units peptide bonds and polyphenolic fragments respectively were found to vary across the tb lb s eps liang et al 2010 liu et al 2020 yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 reported that elemental diversity increases from the inner layer tb eps to the outer layer s eps however it was also noted that organic matter in eps is crosslinked in a complex structure ps may well carry some non ps like functional groups e g acetyl amino phosphoric and sulfhydryl and molecular fragments e g uronic acid and peptide chain and so do pn and ha such as glycoprotein and polycaroboxylate type humic acid bourven et al 2015 felz et al 2020 flemming and wingender 2010 yu 2020 intermolecular interactions occur among ps like pn like and ha like segments through hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction ionic bridging and van der waals attraction boleij et al 2018 flemming and wingender 2010 lin et al 2010 myat et al 2014 these complex structures challenge the characterization and understanding of eps however the spatial distribution of the inter component interactions among ps pn ha in eps tb lb s eps has been rarely reported several methods have been applied to observe the inter component interaction among ps pn and ha including vibrational spectroscopy confocal laser scanning microscopy mass spectrometry ms and molecular dynamics simulation myat et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wells et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 these methods can probe the interactions of some functional groups but are less efficient in evaluating the interactions comprehensively and quantitatively spectroscopy based methods e g ultraviolet visible uv vis and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectra enable convenient quick sensitive and non destructive fingerprinting of eps uv vis spectra can characterize unsaturated fatty chains and aromatic structures the absorbance in 200 230 nm could be related to amide bond in pn and carboxyl or carbonyl in other molecules and the absorbance in 240 280 nm could be attributed to aromatic groups in ha side chains of pn or nucleic acids meng et al 2016 wang et al 2019 feem spectra reflect numerous information of organic matter including physical properties e g hydrophobicity and molecular weight chemical properties e g fluorophore related molecular groups redox index and disinfection byproduct formation potential and biological properties e g biodegradability assimilability and humification degree wang et al 2022 yu et al 2020 previous research widely recognized that feem signals are mainly attributed to pn like tryptophan type or tyrosine type and ha like polyaromatic type or polycarboxylate type components and utilized principal component analysis pca or parallel factor analysis parafac to evaluate their spectral contributions by assuming these components are individual and linearly additive chen et al 2003 peiris et al 2010 stedmon et al 2003 however as mentioned above eps organics are highly complex heterogeneous ps may also contribute to feem signals wang and zhang 2010 yu et al 2021 which is often ignored in previous research the inter component structural relations cast fingerprints on the spectra but have yet to be analyzed quantitatively it was shown that combining spectral fingerprints and advanced statistical analysis e g variance partitioning can provide clues to the interactions between components xiao et al 2019 promisingly spectroscopy based methods will add a new dimension to the characterization of eps structure and function which may even provide tools for rapid monitoring and intelligent early warning of wastewater treatment processes in this study we aimed to explore the multi component polymeric architecture across the extracellular boundaries from tb to lb and s eps of an activated sludge using uv vis and feem fingerprints taking sludge in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr as an example wavelength dependent characteristics were revealed by fluorescence quotient fq analysis multiple linear regression mlr models were established between molecular fluorescence and chemical functionality variance portioning analysis vpa was performed to evaluate the individual and joint roles of ps pn ha in fluorescence in different wavelength regions which would enable tracing the cross linkage and interactions among these components in the eps matrix corroborative evidences were provided by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared ftir spectra ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uhplc ms and circular dichroism cd spectra in terms of chemical bonds functional groups primary structure and secondary structure of the polymers accordingly we developed a new method based on spectroscopic fingerprints and multiple statistical analyses to reveal the inter component interactions among ps pn and ha on a quantitative level the results would demonstrate the usefulness of spectroscopic fingerprints for deciphering the fine organic structure of the multi layer eps spheres enveloping the cells of activated sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr operation and sampling the lab scale anmbr consisted of an anaerobic bioreactor and a membrane

at an interval of 5 nm specific ultraviolet absorbance suva was calculated as the absorbance per toc concentration at each wavelength the feem spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer cary eclipse agilent usa over the excitation wavelength ex of 220 400 nm and emission wavelength em of 250 500 nm the fluorescence intensity was scanned at a speed of 2400 nm min with an interval of 5 nm the photomultiplier voltage was 700 v and the slit widths for excitation and emission were both 5 nm the original feem data were pre corrected by successively eliminating milli q water background rayleigh and raman scatterings and inner filter effect ife yu et al 2020 afterwards the intensity was adapted to raman unit r u by dividing the intensity with the raman peak area at ex 350 nm of milli q water yu et al 2020 to ensure the efficacy of ife correction the tb eps samples were diluted to 1 10 of the initial concentration before scanning the uv vis and feem spectra 2 3 chemical measurements suspended solids ss of the mixed liquor were evaluated by a portable tss analyzer tss portable hach usa total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer mutil n c 3100 analytikjena germany during the measurement inorganic carbon was removed by 2 m hcl acidifying and o2 purging while the remaining organic carbon was catalytically oxidized at 800 c to co2 and quantified by non dispersive infrared detection ps concentrations were determined by the sulfuric acid phenol method using glucose coolaber china as a standard dubois et al 1956 pn and ha concentrations were determined by the modified lowry method which is based on the biuret reaction between peptide bonds and copper shen et al 2013 xiao et al 2022 total absorbance a total reaction with cuso4 and blind absorbance a blind reaction without cuso4 at 750 nm were measured to calculate a pn 1 25a total 1 25a blind and a ha a total a pn bovine serum albumin sigma aldrich usa and a reference humic acid aladdin china were employed as pn and ha standards to calibrate the relationship between concentration and absorbance the ha concentration as determined in this study characterizes the soluble sum of humic substances including both the narrow sense humic acid and the fulvic acid 2 4 molecular structure analyses the eps samples were freeze dried at 70 c for 72 h using a freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan the ftir spectra of the freeze dried samples was scanned using a ftir spectrophotometer alpha breaker germany in the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the chemical bonding properties of the freeze dried samples were identified using xps k alpha thermo fisher usa the xps spectra of c o and n elements were analyzed by xpspeak 4 1 software the chiral properties and the secondary tertiary structure of eps in solution were analyzed via cd spectra using a cd spectrophotometer chirascan applied photophysics uk over the wavelength range of 200 300 nm at a scanning rate of 60 nm min and a bandwidth of 1 nm tb eps samples were diluted to 1 10 of the initial concentration before scanning cd spectra ftir spectra and xps were measured in six replicates for each kind of eps and cd spectra was scanned in five replicates uhplc ms was used to analyze the organic composition at molecular level which was performed in a vanquish uhplc system thermo fisher germany coupled with a q exactive hf x hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo fisher germany the uhplc system was equipped with a reversed phase hyperil gold c18 column metabolites of the eps were extracted by following steps 1 a 100 μl liquid sample was resuspended with prechilled 80 methanol lc ms grade thermo usa and 0 1 formic acid fa lc ms grade thermo usa by well vortex 2 the sample was incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 15 000 g for 20 min under 4 c 3 the supernatant was diluted by water lc ms grade merck germany to a final concentration containing 53 methanol and centrifuged again under the same condition 0 1 fa lc ms grade thermo usa and methanol were used as two eluents for the positive polarity mode while 5 mm ammonium acetate and methanol were used as two eluents for the negative polarity mode higher energy collisional dissociation was performed to fragment the eps metabolites by collisions with nitrogen molecules the mass spectrometer was operated in positive negative polarity mode with at a spray voltage of 3 2 kv a capillary temperature of 320 c a sheath gas flow rate of 40 arb and an aux gas flow rate of 10 arb the m z range of 100 1050 was collected to identify the molecular compositions molecular formulae based on additive ions molecular ion peaks and fragment ions were identified with the mzcloud mzvaultand and masslist database 2 5 statistical analyses differences of feem spectra among s eps lb eps and tb eps were analyzed by fq method xiao et al 2018 fluorescence intensity fi was normalized into the range of 0 01 1 00 according to eq 1 1 fi 0 01 0 99 fi f i min f i max f i min where fi is the normalized fluorescence intensity fimin and fi max are the minimum and maximum intensity of a feem spectrum respectively according to eq 2 fqa b was calculated as the logarithm of the division between fi values in two feem spectra a and b at the same wavelength representing the fluorescence difference between a and b 2 f q a b log 10 fi a fi b a contour map of fq as a function of ex and em wavelengths can then be plotted where fqa b 0 denote that a is more prominent than b and vice versa at a given ex em wavelength hence fqs eps lb eps and fqlb eps tb eps were calculated to identify the different fluorescence distribution among s eps lb eps and tb eps this analysis was performed among 27 s eps 22 lb eps and 22 tb eps samples with the significance for fq 0 or fq 0 evaluated by one tailed non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test the regions with above moderate significance p 0 1 were plotted on the ex em map to highlight the difference in feem spectrum between two kinds of eps xiao et al 2018 2019 a wavelength wise mlr was performed taking fi at each ex em position as y and the concentrations of ps pn ha as x 1 x 2 and x 3 vpa was utilized to evaluate the contribution of the x terms to the total r squared r 2 of the mlr model including individual contributions x 1 x 2 and x 3 binary contributions denoted as x 1 x 2 x 1 x 3 and x 2 x 3 and ternary contributions denoted as x 1 x 2 x 3 yu et al 2021 details of the mlr vpa approach can be found in text s1 the wavelength wise model coefficients and r 2 contributions were plotted as contour maps with respect to the ex em coordinates the sample numbers for the above analyses were 22 22 and 27 for tb eps lb eps and s eps respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 general chemical composition and spectroscopic properties the general chemical composition of eps is shown in fig 1 a the total amount of organic matter in tb eps 14 mgtoc gss was over 10 times higher than that in lb eps 0 6 mgtoc gss and s eps 1 3 mgtoc ss the toc concentrations of s eps lb eps and tb eps in the extracted samples were 6 84 3 00 3 49 1 38 79 95 17 59 mg l respectively tb eps samples were diluted to 1 10 of the initial concentration when measuring uv vis and feem spectra the uv absorbances of all eps samples were smaller than 0 1 thus ensuring the efficacy of ife and minimizing the concentration induced disturbance to fluorescence measurement yu et al 2020 the relative contents of organic components ps pn and ha per toc varied across the multiple layers of eps for ps s eps lb eps tb eps for pn tb eps s eps lb eps and for ha s eps lb eps tb eps it can be grossly concluded that ha followed by ps was the primary component in s eps and pn was a prominent contributor to tb eps while lb eps was more evenly contributed by these components with an intermediate composition between s eps and tb eps the ps and pn were mainly derived from microbial metabolism and cell lysis which released to the periphery of cells to form eps liao et al 2001 more et al 2014 since the synthetic influent did not contain ha the ha in eps was most likely also derived from the metabolism of pollutants and cell debris flemming and wingender 2010 wilén et al 2003 notably the error bars indicated the organic component differences of samples caused by the stepwise change of cod in the influent the uv vis absorption spectra of s eps and lb eps were similar fig 1b in which an apparent peak emerged at 270 nm lb eps additionally showed a weak peak at 345 nm for tb eps a strong peak appeared at 255 nm rather than 270 nm the peak at 255 nm was attributed to aromatic rings while the peak at 270 nm was likely attributed to aromatic rings with electron donating substituents such as hydroxyl to narrow the energy gap for light absorption chin et al 1994 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the peak at 345 nm may be attributed to the larger scaled π conjugated chromophore such as large unsaturated aldehydes ketones yan et al 2018 in addition the overall suva of tb eps is lower than that of s eps and lb eps indicating the lower density of light absorbing groups in tb eps the fluorescence intensity per toc as a function of em fig 1c reflects the type of fluorescent chromophore a significant fluorescent peak at em 330 nm and weak peaks at em 260 and 460 nm appeared in s eps compared to s eps lb eps had a similar peak at em 330 nm but a much stronger peak at em 460 nm differently tb eps showed a highest peak at em 370 nm and a prominent shoulder peak at 300 nm in general peaks at em 380 nm represent aromatic pn like substances or soluble microbial byproducts with tryptophan tyrosine like residues while peaks at em 380 nm represent polyphenolic structures such as humic fulvic acids yu et al 2020 these indicate that tb eps was more of pn like containing two major types of pn related structures 370 and 300 nm that were different from the pn like structure 330 nm in s eps and lb eps s eps and lb eps were similar in pn like structure but different in polyphenolic structure the fluorescence intensity per toc as a function of excitation wavelength ex fig s1 reflects the luminescent characteristics of fluorophores at each ex the different excitation peaks reflect that the structures of fluorophores differed among s eps lb eps and tb eps the average fluorescence intensity at each ex was divided by uva to obtain the apparent fluorescence quantum yield which reflects the difference of fluorophore properties and chemical environment lakowicz 2006 wünsch et al 2015 compared to the emission spectra the apparent quantum yield revealed more fingerprinting fluctuations fig 1d the apparent quantum yield of tb eps was overall higher than that of s eps and lb eps which might be related to the larger π conjugated system and less electron withdrawing groups e g carboxyl in tb eps sato et al 2018 yamaguchi et al 2008 a distinct high peak appeared at ex 310 330 nm in tb eps lb eps was featured by a plateau at ex 340 370 nm while s eps was relatively low and peaked at 290 nm for all types of eps the weak peaks at short ex 220 240 nm might correspond to small molecules polypeptide like or fulvic like and those at long ex 360 nm correspond to high molecular weight polymers e g polycarboxylate type humics wang and zhang 2010 yamashita and tanoue 2003 3 2 normalized feem spectra and fq analysis the normalized feem spectra are shown in fig 2 a for all types of eps the strongest peak and the second strongest peak both appeared in the region of em 330 380 nm indicating the prominence of pn like substances related to tryptophan like residues in particular chen et al 2003 compared to s eps and lb eps the em of tb eps showed a red shift of 25 nm probably due to the increase of conjugation degree the π electrons number and the electron donating groups such as hydroxyl alkoxy and amino substituents valeur and berberan santos 2012 the changes in these groups may be attributed to the decomposition of condensed aromatics and degradation of pn in eps dynamics the feem of tb eps showed an obvious shoulder peak with longer ex and a tail toward shorter em next to the secondary peak indicating that the pn like structure in tb eps was more complicated additionally lb eps showed multiple medium strong peaks in the region of em 420 500 nm for ha like fingerprints fluorescent components identified by parafac models also indicate the difference and complexity of organic matter in s eps lb eps and tb eps fig s2 whose details can be found in text s2 the characteristic wavelength regions of feem for these eps were highlighted by fq analysis fig 2b compared to s eps lb eps tended to emit fluorescence at em 400 nm compared to lb eps tb eps tended to emit fluorescence at em 350 400 nm according to non parametric validation the relatively prominent regions of eps on the feem map were summarized in fig 2c tb eps and lb eps dominated the medium wavelength pn like region em 350 400 nm and high wavelength ha like region em 400 nm respectively corroborating the above findings the insignificance in the low wavelength region em 350 nm was due to the shared pn like signals of all eps in this region interestingly s eps prevailed in the low stokes shift band where ex and em are less than 25 nm apart probably reflecting its hydrophilic ps like constituents xiao et al 2019 it can be concluded that the different layers of eps in activated sludge were different in organic composition and structure and the informative feem fingerprints deserve further exploration 3 3 feem fingerprinting models revealing interactions among chemical components at each ex em position a mlr model was established between the fluorescence intensity as y and the chemical components ps pn and ha contents as xs the regression coefficients and their significance of the model were projected onto the feem map fig s3 s5 the coefficient peaks and the significant regions obviously differed among s eps lb eps and tb eps fluorescence that cannot be described by ps pn ha mainly distributed near em 340 nm might be attributed to other substances such as lipids or nonlinearity of the model the average coefficients in the significant regions were summarized and shown in fig 3 a for s eps the coefficient of ps was larger than that of pn although the concentration of ha was the largest among ps pn ha fig 1a the coefficient of ha was weak reflecting the complex chemical composition and factors such as quenching influencing fluorescence for lb eps the coefficient of ps was negligible and the coefficient of pn was larger than that of ha compared to s eps the coefficients of ps and pn were weaker in lb eps but the overall fluorescence per toc was higher fig 1c which may be attributed to the lower content of non fluorescent inert toc in lb eps for tb eps the coefficients of ps and ha were significantly higher than those in s eps and lb eps which may be attributed to the difference in chromophores the fluorescence of ps may derive from the hybridization of ha and pn fragments in the complex molecules vpa is a useful tool to statistically quantify the contribution rates of different variables xs to the outcome y which has been recently utilized in membrane fouling studies guo et al 2020 xu et al 2022 yu et al 2021 in this study vpa was utilized to explore the individual and joint contribution of organic components to the fluorescence intensity as schematically illustrated in fig 3b for s eps ps showed the strongest individual contribution followed by the cross contributions of pn ps and ha ps fig 3c the individual contributions of pn and ha were weak near em 280 and 380 nm respectively it can be inferred that the ps molecules in s eps may well carry pn like and ha like fragments and there are fewer cross links between pn and ha for lb eps however ha and pn showed significant individual contributions at em 380 nm and em ex 30 nm respectively followed by the cross contributions of pn ha and ps pn fig 3d for tb eps the most obvious contribution came from the binary interaction of ha ps and the ternary interaction of ps pn ha followed by the individual ha fig 3e pn and ps pn also contributed weakly to the feem the individual ha in tb eps distributed at shorter em than those in s eps and lb eps reflecting the difference in molecular structure the above results demonstrate the efficacy of feem based statistical analysis in fingerprinting the difference in molecular structure and interactions among the different layers of eps the mlr vpa method particularly quantified the individual and interactive roles of core components in the feem composition relationship it revealed that in s eps ps was the core component crosslinking or interacting with pn and ha separately expressed as pn ps and ha ps ps in eps would incorporate covalently with peptidic moieties to form glycoprotein like substances and noncovalently interact with ha bourven et al 2015 felz et al 2020 flemming and wingender 2010 yu 2020 in lb eps pn was the core component bridging ps and ha separately expressed as ps pn and pn ha pn has been reported to covalently interact with ps and form supramolecular assembly with ha by hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding π π interaction and van der waals forces myat et al 2014 wang et al 2015 well et al 2022 in tb eps the more complicated simultaneous interaction of ps pn ha became prominent as discussed above ps pn and ha would interact with each other indicating that the simultaneous interaction of ps pn ha is inevitable in eps 3 4 further evidences for structural difference across the multi layer eps 3 4 1 chemical bonds and functional groups xps spectra of the c n and o elements differed among the different layers of eps as shown in fig s6 the proportions of the c1s n1s and o1s related chemical bonds are shown in fig 4 a for the c element the proportion of c c c h was ranked as s eps lb eps tb eps c o n oh as tb eps s eps lb eps and o c r n o as tb eps lb eps s eps it can be inferred that the degree of unsaturation was the highest in the innermost layer of eps the variation of the saturated c proportion across the eps layers was consistent with that of ps content in fig 1a for the n element the organic matrix n proportion followed the order tb eps lb eps s eps indicating the highest pn content in tb eps which was identical to fig 1a for the o element the c o versus c o content was the highest in s eps the chemical states of the c n and o elements were quite different in s eps lb eps and tb eps which might be a major reason for the difference in feem fingerprints ftir spectra of the different eps layers were also different as shown in fig 4b the absorbance at each wavelength was divided by the total absorbance area to obtain the relative absorbance the amide i c o stretching signal at 1655 cm 1 liu et al 2015 followed the order tb eps lb eps s eps which was consistent with the pn like fluorescence emission peak em 380 nm in fig 1c however the amide ii cn stretching and cn h bending signal at 1530 cm 1 liu et al 2015 was in the order of lb eps s eps tb eps particularly the intensity ratio of peak 1655 to 1530 cm 1 was tb eps lb eps s eps manifesting the difference in pn structure from the inner to outer layer of eps the peaks at 1200 1350 cm 1 possibly for amide iii cn stretching and cn h bending hayashi and mukamel 2007 or co asymmetric vibration in carboxyls alcohols phenols or esters liu et al 2015 were also different s eps and lb eps showed a similar peak at 1418 cm 1 symmetric stretching of deprotonated carboxyls zhu et al 2012 but different from tb eps the symmetric stretching co signal at 1125 cm 1 possibly associated with amino acids wang et al 2019 was lb eps tb eps s eps whereas the co stretching signal at 1015 cm 1 possibly due to ps like ha like or other substances such as lipids liu et al 2015 was tb eps lb eps s eps the peaks at 900 920 cm 1 co stretching or oh deformation of α 1 4 glycosidic bond related to ribbonlike helices of ps lapasin et al 1995 maddela et al 2018 also differed in shape and position the peak shape distortion might be attributed to the different molecular structure chemical environment interchain interactions e g related to secondary structure and backbone conformation or intermolecular interactions e g between pn and ps guerrero et al 2014 that influence the vibration of the functional groups 3 4 2 secondary and tertiary structures cd spectra reflect the chiral characteristics of biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids the chiral atoms can affect the secondary structure and further the tertiary structure of a biopolymer the raw cd signal at each wavelength was divided by toc and optical length to obtain the specific ellipticity ψ fig 4c the peaks in the lower wavelength range 200 240 nm describe the secondary structure of the main chain of pn kelly et al 2005 ranjbar and gill 2009 the negative peaks at 208 215 nm for s eps and lb eps signify α helical structures the slightly red shift and sharper peak of lb eps toward 215 nm indicate that lb eps might have a higher content of β sheet structures than s eps for tb eps the negative peak at 200 nm suggests irregular structures random coils the peaks in the higher wavelength range 250 300 nm describe the tertiary structure of the side chains tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine or cysteine of pn kelly et al 2005 ranjbar and gill 2009 the tryptophan signal 285 300 nm was stronger in s eps and lb eps than in tb eps the tyrosine signal 270 285 nm was stronger in lb eps whereas the phenylalanine signal 255 270 nm negative was stronger in s eps the s shape curves crossing the axis with positive slopes above 250 nm of s eps and lb eps suggest that the side chains might be in a right handed topology for tb eps however the side chain signals were distributed flatly not specific to a left or right handed topology the above indicate that the tb eps structure was more complex and disordered which might be ascribed to the higher hybridization interaction among the pn ps ha fragments for instance the ps pn ha interaction as highlighted by the feem analysis fig 3e 3 4 3 molecular fragments the uhplc ms dissociated the eps supramolecules and detected the fragments with molecular weights less than 1 kda the m z signals molecular species proportions double bond equivalents dbe and van krevelen vk diagrams are shown in fig 5 more abundant signals were detected in tb eps than in s eps and lb eps for s eps and lb eps negative fragments were concentrated at m z 120 whereas positive fragments were mainly distributed at m z 150 400 for tb eps the distributions were more balanced between positive and negative moieties with the signals peaking at m z 150 200 and spread toward m z 500 fig 5a this indicates that tb eps contained more diverse and larger fragments by reference to the molecular structure database the detected fragments were classified into 10 species i e sugar aromatics sugar nonaromatics amino acids amino acid variants nucleobase likes steroids lipids other aromatics other aliphatics and others fig 5b the proportion of sugar bearing species was the lowest in tb eps amino acids and variants were the highest in tb eps and other aromatics were the highest in s eps which are consistent with the ps pn and ha contents shown in fig 1a lb eps contained more lipids and aliphatics than s eps and tb eps the dbes of aromatics bearing species sugar aromatics and other aromatics were relatively low in s eps fig 5c in agreement with the xps results showing lower degree of unsaturation in s eps fig 4a particularly noteworthy are the sugar aromatics and amino acid variants which evidence the multi component hybridizations of ps and pn respectively sugar aromatics accounted for 2 5 3 7 and 1 2 and amino acid

would largely influence sludge filterability and membrane fouling ding et al 2015 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2009 therefore it is significant to investigate the properties of eps for robust operation

chemodiversity and multifunctionality of the eps components using a range of analytical techniques including confocal laser scanning microscopy gel filtration chromatography vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry kunacheva and stuckey 2014 wang et al 2019 2009 zhang et al 2014 2021 the ps pn and ha contents as determined by chromogenic reactions of sugar units peptide bonds and polyphenolic fragments respectively were found to vary across the tb lb s eps liang et al 2010 liu et al 2020 yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2020 reported that elemental diversity increases from the inner

aromatic structures the absorbance in 200 230 nm could be related to amide bond in pn and carboxyl or carbonyl in other molecules and the absorbance in 240 280 nm could be attributed to aromatic

and humification degree wang et al 2022 yu et al 2020 previous research widely recognized that feem signals are mainly attributed to pn like tryptophan type or tyrosine type and ha like polyaromatic type or polycarboxylate type components and utilized principal component analysis pca or parallel factor analysis parafac to evaluate their spectral contributions by assuming these components are individual and linearly additive chen et al 2003 peiris et al 2010 stedmon et al 2003 however as mentioned above eps organics are highly complex heterogeneous ps may also contribute to feem signals wang and zhang 2010 yu et al 2021 which is often ignored in previous research the inter component structural relations cast fingerprints on the spectra but have yet to be analyzed quantitatively it was shown that combining spectral fingerprints and advanced statistical analysis e g variance partitioning can provide clues to the interactions between components xiao et al 2019 promisingly spectroscopy based methods will add a new dimension to the characterization of eps structure and function which may even provide tools for rapid monitoring and intelligent early warning of wastewater treatment processes in this study we aimed to explore the multi component polymeric architecture across the extracellular boundaries from tb to lb and s eps of an activated sludge using uv vis and feem fingerprints taking sludge in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr as an example wavelength dependent characteristics were revealed by fluorescence quotient fq analysis multiple linear regression mlr models were established between molecular fluorescence and chemical functionality variance portioning analysis vpa was performed to evaluate the individual and joint roles of ps pn ha

bonds functional groups primary structure and secondary structure of the polymers accordingly we developed a new method based on spectroscopic fingerprints and multiple statistical analyses to reveal the inter component interactions among ps pn and ha on a quantitative level the results would demonstrate the usefulness of spectroscopic fingerprints for deciphering the fine organic structure of the multi layer eps spheres enveloping the cells of activated sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr operation and sampling the lab scale anmbr consisted of an anaerobic bioreactor and a membrane

with an interval of 5 nm the photomultiplier voltage was 700 v and the slit widths for excitation and emission were both 5 nm the original feem data were pre corrected by successively eliminating milli q water background rayleigh and raman scatterings and inner filter effect ife yu et al 2020 afterwards the intensity was adapted to raman unit r u by dividing the intensity with the raman peak area at ex 350 nm of milli q water yu et al 2020 to ensure the efficacy of ife correction the tb eps samples were diluted to 1 10 of the initial concentration before scanning the uv vis and feem spectra 2 3 chemical measurements suspended solids ss of the mixed liquor were evaluated by a portable tss analyzer tss portable hach usa total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer

reference humic acid aladdin china were employed as pn and ha standards to calibrate the relationship between concentration and absorbance the ha concentration as determined in this study characterizes the soluble sum of humic substances including both the narrow sense humic acid and the fulvic acid 2 4 molecular structure analyses the eps samples were freeze dried at 70 c for 72 h using a freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan the ftir spectra of the freeze dried samples was scanned using a ftir spectrophotometer alpha breaker germany in the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the chemical bonding properties of the freeze dried samples were identified using xps k alpha thermo fisher usa the xps spectra of c o and n elements were analyzed by xpspeak 4 1 software the chiral properties and the secondary tertiary structure of eps in solution were analyzed via cd spectra using a cd spectrophotometer chirascan applied photophysics uk over the wavelength range of 200 300 nm at a scanning rate of 60 nm min and a bandwidth of 1 nm tb eps samples were diluted to 1 10 of the initial concentration before scanning cd spectra ftir spectra and xps were measured in six replicates for each kind of eps and cd spectra was scanned in five replicates uhplc ms was used to analyze the organic composition at molecular level which was performed in a vanquish uhplc system thermo fisher germany coupled with a q exactive hf x hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer thermo fisher germany the uhplc system was equipped with a reversed phase hyperil gold c18 column metabolites of the eps were extracted by following steps 1 a 100 μl liquid sample was resuspended with prechilled 80 methanol lc ms grade thermo usa and 0 1 formic acid fa lc ms grade thermo usa by well vortex 2 the sample was incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 15 000 g for 20 min under 4 c 3 the supernatant was diluted by water lc ms grade merck germany to a final concentration containing 53 methanol and centrifuged again under the same condition 0 1 fa lc ms grade thermo usa and methanol were used as two eluents for the positive polarity mode while 5 mm ammonium acetate and methanol were used as two eluents for the negative polarity mode higher energy collisional dissociation was performed to fragment the eps metabolites by collisions with nitrogen molecules the mass spectrometer was operated in positive negative polarity mode with at a spray voltage of 3 2 kv a capillary temperature of 320 c a sheath gas flow rate of 40 arb and an aux gas flow rate of 10 arb the m z range of 100 1050 was collected to identify the molecular compositions molecular formulae based on additive ions molecular ion peaks and fragment ions were identified with the mzcloud mzvaultand and masslist database 2 5 statistical analyses differences of feem spectra among s eps lb eps and tb eps were analyzed by fq method xiao et al 2018 fluorescence intensity fi was normalized into the range of 0 01 1 00 according to eq 1 1 fi 0 01 0 99 fi f i min f i max f i min where fi is the normalized fluorescence intensity fimin and fi max are the minimum and maximum intensity of a feem spectrum respectively according to eq 2 fqa b was calculated as the logarithm of the division between fi values in two feem spectra a and b at the same wavelength representing the fluorescence difference between a and b 2 f q a b log 10 fi a fi b a contour map of fq as a function of ex and em wavelengths can then be plotted where fqa b 0 denote that a is more prominent than b and vice versa at a given ex em wavelength hence fqs eps lb eps and fqlb eps tb eps were calculated to identify the different fluorescence distribution among s eps lb eps and tb eps this analysis was performed among 27 s eps 22 lb eps and 22 tb eps samples with the significance for fq 0 or fq 0 evaluated by one tailed non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test the regions with above moderate significance p 0 1 were plotted on the ex em map to highlight the difference in feem spectrum between two kinds of eps xiao et al 2018 2019 a wavelength wise mlr was performed taking fi at each ex em position as y and the concentrations of ps pn ha as x 1 x 2 and x 3 vpa was utilized to evaluate the contribution of the x terms to the total r squared r 2 of the mlr model including individual contributions x 1 x 2 and x 3 binary contributions denoted as x 1 x 2 x 1 x 3 and x 2 x 3 and ternary contributions denoted as x 1 x 2 x 3 yu et al 2021 details of the mlr vpa approach can be found in text s1 the wavelength wise model coefficients and r 2 contributions were plotted as contour maps with respect to the ex em coordinates the sample numbers for the above analyses were 22 22 and 27 for tb eps lb eps and s eps respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 general chemical composition and spectroscopic properties the general chemical composition of eps is shown in fig 1 a the total amount of organic matter in tb eps 14 mgtoc gss was over 10 times higher than that in lb eps 0 6 mgtoc gss and s eps 1 3 mgtoc ss the toc concentrations of s eps lb eps and tb eps in the extracted samples were 6 84 3 00 3 49 1 38 79 95 17 59 mg l respectively tb eps samples were diluted to 1 10 of the initial concentration when measuring uv vis and feem spectra the uv absorbances of all eps samples were smaller than 0 1 thus ensuring the efficacy of ife and minimizing the concentration induced disturbance to fluorescence measurement yu et al 2020 the relative contents of organic components ps pn and ha per toc varied across the multiple layers of eps for ps s eps lb eps tb eps for pn tb eps s eps lb eps and for ha s eps lb eps tb eps it can be grossly concluded that ha followed by ps was the primary component in s eps and pn was a prominent contributor to tb eps while lb eps was more evenly contributed by these components with an intermediate composition between s eps and tb eps the ps and pn were mainly derived from microbial metabolism and cell lysis which released to the periphery of cells to form eps liao et al 2001 more et al 2014 since the synthetic influent did not contain ha the ha in eps was most likely also derived from the metabolism of pollutants and cell debris flemming and wingender 2010 wilén et al 2003 notably the error bars indicated the organic component differences of samples caused by the stepwise change of cod in the influent the uv vis absorption spectra of s eps and lb eps were similar fig 1b in which an apparent peak emerged at 270 nm lb eps additionally showed a weak peak at 345 nm for tb eps a strong peak appeared at 255 nm rather than 270 nm the peak at 255 nm was attributed to aromatic rings while the peak at 270 nm was likely attributed to aromatic rings with electron donating substituents such as hydroxyl to narrow the energy gap for light absorption chin et al 1994 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the peak at 345 nm may be attributed to the larger scaled π conjugated chromophore such as large unsaturated aldehydes ketones yan et al 2018 in addition the overall suva of tb eps is lower than that of s eps and lb eps indicating the lower density of light absorbing groups in tb eps the fluorescence intensity per toc as a function of em fig 1c reflects the type of fluorescent chromophore a significant fluorescent peak at em 330 nm and weak peaks at em 260 and 460 nm appeared in s eps compared to s eps lb eps had a similar peak at em 330 nm but a much stronger peak at em 460 nm differently tb eps showed a highest peak at em 370 nm and a prominent shoulder peak at 300 nm in general peaks at em 380 nm represent aromatic pn like substances or soluble microbial byproducts with tryptophan tyrosine like residues while peaks at em 380 nm represent polyphenolic structures such as humic fulvic acids yu et al 2020 these indicate that tb eps was more of pn like containing two major types of pn related structures 370 and 300 nm that were different from the pn like structure 330 nm in s eps and lb eps s eps and lb eps were similar in pn like structure but different in polyphenolic structure the fluorescence intensity per toc as a function of excitation wavelength ex fig s1 reflects the luminescent characteristics of fluorophores at each ex the different excitation peaks reflect that the structures of fluorophores differed among s eps lb eps and tb eps the average fluorescence intensity at each ex was divided by uva to obtain the apparent fluorescence quantum yield which reflects the difference of fluorophore properties and chemical environment lakowicz 2006 wünsch et al 2015 compared to the emission spectra the apparent quantum yield revealed more fingerprinting fluctuations fig 1d the apparent quantum yield of tb eps was overall higher than that of s eps and lb eps which might be related to the larger π conjugated system and less electron withdrawing groups e g carboxyl in tb eps sato et al 2018 yamaguchi et al 2008 a distinct high peak appeared at ex 310 330 nm in tb eps lb eps was featured by a plateau at ex 340 370 nm while s eps was relatively low and peaked at 290 nm for all types of eps the weak peaks at short ex 220 240 nm might correspond to small molecules polypeptide like or fulvic like and those at long ex 360 nm correspond to high molecular weight polymers e g polycarboxylate type humics wang and zhang 2010 yamashita and tanoue 2003 3 2 normalized feem spectra and fq analysis the normalized feem spectra are shown in fig 2 a for all types of eps the strongest peak and the second strongest peak both appeared in the region of em 330 380 nm indicating the prominence of pn like substances related to tryptophan like residues in particular chen et al 2003 compared to s eps and lb eps the em of tb eps showed a red shift of 25 nm probably due to the increase of conjugation degree the π electrons number and the electron donating groups such as hydroxyl alkoxy and amino substituents valeur and berberan santos 2012 the changes in these groups may be attributed to the decomposition of condensed aromatics and degradation of pn in eps dynamics the feem of tb eps showed an obvious shoulder peak with longer ex and a tail toward shorter em next to the secondary peak indicating that the pn like structure in tb eps was more complicated additionally lb eps showed multiple medium strong peaks in the region of em 420 500 nm for ha like fingerprints fluorescent components identified by parafac models also indicate the difference and complexity of organic matter in s eps lb eps and tb eps fig s2 whose details can be found in text s2 the characteristic wavelength regions of feem for these eps were highlighted by fq analysis fig 2b compared to s eps lb eps tended to emit fluorescence at em 400 nm compared to lb eps tb eps tended to emit fluorescence at em 350 400 nm according to non parametric validation the relatively prominent regions of eps on the feem map were summarized in fig 2c tb eps and lb eps dominated the medium wavelength pn like region em 350 400 nm and high wavelength ha like region em 400 nm respectively corroborating the above findings the insignificance in the low wavelength region em 350 nm was due to the shared pn like signals of all eps in this region interestingly s eps prevailed in the low stokes shift band where ex and em are less than 25 nm apart probably reflecting its hydrophilic ps like constituents xiao et al 2019 it can be concluded that the different layers of eps in activated sludge were different in organic composition and structure and the informative feem fingerprints deserve further exploration 3 3 feem fingerprinting models revealing interactions among chemical components at each ex em position a mlr model was established between the fluorescence intensity as y and the chemical components ps pn and ha contents as xs the regression coefficients and their significance of the model were projected onto the feem map fig s3 s5 the coefficient peaks and the significant regions obviously differed among s eps lb eps and tb eps fluorescence that cannot be described by ps pn ha mainly distributed near em 340 nm might be attributed to other substances such as lipids or nonlinearity of the model the average coefficients in the significant regions were summarized and shown in fig 3 a for s eps the coefficient of ps was larger than that of pn although the concentration of ha was the largest among ps pn ha fig 1a the coefficient of ha was weak reflecting the complex chemical composition and factors such as quenching influencing fluorescence for lb eps the coefficient of ps was negligible and the coefficient of pn was larger than that of ha compared to s eps the coefficients of ps and pn were weaker in lb eps but the overall fluorescence per toc was higher fig 1c which may be attributed to the lower content of non fluorescent inert toc in lb eps for tb eps the coefficients of ps and ha were significantly higher than those in s eps and lb eps which may be attributed to the difference in chromophores the fluorescence of ps may derive from the hybridization of ha and pn fragments in the complex molecules vpa is a useful tool to statistically quantify the contribution rates of different variables xs to the outcome y which has been recently utilized in membrane fouling studies guo et al 2020 xu et al 2022 yu et al 2021 in this study vpa was utilized to explore the individual and joint contribution of organic components to the fluorescence intensity as schematically illustrated in fig 3b for s eps ps showed the strongest individual contribution followed by the cross contributions of pn ps and ha ps fig 3c the individual contributions of pn and ha were weak near em 280 and 380 nm respectively it can be inferred that the ps molecules in s eps may well carry pn like and ha like fragments and there are fewer cross links between pn and ha for lb eps however ha and pn showed significant individual contributions at em 380 nm and em ex 30 nm respectively followed by the cross contributions of pn ha and ps pn fig 3d for tb eps the most obvious contribution came from the binary interaction of ha ps and the ternary interaction of ps pn ha followed by the individual ha fig 3e pn and ps pn also contributed weakly to the feem the individual ha in tb eps distributed at shorter em than those in s eps and lb eps reflecting the difference in molecular structure the above results demonstrate the efficacy of feem based statistical analysis in fingerprinting the difference in molecular structure and interactions among the different layers of eps the mlr vpa method particularly quantified the individual and interactive roles of core components in the feem composition relationship it revealed that in s eps ps was the core component crosslinking or interacting with pn and ha separately expressed as pn ps and ha ps ps in eps would incorporate covalently with peptidic moieties to form glycoprotein like substances and noncovalently interact with ha bourven et al 2015 felz et al 2020 flemming and wingender 2010 yu 2020 in lb eps pn was the core component bridging ps and ha separately expressed as ps pn and pn ha pn has been reported to covalently interact with ps and form supramolecular assembly with ha by hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding π π interaction and van der waals forces myat et al 2014 wang et al 2015 well et al 2022 in tb eps the more complicated simultaneous interaction of ps pn ha became prominent as discussed above ps pn and ha would interact with each other indicating that the simultaneous interaction of ps pn ha is inevitable in eps 3 4 further evidences for structural difference across the multi layer eps 3 4 1 chemical bonds and functional groups xps spectra of the c n and o elements differed among the different layers of eps as shown in fig s6 the proportions of the c1s n1s and o1s related chemical bonds are shown in fig 4 a for the c element the proportion of c c c h was ranked as s eps lb eps tb eps c o n oh as tb eps s eps lb eps and o c r n o as tb eps lb eps s eps it can be inferred that the degree of unsaturation was the highest in the innermost layer of eps the variation of the saturated c proportion across the eps layers was consistent with that of ps content in fig 1a for the n element the organic matrix n proportion followed the order tb eps lb eps s eps indicating the highest pn content in tb eps which was identical to fig 1a for the o element the c o versus c o content was the highest in s eps the chemical states of the c n and o elements were quite different in s eps lb eps and tb eps which might be a major reason for the difference in feem fingerprints ftir spectra of the different eps layers were also different as shown in fig 4b the absorbance at each wavelength was divided by the total absorbance area to obtain the relative absorbance the amide i c o stretching signal at 1655 cm 1 liu et al 2015 followed the order tb eps lb eps s eps which was consistent with the pn like fluorescence emission peak em 380 nm in fig 1c however the amide ii cn stretching and cn h bending signal at 1530 cm 1 liu et al 2015 was in the order of lb eps s eps tb eps particularly the intensity ratio of peak 1655 to 1530 cm 1 was tb eps lb eps s eps manifesting the difference in pn structure from the inner to outer layer of eps the peaks at 1200 1350 cm 1 possibly for amide iii cn stretching and cn h bending hayashi and mukamel 2007 or co asymmetric vibration in carboxyls alcohols phenols or esters liu et al 2015 were also different s eps and lb eps showed a similar peak at 1418 cm 1 symmetric stretching of deprotonated carboxyls zhu et al 2012 but different from tb eps the symmetric stretching co signal at 1125 cm 1 possibly associated with amino acids wang et al 2019 was lb eps tb eps s eps whereas the co stretching signal at 1015 cm 1 possibly due to ps like ha like or other substances such as lipids liu et al 2015 was tb eps lb eps s eps the peaks at 900 920 cm 1 co stretching or oh deformation of α 1 4 glycosidic bond related to ribbonlike helices of ps lapasin et al 1995 maddela et al 2018 also differed in shape and position the peak shape distortion might be attributed to the different molecular structure chemical environment interchain interactions e g related to secondary structure and backbone conformation or intermolecular interactions e g between pn and ps guerrero et al 2014 that influence the vibration of the functional groups 3 4 2 secondary and tertiary structures cd spectra reflect the chiral characteristics of biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids the chiral atoms can affect the secondary structure and further the tertiary structure of a biopolymer the raw cd signal at each wavelength was divided by toc and optical length to obtain the specific ellipticity ψ fig 4c the peaks in the lower wavelength range 200 240 nm describe the secondary structure of the main chain of pn kelly et al 2005 ranjbar and gill 2009 the negative peaks at 208 215 nm for s eps and lb eps signify α helical structures the slightly red shift and sharper peak of lb eps toward 215 nm indicate that lb eps might have a higher content of β sheet structures than s eps for tb eps the negative peak at 200 nm suggests irregular structures random coils the peaks in the higher wavelength range 250 300 nm describe the tertiary structure of the side chains tryptophan tyrosine phenylalanine or cysteine of pn kelly et al 2005 ranjbar and gill 2009 the tryptophan signal 285 300 nm was stronger in s eps and lb eps than in tb eps the tyrosine signal 270 285 nm was stronger in lb eps whereas the phenylalanine signal 255 270 nm negative was stronger in s eps the s shape curves crossing the axis with positive slopes above 250 nm of s eps and lb eps suggest that the side chains might be in a right handed topology for tb eps however the side chain signals were distributed flatly not specific to a left or right handed topology the above indicate that the tb eps structure was more complex and disordered which might be ascribed to the higher hybridization interaction among the pn ps ha fragments for instance the ps pn ha interaction as highlighted by the feem analysis fig 3e 3 4 3 molecular fragments the uhplc ms dissociated the eps supramolecules and detected the fragments with molecular weights less than 1 kda the m z signals molecular species proportions double bond equivalents dbe and van krevelen vk diagrams are shown in fig 5 more abundant signals were detected in tb eps than in s eps and lb eps for s eps and lb eps negative fragments were concentrated at m z 120 whereas positive fragments were mainly distributed at m z 150 400 for tb eps the distributions were more balanced between positive and negative moieties with the signals peaking at m z 150 200 and spread toward m z 500 fig 5a this indicates that tb eps contained more diverse and larger fragments by reference to the molecular structure database the detected fragments were classified into 10 species i e sugar aromatics sugar nonaromatics amino acids amino acid variants nucleobase likes steroids lipids other aromatics other aliphatics and others fig 5b the proportion of sugar bearing species was the lowest in tb eps amino acids and variants were the highest in tb eps and other aromatics were the highest in s eps which are consistent with the ps pn and ha contents shown in fig 1a lb eps contained more lipids and aliphatics than s eps and tb eps the dbes of aromatics bearing species sugar aromatics and other aromatics were relatively low in s eps fig 5c in agreement with the xps results showing lower degree of unsaturation in s eps fig 4a particularly noteworthy are the sugar aromatics and amino acid variants which evidence the multi component hybridizations of ps and pn respectively sugar aromatics accounted for 2 5 3 7 and 1 2 and amino acid variants accounted for 4 7 3 7 and 10 4 in s eps lb eps and tb eps respectively fig 5b their dbes also varied among eps fig 5c reflecting the fine differences of the hybridizations the detailed distributions of the molecular fragments are displayed in vk diagrams fig 5e f tb eps showed overall higher intensity and diversity the average h c ratios were 1 48 1 51 and 1 53 the average o c ratios were 0 28 0 30 and 0 46 and the average n c ratios were 0 07 0 06 and 0 11 for the s eps lb eps and tb eps fragments respectively the average molecular formulae also underlined their structural difference especially for tb eps table s1 specifically some fragments e g hesperidin neohesperidin naringin naringenin and prunin containing both sugar and polyphenol structures were detected signifying the ps ha hybrids some fragments containing both sugar and amino acids in lb eps and tb eps i e lactosyl phenylalanine reflected the ps pn hybrids table s2 these findings corroborate the aforementioned interactive roles of ps pn and ha revealed by the feem fingerprinting models 4 implications it is well known that the polymeric components can interact and crosslink with each other in the matrix of eps bourven et al 2015 flemming and wingender 2010 this study explored the different spectroscopic fingerprints of the multi layer eps s eps lb eps and tb eps and developed a new method combining feem and mlr vpa to quantitatively evaluate the relationships among the multiple components ps pn and ha in the eps architecture the feem modeling analysis sensibly identified the ps ha and ps pn interactions in s eps pn ha and ps pn interactions in lb eps and ps pn ha interaction in tb eps such structural differences were cross validated by xps ftir cd and uhplc ms analyses and the multi component interactions of pn ps and ha ps were proved by uhplc ms analysis the state of being of the ps pn and ha components across the eps layers is illustrated in fig 6 proven to be powerful in revealing the fine details of eps structures the spectroscopic methods feem in particular are more agile sensitive and explicable than many of the other instrumental methods and can readily realize in situ and online monitoring through inferential statistics or machine learning the spectroscopic fingerprints can be informatively deciphered and further related to sludge performances e g biological activity settleability dewaterability and membrane filterability for early warning and smart control of the wastewater treatment process for example significant correlations among the ps pn concentrations fluorescence intensity and membrane fouling were found in s eps fig s7 further research could be conducted to interpret and predict specific sludge parameters e g sludge viscosity sludge volume index capillary suction time oxygen mass transfer coefficient and membrane fouling potential from eps s fundamental properties e g the structural composition and interactions probed by feem vpa the ha can be further distinguished into the narrow sense humic acid and fulvic acid by xad resin chromatography for instance to improve the accuracy and fineness of the inter component interaction among organic matters besides the feem in combination with mlr and vpa method can also be applied to explore the inter component interactions among organic matters in other aquatic systems such as rivers lakes drinking water soil and sludge treatment systems 5 conclusion stratified structure of eps related to organic components in activated sludge was explored using uv vis and feem spectra the uv vis absorbance peaks and suva indicated difference between tb eps and other eps feem peaks and apparent quantum yield further revealed differences in chromophores the prominent fq regions of tb eps lb eps and s eps dominant in em 350 400 nm em 400 nm and em ex 25 nm of the feem map respectively an mlr vpa model was established to predict the feem intensity by ps pn and ha concentrations which revealed the contributions of ps ha and ps pn interactions in s eps pn ha and ps pn interactions in lb eps and ps pn ha interaction in tb eps to fluorescence signals xps ftir and cd spectra provided evidences for the structural characteristics of the stratified eps uhplc ms detected the molecular fragments and corroborated the multi component hybridization of ps pn and ha in eps these findings proved the feasibility of spectroscopic fingerprints to profile the key organic components in multi layer of eps matrix promoting the development of rapid monitoring for sludge

14883,changes in spectral features and molecular weight mw of dissolved organic matter dom along the a a o processes in eight full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps were characterized using size exclusion chromatography with a diode array detector a fluorescence detector and an organic carbon detector in tandem sec dad fld ocd as well as bulk water quality parameters the parallel factor parafac and the nonnegative matrix factorization nmf analyses have been effectively applied to the postprocessing of sec fld fingerprints and sec ocd chromatograms respectively individual sec fld parafac or sec ocd nmf components may span a broad range of mw indicating that these sec fractions within the same component were cognate and varied coherently across the dataset samples the sec fld parafac modeling and sec ocd nmf analysis have clearly and concisely presented that the dramatic decreases of dissolved organic carbon uv absorbance at 254 nm and protein like fluorescence at ex280 em350 nm in the anaerobic process were primarily associated with the degradation of the large mw proteinaceous and polysaccharide like biopolymers it has also revealed that fluorescence of humic acid like fractions increased significantly during the anaerobic process but fluorescence of fulvic acid like and humic substances building blocks decreased slightly laboratory experiments further confirmed the presence of the humification process in anaerobic processes and the formation of humic acid like fluorophores may be associated with carbohydrate metabolism the combination of sec fld parafac and sec ocd nmf helped to establish the links between changes in bulk water quality parameters and the evolution of sec mw fractions which provides a more in depth insight into wastewater dom treatability and enables the optimization of wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords humic substances effluent organic matter soluble microbial product excitation emission matrix biotransformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps poses a significant challenge for wastewater reclamation and reuse as it not only affects membrane fouling chemical and absorbent demands and formation of disinfection byproducts li et al 2014a wu et al 2018 wu et al 2021 zheng et al 2009 but also stimulates the growth of algae and microorganisms in receiving water bodies liu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the secondary effluent dom originates in part from influent wastewater and hydrolysis of particulate components which may vary substantially amongst wwtps due to changes in influent sewage and treatment process efficiency cai et al 2020 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 shi et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wang and chen 2018 on the other hand during biological treatment processes microbes would produce soluble microbial products smps while degrading and consuming labile dom which are the primary components of effluent dom wang and chen 2018 the anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o process is globally one of the most widely used biological sewage treatment processes in municipal wwtps for degradation of organic matter and removal of nutrients however the varied micro environments and microbial communities in the a a o process may affect the degradation of dom and the production of smps wang and chen 2018 therefore a comprehensive illustration of the characteristic microbe mediated dom transformation along the wwtps biological a a o treatment processes is essential with complicated origins the wastewater dom is highly heterogeneous in composition molecular structure and properties which can be further subdivided depending on aromaticity fluorescence characteristics molecular weight mw distribution biodegradability and so on wang and chen 2018 uv absorbance spectra and associated ph titration differential spectra can depict the aromatic properties of dom and the abundance of carboxylic and phenolic like groups huang et al 2019 the three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy illustrates the fluorescence characteristics of dom fluorophores which present fluorescence intensities as a function of excitation ex and emission em wavelengths parallel factor analysis parafac is a multivariate statistical technique that can decompose the three way datasets of eem sample excitation wavelength emission wavelength into their underlying chemical components murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 the eem parafac analysis has proven to be a popular and effective approach for tracking the fluctuations of dom fluorophores in water and wastewater treatment system through mathematical identification and quantification of fluorescent components with independently variable concentrations ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014b size exclusion chromatography sec can characterize apparent mw of dom and the interpretation of sec results is frequently influenced by the nature of data generated by post column detection methods cai et al 2020 although various previous studies have used these analytical methods to investigate the composition and properties of wastewater dom many of these investigations focused on the variations of fluorescence with the different components of dom pan et al 2018 yang et al 2015 yu et al 2013 and few studies have provided a unified description of dom transformation in full scale a a o treatment processes in terms of doc optical properties and mw distribution komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2021 tang et al 2020 thus direct evidence of relationships between changes in bulk water quality parameters e g doc uv254 and fluorescence indices and the evolution of sec mw fractions is currently missing wang and chen 2018 we have recently outfitted the sec system with a diode array detector dad to record uv absorbance spectra a fluorescence detector fld to record the multi emission fluorescence at a given ex wavelength and an online organic carbon detector ocd cai et al 2020 a further chemometric postprocessing of sec chromatograms can decipher the changes in dom that cannot be separated by sec park et al 2021 which enables tracking the microbe mediated dom transformation in wwtps similar to eem spectra the sec fld multi emission fluorescence fingerprints follow the rules of additivity and variability and its dataset is also three way i e sample emission wavelength retention time therefore parafac analysis can also be used to deconvolute the sec fld fingerprints into underlying independent components wünsch et al 2018 the nonnegativity matrix factorization nmf technique is another dimension reduction method for processing nonnegative data with nature of additivity and variability and it can be used to deconvolute the overlapping sec ocd or sec uv254 chromatographic peaks into independently varying components park et al 2021 in addition each deconvoluted sec chromatogram component via parafac or nmf analysis might capture supramolecular assembly and rearrangement of sec fractions that changed in coherent manner in the analyzed wastewater samples this study aims to characterize the mw distribution and spectral features of dom in wastewater and track their transformations along the a a o treatment processes to this end eight full scale wwtps wastewater samples were analyzed by the sec dad fld ocd coupled with parafac and nmf deconvolution as well as the bulk doc uv absorbance and fluorescence eem analyses in addition laboratory a a o experiments fed with synthetic and actual wastewater were utilized to investigate the transformation of various dom components in each treatment unit and to determine the effect of influent substrates on dom transformation 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater samples in this study eight municipal wwtps employing anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o treatment processes with capacities ranging from 20 000 to 375 000 m3 day were investigated table s1 and wastewater samples were collected from influent of wwtp raw wastewater after the fine grid process and effluents of anaerobic tank anoxic tank and oxic tank respectively it is worth noting that there was no precipitation in the five days before sampling and thus there was no rainwater blended in the collected wastewater wastewater samples were immediately transported to laboratories filtered via 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane and stored at 4 c in darkness in addition activated sludge samples were collected for laboratory experiments from the anaerobic anoxic and oxic processes of wwtp a 2 2 laboratory continuous a a o experiments two laboratory continuous experiments were conducted to simulate the a a o biological treatment processes which were respectively fed with the collected raw wastewater from wwtp a test r1 and the synthetic solutions containing glucose test g1 the synthetic solutions were prepared with 15 mg c l of glucose 2 mg l nh3 n and trace elements in tap water each continuous experiment consisted of three continuously stirred tank reactors cstr and one settler and the system temperature was controlled at 25 1 c fig s1 illustrates specifics of the setup after one month of sludge acclimation under steady state conditions samples of suspended liquid were withdrawn from the a a o reactors respectively and filtered for characterization 2 3 analytical methods multi n c 3100 analyzer was used to analyze doc analytik jena germany with agilent 8453 uv visible spectroscopy uv vis absorbance spectra were obtained the hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to measure fluorescence eem spectra spanning an excitation ex wavelength range of 200 400 nm with a 5 nm increment and an emission em wavelength range of 300 500 nm with a 1 nm increment fluorescence intensity at ex280 em350 or ex280 em450 was extracted from eem spectra fig s2 and corrected by the uv absorbance at 280 nm uva280 to eliminate the primary inner filter effect of fluorescence eq 1 which can be utilized to reflect the variations of protein like and humic like fluorophores respectively li et al 2016 1 f c o r r f o b s 10 u v a 280 2 the sec dad fld ocd system was assembled utilizing an agilent 1260 hplc system outfitted with a diode array detector dad agilent 1290 infinity ii g7117b a fluorescence detector fld agilent 1260 infinity ii g1721b and an online organic carbon detector turbo sievers m9sec toc analyzer suez cai et al 2020 a size exclusion column 20 mm 250 mm packed with tsk hw 50s resin material was inserted for molecular weight separation to inhibit ionic interactions between dom and sec resin material the mobile phase was prepared with 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2h2o 2 5 g l kh2po4 phosphate buffer the mobile phase flow rate was set to 1 0 ml min and the injection volume for each sample was 500 μl the dad settings for the multiple absorbance scan were set with a 2 nm wavelength increment from 200 nm to 300 nm the fld parameters for multi emission scan were set with an em wavelength from 300 nm to 500 nm and an ex wavelength fixed at 230 nm li et al 2014b li et al 2013 notably the fld includes a reference diode to record the light intensity passing through the flow cells for automatic correction of inner filter effects of fluorescence dextran standard 60 kda and polyethylene glycol standards peg 20 kda 10 kda 6 kda 2 kda 1 kda 400 da and 200 da from aladdin were used for molecular weight calibration of sec chromatograms via the organic carbon detector 2 4 data processing methods 2 4 1 parafac modeling of sec fld fingerprints the data preprocessing of the sec fld fingerprints before parafac modeling is described as follows firstly the retention times among samples were aligned with bilinear two dimensional interpolation secondly the chromatogram baseline drift and offset were corrected by subtracting a linear baseline fit between the fluorescence intensity of the initial and last retention time for individual chromatograms at each emission wavelength finally the retention time axis was further transformed to apparent mw via the calibration curves besides the 4 8 samples from wwtp a a o treatment process another 27 samples of wwtp wastewater were added into the dataset for parafac modeling table s2 the sec fld dataset was saved as a 3 way matrix of samples apparent mw and emission wavelength according to the published protocols murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 parafac modeling was performed on the preprocessed sec fld dataset using the domfluor toolbox which contains a set of tools i to identify outlier samples ii to test numbers of modeling components with core consistency and residual error diagnostics and iii to validate models by split half analysis 2 4 2 peak fitting and nonnegative matrix factorization of sec ocd chromatograms the sec ocd chromatograms of wastewater samples were analyzed via the peakfit software individually to resolve the overlapping peaks version 4 systat software inc while peak fitting software is capable of performing autofitting algorithms to obtain statistically ideal fits using an unlimited numbers of component peaks it was deemed important for selection of peak number to ensure that the results closely matched dom fractional components log normal 4 area was selected as the best peak type to guarantee that the results closely matched those of the real molecular weight characteristics of dom and its fractional components chow et al 2008 the dataset of sec ocd chromatograms of the 4 8 wwtp wastewater samples were further processed by the nonnegative matrix factorization nmf algorithm using hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm coupled with multiplicative updating algorithm which may deconvolute the overlapped sec chromatograms and capture the inherent common components with coherent variations across the dataset park et al 2021 the sec ocd chromatograms were initially preprocessed by peakfit software for correction of baseline drift the nmf data processing was accomplished with a matlab based graphical user interface software a random initialization was implemented comparable to parafac modeling the split half analysis with euclidean distance sorting was used for cross validation to confirm the robustness and reproducibility of nmf deconvolution and the cosine similarity value and dispersity index were used to determine the number of components 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of bulk water quality parameters along a a o processes the bulk water quality metrics which include doc concentration uva254 ex280 em350 protein like fluorescence and ex280 em450 humic like fluorescence offer a straightforward method for determining the variation of dom along the a a o process in wwtps inferred from the box whisker plots fig 1 the influent dom concentrations in terms of doc uva254 and protein like fluorescence were distributed over a broad range across wwtps whereas the effluent dom concentrations characterized by these parameters were in relatively narrow ranges consistent with the dom variations in wwtp influent and effluent observed by komatsu et al 2020 the average reduction efficiencies of doc uva254 and protein like fluorescence by wwtps were 47 00 78 54 and 75 46 respectively with a large portion attributable to the substantial drops in the anaerobic process recent research on the variation of dom in wastewater along a a o processes over a year also indicated that the anaerobic process played a crucial role in the decrease of doc and the protein like eem parafac component tang et al 2020 in this work however the humic like fluorescence reduced gradually but not considerably along a a o process and showed an increased diversity from influents to effluents this inconsistency between humic like fluorescence and other bulk dom parameters suggests that the changes of dom composition and concentration in wwtps should be investigated in greater depth 3 2 sec dad fld ocd chromatograms of municipal wastewater fig 2 depicts the sec dad fld ocd chromatograms of the representative influent and effluent wastewater samples from wwtp a typically the dad measurement with λ 240 nm quantifies the aromatic functional groups in dom i e chromophores her et al 2002 the fld with a multi emission scan detects protein like fluorescence em 380 nm and humic like fluorescence em 380 nm which are attributed to monocyclic aromatic fluorophores e g aniline and phenol and fused aromatic rings e g naphthols naphthylamine biopterins and flavones li et al 2013 li et al 2015 as it features an online vacuum degassing unit to remove carbonate in acidic ph the ocd primarily responds to dissolved organic carbon her et al 2002 according to their optical properties mw distribution and peak fitting results r2 value 0 985 cai et al 2020 huber et al 2011 dom in the investigated wwtp wastewater were classified into 6 major fractions cai et al 2020 which were defined as biopolymers bp peak 1 humic like acids ha i peak 2 and ha ii peak 3 fulvic like acids fa peak 4 building blocks of humic substances bb peak 5 and neutral or hydrophobic low molecular weight substances lmws peak 6 respectively consistent with the sec characterization of dom in literature the biopolymer fraction typically had an apparent mw 18 kda and exhibited characteristic protein like fluorescence but no noticeable humic like fluorescence in any of the investigated samples cai et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 li et al 2016 this fraction could contain polymeric substances e g polysaccharides and proteins that derived from the hydrolysis of particulate organic matter and smps in sewage laspidou and rittmann 2002 in addition there was a distinct separation between the biopolymer and ha fraction chromatogram peaks in all of the investigated wastewater samples indicating that there were no strong interactions or binds between the macromolecular proteinaceous biopolymers and humic substances in wastewater the apparent mw of ha subfractions ha i and ha ii ranged from 2 6 kda to 4 0 kda and from 4 0 kda to 7 0 kda respectively the apparent mw of fa fraction ranged from 1 3 kda to 2 6 kda both ha and fa fractions exhibited a rather intense uv absorbance at λ 254 nm indicating the presence of aromatic moieties korshin et al 1997 as the residuals or parts from ha or fa fractions the apparent mw of bb fraction ranged from 1 3 kda to the permeability limit of the tsk hw50s column for the lmws fraction sec dad chromatograms exhibited an intense peak with uv absorbance 240 nm which was attributed to the π π transition of nitrate mack and bolton 1999 while the symmetrical peak 6 in the sec ocd chromatogram was attributed to the residual carbonate which had not been completely removed by the inorganic carbon degassing module of ocd cai et al 2020 the sec fld chromatograms showed no traces of fluorescent aromatic organic matter e g tyrosine or tryptophan in the neutral or hydrophobic lmws fraction according to their fluorescence characteristics the ha fa and bb fractions were further classified as humic substances whereas the bp and lmws fractions were classified as non humic substances fig s3 s5 depicts chromatograms of sec uva254 sec fld and sec ocd of wastewater samples from the 8 wwtps which revealed comparable mw fractions of dom along the a a o treatment processes of wwtps non humic proteinaceous biopolymers were decreasing while some humic fractions were increasing indicating that there was a humification process in wwtps treatment processes i e microbes may consume labile dom fractions and meanwhile produce recalcitrant substances wang et al 2021 the application of sec dad fld ocd successfully tracked the underlying transformation of humic like fractions in dom as compared to the bulk eem spectra analysis to clearly and concisely illustrate such transformation of dom along the wwtp a a o treatment processes the sec fld fingerprints and sec ocd chromatograms were subjected to the parafac modeling and the nmf analysis respectively 3 3 variation of sec fld parafac components in a a o treatment processes the sec fld parafac modeling and validation processes are detailed in the table s3 and fig s6 using residual analysis and split half analysis the sec fld fingerprints were decomposed into four components in fig 3 which were listed in the order of fluorescence score both component f1 and f4 showed protein like fluorescence characteristics with em 380 nm ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014b nonetheless component f1 was associated with the large mw proteinaceous biopolymers whereas component f4 may be ascribed to the presence of phenolic or aniline moieties in bb fractions component f2 and f3 exhibited humic like fluorescence with em 380 nm and these components comprised a variety of sec fractions according to their mw distributions component f2 was primarily associated with ha i fraction and a part of ha ii fraction whereas component f3 was associated with fa fraction bb fraction and a part of ha ii fraction the sec fld parafac components could provide more information on mw distribution of fluorophores than typical eem parafac modeling li et al 2014b notably the sec fld parafac components are independent to each other murphy et al 2013 therefore the presence of ha ii fraction in both f2 and f3 components suggests that a portion of ha ii varied alongside with ha i fraction whilst another portion of ha ii varied together with fa and bb fractions in general the sec fld parafac components were unimodal in their emission spectra indicating that the protein like fluorescence and humic like fluorescence varied independently across the dataset samples whereas the sec fld parafac component may comprise a broad range of mw implying that these sec fractions in the same parafac component were cognate and varied coherently across the dataset samples fig 4 provides a statistical summary of the fluctuations in the fluorescence scores of each sec fld parafac component along a a o treatment processes using box whisker plots component f1 showed a dramatical decrease with an averaged value of 46 40 in the anaerobic process and also a significant decrease in the aerobic process consistent with the variation trends of the protein like eem parafac components in a full scale a a o process tang et al 2020 yu et al 2013 whereas the variation of component f4 in the a a o treatment was insignificant indicating that the decreases of the bulk ex280 em350 protein like fluorescence in eem spectra were mainly attributed to the degradation of the large mw proteinaceous biopolymers previous studies have reached a consensus that the humic related eem parafac components were comparatively stable along the full scale a a o process irrespective of change in season tang et al 2020 yang et al 2015 yu et al 2013 nonetheless the sec fld parafac modeling revealed that component f2 demonstrated a considerable increase with an averaged value of 66 68 in anaerobic process whilst component f3 exhibited a slight decrease in anaerobic process as a counterbalance both component f2 and f3 remained rather stable in the following anoxic and oxic processes these variations in fluorescent dom composition and concentration suggest that the humification process happened predominantly in the anaerobic process and was possibly associated with the biodegradation of proteinaceous biopolymers jiang et al 2022 3 4 variation of sec ocd nmf components in a a o treatment processes according to cosine similarity value and dispersity index via nmf analysis and cross validation fig s7 the sec ocd chromatograms of wwtp wastewater samples were deconvoluted into three independent components as shown in fig 5 a observably these sec ocd nmf components covered a range of sec fractions determined by peak fitting techniques indicating that the sec fractions in the same component varied coherently across the dataset samples park et al 2021 component a consisted primarily of the biopolymer fraction peak 1 comparatively to the sec fld parafac analysis component a showed a similar decreasing trend to that of component f1 as component f1 primarily contributed to the ex280 em350 protein like fluorescence this bulk fluorescence parameter might be utilized to estimate the content of biodegradable doc in wastewater samples komatsu et al 2020 component a also comprised a small part of fa and bb fractions peak 4 peak 5 indicating that these fractions of doc with apparent mw 2 5 kda were partially degradable component b was consisted of the majority of ha i fraction peak 2 and parts of ha ii and fa fractions peak 3 and peak 4 which exhibited a similar variation pattern to component f2 therefore the increases of component b were associated with the humification process in anaerobic processes component c which consists of the majority of bb and a part of ha ii and fa fractions remained reasonably steady during anerobic anoxic processes followed by a minor rise during the aerobic process thus component c represents another part of refractory dom in this study the combination of sec fld parafac and sec ocd nmf helped to establish the relationships between changes of bulk water quality parameters and evolution of sec mw fractions in terms of molecular weight optical properties and organic carbon content and provided a clear and concise illustration of dom transformation in full scale a a o treatment processes 3 5 evolution of dom composition and concentration in laboratory a a o experiments by peak fitting the sec uv254 and ocd chromatograms of samples from continuous a a o experiments fed with real test r1 and synthetic test g1 wastewater were resolved and categorized into six primary fractions as stated above fig 6 a b summarize the changes of doc and uv254 absorbance of dom sec fractions during continuous a a o experiments fed with real wastewater respectively the bp fraction displayed a greater decline in ocd chromatograms than in uv254 chromatograms 90 5 vs 76 3 which may be attributable to the degradation of bioploymer polysaccharides with low aromaticity consistent with the humification phenomena found in the full scale wwtp a a o processes the ha fraction was mostly produced in anaerobic anoxic stage and then partially reduced in the aerobic stage in terms of doc concentration and uv254 absorbance as building blocks of humic substances the bb fraction exhibited a similar pattern to that of ha in the sec ocd chromatograms but no significant variations in sec uv254 indicating that no aromatic moieties were produced in bb fraction these phenomena imply that the uv254 suv254 may reflect aromaticity or aromatic components of dom wang and chen 2018 but cannot be used to estimate the biodegradability of dom for the continuous a a o experiment fed with synthetic solution of glucose and ammonia fig 6c d it can be seen that the glucose in the lmws fraction was readily assimilated by the anaerobic activated sludges accompanied by formation of aromatic humic substances but no bp fraction in the anoxic aerobic stage the sec uv254 chromatograms showed that the aromaticity of humic substances increased slightly but their doc concentration did not significantly alter by comparing laboratory experiments fed with synthetic and real wastewater it was possible to conclude that influent substrates had a significant impact on dom transformation however no suitable compounds are available to accurately simulate the large mw proteinaceous biopolymers in real domestic wastewater calling for more in depth investigations in the future in general the formation of bp and ha fraction was primarily connected with the metabolism of carbohydrates in anaerobic process and the formed ha fraction was only minimally degraded by aerobic bacteria 4 conclusions sec dad fld ocd analysis with parafac modeling and nmf analysis were used to decipher changes in the molecular weight distribution and spectral features of wastewater dom along the a a o process in eight full scale wwtps individual sec fld parafac or sec ocd nmf components

nmf analysis have clearly and concisely presented that the dramatic decreases of doc uva254 and protein like fluorescence in the anaerobic process were mainly associated with the degradation of the large mw proteinaceous and polysaccharide like biopolymers it also revealed a trend of increasing fluorescence of ha fractions along with decreasing fluorescence of fa and bb fractions however the

14883,changes in spectral features and molecular weight mw of dissolved organic matter dom along the a a o processes in eight full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps were characterized using size exclusion chromatography with a diode array detector a fluorescence detector and an organic carbon detector in tandem sec dad fld ocd as well as bulk water quality parameters the parallel factor parafac and the nonnegative matrix factorization nmf analyses have been effectively applied to the postprocessing of sec fld fingerprints and sec ocd chromatograms respectively individual sec fld parafac or sec ocd nmf components may span a broad range of mw indicating that these sec fractions within the same component were cognate and varied coherently across the dataset samples the sec fld parafac modeling and sec ocd nmf analysis have clearly and concisely presented that the dramatic decreases of dissolved organic carbon uv absorbance at 254 nm and protein like fluorescence at ex280 em350 nm in the anaerobic process were primarily associated with the degradation of the large mw proteinaceous and polysaccharide like biopolymers it has also revealed that fluorescence of humic acid like fractions increased significantly during the anaerobic process but fluorescence of fulvic acid like and humic substances building blocks decreased slightly laboratory experiments further confirmed the presence of the humification process in anaerobic processes and the formation of humic acid like fluorophores may be associated with carbohydrate metabolism the combination of sec fld parafac and sec ocd nmf helped to establish the links between changes in bulk water quality parameters and the evolution of sec mw fractions which provides a more in depth insight into wastewater dom treatability and enables the optimization of wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords humic substances effluent organic matter soluble microbial product excitation emission matrix biotransformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps poses a significant challenge for wastewater reclamation and reuse as it not only affects membrane fouling chemical and absorbent demands and formation of disinfection byproducts li et al 2014a wu et al 2018 wu et al 2021 zheng et al 2009 but also stimulates the growth of algae and microorganisms in receiving water bodies liu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the secondary effluent dom originates in part from influent wastewater and hydrolysis of particulate components which may vary substantially amongst wwtps due to changes in influent sewage and treatment process efficiency cai et al 2020 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 shi et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wang and chen 2018 on the other hand during biological treatment processes microbes would produce soluble microbial products smps while degrading and consuming labile dom which are the primary components of effluent dom wang and chen 2018 the anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o process is globally one of the most widely used biological sewage treatment processes in municipal wwtps for degradation of organic matter and removal of nutrients however the varied micro environments and microbial communities in the a a o process may affect the degradation of dom and the production of smps wang and chen 2018 therefore a comprehensive illustration of the characteristic microbe mediated dom transformation along the wwtps biological a a o treatment processes is essential with complicated origins the wastewater dom is highly heterogeneous in composition molecular structure and properties which can be further subdivided depending on aromaticity fluorescence characteristics molecular weight mw distribution biodegradability and so on wang and chen 2018 uv absorbance spectra and associated ph titration differential spectra can depict the aromatic properties of dom and the abundance of carboxylic and phenolic like groups huang et al 2019 the three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy illustrates the fluorescence characteristics of dom fluorophores which present fluorescence intensities as a function of excitation ex and emission em wavelengths parallel factor analysis parafac is a multivariate statistical technique that can decompose the three way datasets of eem sample excitation wavelength emission wavelength into their underlying chemical components murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 the eem parafac analysis has proven to be a popular and effective approach for tracking the fluctuations of dom fluorophores in water and wastewater treatment system through mathematical identification and quantification of fluorescent components with independently variable concentrations ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014b size exclusion chromatography sec can characterize apparent mw of dom and the interpretation of sec results is frequently influenced by the nature of data generated by post column detection methods cai et al 2020 although various previous studies have used these analytical methods to investigate the composition and properties of wastewater dom many of these investigations focused on the variations of fluorescence with the different components of dom pan et al 2018 yang et al 2015 yu et al 2013 and few studies have provided a unified description of dom transformation in full scale a a o treatment processes in terms of doc optical properties and mw distribution komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2021 tang et al 2020 thus direct evidence of relationships between changes in bulk water quality parameters e g doc uv254 and fluorescence indices and the evolution of sec mw fractions is currently missing wang and chen 2018 we have recently outfitted the sec system with a diode array detector dad to record uv absorbance spectra a fluorescence detector fld to record the multi emission fluorescence at a given ex wavelength and an online organic carbon detector ocd cai et al 2020 a further chemometric postprocessing of sec chromatograms can decipher the changes in dom that cannot be separated by sec park et al 2021 which enables tracking the microbe mediated dom transformation in wwtps similar to eem spectra the sec fld multi emission fluorescence fingerprints follow the rules of additivity and variability and its dataset is also three way i e sample emission wavelength retention time therefore parafac analysis can also be used to deconvolute the sec fld fingerprints into underlying independent components wünsch et al 2018 the nonnegativity matrix factorization nmf technique is another dimension reduction method for processing nonnegative data with nature of additivity and variability and it can be used to deconvolute the overlapping sec ocd or sec uv254 chromatographic peaks into independently varying components park et al 2021 in addition each deconvoluted sec chromatogram component via parafac or nmf analysis might capture supramolecular assembly and rearrangement of sec fractions that changed in coherent manner in the analyzed wastewater samples this study aims to characterize the mw distribution and spectral features of dom in wastewater and track their transformations along the a a o treatment processes to this end eight full scale wwtps wastewater samples were analyzed by the sec dad fld ocd coupled with parafac and nmf deconvolution as well as the bulk doc uv absorbance and fluorescence eem analyses in addition laboratory a a o experiments fed with synthetic and actual wastewater were utilized to investigate the transformation of various dom components in each treatment unit and to determine the effect of influent substrates on dom transformation 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater samples in this study eight municipal wwtps employing anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o treatment processes with capacities ranging from 20 000 to 375 000 m3 day were investigated table s1 and wastewater samples were collected from influent of wwtp raw wastewater after the fine grid process and effluents of anaerobic tank anoxic tank and oxic tank respectively it is worth noting that there was no precipitation in the five days before sampling and thus there was no rainwater blended in the collected wastewater wastewater samples were immediately transported to laboratories filtered via 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane and stored at 4 c in darkness in addition activated sludge samples were collected for laboratory experiments from the anaerobic anoxic and oxic processes of wwtp a 2 2 laboratory continuous a a o experiments two laboratory continuous experiments were conducted to simulate the a a o biological treatment processes which were respectively fed with the collected raw wastewater from wwtp a test r1 and the synthetic solutions containing glucose test g1 the synthetic solutions were prepared with 15 mg c l of glucose 2 mg l nh3 n and trace elements in tap water each continuous experiment consisted of three continuously stirred tank reactors cstr and one settler and the system temperature was controlled at 25 1 c fig s1 illustrates specifics of the setup after one month of sludge acclimation under steady state conditions samples of suspended liquid were withdrawn from the a a o reactors respectively and filtered for characterization 2 3 analytical methods multi n c 3100 analyzer was used to analyze doc analytik jena germany with agilent 8453 uv visible spectroscopy uv vis absorbance spectra were obtained the hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to measure fluorescence eem spectra spanning an excitation ex wavelength range of 200 400 nm with a 5 nm increment and an emission em wavelength range of 300 500 nm with a 1 nm increment fluorescence intensity at ex280 em350 or ex280 em450 was extracted from eem spectra fig s2 and corrected by the uv absorbance at 280 nm uva280 to eliminate the primary inner filter effect of fluorescence eq 1 which can be utilized to reflect the variations of protein like and humic like fluorophores respectively li et al 2016 1 f c o r r f o b s 10 u v a 280 2 the sec dad fld ocd system was assembled utilizing an agilent 1260 hplc system outfitted with a diode array detector dad agilent 1290 infinity ii g7117b a fluorescence detector fld agilent 1260 infinity ii g1721b and an online organic carbon detector turbo sievers m9sec toc analyzer suez cai et al 2020 a size exclusion column 20 mm 250 mm packed with tsk hw 50s resin material was inserted for molecular weight separation to inhibit ionic interactions between dom and sec resin material the mobile phase was prepared with 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2h2o 2 5 g l kh2po4 phosphate buffer the mobile phase flow rate was set to 1 0 ml min and the injection volume for each sample was 500 μl the dad settings for the multiple absorbance scan were set with a 2 nm wavelength increment from 200 nm to 300 nm the fld parameters for multi emission scan were set with an em wavelength from 300 nm to 500 nm and an ex wavelength fixed at 230 nm li et al 2014b li et al 2013 notably the fld includes a reference diode to record the light intensity passing through the flow cells for automatic correction of inner filter effects of fluorescence dextran standard 60 kda and polyethylene glycol standards peg 20 kda 10 kda 6 kda 2 kda 1 kda 400 da and 200 da from aladdin were used for molecular weight calibration of sec chromatograms via the organic carbon detector 2 4 data processing methods 2 4 1 parafac modeling of sec fld fingerprints the data preprocessing of the sec fld fingerprints before parafac modeling is described as follows firstly the retention times among samples were aligned with bilinear two dimensional interpolation secondly the chromatogram baseline drift and offset were corrected by subtracting a linear baseline fit between the fluorescence intensity of the initial and last retention time for individual chromatograms at each emission wavelength finally the retention time axis was further transformed to apparent mw via the calibration curves besides the 4 8 samples from wwtp a a o treatment process another 27 samples of wwtp wastewater were added into the dataset for parafac modeling table s2 the sec fld dataset was saved as a 3 way matrix of samples apparent mw and emission wavelength according to the published protocols murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 parafac modeling was performed on the preprocessed sec fld dataset using the domfluor toolbox which contains a set of tools i to identify outlier samples ii to test numbers of modeling components with core consistency and residual error diagnostics and iii to validate models by split half analysis 2 4 2 peak fitting and nonnegative matrix factorization of sec ocd chromatograms the sec ocd chromatograms of wastewater samples were analyzed via the peakfit software individually to resolve the overlapping peaks version 4 systat software inc while peak fitting software is capable of performing autofitting algorithms to obtain statistically ideal fits using an unlimited numbers of component peaks it was deemed important for selection of peak number to ensure that the results closely matched dom fractional components log normal 4 area was selected as the best peak type to guarantee that the results closely matched those of the real molecular weight characteristics of dom and its fractional components chow et al 2008 the dataset of sec ocd chromatograms of the 4 8 wwtp wastewater samples were further processed by the nonnegative matrix factorization nmf algorithm using hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm coupled with multiplicative updating algorithm which may deconvolute the overlapped sec chromatograms and capture the inherent common components with coherent variations across the dataset park et al 2021 the sec ocd chromatograms were initially preprocessed by peakfit software for correction of baseline drift the nmf data processing was accomplished with a matlab based graphical user interface software a random initialization was implemented comparable to parafac modeling the split half analysis with euclidean distance sorting was used for cross validation to confirm the robustness and reproducibility of nmf deconvolution and the cosine similarity value and dispersity index were used to determine the number of components 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of bulk water quality parameters along a a o processes the bulk water quality metrics which include doc concentration uva254 ex280 em350 protein like fluorescence and ex280 em450 humic like fluorescence offer a straightforward method for determining the variation of dom along the a a o process in wwtps inferred from the box whisker plots fig 1 the influent dom concentrations in terms of doc uva254 and protein like fluorescence were distributed over a broad range across wwtps whereas the effluent dom concentrations characterized by these parameters were in relatively narrow ranges consistent with the dom variations in wwtp influent and effluent observed by komatsu et al 2020 the average reduction efficiencies of doc uva254 and protein like fluorescence by wwtps were 47 00 78 54 and 75 46 respectively with a large portion attributable to the substantial drops in the anaerobic process recent research on the variation of dom in wastewater along a a o processes over a year also indicated that the anaerobic process played a crucial role in the decrease of doc and the protein like eem parafac component tang et al 2020 in this work however the humic like fluorescence reduced gradually but not considerably along a a o process and showed an increased diversity from influents to effluents this inconsistency between humic like fluorescence and other bulk dom parameters suggests that the changes of dom composition and concentration in wwtps should be investigated in greater depth 3 2 sec dad fld ocd chromatograms of municipal wastewater fig 2 depicts the sec dad fld ocd chromatograms of the representative influent and effluent wastewater samples from wwtp a typically the dad measurement with λ 240 nm quantifies the aromatic functional groups in dom i e chromophores her et al 2002 the fld with a multi emission scan detects protein like fluorescence em 380 nm and humic like fluorescence em 380 nm which are attributed to monocyclic aromatic fluorophores e g aniline and phenol and fused aromatic rings e g naphthols naphthylamine biopterins and flavones li et al 2013 li et al 2015 as it features an online vacuum degassing unit to remove carbonate in acidic ph the ocd primarily responds to dissolved organic carbon her et al 2002 according to their optical properties mw distribution and peak fitting results r2 value 0 985 cai et al 2020 huber et al 2011 dom in the investigated wwtp wastewater were classified into 6 major fractions cai et al 2020 which were defined as biopolymers bp peak 1 humic like acids ha i peak 2 and ha ii peak 3 fulvic like acids fa peak 4 building blocks of humic substances bb peak 5 and neutral or hydrophobic low molecular weight substances lmws peak 6 respectively consistent with the sec characterization of dom in literature the biopolymer fraction typically had an apparent mw 18 kda and exhibited characteristic protein like fluorescence but no noticeable humic like fluorescence in any of the investigated samples cai et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 li et al 2016 this fraction could contain polymeric substances e g polysaccharides and proteins that derived from the hydrolysis of particulate organic matter and smps in sewage laspidou and rittmann 2002 in addition there was a distinct separation between the biopolymer and ha fraction chromatogram peaks in all of the investigated wastewater samples indicating that there were no strong interactions or binds between the macromolecular proteinaceous biopolymers and humic substances in wastewater the apparent mw of ha subfractions ha i and ha ii ranged from 2 6 kda to 4 0 kda and from 4 0 kda to 7 0 kda respectively the apparent mw of fa fraction ranged from 1 3 kda to 2 6 kda both ha and fa fractions exhibited a rather intense uv absorbance at λ 254 nm indicating the presence of aromatic moieties korshin et al 1997 as the residuals or parts from ha or fa fractions the apparent mw of bb fraction ranged from 1 3 kda to the permeability limit of the tsk hw50s column for the lmws fraction sec dad chromatograms exhibited an intense peak with uv absorbance 240 nm which was attributed to the π π transition of nitrate mack and bolton 1999 while the symmetrical peak 6 in the sec ocd chromatogram was attributed to the residual carbonate which had not been completely removed by the inorganic carbon degassing module of ocd cai et al 2020 the sec fld chromatograms showed no traces of fluorescent aromatic organic matter e g tyrosine or tryptophan in the neutral or hydrophobic lmws fraction according to their fluorescence characteristics the ha fa and bb fractions were further classified as humic substances whereas the bp and lmws fractions were classified as non humic substances fig s3 s5 depicts chromatograms of sec uva254 sec fld and sec ocd of wastewater samples from the 8 wwtps which revealed comparable mw fractions of dom along the a a o treatment processes of wwtps non humic proteinaceous biopolymers were decreasing while some humic fractions were increasing indicating that there was a humification process in wwtps treatment processes i e microbes may consume labile dom fractions and meanwhile produce recalcitrant substances wang et al 2021 the application of sec dad fld ocd successfully tracked the underlying transformation of humic like fractions in dom as compared to the bulk eem spectra analysis to clearly and concisely illustrate such transformation of dom along the wwtp a a o treatment processes the sec fld fingerprints and sec ocd chromatograms were subjected to the parafac modeling and the nmf analysis respectively 3 3 variation of sec fld parafac components in a a o treatment processes the sec fld parafac modeling and validation processes are detailed in the table s3 and fig s6 using residual analysis and split half analysis the sec fld fingerprints were decomposed into four components in fig 3 which were listed in the order of fluorescence score both component f1 and f4 showed protein like fluorescence characteristics with em 380 nm ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014b nonetheless component f1 was associated with the large mw proteinaceous biopolymers whereas component f4 may be ascribed to the presence of phenolic or aniline moieties in bb fractions component f2 and f3 exhibited humic like fluorescence with em 380 nm and these components comprised a variety of sec fractions according to their mw distributions component f2 was primarily associated with ha i fraction and a part of ha ii fraction whereas component f3 was associated with fa fraction bb fraction and a part of ha ii fraction the sec fld parafac components could provide more information on mw distribution of fluorophores than typical eem parafac modeling li et al 2014b notably the sec fld parafac components are independent to each other murphy et al 2013 therefore the presence of ha ii fraction in both f2 and f3 components suggests that a portion of ha ii varied alongside with ha i fraction whilst another portion of ha ii varied together with fa and bb fractions in general the sec fld parafac components were unimodal in their emission spectra indicating that the protein like fluorescence and humic like fluorescence varied independently across the dataset samples whereas the sec fld parafac component may comprise a broad range of mw implying that these sec fractions in the same parafac component were cognate and varied coherently across the dataset samples fig 4 provides a statistical summary of the fluctuations in the fluorescence scores of each sec fld parafac component along a a o treatment processes using box whisker plots component f1 showed a dramatical decrease with an averaged value of 46 40 in the anaerobic process and also a significant decrease in the aerobic process consistent with the variation trends of the protein like eem parafac components in a full scale a a o process tang et al 2020 yu et al 2013 whereas the variation of component f4 in the a a o treatment was insignificant indicating that the decreases of the bulk ex280 em350 protein like fluorescence in eem spectra were mainly attributed to the degradation of the large mw proteinaceous biopolymers previous studies have reached a consensus that the humic related eem parafac components were comparatively stable along the full scale a a o process irrespective of change in season tang et al 2020 yang et al 2015 yu et al 2013 nonetheless the sec fld parafac modeling revealed that component f2 demonstrated a considerable increase with an averaged value of 66 68 in anaerobic process whilst component f3 exhibited a slight decrease in anaerobic process as a counterbalance both component f2 and f3 remained rather stable in the following anoxic and oxic processes these variations in fluorescent dom composition and concentration suggest that the humification process happened predominantly in the anaerobic process and was possibly associated with the biodegradation of proteinaceous biopolymers jiang et al 2022 3 4 variation of sec ocd nmf components in a a o treatment processes according to cosine similarity value and dispersity index via nmf analysis and cross validation fig s7 the sec ocd chromatograms of wwtp wastewater samples were deconvoluted into three independent components as shown in fig 5 a observably these sec ocd nmf components covered a range of sec fractions determined by peak fitting techniques indicating that the sec fractions in the same component varied coherently across the dataset samples park et al 2021 component a consisted primarily of the biopolymer fraction peak 1 comparatively to the sec fld parafac analysis component a showed a similar decreasing trend to that of component f1 as component f1 primarily contributed to the ex280 em350 protein like fluorescence this bulk fluorescence parameter might be utilized to estimate the content of biodegradable doc in wastewater samples komatsu et al 2020 component a also comprised a small part of fa and bb fractions peak 4 peak 5 indicating that these fractions of doc with apparent mw 2 5 kda were partially degradable component b was consisted of the majority of ha i fraction peak 2 and parts of ha ii and fa fractions peak 3 and peak 4 which exhibited a similar variation pattern to component f2 therefore the increases of component b were associated with the humification process in anaerobic processes component c which consists of the majority of bb and a part of ha ii and fa fractions remained reasonably steady during anerobic anoxic processes followed by a minor rise during the aerobic process thus component c represents another part of refractory dom in this study the combination of sec fld parafac and sec ocd nmf helped to establish the relationships between changes of bulk water quality parameters and evolution of sec mw fractions in terms of molecular weight optical properties and organic carbon content and provided a clear and concise illustration of dom transformation in full scale a a o treatment processes 3 5 evolution of dom composition and concentration in laboratory a a o experiments by peak fitting the sec uv254 and ocd chromatograms of samples from continuous a a o experiments fed with real test r1 and synthetic test g1 wastewater were resolved and categorized into six primary fractions as stated above fig 6 a b summarize the changes of doc and uv254 absorbance of dom sec fractions during continuous a a o experiments fed with real wastewater respectively the bp fraction displayed a greater decline in ocd chromatograms than in uv254 chromatograms 90 5 vs 76 3 which may be attributable to the degradation of bioploymer polysaccharides with low aromaticity consistent with the humification phenomena found in the full scale wwtp a a o processes the ha fraction was mostly produced in anaerobic anoxic stage and then partially reduced in the aerobic stage in terms of doc concentration and uv254 absorbance as building blocks of humic substances the bb fraction exhibited a similar pattern to that of ha in the sec ocd chromatograms but no significant variations in sec uv254 indicating that no aromatic moieties were produced in bb fraction these phenomena imply that the uv254 suv254 may reflect aromaticity or aromatic components of dom wang and chen 2018 but cannot be used to estimate the biodegradability of dom for the continuous a a o experiment fed with synthetic solution of glucose and ammonia fig 6c d it can be seen that the glucose in the lmws fraction was readily assimilated by the anaerobic activated sludges accompanied by formation of aromatic humic substances but no bp fraction in the anoxic aerobic stage the sec uv254 chromatograms showed that the aromaticity of humic substances increased slightly but their doc concentration did not significantly alter by comparing laboratory experiments fed with synthetic and real wastewater it was possible to conclude that influent substrates had a significant impact on dom transformation however no suitable compounds are available to accurately simulate the large mw proteinaceous biopolymers in real domestic wastewater calling for more in depth investigations in the future in general the formation of bp and ha fraction was primarily connected with the metabolism of carbohydrates in anaerobic process and the formed ha fraction was only minimally degraded by aerobic bacteria 4 conclusions sec dad fld ocd analysis with parafac modeling and nmf analysis were used to decipher changes in the molecular weight distribution and spectral features of wastewater dom along the a a o process in eight full scale wwtps individual sec fld parafac or sec ocd nmf components may cover a broad range of mw indicating that these sec fractions in the same component were cognate and varied in a consistent manner across dataset samples the sec fld parafac modeling and sec ocd nmf analysis have clearly and concisely presented that the dramatic decreases of doc uva254 and protein like fluorescence in the anaerobic process were mainly associated with the degradation of the large mw proteinaceous and polysaccharide like biopolymers it also revealed a trend of increasing fluorescence of ha fractions along with decreasing fluorescence of fa and bb fractions however the bulk humic like fluorescence via eem analysis could not reflect such underlying evolution laboratory continuous a a o experiments further confirmed the presence of the humification process in anaerobic process and the formation of aromatic moieties in ha fraction may be related to the metabolism of carbohydrates declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial

14884,the influence of fe iii on the bioreduction efficiency of cr vi in a microbial fuel cell mfc granular sludge coupling system using dissolved methane as an electron donor and carbon source was explored and the mechanism of fe iii mediating enhancement in the bioreduction process of cr vi in the coupling system was also investigated results showed that the presence of fe iii enhanced the ability of the coupling system to reduce cr vi the average removal efficiencies of cr vi in the anaerobic zone in response to 0 5 and 20 mg l of fe iii were 16 53 2 12 24 17 2 10 and 46 33 4 41 respectively fe iii improved the reducing ability and output power of the system in addition fe iii enhanced the electron transport systems activity of the sludge the polysaccharide and protein content in the anaerobic sludge meanwhile x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps spectra demonstrated that cr vi was reduced to cr iii while fe2p participated in reducing cr vi in the form of fe iii and fe ii proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the dominant phylum in the fe iii enhanced mfc granular sludge coupling system accounting for 49 7 81 83 of the microbial community the relative abundance of syntrophobacter and geobacter increased after adding fe iii indicating that fe iii contributed to the microbial mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane aom and bioreduction of cr vi the genes mcr hdr and mtr were highly expressed in the coupling system after the fe iii concentration increased meanwhile the relative abundances of coo and aacs genes were up regulated by 0 014 and 0 075 respectively overall these findings deepen understanding of the mechanism of the cr vi bioreduction in the mfc granular sludge coupling system driven by methane under the influence of fe iii graphical

1 introduction chromium and its compounds are important raw materials in industrial production and are widely used in industries such as electroplating leather tanning non ferrous metallurgy and chromium pigment production owlad et al 2009 as a result of extensive industrial production and applications chromium is released into the environment as hexavalent chromium cr vi and trivalent chromium cr iii zhang et al 2020 cr iii is the less hazardous of the two and is an essential micronutrient for the body to maintain normal metabolism of glucose fatty acids and minerals li et al 2022 it is usually distributed in the environment as a precipitate or as a complex swaroop et al 2019 in contrast cr vi is 1000 times more toxic than cr iii terpilowska et al 2018 cr vi has high toxicity to all forms of living organisms with a high solubility mobility and bioavailability zhang et al 2020 in addition cr vi is not biodegradable and exposure to chromium containing wastewater can pose a high risk to human health uddin et al 2021 effectively treating cr vi containing wastewater has attracted a great deal of attention in both research and applied environments traditional cr vi wastewater treatment technologies such as chemical reagent reduction precipitation and electrolytic reduction often require large amounts of chemical reagents and electrical energy therefore a trend has emerged to develop new environmentally friendly and sustainable wastewater treatment technologies to reduce costs reduce carbon emissions and recover resources and energy from cr vi wastewater liu et al 2022 compared to conventional chromium pollution treatment technologies biological treatment technologies are economical and environmentally friendly in particular microbial fuel cell mfc is a sustainable biotechnology for treating wastewater the approach removes pollutants from wastewater and generates bioelectricity mfc offers a new way to remove and recover heavy metals from wastewater including cr vi liu et al 2022 zhou et al 2020 for example mu et al 2021 used volcanic rock as a constructed wetland cw mfc filler to maximize cr vi treatment efficiency and bio electric production achieving the following simultaneous outcomes a 99 0 cr vi removal rate 0 595 0 019 v of output voltage and 0 462 w m3 of maximum power density a variety of organic substrates and inorganic substrates have been used as electron donors to reduce microbial cr vi luo et al 2019 shi et al 2019 methane ch4 is a widely used energy source but is also the second largest contributor to global warming after co2 this highlights the need to explore how methane can be used effectively to reduce global carbon emissions in the absence of oxygen methane is oxidized to co2 by reducing bacteria coupled with anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme a process known as the anaerobic oxidation of methane aom bhattarai et al 2019 nie et al 2021 aom is an innovative technology that reduces residual ch4 from wastewater treatment plants contreras et al 2022 in the last decade different electron acceptors have been shown to be involved in aom including sulfate samo and nitrate nitrite damo zhang et al 2022 recent evidence has indicated that aom can be combined with the allosteric reduction of metals such as fe iii and mn iv have been shown to be potential electron acceptors for aom dang et al 2021 ettwig et al 2016 used 13c methane to demonstrate that soluble fe iii and nanoparticle forms of fe iii and mn iv support methane oxidation cai et al 2018 reported that a new archaebacterium candidatus methanoperedens ferrireducens used fe iii as a terminal electron acceptor to independently mediate aom in addition fe iii acts as a potential electron acceptor for aom chen et al 2022 reported that the biochemical reaction of fe iii with no2 and its secondary processes accelerated the transfer of electrons to microbial cells enhancing aom in the reactor lu et al 2016 demonstrated that cr vi reduction was associated with the anaerobic oxidation of methane combined in a laboratory reactor lai et al 2016a and luo et al 2019 demonstrated microbial cr vi reduction in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr with methane as the sole electron donor and carbon source anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria were responsible for methane driven cr vi bioreduction with 95 cr vi removal rate in addition studies have illustrated that in the process of reduction and removal of cr vi by mfc the electrochemically active bacterium such as geobacter could be enriched at the anode and can be coupled with methane oxidizing bacteria this enabled methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction asranudin et al 2022 chen et al 2018 in addition the standard redox potential for the cr vi cr iii half reaction is 221 mv and the standard redox potential for co ch4 is 240 mv this potential difference allows the microorganisms to use methane to transfer electrons to cr vi with sufficient energy to sustain their growth lv et al 2018 however it is not clear whether fe iii reduction in this system drives aom and cr vi reduction through direct or indirect pathways chen et al 2022 adding fe iii enhanced the relative abundance of cr vi and fe iii reducing microorganisms in the microbial community structure with a 1 1 2 6 fold increase in cr vi reduction efficiency ma et al 2022 this demonstrated that fe iii acted as an electron shuttle to improve cr vi reduction in mfcs which occurred through an fe iii mediated mechanism wang et al 2017 fe iii can be used as an electron acceptor for aom and fe iii can be used as an effective electron shuttle medium to enhance the reduction of cr vi in microbial fuel cells wang et al 2017 meanwhile fe iii is also an essential trace metal element for microbial growth and can promote microorganism growth and metabolism herein this study investigated the effect of fe iii dependent methane anaerobic oxidation on the bioreduction of cr vi in the mfc granular sludge coupling system with methane as electron donor and carbon source additionally the mechanism of cr vi bioreduction in the fe iii mediated coupling system was explored from the aspects of electrochemical and physicochemical properties of sludge finally the effects of fe iii on the microecology of the coupling system were evaluated by high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis this study aims to reveal the mechanism of fe iii in the oxidation of methane coupled with cr vi reduction process and to provide an alternative way for the utilization of dissolved methane and the removal of oxidizing pollutants in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge in this study cr vi containing wastewater were prepared as feed water to

inoculation mixing ratio of 5 1 the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss concentration was 32 g l and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss mlss value was 0 75 the inoculum volume was approximately two thirds of the effective volume of each anodic chamber the aerobic sludge for the cathodic chamber was collected from the cyclic activated sludge system cass pond of a wastewater treatment plant in guilin with an inoculum volume that was approximately one third of the effective volume of the cathodic chamber and a mlss concentration of 0 40 g l the inoculated sludge was placed into both the anaerobic anodic chamber and aerobic cathodic chamber and was fed with the prepared synthetic wastewater for domestication the acclimation process was as follows the sludge was placed in the experiment reactor methane 20 ml min was injected into the reactor and the influent cr vi concentration was set as 5 mg l 1 20 d and 10 mg l 21 40 d 2 2 reactor setup and operation anaerobic granular sludge has high treatment performance and rich microbial community which can improve the performance of mfc meanwhile bioelectrochemical system could be beneficial to the aom process therefore anaerobic granular sludge was used as the biocatalysts of mfc anode a multi compartment tandem mfc granular sludge coupling system was constructed for this experiment as shown in fig 1 the system included an anaerobic anode chamber an aerobic cathode chamber an external resistor and a pretreated proton exchange membrane nafion tmn117 dupont usa the system was constructed of polymethyl methacrylate the anaerobic anode chamber 400 80 150 mm was an anaerobic baffled reactor abr with 4 compartments with an effective volume of 3 52 l the compartments were sequentially labeled as compartment 1 compartment 2 compartment 3 and compartment 4 from the inlet to the outlet of the anaerobic section carbon brushes were placed in each compartment as the anode material the aerobic cathodic chamber 400 55 100 mm was a corresponding aerobic tank labeled as chamber 5 with an effective volume of 2 09 l four carbon cloths corresponding to the anodic carbon brushes were used as the

system compartments were dried at 105 c and ground into a powder form the sludge was characterized for surface chemistry and functional groups elemental distribution and the valence state using an escalab 250xi x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermofisher scientific usa the al ka x ray source was used as the excitation source with a power of 150 w a passage energy of 50 0 ev and a step size of 0 1 ev all binding energies were referenced to the c1s 284 8 ev peak to compensate for surface charge effects and were fitted using avantage software 2 4 microbial community structures and metagenomic analysis at the end of the experimental cycle the sludge samples collected from each compartment of the system the 16s rrna microbial taxonomic sequencing technique used to analyze the microbial community structure in the samples was performed by sangon biotech shanghai co ltd the experimental procedure followed four key steps 1 extraction of genomic dna using a mag bind soil dna

analysis of the data was performed to further construct metabolic processes and to predict the function of potential genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe iii on the efficiency of the mfc granular sludge coupling system 3 1 1 effect of fe iii on the efficiency of cr vi reduction to investigate the bioreduction of cr vi in the mfc granular sludge coupling system with different fe iii concentrations the influent cr vi concentration was held steady at about 50 mg l there were three stages of fe iii addition the fe iii concentration was 0 mg l in stage i 5 mg l in stage ii and 20 mg l in stage iii fig 2 shows that the removal rate of cr vi in the anaerobic section without fe iii was 16 53 2 12 and the removal rate of cr vi in the aerobic section was 9 67 2 54 when fe iii was added at a concentration of 5 mg l the cr vi reduction in the anaerobic and aerobic sections increased the cr vi removal rate in the anaerobic section was 24 17 2 10 and the removal rate in the aerobic section was 12 10 3 23 when the fe iii concentration increased to 20 mg l the cr vi removal efficiency increased obviously at a level nearly three times higher compared to when there was no fe iii the cr vi removal rates in the anaerobic and aerobic sections were 46 33 4 41 and 27 80 4 92 respectively in summary adding fe iii into the coupling system led to increase in the cr vi reduction efficiency with the enhancement effect being more pronounced with higher concentrations of fe iii this may be because fe iii is used for anaerobic oxidation with methane to produce fe ii and fe ii reacts with cr vi in a redox reaction to enhance cr vi reduction cai et al 2018 this indicated that cr vi reduction could occur through an indirect fe iii mediated mechanism wang et al 2017 adding fe iii also promotes microorganism growth such as iron reducing bacteria resulting in the biological reduction of cr vi ma et al 2022 in addition fe iii may act as an electron mediator to effectively eliminate the electrical repulsion with the cr2o7 2 anion playing a critical role in achieving enhanced cr vi reduction although the removal rate of cr vi in the coupling reactor was lower than that of a mfc with sodium acetate as carbon source the coupling reactor was driven by methane which expanded the utilization way of dissolved methane lin et al 2023 3 1 2 effect of fe iii on the electrochemical properties to evaluate the electrochemical performance and redox capacity of different compartments in the system cv lsv and eis of each compartment were tested at different fe iii concentrations first cv scan tests were conducted for the anode and cathode solutions of each compartment under the influence of different fe iii concentrations fig 3 the cv curve demonstrated a clear reduction peak potential between 0 5 v and 0 9 v the peak shape of the reduction peak became more significant as the fe iii concentration increased indicating that fe iii enhanced the reduction capacity of cr vi a higher fe iii concentration was associated with a more significant enhancement effect as shown in fig 3a the reduction peak potential of compartment 1 changed from 0 50 v at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 88 v at 20 mg l fe iii this was associated with an increase in the reduction peak current increasing the fe iii concentration also led to a gradual increase in the reduction peak current with average peak currents of 22 70 μa for 0 mg l fe iii 25 19 μa for 5 mg l fe iii and 32 92 μa for 20 mg l fe iii a higher peak current was associated with a better redox performance of the electrode or catalyst this further demonstrated that adding fe iii improved the redox performance of the electrode and biocatalyst in the coupling system facilitating the reduction of cr vi the result also illustrated that the diffusion resistance of the cr vi containing wastewater decreased when the fe iii concentration increased in addition based on the data above the reduction peak potential and the reduction peak current of each compartment increased after adding fe iii this illustrated that the output power of the mfc granular sludge coupling system also increased the lsv was used to assess the effect of fe iii on the electrochemical performance of the coupling system fig s1 there was a steeper slope on the i v curve under test scans at the electrochemical workstation when the fe iii concentration increased with a slope magnitude as follows 20 mg l fe iii 5 mg l fe iii 0 mg l fe iii a higher slope was associated with a lower internal resistance increasing the fe iii concentration reduced the internal resistance promoting electron transfer and transmission and increasing the electrochemical reaction rate of cr vi this may be because fe iii promotes the growth of electrochemically active bacteria a higher count of electrogenic bacteria and higher bacterial activity is associated with an increased degradation of organic matter and more electron production per unit time accelerating the bioreduction of cr vi this enhanced the electrogenic effect of the mfc granular sludge coupling system to further evaluate the electrochemical performance in the mfc granular sludge coupling system eis tests were conducted fig 3 after fe iii was added to the system the charge transfer resistance rct initially increased as the fe iii concentration increased in compartment 1 with rct values of 1987 7 ω with 0 mg l fe iii 2035 1 ω with 5 mg l fe iii and 2367 0 ω with 20 mg l fe iii as the wastewater underwent further biological treatment in the subsequent compartments the rct values changed considerably finally in compartment 5 fig 3e the rct values were 2426 0 ω at 0 mg l fe iii 1718 5 ω at 5 mg l fe iii and 853 2 ω at 20 mg l fe iii the results suggested that the electron transfer capacity of the electrodes was increased by the treatment in each compartment of the coupling system probably because fe iii promoted the continuous growth and enrichment of the electricity producing microorganisms in each compartment this caused the bacteria to form biofilms on the electrode surfaces where the microorganisms became the biocatalysts of the mfc granular sludge coupling system the bacteria use organic matter for metabolism and these microbial reactions reduce their charge transfer resistance this indicates that the eis may be used as a parameter to evaluate microbial activity in the mfc granular sludge coupling system and provides a reference for studying the interaction between bacteria and electrodes 3 2 effect of fe iii on sludge activity in the mfc granular sludge coupling system 3 2 1 effect of fe iii on changes in sludge ets activity to reflect the microbial respiratory activity of sludge under the influence of fe iii int and ttc were used as artificial electron acceptors to detect the ets activity of sludge fig 4 illustrated that adding fe iii increased the int ets activity of the sludge when the fe iii concentration was 20 mg l the int ets activities of sludge in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 were 2 02 0 11 1 17 0 04 4 82 0 70 3 55 0 43 and 1 54 0 13 mg tf g tss h respectively the int ets activity was significantly enhanced compared to the control 0 mg l fe iii the ttc ets of the sludge also showed better activity at fe iii concentration of 20 mg l with activity levels of 4 77 0 05 2 18 0 17 4 29 0 18 2 04 0 21 and 3 22 0 09 mg tf g tss h in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively in contrast microbial and geochemical evidence indicates that fe iii reduction may be the first form of microbial respiration lovley et al 1991 this may have been because fe iii reducing microorganisms e g geobacter spp and shewanella spp solubilize fe iii and release electron shuttles that transfer electrons from the cell surface to participate in the microbial oxidative respiratory chain lovley et al 1991 3 2 2 effect of fe iii on the eps composition of sludge the presence of eps provides microorganisms with a protective layer against harsh external conditions such as heavy metals and toxic organic compounds therefore this study assessed the effect of adding fe iii on the eps composition by measuring the polysaccharide and protein levels of eps adding fe iii increased the polysaccharide and protein levels of lb eps and tb eps in compartments 1 4 of the anaerobic zone fig 5 the highest polysaccharide and protein levels in the lb eps were 2 39 0 32 μg g vss and l6 84 0 54 μg g vss respectively the highest levels in the tb eps reached 2 78 0 47 μg g vss ps and 17 98 0 16 μg g vss pn in contrast there was a decrease in the polysaccharide and protein levels in compartment 5 of the aerobic zone this may be because fe iii was added in the anaerobic zone which was positively charged fe iii promoted eps production and increased microbial activity zhao et al 2023b fe iii was more likely to bind to amino acids with high levels of negatively charged in the proteins therefore they were more likely to stimulate them to secrete more protein this also explains the higher protein levels in eps than in polysaccharides where negatively charged amino acid structures are more involved in the electrostatic bonding of multivalent cations than polysaccharides iron itself is an essential trace element for microorganisms and an active factor in the different enzymes involved in microbial electron transfer ma et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a adding fe iii therefore further promoted the increase of protein content in eps there was a certain correlation between the protein level in the eps fraction and the presence of well settled sludge the high protein level in the eps fraction supports the stabilizing of the aggregate structure and forming an across linked network with neighboring microbial cells through a process similar to microbial flocculation to resist the toxic effects of cr vi lai et al 2016b in addition the pn ps ratio strongly influences sludge stability with a good pn ps ratio contributing to the formation of a stable particle structure of sludge liu et al 2022 fig 5 showed that the pn ps ratio increased up to 7 15 as the fe iii concentration increased as such an increase in the pn ps ratio better ensures the hydrophobicity of the eps and sludge stability which is more conductive to microorganism accumulation and flocculation 3 3 morphological and structural characterization of sludge under the influence of fe iii to further analyze changes in the morphology and structure of the sludge in the mfc granular sludge system coupling with added fe iii the surface elemental valence of the sludge samples at the end of the experimental cycle after adding 20 mg l fe iii was analyzed by using xps fig s2i presents that the cls spectra was dominated by the presence of functional groups in the form of cc ch 284 8 ev co 286 0 286 3 ev and c o 288 2 286 4 ev dong et al 2022 of these cc ch represents an aliphatic aromatic carbon which occupies a large proportion of the spectrogram as the main form of elemental c on the sludge surface and plays an important role in maintaining the structural stability of sludge in contrast the co and c o functional groups are closely related to polysaccharides and proteins respectively li et al 2020 the percentage of co bonds corresponding to polysaccharides was 26 63 26 89 37 98 38 19 and 31 17 in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively meanwhile the percentages of c o bonds related to proteins were 13 41 15 78 11 56 13 73 and 15 04 in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the relative atomic content percentages of co and c o bonds indicate that the percentage of functional groups associated with polysaccharides and proteins increased gradually in subsequent compartments as fe iii was added to the coupling system these results provided additional evidence that fe iii promoted the increase of polysaccharides and proteins level in sludge eps for the cr2p spectra in fig s2ii the binding energies were mainly concentrated at 577 50 ev and 586 80 ev corresponding to cr2p3 2 and cr2p1 2 which were characteristic peaks for soluble cr iii and cr oh 3 respectively luo et al 2019 lai et al 2016a it maybe that fe iii acted as an electron acceptor in the anaerobic oxidation of methane indirectly reducing the highly toxic cr vi to the less toxic cr iii to trace the morphology of fe iii in the sludge after its addition the fe2p spectra was analyzed fig s2iii and peaks were attributed to fe2p3 2 and fe2p1 2 the values 710 4 711 6 ev and 724 5 724 8 ev corresponded to fe ii while 715 0 715 3 ev and 728 1 728 8 ev corresponded to fe iii the peak at 719 8 ev corresponded to the satellite peak zhang et al 2018 jia et al 2018 ma et al 2020 this illustrated that iron cycling occurred throughout the reaction system and the resulting fe ii was further subjected to redox reaction with cr vi through electron transfer and gain loss to reduce cr vi he et al 2023 cai et al 2018 added fe iii containing oxide hydrous ferrite and methane to a laboratory scale bioreactor for long term performance studies in that study l3c and 57fe labeled batch experiments showed that aom combined with the reduction of fe iii to fe ii in the bioreactor cai et al 2018 in addition ettwig et al 2016 used 13c methane to demonstrate that soluble fe iii supported methane oxidation activity with simultaneous fe ii production thus the presence of fe ii in the fe2p spectra indicated the fe iii may be involved in aom process 3 4 effect of fe iii on microbial community structure to investigate the effect of fe iii on the microbial community structure in the mfc granular sludge coupling system 16s rrna microbial taxonomic sequencing was performed on sludge samples from compartments 1 5 at the end of the experimental cycles at 0 mg l fe iii and 20 mg l fe iii concentrations the analysis of the microbial community at the phylum level revealed that proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the main dominant phylum accounting for a significant proportion of the overall microbial community structure in each compartment ranging from approximately 49 7 to 81 83 fig 6 a when the fe iii concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg l the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 42 04 65 40 to 27 83 62 47 while the relative abundance of chloroflexi increased incrementally from 2 13 11 99 to 9 74 25 42 this demonstrated that fe iii facilitated chloroflexi growth some species belonging to chloroflexi were potential participants of direct interspecies electrons transfer diet indicating that adding fe iii could create favorable conditions for diet li et al 2021 in addition the relative abundance of the firmicutes increased from 0 72 1 93 to 0 83 7 58 and thermotogae increased from 0 0 54 to 0 29 4 32 both of these were strains that tend to be present at high cr vi concentrations and both could reduce cr vi zheng et al 2019 the changes in microbial community structure at genus level were further explored fig 6b the dominant genera were syntrophobacter geobacter and thiobacillus the relative abundance of syntrophobacter increased from 0 08 3 15 at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 59 7 00 at 20 mg l fe iii in the operational stage of the coupling system there was also an increase in the relative abundance of the symbiotic bacterium syntrophobacte which is associated with methanogenic bacteria and can participate in diet the relative abundance of geobacter ranged from 0 02 1 23 at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 82 9 37 at 20 mg l fe iii the relative abundance of geobacter increased significantly after adding fe iii geobacter is an electrochemically active bacterium that adhered to the electrode surface in the mfc granular sludge coupling system and is also an iron reducing bacterium luo et al 2021 the fe iii dependent aom was mainly conducted by fe iii reducing bacteria and anme as such the increased relative abundance of geobacter facilitated microbially mediated aom while shinella showed a high abundance 25 40 only in compartment 1 at 0 mg l fe iii with the operation of the coupling system the relative abundance of shinella gradually decreased to 0 009 shinella is mainly used to degrade organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ntougias et al 2015 this illustrated that the mfc granular sludge coupling system had the ability to self regulate as the system operates optimizing the microbial community composition in addition mesotoga which occurs at the genus level increased in relative abundance from 0 0 54 at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 26 4 18 at 20 mg l fe iii thiobacillus could reduce cr vi to cr iii xiao et al 2023 it is classified as a thermotogae a thermophilic microorganism that reduces cr vi zheng et al 2019 3 5 analysis of relevant metabolic pathways under the influence of fe iii to investigate fe iii as a terminal electron acceptor mediated aom the relevant metabolic pathways were analyzed fig 7 and table s1 all genes encoding the reverse methanogenic pathway were present in the anaerobic methane oxidation pathway and the relevant genes mcr hdr mtr mer mtd mch ftr and fwd were expressed in the mfc granular sludge coupling system after increasing the fe iii concentration cai et al 2018 the relative abundances of mcr hdr mtr mer mtd mch ftr and fwd were up regulated by 0 122 0 112 0 275 0 027 0 030 0 029 0 015 and 0 075 respectively these play an important potential role in active methane oxidation and metal respiration in addition the mcr gene encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase and the hdr gene encoding isodisulfide bond reductase are key genes for activating the reverse methanogenic pathway their substantial up regulation and increase in relative abundance facilitated the acceleration of the aom process and the generation of electrons that combined with the cr vi reduction essential for the oxidative growth of methane yan et al 2018 this demonstrated that increasing fe iii concentration further promoted the aom process in the coupling system which enhanced methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction cytochrome c which encodes the gene cytc and which had a relative abundance of 0 045 at 20 mg l fe iii was present in the system and was involved in the direct reduction of fe iii via direct electron transfer meanwhile anme may fix carbon from methane and carbon dioxide via the reductive acetyl coenzyme a pathway while the reductive tricarboxylic acid tca cycle is responsible for synthesizing metabolic intermediates meyerdierks et al 2010 in the reductive acetyl coenzyme a pathway anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase coo and acetyl coenzyme a decarbonylase acs are the key enzymes ji et al 2019 the relative abundances of genes encoding these enzymes coo and acs were up regulated by 0 014 and 0 075 respectively indicating that increasing the concentration of fe iii promotes the production of co2 and acetyl coenzyme a by the action of acetyl coenzyme a decarbonylase this is an essential intermediate for the synthesis of cellular components the reduction of cr vi can also occur through reactions with organic compounds inside and outside the cell such as organic acids amino acids and sugars zhang et al 2021b adding fe iii demonstrated that the genes encoding pyruvate ferric oxidoreductase por pynuvate carboxylase pyc and 2 oxoglutarate ferric oxidoreductase kor remained up regulated in the reduced tca cycle these three por pyc and kor produced intermediate metabolites corresponding to pyruvate oxaloacetate and 2 oxoglutarate respectively indicating that the addition of fe iii promoted its expression and produced some organic acids as intermediate products involved in cr vi reduction overall methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction after the increase in fe iii was the main reduction mode compared to the production of intermediate metabolites for cr vi reduction while also achieving co2 fixation 4 conclusions the present study was designed to determine the effect of fe iii on cr vi bioreduction in the mfc granular sludge coupling system using dissolved methane as an electron donor and carbon source the presence of fe iii enhanced the reduction of cr vi in the mfc granular sludge coupling system with an average cr vi removal efficiency of 16 53 2 12 24 17 2 10 and 46 33 4 41 in the anaerobic section when the fe iii levels were 0 mg l 5 mg l and 20 mg l respectively meanwhile it was indicated that adding fe iii improved the redox capacity and electrochemical performance of the system adding fe iii also enhanced the ets activity of the sludge and promoted the secretion of polysaccharides and proteins in eps chromate bioreduction was mainly in the form of soluble cr iii and cr oh 3 the relative abundance of syntrophobacter and geobacter increased as more fe iii was added indicating it contributes to the fe iii dependent microbial mediated bioreduction of aom and cr vi in addition increasing the fe iii concentration promoted the production of co2 and acetyl coenzyme a through the action of acetyl coenzyme a decarbonylase this study demonstrated the mechanism of fe iii enhances cr vi bioreduction which provides new insights for enhancing the cr vi removal in the mfc granular sludge coupling system driven by methane declaration of competing interest the

14884,the influence of fe iii on the bioreduction efficiency of cr vi in a microbial fuel cell mfc granular sludge coupling system using dissolved methane as an electron donor and carbon source was explored and the mechanism of fe iii mediating enhancement in the bioreduction process of cr vi in the coupling system was also investigated results showed that the presence of fe iii enhanced the ability of the coupling system to reduce cr vi the average removal efficiencies of cr vi in the anaerobic zone in response to 0 5 and 20 mg l of fe iii were 16 53 2 12 24 17 2 10 and 46 33 4 41 respectively fe iii improved the reducing ability and output power of the system in addition fe iii enhanced the electron transport systems activity of the sludge the polysaccharide and protein content in the anaerobic sludge meanwhile x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps spectra demonstrated that cr vi was reduced to cr iii while fe2p participated in reducing cr vi in the form of fe iii and fe ii proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the dominant phylum in the fe iii enhanced mfc granular sludge coupling system accounting for 49 7 81 83 of the microbial community the relative abundance of syntrophobacter and geobacter increased after adding fe iii indicating that fe iii contributed to the microbial mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane aom and bioreduction of cr vi the genes mcr hdr and mtr were highly expressed in the coupling system after the fe iii concentration increased meanwhile the relative abundances of coo and aacs genes were up regulated by 0 014 and 0 075

chromium pigment production owlad et al 2009 as a result of extensive industrial production and applications chromium is released into the environment as hexavalent chromium cr vi and trivalent chromium cr iii zhang et al 2020 cr iii is the less hazardous of the two and is an essential micronutrient for the body to maintain normal metabolism of glucose fatty acids and minerals li et al 2022 it is usually distributed in the environment as a precipitate or as a complex swaroop et al 2019 in contrast cr vi is 1000 times more toxic than cr iii terpilowska et al 2018 cr vi has high toxicity to all forms of living organisms with a high solubility mobility and bioavailability zhang et al 2020 in addition cr vi is not biodegradable and exposure to chromium containing wastewater can pose a high risk to human health uddin et al 2021 effectively treating cr vi containing wastewater has attracted a great deal of attention in both research and applied environments traditional cr vi wastewater treatment technologies such as chemical reagent reduction precipitation and electrolytic reduction often require large amounts of chemical reagents and electrical energy therefore a trend has emerged to develop new environmentally friendly and sustainable wastewater treatment technologies to reduce costs reduce carbon emissions and recover resources and energy from cr vi wastewater liu et al 2022 compared to conventional chromium pollution treatment technologies biological treatment technologies are economical and environmentally friendly in particular microbial fuel cell mfc is a sustainable biotechnology for treating wastewater the approach removes pollutants from wastewater and generates bioelectricity mfc offers a new way to remove and recover heavy metals from wastewater including cr vi liu et al 2022 zhou et al 2020 for example mu et al 2021 used volcanic rock as a constructed wetland cw mfc filler to maximize cr vi treatment efficiency and bio electric production achieving the following simultaneous outcomes a 99 0 cr vi removal rate 0 595 0 019 v of output voltage and 0 462 w m3 of maximum power density a variety of organic substrates and inorganic substrates have been used as electron donors to reduce microbial cr vi luo et al 2019 shi et al 2019 methane ch4 is a widely used energy source but is also the second largest contributor to global warming after co2 this highlights the need to explore how methane can be used effectively to reduce global carbon emissions in the absence of oxygen methane is oxidized to co2 by reducing bacteria coupled with anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme a process known as the anaerobic oxidation of methane aom bhattarai et al 2019 nie et al 2021 aom is an innovative technology that reduces residual ch4 from wastewater treatment plants contreras et al 2022 in the last decade different electron acceptors have been shown to be involved in aom including sulfate samo and nitrate nitrite damo zhang et al 2022 recent evidence has indicated that aom can be combined with the allosteric reduction of metals such as fe iii and mn iv have been shown to be potential electron acceptors for aom dang et al 2021 ettwig et al 2016 used 13c methane to demonstrate that soluble fe iii and nanoparticle forms of fe iii and mn iv support methane oxidation cai et al 2018 reported that a new archaebacterium candidatus methanoperedens ferrireducens used fe iii as a terminal electron acceptor to independently mediate aom in addition fe iii acts as a potential electron acceptor for aom chen et al 2022 reported that the biochemical reaction of fe iii with no2 and its secondary processes accelerated the transfer of electrons to microbial cells enhancing aom in the reactor lu et al 2016 demonstrated that cr vi reduction was associated with the anaerobic oxidation of methane combined in a laboratory reactor lai et al 2016a and luo et al 2019 demonstrated microbial cr vi reduction in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr with methane as the sole electron donor and carbon source anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria were responsible for methane driven cr vi bioreduction with 95 cr vi removal rate in addition studies have illustrated that in the process of reduction and removal of cr vi by mfc the electrochemically active bacterium such as geobacter could be enriched at the anode and can be coupled with methane oxidizing bacteria this enabled methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction asranudin et al 2022 chen et al 2018 in addition the standard redox potential for the cr vi cr iii half reaction is 221 mv and the standard redox potential for co ch4 is 240 mv this potential difference allows the microorganisms to use methane to transfer electrons to cr vi with sufficient energy to sustain their growth lv et al 2018 however it is not clear whether fe iii reduction in this system drives aom and cr vi reduction through direct or indirect pathways chen et al 2022 adding fe iii enhanced the relative abundance of cr vi and fe iii reducing microorganisms in the microbial community structure with a 1 1 2 6 fold increase in cr vi reduction efficiency ma et al 2022 this demonstrated that fe iii acted as an electron shuttle to improve cr vi reduction in mfcs which occurred through an fe iii mediated mechanism wang et al 2017 fe iii can be used as an electron acceptor for aom and fe iii can be used as an effective electron shuttle medium to enhance the reduction of cr vi in microbial fuel cells wang et al 2017 meanwhile fe iii is also an essential trace metal element for microbial growth and can promote microorganism growth and metabolism herein this study investigated the effect of fe iii dependent methane anaerobic oxidation on the bioreduction of cr vi in the mfc granular sludge coupling system with methane as electron donor and carbon source additionally the mechanism of cr vi bioreduction in the fe iii mediated coupling system was explored from the aspects of electrochemical and physicochemical properties of sludge finally the effects of fe iii on the microecology of the coupling system were evaluated by high throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis this study aims to reveal the mechanism of fe iii in the oxidation of methane coupled with cr vi reduction process and to provide an alternative way for the utilization of dissolved methane and the removal of oxidizing pollutants in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge in this study cr vi containing wastewater were prepared as feed water to the mfc granular sludge coupling system which had multiple chambers cr vi was added to the wastewater at 50 mg l in the form of k2cr2o7 cao et al 2021 other wastewater components included kh2po4 0 038

the system the sludge inoculated in the anaerobic anode chamber was collected from the anaerobic granular sludge of a brewery in guilin and the deep substrate of a wetland in guilin with an inoculation mixing ratio of 5 1 the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss concentration was 32 g l and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss mlss value was 0 75 the inoculum volume was approximately two thirds of the effective volume of each anodic chamber the aerobic sludge for the cathodic chamber was collected from the cyclic activated sludge system cass pond of a wastewater treatment plant in guilin with an inoculum volume that was approximately one third of the effective volume of the cathodic chamber and a mlss concentration of 0 40 g l the inoculated sludge was placed into both the anaerobic anodic chamber and aerobic cathodic chamber and was fed with the prepared synthetic wastewater for domestication the acclimation process was as follows the sludge was placed in the experiment reactor methane 20 ml min was injected into the reactor and the influent cr vi concentration was set as 5 mg l 1 20 d and 10 mg l 21 40 d 2 2 reactor setup and operation anaerobic granular sludge has high treatment performance and rich microbial community which can improve the performance of mfc meanwhile bioelectrochemical system could be beneficial to the aom process therefore anaerobic granular sludge was used as the biocatalysts of mfc anode a multi compartment tandem mfc granular sludge coupling system was constructed for this experiment as shown in fig 1 the system included an anaerobic anode chamber an aerobic cathode chamber an external resistor and a pretreated proton exchange membrane nafion tmn117 dupont usa the system was constructed of polymethyl methacrylate the anaerobic anode chamber 400 80 150 mm was an anaerobic baffled reactor abr with 4 compartments with an effective volume of 3 52 l the compartments were sequentially labeled as compartment 1 compartment 2 compartment 3 and compartment 4 from the inlet to the outlet of the anaerobic section carbon brushes were placed in each compartment as the anode material the aerobic cathodic chamber 400 55 100 mm was a corresponding aerobic tank labeled as chamber 5 with an effective volume of 2 09 l four carbon cloths corresponding to the anodic carbon brushes were used as the cathodic material the chamber was equipped with an air pump for cathodic aeration the anaerobic anode chamber and the aerobic cathode chamber were connected by a titanium wire each reactor compartment operated with 1000 ω resistance in the external circuit each compartment was connected to the data acquisition unit by wires and connected to the computer short tubes with an internal diameter of 5 mm were installed on the side walls of reactor compartments 4 and 5 to sample the effluent from the anaerobic anode and aerobic cathode chambers the wastewater treatment process was as follows first the synthetic wastewater was pumped into the anaerobic anode chamber from the lower inlet of the reactor via a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j baoding lange china the wastewater then passed through each compartment of the anaerobic section in sequence and then flowed out the compartment 4 outlet the wastewater then entered the aerobic cathode chamber for further treatment and was finally discharged from the upper outlet of the cathode chamber the hydraulic retention time of the system was 24 h all experiments were conducted at room temperature methane was used as the electron donor in the cr vi contaminated wastewater the ch4 95 and co2 5 mixture was transported to the anaerobic anode chamber and the ch4 flow was controlled by a gas flowmeter horiba d519mg japan at a standard level of 20 ml

voltammetry cv curves of the system were determined as follows first the measurement solution was connected to the electrochemical workstation chi660e chinstruments china through the three electrode

triphenyltetrazolium chloride and int 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyltetrazolium chloride wang et al 2013 cheng et al 2011 loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps of the sludge were extracted from each compartment using a thermal extraction method wang et al 2021 polysaccharide ps of the lb eps and tb eps was measured using an anthrone colorimetric method and protein pn was measured using the bradford method for bovine serum albumin yang et al 2020 sankaran et al 2020 the sludge samples collected from the system compartments were dried at 105 c and ground into a powder form the sludge was characterized for surface chemistry and functional groups elemental distribution and the valence state using an escalab 250xi x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermofisher scientific usa the al ka x ray source was used as the excitation source with a power of 150 w a passage energy of 50 0 ev and a step size of 0 1 ev all binding energies were referenced to the c1s 284 8 ev peak to compensate for surface charge effects and were fitted using avantage software 2 4 microbial community structures and metagenomic analysis at the end of the experimental cycle the sludge samples collected from each compartment of the system the 16s rrna microbial taxonomic sequencing technique used to analyze the microbial community structure in the samples was performed by sangon biotech shanghai co ltd the experimental procedure followed four key steps 1 extraction of genomic dna using a mag bind soil dna kit e z n a omega usa zhao et al 2023a the qubit 3 0 dna assay kit was used to accurately quantify the genomic dna to determine the amount of dna to be added to the polymerase chain reaction pcr 2 pcr

analysis of the data was performed to further construct metabolic processes and to predict the function of potential genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe iii on the efficiency of the mfc granular sludge coupling system 3 1 1 effect of fe iii on the efficiency of cr vi reduction to investigate the bioreduction of cr vi in the mfc granular sludge coupling system with different fe iii concentrations the influent cr vi concentration was held steady at about 50 mg l there were three stages of fe iii addition the fe iii concentration was 0 mg l in stage i 5 mg l in stage ii and 20 mg l in stage iii fig 2 shows that the removal rate of cr vi in the anaerobic section without fe iii was 16 53 2 12 and the removal rate of cr vi in the aerobic section was 9 67 2 54 when fe iii was added at a concentration of 5 mg l the cr vi reduction in the anaerobic and aerobic sections increased the cr vi removal rate in the anaerobic section was 24 17 2 10 and the removal rate in the aerobic section was 12 10 3 23 when the fe iii concentration increased to 20 mg l the cr vi removal efficiency increased obviously at a level nearly three times higher compared to when there was no fe iii the cr vi removal rates in the anaerobic and aerobic sections were 46 33 4 41 and 27 80 4 92 respectively in summary adding fe iii into the coupling system led to increase in the cr vi reduction efficiency with the enhancement effect being more pronounced with higher concentrations of fe iii this may be because fe iii is used for anaerobic oxidation with methane to produce fe ii and fe ii reacts with cr vi in a redox reaction to enhance cr vi reduction cai et al 2018 this indicated that cr vi reduction could occur through an indirect fe iii mediated mechanism wang et al 2017 adding fe iii also promotes microorganism growth such as iron reducing bacteria resulting in the biological reduction of cr vi ma et al 2022 in addition fe iii may act as an electron mediator to effectively eliminate the electrical repulsion with the cr2o7 2 anion playing a critical role in achieving enhanced cr vi reduction although the removal rate of cr vi in the coupling reactor was lower than that of a mfc with sodium acetate as carbon source the coupling reactor was driven by methane which expanded the utilization way of dissolved methane lin et al 2023 3 1 2 effect of fe iii on the electrochemical properties to evaluate the electrochemical performance and redox capacity of different compartments in the system cv lsv and eis of each compartment were tested at different fe iii concentrations first cv scan tests were conducted for the anode and cathode solutions of each compartment under the influence of different fe iii concentrations fig 3 the cv curve demonstrated a clear reduction peak potential between 0 5 v and 0 9 v the peak shape of the reduction peak became more significant as the fe iii concentration increased indicating that fe iii enhanced the reduction capacity of cr vi a higher fe iii concentration was associated with a more significant enhancement effect as shown in fig 3a the reduction peak potential of compartment 1 changed from 0 50 v at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 88 v at 20 mg l fe iii this was associated with an increase in the reduction peak current increasing the fe iii concentration also led to a gradual increase in the reduction peak current with average peak currents of 22 70 μa for 0 mg l fe iii 25 19 μa for 5 mg l fe iii and 32 92 μa for 20 mg l fe iii a higher peak current was associated with a better redox performance of the electrode or catalyst this further demonstrated that adding fe iii improved the redox performance of the electrode and biocatalyst in the coupling system facilitating the reduction of cr vi the result also illustrated that the diffusion resistance of the cr vi containing wastewater decreased when the fe iii concentration increased in addition based on the data above the reduction peak potential and the reduction peak current of each compartment increased after adding fe iii this illustrated that the output power of the mfc granular sludge coupling system also increased the lsv was used to assess the effect of fe iii on the electrochemical performance of the coupling system fig s1 there was a steeper slope on the i v curve under test scans at the electrochemical workstation when the fe iii concentration increased with a slope magnitude as follows 20 mg l fe iii 5 mg l fe iii 0 mg l fe iii a higher slope was associated with a lower internal resistance increasing the fe iii concentration reduced the internal resistance promoting electron transfer and transmission and increasing the electrochemical reaction rate of cr vi this may be because fe iii promotes the growth of electrochemically active bacteria a higher count of electrogenic bacteria and higher bacterial activity is associated with an increased degradation of organic matter and more electron production per unit time accelerating the bioreduction of cr vi this enhanced the electrogenic effect of the mfc granular sludge coupling system to further evaluate the electrochemical performance in the mfc granular sludge coupling system eis tests were conducted fig 3 after fe iii was added to the system the charge transfer resistance rct initially increased as the fe iii concentration increased in compartment 1 with rct values of 1987 7 ω with 0 mg l fe iii 2035 1 ω with 5 mg l fe iii and 2367 0 ω with 20 mg l fe iii as the wastewater underwent further biological treatment in the subsequent compartments the rct values changed considerably finally in compartment 5 fig 3e the rct values were 2426 0 ω at 0 mg l fe iii 1718 5 ω at 5 mg l fe iii and 853 2 ω at 20 mg l fe iii the results suggested that the electron transfer capacity of the electrodes was increased by the treatment in each compartment of the coupling system probably because fe iii promoted the continuous growth and enrichment of the electricity producing microorganisms in each compartment this caused the bacteria to form biofilms on the electrode surfaces where the microorganisms became the biocatalysts of the mfc granular sludge coupling system the bacteria use organic matter for metabolism and these microbial reactions reduce their charge transfer resistance this indicates that the eis may be used as a parameter to evaluate microbial activity in the mfc granular sludge coupling system and provides a reference for studying the interaction between bacteria and electrodes 3 2 effect of fe iii on sludge activity in the mfc granular sludge coupling system 3 2 1 effect of fe iii on changes in sludge ets activity to reflect the microbial respiratory activity of sludge under the influence of fe iii int and ttc were used as artificial electron acceptors to detect the ets activity of sludge fig 4 illustrated that adding fe iii increased the int ets activity of the sludge when the fe iii concentration was 20 mg l the int ets activities of sludge in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 were 2 02 0 11 1 17 0 04 4 82 0 70 3 55 0 43 and 1 54 0 13 mg tf g tss h respectively the int ets activity was significantly enhanced compared to the control 0 mg l fe iii the ttc ets of the sludge also showed better activity at fe iii concentration of 20 mg l with activity levels of 4 77 0 05 2 18 0 17 4 29 0 18 2 04 0 21 and 3 22 0 09 mg tf g tss h in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively in contrast microbial and geochemical evidence indicates that fe iii reduction may be the first form of microbial respiration lovley et al 1991 this may have been because fe iii reducing microorganisms e g geobacter spp and shewanella spp solubilize fe iii and release electron shuttles that transfer electrons from the cell surface to participate in the microbial oxidative respiratory chain lovley et al 1991 3 2 2 effect of fe iii on the eps composition of sludge the presence of eps provides microorganisms with a protective layer against harsh external conditions such as heavy metals and toxic organic compounds therefore this study assessed the effect of adding fe iii on the eps composition by measuring the polysaccharide and protein levels of eps adding fe iii increased the polysaccharide and protein levels of lb eps and tb eps in compartments 1 4 of the anaerobic zone fig 5 the highest polysaccharide and protein levels in the lb eps were 2 39 0 32 μg g vss and l6 84 0 54 μg g vss respectively the highest levels in the tb eps reached 2 78 0 47 μg g vss ps and 17 98 0 16 μg g vss pn in contrast there was a decrease in the polysaccharide and protein levels in compartment 5 of the aerobic zone this may be because fe iii was added in the anaerobic zone which was positively charged fe iii promoted eps production and increased microbial activity zhao et al 2023b fe iii was more likely to bind to amino acids with high levels of negatively charged in the proteins therefore they were more likely to stimulate them to secrete more protein this also explains the higher protein levels in eps than in polysaccharides where negatively charged amino acid structures are more involved in the electrostatic bonding of multivalent cations than polysaccharides iron itself is an essential trace element for microorganisms and an active factor in the different enzymes involved in microbial electron transfer ma et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a adding fe iii therefore further promoted the increase of protein content in eps there was a certain correlation between the protein level in the eps fraction and the presence of well settled sludge the high protein level in the eps fraction supports the stabilizing of the aggregate structure and forming an across linked network with neighboring microbial cells through a process similar to microbial flocculation to resist the toxic effects of cr vi lai et al 2016b in addition the pn ps ratio strongly influences sludge stability with a good pn ps ratio contributing to the formation of a stable particle structure of sludge liu et al 2022 fig 5 showed that the pn ps ratio increased up to 7 15 as the fe iii concentration increased as such an increase in the pn ps ratio better ensures the hydrophobicity of the eps and sludge stability which is more conductive to microorganism accumulation and flocculation 3 3 morphological and structural characterization of sludge under the influence of fe iii to further analyze changes in the morphology and structure of the sludge in the mfc granular sludge system coupling with added fe iii the surface elemental valence of the sludge samples at the end of the experimental cycle after adding 20 mg l fe iii was analyzed by using xps fig s2i presents that the cls spectra was dominated by the presence of functional groups in the form of cc ch 284 8 ev co 286 0 286 3 ev and c o 288 2 286 4 ev dong et al 2022 of these cc ch represents an aliphatic aromatic carbon which occupies a large proportion of the spectrogram as the main form of elemental c on the sludge surface and plays an important role in maintaining the structural stability of sludge in contrast the co and c o functional groups are closely related to polysaccharides and proteins respectively li et al 2020 the percentage of co bonds corresponding to polysaccharides was 26 63 26 89 37 98 38 19 and 31 17 in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively meanwhile the percentages of c o bonds related to proteins were 13 41 15 78 11 56 13 73 and 15 04 in compartments 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the relative atomic content percentages of co and c o bonds indicate that the percentage of functional groups associated with polysaccharides and proteins increased gradually in subsequent compartments as fe iii was added to the coupling system these results provided additional evidence that fe iii promoted the increase of polysaccharides and proteins level in sludge eps for the cr2p spectra in fig s2ii the binding energies were mainly concentrated at 577 50 ev and 586 80 ev corresponding to cr2p3 2 and cr2p1 2 which were characteristic peaks for soluble cr iii and cr oh 3 respectively luo et al 2019 lai et al 2016a it maybe that fe iii acted as an electron acceptor in the anaerobic oxidation of methane indirectly reducing the highly toxic cr vi to the less toxic cr iii to trace the morphology of fe iii in the sludge after its addition the fe2p spectra was analyzed fig s2iii and peaks were attributed to fe2p3 2 and fe2p1 2 the values 710 4 711 6 ev and 724 5 724 8 ev corresponded to fe ii while 715 0 715 3 ev and 728 1 728 8 ev corresponded to fe iii the peak at 719 8 ev corresponded to the satellite peak zhang et al 2018 jia et al 2018 ma et al 2020 this illustrated that iron cycling occurred throughout the reaction system and the resulting fe ii was further subjected to redox reaction with cr vi through electron transfer and gain loss to reduce cr vi he et al 2023 cai et al 2018 added fe iii containing oxide hydrous ferrite and methane to a laboratory scale bioreactor for long term performance studies in that study l3c and 57fe labeled batch experiments showed that aom combined with the reduction of fe iii to fe ii in the bioreactor cai et al 2018 in addition ettwig et al 2016 used 13c methane to demonstrate that soluble fe iii supported methane oxidation activity with simultaneous fe ii production thus the presence of fe ii in the fe2p spectra indicated the fe iii may be involved in aom process 3 4 effect of fe iii on microbial community structure to investigate the effect of fe iii on the microbial community structure in the mfc granular sludge coupling system 16s rrna microbial taxonomic sequencing was performed on sludge samples from compartments 1 5 at the end of the experimental cycles at 0 mg l fe iii and 20 mg l fe iii concentrations the analysis of the microbial community at the phylum level revealed that proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes were the main dominant phylum accounting for a significant proportion of the overall microbial community structure in each compartment ranging from approximately 49 7 to 81 83 fig 6 a when the fe iii concentration increased from 0 to 20 mg l the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from 42 04 65 40 to 27 83 62 47 while the relative abundance of chloroflexi increased incrementally from 2 13 11 99 to 9 74 25 42 this demonstrated that fe iii facilitated chloroflexi growth some species belonging to chloroflexi were potential participants of direct interspecies electrons transfer diet indicating that adding fe iii could create favorable conditions for diet li et al 2021 in addition the relative abundance of the firmicutes increased from 0 72 1 93 to 0 83 7 58 and thermotogae increased from 0 0 54 to 0 29 4 32 both of these were strains that tend to be present at high cr vi concentrations and both could reduce cr vi zheng et al 2019 the changes in microbial community structure at genus level were further explored fig 6b the dominant genera were syntrophobacter geobacter and thiobacillus the relative abundance of syntrophobacter increased from 0 08 3 15 at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 59 7 00 at 20 mg l fe iii in the operational stage of the coupling system there was also an increase in the relative abundance of the symbiotic bacterium syntrophobacte which is associated with methanogenic bacteria and can participate in diet the relative abundance of geobacter ranged from 0 02 1 23 at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 82 9 37 at 20 mg l fe iii the relative abundance of geobacter increased significantly after adding fe iii geobacter is an electrochemically active bacterium that adhered to the electrode surface in the mfc granular sludge coupling system and is also an iron reducing bacterium luo et al 2021 the fe iii dependent aom was mainly conducted by fe iii reducing bacteria and anme as such the increased relative abundance of geobacter facilitated microbially mediated aom while shinella showed a high abundance 25 40 only in compartment 1 at 0 mg l fe iii with the operation of the coupling system the relative abundance of shinella gradually decreased to 0 009 shinella is mainly used to degrade organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ntougias et al 2015 this illustrated that the mfc granular sludge coupling system had the ability to self regulate as the system operates optimizing the microbial community composition in addition mesotoga which occurs at the genus level increased in relative abundance from 0 0 54 at 0 mg l fe iii to 0 26 4 18 at 20 mg l fe iii thiobacillus could reduce cr vi to cr iii xiao et al 2023 it is classified as a thermotogae a thermophilic microorganism that reduces cr vi zheng et al 2019 3 5 analysis of relevant metabolic pathways under the influence of fe iii to investigate fe iii as a terminal electron acceptor mediated aom the relevant metabolic pathways were analyzed fig 7 and table s1 all genes encoding the reverse methanogenic pathway were present in the anaerobic methane oxidation pathway and the relevant genes mcr hdr mtr mer mtd mch ftr and fwd were expressed in the mfc granular sludge coupling system after increasing the fe iii concentration cai et al 2018 the relative abundances of mcr hdr mtr mer mtd mch ftr and fwd were up regulated by 0 122 0 112 0 275 0 027 0 030 0 029 0 015 and 0 075 respectively these play an important potential role in active methane oxidation and metal respiration in addition the mcr gene encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase and the hdr gene encoding isodisulfide bond reductase are key genes for activating the reverse methanogenic pathway their substantial up regulation and increase in relative abundance facilitated the acceleration of the aom process and the generation of electrons that combined with the cr vi reduction essential for the oxidative growth of methane yan et al 2018 this demonstrated that increasing fe iii concentration further promoted the aom process in the coupling system which enhanced methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction cytochrome c which encodes the gene cytc and which had a relative abundance of 0 045 at 20 mg l fe iii was present in the system and was involved in the direct reduction of fe iii via direct electron transfer meanwhile anme may fix carbon from methane and carbon dioxide via the reductive acetyl coenzyme a pathway while the reductive tricarboxylic acid tca cycle is responsible for synthesizing metabolic intermediates meyerdierks et al 2010 in the reductive acetyl coenzyme a pathway anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase coo and acetyl coenzyme a decarbonylase acs are the key enzymes ji et al 2019 the relative abundances of genes encoding these enzymes coo and acs were up regulated by 0 014 and 0 075 respectively indicating that increasing the concentration of fe iii promotes the production of co2 and acetyl coenzyme a by the action of acetyl coenzyme a decarbonylase this is an essential intermediate for the synthesis of cellular components the reduction of cr vi can also occur through reactions with organic compounds inside and outside the cell such as organic acids amino acids and sugars zhang et al 2021b adding fe iii demonstrated that the genes encoding pyruvate ferric oxidoreductase por pynuvate carboxylase pyc and 2 oxoglutarate ferric oxidoreductase kor remained up regulated in the reduced tca cycle these three por pyc and kor produced intermediate metabolites corresponding to pyruvate oxaloacetate and 2 oxoglutarate respectively indicating that the addition of fe iii promoted its expression and produced some organic acids as intermediate products involved in cr vi reduction overall methane oxidation coupled with cr vi reduction after the increase in fe iii was the main reduction mode compared to the production of intermediate metabolites for cr vi reduction while also achieving co2 fixation 4 conclusions the present study was designed to determine the effect of fe iii on cr vi bioreduction in the mfc granular sludge coupling system using dissolved methane as an electron donor and carbon source the presence of fe iii enhanced the reduction of cr vi in the mfc granular sludge coupling system with an average cr vi removal efficiency of 16 53 2 12 24 17 2 10 and 46 33 4 41 in the anaerobic section when the fe iii levels were 0 mg l 5 mg l and 20 mg l respectively meanwhile it was indicated that adding fe iii improved the redox capacity and electrochemical performance of the system adding fe iii also enhanced the ets activity of the sludge and promoted the secretion of polysaccharides and proteins in eps chromate bioreduction was mainly in the form of soluble cr iii and cr oh 3 the relative abundance of syntrophobacter and geobacter increased as more fe iii was added indicating it contributes to the fe iii dependent microbial mediated bioreduction of aom and cr vi in addition increasing the fe iii concentration promoted the production of co2 and acetyl coenzyme a through the action of acetyl coenzyme a decarbonylase this study demonstrated the mechanism of fe iii enhances cr vi bioreduction which provides new insights for enhancing the cr vi removal in the mfc granular sludge coupling system driven by methane declaration of competing interest the
