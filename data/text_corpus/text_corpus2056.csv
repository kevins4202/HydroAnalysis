ck group 4 the effects of aerated irrigation ai on the growth photosynthesis quality biomass yield wue and soc of the tomatoes as well as the soil microorganisms were consistent such that o3 o2 o1 ck but their levels of significance differed slightly when the do of the irrigation water was increased the soc increased indirectly the soil environment was improved and the growth of the tomato plants increased moreover these effects were also conducive to improved wue and tomato quality and efficiency this study provides a new irrigation model and a theoretical basis for the popularization of greenhouse crop cultivation keywords drip irrigation under mulch aerated irrigation oxygen content dry matter accumulation soil enzyme activity relationship between yield and quality 1 introduction tomatoes which are a popular vegetable species are highly nutritious as such how to achieve high yields and improve tomato quality have become goals for many researchers the root system of the plant needs sufficient amounts of oxygen for aerobic respiration both to maintain its own metabolism and to maintain the growth and development of the entire plant in agricultural production traditional irrigation methods such as drip irrigation provide water to crops and simultaneously squeeze out the air in the soil to a certain extent when the soil has a high water content not only is the amount of air within soil pores low but also more importantly water blocks the movement of air the blockage of atmospheric gas prevents the oxygen in the atmosphere from replenishing that which is consumed by soil respiration in a timely manner hypoxia decreases root respiration resulting in a shift from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration root growth subsequently stops and ion transport slows the root sap flow becomes out of sync which in turn affects the growth of the entire plant lu et al 2012 the higher the soil moisture content the smaller the stomatal ratio leading to a longer and more zigzaging oxygen migration path hillel 1998 and the lower the effective diffusion coefficient de of oxygen mbonimpa et al 2011 aerated irrigation ai can effectively improve the oxygen environment in the root zone increase the length of fine roots increase the vitality of the root system improve the physiological function of plants indirectly improve water use efficiency wue increase plant growth and increase crop yields li et al 2016b therefore to distinguish from other aeration methods it is important to study the effects of do on the tomato plants as well as on the soil microorganisms by applying irrigation water to increase the do concentration previous studies have shown that current ai techniques focus mainly on their impact on crop growth quality and yield for example zhu et al 2017 reported that the lycopene content vitamin c vc content soluble sugar content and sugar acid ratio of tomato fruits increased significantly under drip irrigation compared with those under non aerated drip irrigation zhu et al 2017 reported that the wue of tomatoes under ai increased by 19 3 compared with that under aerated drip irrigation liu et al 2019 showed that micro nanobubble water oxidation could significantly improve the yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fruit quality of tomatoes p 0 05 compared with those under no aeration the tomato yield iwue vc content and soluble sugar content under micro nanobubble water oxidation increased by 16 9 16 9 17 7 and 39 2 respectively du et al 2019 reported that ai can significantly increase tomato yields zhu et al 2016 reported that compared with those under non aerated irrigation the iwue yield per plant and individual fruit quality increased by 23 12 23 12 and 29 84 respectively under ai similarly wen et al 2014 reported that compared with those under non ai the tomato yield under ai increased by 19 49 chen et al 2018 reported that compared with those in the control ck treatment group the yield wue and carbon footprint of tomatoes in the ai treatment group increased significantly by 32 0 32 0 and 24 0 on average respectively bhattarai et al 2006 showed that the aeration treated tomato fruit yield increased by 21 compared with that of the ck current research on ai of tomato plants has focused mainly on growth niu et al 2013 yield li et al 2016a shang et al 2020 quality wen et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 and soil environment with no systematic or comprehensive research conducted to date in addition most of these studies were are conducted only once thus there is a lack of replicated studies to verify the research results to more comprehensively and systematically study the mechanism by which ai affects the growth photosynthesis quality yield and wue of tomatoes as well as the soil microbes this study accurately investigated the growth photosynthesis yield and quality of tomatoes in different climates with different do concentrations based on previous studies deng 2018 ouyang 2018 2019 2020 zhao et al 2019 the micro nano aeration method for irrigation water was used to conduct a two year comparative test in a solar greenhouse this study clarified the mechanism by which different levels of do affect improvements in tomato quality revealed the aerobic irrigation law of tomatoes and identified the best do parameters under the conditions of this experiment thus

p 0 01 the influence of do on these quality indicators was consistent the vc content soluble sugar content lycopene content soluble solids content and total acid content of tomato fruits increased

the ck the o3 treatment increased the yield iwue wue and wueint by 15 09 15 06 34 97 and 28 70 respectively the results of these two years of research indicate that do has a significant effect on yield iwue and wue p 0 01 moreover the effects of do on the yield iwue wue and wueint were consistent each index increased with increasing do in the irrigation water which indicated that increased do concentrations in irrigation water can increase tomato yield and wue to a certain extent 3 7 effects of different do concentrations on soil oxygen content table 11 shows the effects of different do treatments on the soc the increases in the soc under the different do treatments were such that o3 o2 o1 ck compared with that in the ck the o3 treatment increased the soc by 50 97 and 53 34 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the results of these two years of research indicate that do has a significant effect on the soc p 0 01 the influence of do on the soc was consistent the soc increased with increasing do concentrations indicating that increased do concentrations in irrigation water can increase the soil oxygen content to a certain extent furthermore based on the real time monitoring data of both the do and soc of the irrigation water in 2018 the average soc value corresponding to the different levels of do was calculated and the relationship between the do x and soc y of the irrigation water was established as follows y 1 288 x 7 617 r2 0 9953 the measured data were verified in 2019 and the error between the measured values and the predicted values was analysed the average relative error was 2 less than 5 indicating that the linear equation was reliable and had a good predictive ability the relationship between the do concentration in the irrigation water and the soc is shown in fig 1 4 discussion micro nano bubbles typically refer to bubbles whose diameters are less than 50 µm because micro nanobubbles are extremely small they have unique properties that differ from those of ordinary bubbles they persist for a long time in irrigation water have a high mass transfer efficiency and are stable and durable li et al 2012 the fragmentation of nanobubbles will generate shock waves which in turn promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals which are highly reactive oxygen species ahmed et al 2018 these facts may explain why air bubbles easily adhere to the root surface of plants alter the adsorption characteristics of the root surface and improve nutrient absorption 4 1 tomato plants growth oxygen is important for plants to absorb nutrients because it carries them to the cell walls and roots as more oxygen is absorbed by the roots nutrient uptake improves ahmed et al 2018 root hypoxia causes rapid increases in phytohormones such as abscisic acid aba and ethylene leading to the closure of leaf stomata and a decrease in the a which affects the production of atp and thus affects crop growth zhu et al 2017 the results of this experiment showed that increasing the do concentration indirectly increased the oxygen content of the soil table 11 and a mathematical relationship between the do and the soc was derived fig 1 zhang et al 2017 showed that the growth rate plant height stem diameter and leaf area per plant of tomato plants under micro nano ai were significantly higher than those under conventional irrigation these findings are consistent with the conclusion that both plant height and stem diameter increase with increasing do concentration zang et al 2018 in addition the results of this experiment also showed that the lai was positively correlated with do concentration table 3 4 2 tomato plants photosynthesis and da previous studies have shown that aeration treatment can increase the soc by 2 4 32 6 which can effectively alleviate hypoxic stress in the root zone and may in turn cause a decrease in the aba concentration in plants to a certain extent and an increase the gsw of the leaves chen et al 2011 the results from the two years of research in this study showed that increased do concentrations can increase the gsw a and da of tomato plants this occurs is because as the do increases the gsw ci a and plant e also increase in addition the aeration treatment also increased the chlorophyll content in the plant leaves chlorophyll the pigment of photosynthetic reaction centres plays a dual role in capturing light energy and separating the photovoltaic charge gerischer 1979 this leads to the accumulation of dry matter and increased production bhattarai et al 2004 li et al 2016b showed that aeration of the tomato root zone soil can significantly increase leaf chlorophyll content gsw photosynthesis da and yields this conclusion is consistent with the results of the present study table 4 table 6 our results also showed that multiple indicators of photosynthesis were higher in 2018 spring summer than those in 2019 autumn winter which may have occurred because the light intensity and temperature in autumn winter are not as high as in spring summer the a of tomato plants increased linearly with increasing illumination el gizawy et al 1993 4 3 tomato fruits yield quality and wue rhizosphere oxygenation promotes the absorption of soil moisture and nutrients and improves crop yields ityel et al 2014 sang et al 2018 wen et al 2013 showed that compared with non aeration treatments various aeration treatments of tomato fruits increased the yield vc content and organic acid content to varying degrees in addition liu et al 2019 showed that compared with the non aeration treatment the optimal irrigation treatment increased the tomato yield iwue vc content and soluble sugar content by 16 9 16 9 17 7 and 39 2 respectively aeration treatment can improve crop yields and wue bhattarai 2005 wu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the tomato yield vc content soluble sugar content lycopene content soluble solids content and total acid content in this study increased with increasing do concentration which was consistent with the results of previous studies in this study the lycopene content was higher in 2018 spring summer than that in 2019 autumn winter because the synthesis of lycopene requires a suitable temperature of 20 24 c xin et al 2009 local daytime temperatures are lower in autumn and winter the lowest temperature in the greenhouse is approximately 8 10 c which is not conducive to the synthesis of lycopene in this study the soluble sugar content soluble solids content total acid content and lycopene content in the spring summer were higher than those in the autumn winter which may have occurred because the daytime sunlight duration in the spring summer was relatively long and because the greenhouse temperature was relatively high moreover in a previous study the large temperature difference for sugar accumulation between day and night combined with high temperatures also led to early fruit development inadequate nutrient amounts an increase in organic acid content and a decrease in the sugar acid ratio zhao 2010 these findings are consistent with the results of the present study table 5 table 10 4 4 soil microbial biomass enzyme activity and respiration rate studies have shown that ai can affect soil urease catalase and other enzyme activities and can improve the soil microbial environment morard and silvestre 1996 the soil o2 content is closely related to soil microbial activity and soil o2 directly affects soil enzyme activity when the temperature and moisture of the soil are suitable and the aeration is good the aerobic microorganisms in the soil are active and humus decomposes quickly which can release additional nutrients for plant absorption ai has significant effects on soil enzyme activity and soil microbial populations chen et al 2019 li et al 2015 in this study soil catalase urease and phosphatase activities increased with increasing do concentration and the effects were significant the results of this study are consistent with those of the abovementioned reports table 9 smbn is a key link in the conversion of organic inorganic ammonia in the soil lu 2000 soil respiration is often used as an indicator of soil biological activity soil fertility and even permeability and it can indicate the process and direction of ecosystem succession zang et al 2015 the ratio of smbc smbn can reflect the microbial community structure and significant changes in this ratio indicate that the changes in the microbial community structure may be the main reason for the high microbial biomass lovell et al 1995 in this experiment both the smbc and the smbn increased with increasing do and the effects were significant table 8 yan et al 2016 showed that compared with those under no ai belowground drip irrigation the number of bacteria and fungi corresponding to each growth period under aeration is significantly increased the number of bacteria fungi and actinomycetes was also significantly higher under high and moderate levels of ai compared to that in the ck group wendu et al 2010 showed that soil urease was significantly positively correlated with the amount of actinomycetes and that soil catalase was extremely significantly positively correlated with the amount of bacteria fungi and actinomycetes in addition the smbc and the smbn were significantly positively correlated and soil phosphatase and fungal quantity were extremely significantly positively correlated the results of the present study are consistent with those of the abovementioned reports table 7 in addition the results of this study also showed that the amount of soil bacteria fungi and actinomycetes in 2018 spring summer was higher than that in 2019 autumn winter which may have occurred because of the high temperature and light intensity in spring summer this study also showed that do has a significant effect on the soil respiration rate and the higher the do in the irrigation water the greater the soil respiration rate this is because do indirectly increases the soc increases soil gas exchange improves the soil environment promotes the diversity of soil microorganisms and increases soil enzyme activity thus enhancing the soil respiration rate 5 conclusions increasing the do concentration in irrigation water indirectly increased the soc improved the soil environment and promoted the growth of tomato plants moreover the increase in soc promoted an increase in plant gsw and chlorophyll content to a certain extent and enhanced photosynthesis which is beneficial for the accumulation of dry matter the increase in soc also enhanced the absorption of soil nutrients and water by tomato roots which is beneficial for improving wue quality and efficiency the main conclusions from this two year greenhouse experiment are as follows 1 do has a very significant impact on main plant indicators such as growth indicators photosynthesis indicators fruit quality biomass soil microorganisms yield iwue wue and oxygen content p 0 01 2 in 2018 and 2019 the lai a vc content soluble sugar content lycopene content da soil respiration rate smbc and smbn of the o3 group increased to varying degrees compared to the ck group at the same time the yield iwue wue and oxygen content increased to varying degrees 3 the effects of do on tomato growth photosynthesis quality biomass yield and iwue as well as the soil microorganisms and soc were consistent such that o3 o2 o1 ck but there were slight differences in terms of significance 4 the relationship between the do concentration x and the soc y was established as follows y 1 288 x 7 617 r2 0 9953 5 after a comprehensive consideration of indicators and a do concentration in the irrigation water of 9 0 mg l 1 is recommended for optimal tomato

ck group 4 the effects of aerated irrigation ai on the growth photosynthesis quality biomass yield wue and soc of the tomatoes as well as the soil microorganisms were consistent such that o3 o2 o1 ck but their levels of significance differed slightly when the do of the irrigation water was increased the soc increased indirectly the soil environment was improved and the growth of the tomato plants increased moreover these effects were also conducive to improved wue and tomato quality and efficiency this study provides a new irrigation model and a theoretical basis for the popularization of greenhouse crop cultivation keywords drip irrigation under mulch aerated irrigation oxygen content dry matter accumulation soil enzyme activity relationship between yield and quality 1 introduction tomatoes which are a popular vegetable species are highly nutritious as such how to achieve high yields and improve tomato quality have become goals for many researchers the root system of the plant needs sufficient amounts of oxygen for aerobic respiration both to maintain its own metabolism and to maintain the growth and development of the entire plant in agricultural production traditional irrigation methods such as drip irrigation provide water to crops and simultaneously squeeze out the air in the soil to a certain extent when the soil has a high water content not only is the amount of air within soil pores low but also more importantly water blocks the movement of air the blockage of atmospheric gas prevents the oxygen in the atmosphere from replenishing that which is consumed by soil respiration in a timely manner hypoxia decreases root respiration resulting in a shift from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration root growth subsequently stops and ion transport slows the root sap flow becomes out of sync which in turn affects the growth of the entire plant lu et al 2012 the higher the soil moisture content the smaller the stomatal ratio leading to a longer and more zigzaging oxygen migration path hillel 1998 and the lower the effective diffusion coefficient de of oxygen mbonimpa et al 2011 aerated irrigation ai can effectively improve the oxygen environment in the root zone increase the length of fine roots increase the vitality of the root system improve the physiological function of plants indirectly improve water use efficiency wue increase plant growth and increase crop yields li et al 2016b therefore to distinguish from other aeration methods it is important to study the effects of do on the tomato plants as well as on the soil microorganisms by applying irrigation water to increase the do concentration previous studies have shown that current ai techniques focus mainly on their impact on crop growth quality and yield for example zhu et al 2017 reported that the lycopene content vitamin c vc content soluble sugar content and sugar acid ratio of tomato fruits increased significantly under drip irrigation compared with those under non aerated drip irrigation zhu et al 2017 reported that the wue of tomatoes under ai increased by 19 3 compared with that under aerated drip irrigation liu et al 2019 showed that micro nanobubble water oxidation could significantly improve the yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fruit quality of tomatoes p 0 05 compared with those under no aeration the tomato yield iwue vc content and soluble sugar content under micro nanobubble water oxidation increased by 16 9 16 9 17 7 and 39 2 respectively du et al 2019 reported that ai can significantly increase tomato yields zhu et al 2016 reported that compared with those under non aerated irrigation the iwue yield per plant and individual fruit quality increased by 23 12 23 12 and 29 84 respectively under ai similarly wen et al 2014 reported that compared with those under non ai the tomato yield under ai increased by 19 49 chen et al 2018 reported that compared with those in the control ck treatment group the yield wue and carbon footprint of tomatoes in the ai treatment group increased significantly by 32 0 32 0 and 24 0 on average respectively bhattarai et al 2006 showed that the aeration treated tomato fruit yield increased by 21 compared with that of the ck current research on ai of tomato plants has focused mainly on growth niu et al 2013 yield li et al 2016a shang et al 2020 quality wen et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 and soil environment with no systematic or comprehensive research conducted to date in addition most of these studies were are conducted only once thus there is a lack of replicated studies to verify the research results to more comprehensively and systematically study the mechanism by which ai affects the growth photosynthesis quality yield and wue of tomatoes as well as the soil microbes this study accurately investigated the growth photosynthesis yield and quality of tomatoes in different climates with different do concentrations based on previous studies deng 2018 ouyang 2018 2019 2020 zhao et al 2019 the micro nano aeration method for irrigation water was used to conduct a two year comparative test in a solar greenhouse this study clarified the mechanism by which different levels of do affect improvements in tomato quality revealed the aerobic irrigation law of tomatoes and identified the best do parameters under the conditions of this experiment thus

p 0 01 the influence of do on these quality indicators was consistent the vc content soluble sugar content lycopene content soluble solids content and total acid content of tomato fruits increased

the ck the o3 treatment increased the yield iwue wue and wueint by 15 09 15 06 34 97 and 28 70 respectively the results of these two years of research indicate that do has a significant effect on yield iwue and wue p 0 01 moreover the effects of do on the yield iwue wue and wueint were consistent each index increased with increasing do in the irrigation water which indicated that increased do concentrations in irrigation water can increase tomato yield and wue to a certain extent 3 7 effects of different do concentrations on soil oxygen content table 11 shows the effects of different do treatments on the soc the increases in the soc under the different do treatments were such that o3 o2 o1 ck compared with that in the ck the o3 treatment increased the soc by 50 97 and 53 34 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the results of these two years of research indicate that do has a significant effect on the soc p 0 01 the influence of do on the soc was consistent the soc increased with increasing do concentrations indicating that increased do concentrations in irrigation water can increase the soil oxygen content to a certain extent furthermore based on the real time monitoring data of both the do and soc of the irrigation water in 2018 the average soc value corresponding to the different levels of do was calculated and the relationship between the do x and soc y of the irrigation water was established as follows y 1 288 x 7 617 r2 0 9953 the measured data were verified in 2019 and the error between the measured values and the predicted values was analysed the average relative error was 2 less than 5 indicating that the linear equation was reliable and had a good predictive ability the relationship between the do concentration in the irrigation water and the soc is shown in fig 1 4 discussion micro nano bubbles typically refer to bubbles whose diameters are less than 50 µm because micro nanobubbles are extremely small they have unique properties that differ from those of ordinary bubbles they persist for a long time in irrigation water have a high mass transfer efficiency and are stable and durable li et al 2012 the fragmentation of nanobubbles will generate shock waves which in turn promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals which are highly reactive oxygen species ahmed et al 2018 these facts may explain why air bubbles easily adhere to the root surface of plants alter the adsorption characteristics of the root surface and improve nutrient absorption 4 1 tomato plants growth oxygen is important for plants to absorb nutrients because it carries them to the cell walls and roots as more oxygen is absorbed by the roots nutrient uptake improves ahmed et al 2018 root hypoxia causes rapid increases in phytohormones such as abscisic acid aba and ethylene leading to the closure of leaf stomata and a decrease in the a which affects the production of atp and thus affects crop growth zhu et al 2017 the results of this experiment showed that increasing the do concentration indirectly increased the oxygen content of the soil table 11 and a mathematical relationship between the do and the soc was derived fig 1 zhang et al 2017 showed that the growth rate plant height stem diameter and leaf area per plant of tomato plants under micro nano ai were significantly higher than those under conventional irrigation these findings are consistent with the conclusion that both plant height and stem diameter increase with increasing do concentration zang et al 2018 in addition the results of this experiment also showed that the lai was positively correlated with do concentration table 3 4 2 tomato plants photosynthesis and da previous studies have shown that aeration treatment can increase the soc by 2 4 32 6 which can effectively alleviate hypoxic stress in the root zone and may in turn cause a decrease in the aba concentration in plants to a certain extent and an increase the gsw of the leaves chen et al 2011 the results from the two years of research in this study showed that increased do concentrations can increase the gsw a and da of tomato plants this occurs is because as the do increases the gsw ci a and plant e also increase in addition the aeration treatment also increased the chlorophyll content in the plant leaves chlorophyll the pigment of photosynthetic reaction centres plays a dual role in capturing light energy and separating the photovoltaic charge gerischer 1979 this leads to the accumulation of dry matter and increased production bhattarai et al 2004 li et al 2016b showed that aeration of the tomato root zone soil can significantly increase leaf chlorophyll content gsw photosynthesis da and yields this conclusion is consistent with the results of the present study table 4 table 6 our results also showed that multiple indicators of photosynthesis were higher in 2018 spring summer than those in 2019 autumn winter which may have occurred because the light intensity and temperature in autumn winter are not as high as in spring summer the a of tomato plants increased linearly with increasing illumination el gizawy et al 1993 4 3 tomato fruits yield quality and wue rhizosphere oxygenation promotes the absorption of soil moisture and nutrients and improves crop yields ityel et al 2014 sang et al 2018 wen et al 2013 showed that compared with non aeration treatments various aeration treatments of tomato fruits increased the yield vc content and organic acid content to varying degrees in addition liu et al 2019 showed that compared with the non aeration treatment the optimal irrigation treatment increased the tomato yield iwue vc content and soluble sugar content by 16 9 16 9 17 7 and 39 2 respectively aeration treatment can improve crop yields and wue bhattarai 2005 wu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the tomato yield vc content soluble sugar content lycopene content soluble solids content and total acid content in this study increased with increasing do concentration which was consistent with the results of previous studies in this study the lycopene content was higher in 2018 spring summer than that in 2019 autumn winter because the synthesis of lycopene requires a suitable temperature of 20 24 c xin et al 2009 local daytime temperatures are lower in autumn and winter the lowest temperature in the greenhouse is approximately 8 10 c which is not conducive to the synthesis of lycopene in this study the soluble sugar content soluble solids content total acid content and lycopene content in the spring summer were higher than those in the autumn winter which may have occurred because the daytime sunlight duration in the spring summer was relatively long and because the greenhouse temperature was relatively high moreover in a previous study the large temperature difference for sugar accumulation between day and night combined with high temperatures also led to early fruit development inadequate nutrient amounts an increase in organic acid content and a decrease in the sugar acid ratio zhao 2010 these findings are consistent with the results of the present study table 5 table 10 4 4 soil microbial biomass enzyme activity and respiration rate studies have shown that ai can affect soil urease catalase and other enzyme activities and can improve the soil microbial environment morard and silvestre 1996 the soil o2 content is closely related to soil microbial activity and soil o2 directly affects soil enzyme activity when the temperature and moisture of the soil are suitable and the aeration is good the aerobic microorganisms in the soil are active and humus decomposes quickly which can release additional nutrients for plant absorption ai has significant effects on soil enzyme activity and soil microbial populations chen et al 2019 li et al 2015 in this study soil catalase urease and phosphatase activities increased with increasing do concentration and the effects were significant the results of this study are consistent with those of the abovementioned reports table 9 smbn is a key link in the conversion of organic inorganic ammonia in the soil lu 2000 soil respiration is often used as an indicator of soil biological activity soil fertility and even permeability and it can indicate the process and direction of ecosystem succession zang et al 2015 the ratio of smbc smbn can reflect the microbial community structure and significant changes in this ratio indicate that the changes in the microbial community structure may be the main reason for the high microbial biomass lovell et al 1995 in this experiment both the smbc and the smbn increased with increasing do and the effects were significant table 8 yan et al 2016 showed that compared with those under no ai belowground drip irrigation the number of bacteria and fungi corresponding to each growth period under aeration is significantly increased the number of bacteria fungi and actinomycetes was also significantly higher under high and moderate levels of ai compared to that in the ck group wendu et al 2010 showed that soil urease was significantly positively correlated with the amount of actinomycetes and that soil catalase was extremely significantly positively correlated with the amount of bacteria fungi and actinomycetes in addition the smbc and the smbn were significantly positively correlated and soil phosphatase and fungal quantity were extremely significantly positively correlated the results of the present study are consistent with those of the abovementioned reports table 7 in addition the results of this study also showed that the amount of soil bacteria fungi and actinomycetes in 2018 spring summer was higher than that in 2019 autumn winter which may have occurred because of the high temperature and light intensity in spring summer this study also showed that do has a significant effect on the soil respiration rate and the higher the do in the irrigation water the greater the soil respiration rate this is because do indirectly increases the soc increases soil gas exchange improves the soil environment promotes the diversity of soil microorganisms and increases soil enzyme activity thus enhancing the soil respiration rate 5 conclusions increasing the do concentration in irrigation water indirectly increased the soc improved the soil environment and promoted the growth of tomato plants moreover the increase in soc promoted an increase in plant gsw and chlorophyll content to a certain extent and enhanced photosynthesis which is beneficial for the accumulation of dry matter the increase in soc also enhanced the absorption of soil nutrients and water by tomato roots which is beneficial for improving wue quality and efficiency the main conclusions from this two year greenhouse experiment are as follows 1 do has a very significant impact on main plant indicators such as growth indicators photosynthesis indicators fruit quality biomass soil microorganisms yield iwue wue and oxygen content p 0 01 2 in 2018 and 2019 the lai a vc content soluble sugar content lycopene content da soil respiration rate smbc and smbn of the o3 group increased to varying degrees

10281,regular appraisal performance of the irrigation water distribution systems from the adequacy equity and sustainable operation perspectives are essential due to the significant water losses that has been led by the improper adjustments of the hydraulic structures appropriate operational strategies could be adapted when the irrigation district authorities have a pragmatic approach to assess the hydraulic behavior of the system this study develops an intelligent model for i hydraulic simulation and ii operational performance evaluation of the agricultural water distribution systems by employing a hybrid bayesian networks hbns the developed model was tested on a real test case located in iran and under the different operational scenarios in this regard firstly a hydrodynamic model of the test case was developed calibrated and validated to simulate the hydraulic condition of the irrigation canal based on a wide range of the canal inflow variations called operational scenarios then performance assessment was conducted for the scenarios based on adequacy equity and efficiency of water distribution perspectives the results were employed for the training of the hbns model the hbns model configuration was selected based on the irrigation district manages expectations where the performance indicators of adequacy efficiency and equity of water delivery needs to be calculated for the canal inflow variations in different operational scenarios validation of the developed hbns model reveals that mean absolute percentage error mape and coefficient of determination r2 of the superior model within the entire output nodes are 17 31 and 0 96 respectively the results indicated the ability of the hbns model for the simulation performance appraisal of any operating systems in the irrigation districts the developed model is a useful tool for i periodic appraisal performance of the distribution system ii operational personals and ditch riders and iii regionalization of the district to facilitate the recurrent inspections and field visiting keywords intelligent model water distribution simulation performance appraisal hybrid bayesian network surrogate models irrigation canals 1 introduction irrigation canal networks are responsible for conveying distributing and delivering the agricultural water to farms the operating performance of these networks is below the expectations due to the significant water losses occurred including seepage losses alongside the canals kamrani et al 2020 and the improper operation of the hydraulic structures shahdany and firoozfar 2017 therefore operational performance appraisal of the system is essential to adopt appropriate management strategies the preliminary action to evaluate the agricultural water distribution and delivery systems awdds performance is the simulation of the hydraulic behavior of flow in canal networks to calculate the hydraulic parameters e g water level and discharge deliveries to individual off takes however diversification of the hydraulic structures and the operating systems employed in a water distribution system escalate complexities to estimate the hydraulic behavior the typical approach is employing a hydrodynamic model for hydraulic simulation and a set of indicators for evaluating the operational performance of an agricultural water distribution system tariq and latif 2011 kumar et al 2002 simulated water distribution conditions in the main canal in india by canalman hydrodynamic model shahrokhnia and javan 2005 simulated the same conditions in a canal in iran using the hec ras model and evaluated the operational condition in the status quo using three indicators of adequacy equity and efficiency of water delivery tariq and latif 2010 employed the sic hydrodynamic model for hydraulic simulation of a canal in pakistan and employed four indicators of i effective delivery ii adequacy iii delivery performance ratio and iv operational efficiency for the performance appraisal dejen 2015 simulated the hydraulic flow in the main canal in ethiopia using the dufflow hydrodynamic model and evaluated the desirability of water distribution using adequacy efficiency equity and sustainability indicators afrasiabikia et al 2017 investigated the operational conditions in the main canal in iran using the sobek hydrodynamic model and adequacy equity and surplus water indicators the studies mentioned above showed that the processes of simulation and evaluation of the awdds were conducted separately additionally hydraulic simulation and evaluation are time consuming and expert oriented processes needed an appropriate instruction moreover reliable operational management needs regular and periodic evaluations when different operational scenarios occurred in other words the practical decisions can be made by the irrigation district authorities based on accurate projections of the awddss operational status however employing these expert oriented models and the district managers do not embrace systematic techniques due to lack of educated personnel ditch riders and operators accordingly developing easy to use models would guarantee appropriate water distribution scheduling throughout the irrigation districts according to the constraints mentioned above the current study introduces a framework by which an intelligent surrogate model is developed using the bayesian networks bns for the simulation operational performance appraisal of awdds in irrigation districts in this regard various artificial intelligence models have been used to develop the surrogate models for different objectives including i artificial neural networks for the conjunctive operation of surface and groundwater resources karamouz et al 2005 ii polynomial neural network for online flood forecasting schmitz and cullmann 2008 iii adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for flood routing ghalkhani et al 2013 iv m5p model for prediction of the optimal groundwater abstraction of coastal aquifers triki et al 2017 and v bayesian networks for real time river water quality management mesbah et al 2009 investigation of the response of groundwater to sea level changes fienen et al 2013 conjunctive surface groundwater operation rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 and optimal water allocation to irrigation districts sherafatpour et al 2019 the studies showed that artificial intelligence models can make surrogate models due to their high speed ease of use computational efficiency ability to perform nonlinear simulations and numerical stability the literature review about applying bns as surrogate models have also indicated that they are capable tools that provide reliable outputs bayesian networks pearl 1988 are graphical models based on graph and probability theories they have various capabilities including the ability to develop by incomplete and little dataset uusitalo 2007 ease of use the capability to update with new data anbari et al 2017 and the ability to integrate different processes into an intelligent model bns can also graphically display cause and effect relationships between various variables allowing the user to identify specific factors affecting the problem quickly bns variables can be discrete continuous or a combination of both discrete and continuous random variables are usually seen together in many real phenomena aguilera et al 2013 the bns that include both discrete and continuous nodes are called hybrid bayesian networks hbns this feature makes it possible to implement the current bayesian model for different operational scenarios defined in the model by expressive phrases therefore the developed hbns has one discrete node called scenario meanwhile the model s other nodes are continuous which are related to simulation and evaluation of agricultural water distribution system studies including mittnik and starobinskaya 2010 aguilera et al 2013 xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 have made use of hbns these factors have turned bns into powerful tools in many scientific fields in this study the bns was employed to develop a surrogate model for awdds s simulation performance evaluation objective to the best of our knowledge this study for the first time employs a machine learning method to establish a framework for simultaneous simulation and evaluation of agricultural water distribution system the proposed framework was tested based on different operational scenarios including a wide range of possible patterns that occurred at the canal head gate in irrigation districts on a global scale the framework consists of three main components of i water distribution simulation ii operational performance appraisal of awdds and iii development of an intelligent model by employing a hybrid bayesian network hbns the methodology presented in this study was implemented on the awdds in the roodasht irrigation district located in a very arid region in the center of iran it is worth mentioning that the proposed framework of this study can be used in all the awdds in irrigation districts since different hydrodynamic models can be replaced by the hec ras and various appraisal indicators can be substituted by those employed in this study additionally one of the advantages of the proposed hbns model is the compatibility of the bayesian network with inadequate or incomplete data as mentioned in different studies such as uusitalo 2007 chickering and heckerman 2013 myers et al 2013 accordingly it can be claimed that the proposed model can be employed in irrigation districts where limited measured operational data are available for training bns 2 materials and methods the primary objective of this study is to present a framework for the development of the hbns as a surrogate model for awdds in irrigation districts fig 1 shows components of the proposed framework including operational simulation delivery and distribution evaluation and development of hbns model according to fig 1 the various steps conducted in developing the framework are explained as follows i measurement collecting of the geometrical and operational data required for developing calibrating and validating the hec ras hydrodynamic model ii developing a hydrodynamic simulation model based on observation data measured in the field and collected ones from the data source of the irrigation district head office iii calibrating and validating the hec ras model based on measured hydraulic and structural parameters during the operational period the hydraulic parameters include 1 water level elevations at the upstream side of the off take structures 2 discharge to each off takes and the structural setting consists of the opening closing configuration of sluices of the off take structure in this study the parameters mentioned above were measured on site by the research team members during 53 operational days in the water year 2014 2015 other required information included i canal inflow and ii water demands at each off take were collected from the head office of the district iv performing the validated hydrodynamic model 522 times to simulate hydraulic parameters water level and discharge delivered to individual off takes under the normal fluctuation and water shortage operational scenarios v calculating awdds performance indicators explained in section 2 3 vi calculating the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator vii collecting data from steps number iv to vi and using stratified random sampling to categorize them into two groups namely calibration and validation viii calibrating and validating the hbns model for different structures ix selecting the superior hbns model in terms of accuracy x using the hbns model as a surrogate model for simulating and evaluating water distribution and delivery in awdds it is worth noting that the data related to the stage iii including canal inflow and delivery discharges to the off takes are provided in table b 1 2 in appendix b 2 1 case study roodasht irrigation district is located in the southeastern of isfahan city in iran the roodasht north branch rnb main canal fig 2 is selected as a test case the rnb canal has 42 169 km length with a design discharge capacity of 9 cms at the head gate this canal has 13 canal reaches reach is the distance between the two water level regulating structures separated by 14 static head long crest weirs duckbill there are 26 off takes in the test canal taking water for the laterals the study area selection was conducted based on a set of reasons which created the roodasht irrigation district as the most vulnerable one in iran the logic behind this selection is as follows i unreliable supply of the required surface water by the river that resulted in inflow fluctuations and water shortages in the main canal khiabani et al 2020 ii the region s social tensions due to limited water supply shahdany et al 2018 iii the improper design and the multiplicity of water level regulating structures that have led to a significant water level drop along the main canal khiabani et al 2020 iv the multitude of groundwater wells and a substantial reduction in the region s aquifer khiabani et al 2020 2 2 operational simulation 2 2 1 hydrodynamic model hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras model is developed by the u s army corps of engineers hec ras allows users to simulate one dimensional steady one and two dimensional unsteady flow hydraulics in canals water surface profiles are obtained by solving the energy equation from one cross section to the next using a repetitive process called the standard step method the energy equation is defined as eq 1 brunner 2020 1 z 2 y 2 α 2 v 2 2 2 g z i y 1 α 1 v 1 2 2 g h e where z 1 and z 2 are elevations of the canal y 1 and y 2 indicate the depth of water at cross sections v 1 and v 2 are average velocities α 1 and α 2 show velocity weighting coefficients g is gravitational acceleration and he is energy head loss hydraulic simulation in roodasht main irrigation canal was performed using the hec ras model information such as canal layout geometrical and physical characteristics of the cross sections hydraulic structures upstream and downstream boundary conditions are required to create the hydrodynamic model of the canal the mentioned data were obtained from the water authority of isfahan province table b 3 in appendix b shows the data used to set up the model upstream and downstream boundary conditions were canal inflow and rating curves downstream of each off take respectively 2 2 2 calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model the hec ras model was calibrated and validated based on a set of measured hydraulic and structural parameters in this study the parameters mentioned above were measured on site by the research team members during 53 working days in the water year 2014 2015 the hydraulic parameters include i water level elevations at the upstream side of the off take structures ii discharge to each off takes and the structural setting consists of the opening closing configuration of sluices of the off take structure it is worth noting that the parameters mentioned above were measured by the research team members since there was no reliable measurement information in the head office of the irrigation district other required information included i canal inflow and ii water demands at each off take were collected from the head office of the district it should be mentioned that farmers of the case study supplied by the surface water just for 53 days in a water year while the groundwater resource is the primary source for supplying water for the rest of each year accordingly all the available data during the use of surface water in the district was used for model calibration and validation the hec ras simulation model was calibrated and validated using 100 of the data 50 of the data was used for calibration and the other 50 was allocated for validation discharge coefficients of water level regulating structure were used for model calibration after calibration the model was validated using the next data set the root mean square error rmse coefficient of residual mass crm and mean absolute error mae statistical indicators were used to compare the simulated and measured values the indicators are mathematically expressed as eqs 2 4 2 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 3 crm i 1 n x i i 1 n y i i 1 n x i 4 mae 1 n i 1 n y i x i where x i measured values y i simulated values n number of measurements the optimal value for the crm rmse and mae indicators is 0 if these indicators approach 0 simulated and measured values will be matched and the model performs better olyaie et al 2015 crm can be above or below 0 this indicator s negative values show a tendency to overestimate homaee et al 2002 it should be noted that the mentioned indicators have been used in studies such as shahrokhnia and javan 2005 dejen 2015 to evaluate the accuracy of hydrodynamic models 2 2 3 operational scenarios canal operation consists of all activities performed on canal structures to distribute and deliver agricultural water properly therefore the operational scenario represents specific conditions in the canal accordingly the relevant activities must be implemented all the operational conditions of the canal test case were determined in the form of various operational scenarios to simulate the hydraulic behavior of flow and the delivery discharges to off takes in different states hashemy et al 2017 operational scenarios were defined using patterns that are obtained from canal inflow data over the 53 day operational period fig 3 accordingly the operational scenarios are divided into three main groups normal operational scenario fluctuation operational scenarios and water shortage operational scenarios based on the extracted patterns the fluctuation operational scenarios and the water shortage operational scenarios were divided into six and five categories respectively fig 3 shows the system s 53 day operational status different days are distinguished by green yellow and purple colors green color represents days in which operation is normal also known as the normal operational scenario in other words there are no reductions or fluctuations in the canal inflow yellow color represents days in which the canal inflow has decreased from the normal value 4 5 m3 s according to graph a such conditions are called water shortage operational scenarios purple color represents the fluctuation operational scenarios which means that the canal inflow fluctuates over time graph b in fig 3 illustrates the fluctuation operational scenarios table 1 shows the range of canal inflow changes for different operational scenarios 2 3 evaluation of agricultural water distribution and delivery the primary purpose of evaluating awdds in the irrigation district is gathering information that allows the understanding of how well the system has been able to support the operational objectives in the current study the adequacy pa efficiency pf and equity pe of water distribution are evaluated based on eqs 5 7 molden and gates 1990 5 p a 1 t t 1 r r p a p a q d q r if q d q r otherwise p a 1 6 p f 1 t t 1 r r p f p f q r q d if q r q d otherwise p f 1 7 p e 1 t t cv r q d q r where q r and q d represent the required and the delivery discharges respectively 1 t and 1 r indicate the time and spatial average respectively cv r is spatial variations of the ratio q d q r throughout the canal pa shows the ability of the system to deliver enough water to off takes and pf indicates the relative amount of water loss in each off take pe demonstrates the fair distribution of water among consumers throughout the system the standard classification of pa pf and pe indicators can be seen in table b 4 in appendix b molden and gates 1990 the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator provides a comprehensive overview of how the water is distributed and delivered throughout the irrigation canal the calculated pa pf and pe indicators were merged to calculate the mentioned indicator to this end the weight of each indicator must be specified which can differ depending on each operational scenario further information about the calculation of the mentioned indicator is given in appendix a 2 4 bayesian networks bayesian networks are graphical models based on graph and probability theories in this regard bayesian networks consist of two qualitative and quantitative components the qualitative part is a directed acyclic graph dag in which each node represents a random variable and each linkage represents a causal relationship between the variables for instance when there is a linkage from node a to node c it means that a has a direct influence on the c the quantitative component is probabilistic relationships between random variables based on bayesian theory eq 8 8 p a b p b a p a p b in eq 8 p a is the probability of variable a p b is the probability of variable b p b a the conditional probability of b given a and p a b the conditional probability of a given b 2 4 1 bayesian network training 2 4 1 1 data splitting one of the primary requirements in machine learning models is to train them with high generalization capabilities therefore the data must be appropriately divided into two categories of calibration and validation to this end statistical sampling techniques can be developed in the present study the stratified random sampling method was used to classify the data into two groups of calibration and validation the main idea of this method is to investigate the distribution and structure of the dataset then divide it into smaller groups called strata samples are randomly selected within each stratum in such a case calibration data adequately covers the whole dataset therefore high precision is achieved within the validation process reitermanova 2010a 2010b in the current study the caret package in r software was used to make the above goal this package uses the createdatapartition function to classify the data in which the samples are split into quartiles and data are extracted randomly within each quartile it is worth mentioning that studies such as candanedo et al 2017 kim et al 2019 have utilized the same method for data splitting in addition to mentioned points one of the several features of bns which have made them useful in comparison with other modeling techniques is their ability to avoid overfitting heckerman 1998 uusitalo 2007 needham et al 2007 hänninen 2014 2 4 1 2 structure and parameter learning the training of bns is based on their division into quantitative parameter learning and qualitative structure learning components training of bns structure involves identifying dependent and independent variables and finding possible relationships between variables that are likely to have causal relationships structure learning of bayesian networks is done manually automatically and by combining the two methods aguilera et al 2013 in this study different hbns structures based on the operational method of the test case and expert s opinions were proposed calibrated and validated to find the most appropriate hbns structure the best structure was selected based on indicators including mape mean absolute percentage error rmse root mean square error and r2 coefficient of determination indicators mathematically expressed as 9 mape 1 n σ x i y i y i 10 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 11 r 2 x x y y x x 2 σ y y 2 2 where x i real values y i simulated values if the mape and rmse values become 0 the developed model is functioning correctly the closer these values are to 0 the accuracy of the model is higher homaee et al 2002 adoko et al 2013 the r2 indicator varies from 0 to 1 an r2 close to 1 indicates an approximately perfect relationship between the model and the data whereas an r2 close to 0 shows just fitting the mean is equivalent to the model fitted saunders et al 2012 mcmc markov chain monte carlo algorithm was used for parameter learning of hbns to some extent the training of the hbns was performed in r software using the hydenet package dalton 2020 2 4 2 hybrid bayesian networks bayesian network variables can be discrete continuous or a combination of discrete and continuous variables typically in many real phenomena discrete and continuous random variables are together which led to hybrid bayesian networks that simultaneously combine these two types of variables lerner 2002 the most common and convenient way to deal with such phenomena is the discretization of random variables since the discretization process reduces accuracy it is not acceptable to use such an approach in systems that require high precision neil et al 2008 in this study due to the existence of simultaneous discrete and continuous node the developed bayesian network is a hybrid type the hbns model has only one discrete node called scenario the existence of this node has led to implementing the proposed intelligent model separately in different operational scenarios therefore considering the expressive phrases for each scenario the node was deemed to be discrete the rest nodes are continuous type according to the accuracy required various methods have been developed to train hbns one of these approaches is the markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique which was used in this study mcmc is an approximation technique for the development of hbns they are popular since exact algorithms are computationally complicated markov chain monte carlo is a sampling method that uses previous sample values to produce subsequent ones randomly it means the values drawn at the ith iteration depend on those drawn at the i 1 th iteration carlo 2004 samples are extracted from the joint posterior distribution of the variables with complicated iterative algorithms scutari and denis 2014 one of the most straightforward mcmc strategies to fulfill the mentioned aim is gibbs sampling geman and geman 1984 in which a variable is selected and sampled according to the value of the other variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of hec ras model the results of calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model hec ras through statistical indicators including rmse mae and crm showed that the model was developed accurately mae rmse and crm indicators were 0 0027 m3 s 0 0028 m3 s and 0 043 respectively in calibration and 0 0038 m3 s 0 004 m3 s and 0 061 in the validation process comparing these results with the results gained from similar studies regarding the mentioned indicators shows the desirability of calibration and validation processes for instance the rmse and mae are respectively within the ranges of 0 0349 0 0369 and 0 020 0 022 m3 s in shahrokhnia and javan 2005 and in dejen 2015 rmse and crm indicators were reported acceptable within the ranges of 0 06 0 09 and 0 07 0 02 m3 s respectively according to the results of the current study it can be concluded that the present study s statistical indicators are closer to zero in comparison to the acceptable ranges of studies mentioned above therefore the accuracy of the developed hydrodynamic model is confirmed 3 2 operational simulation results after calibration and validation of the hec ras model various operational scenarios were simulated according to table 1 the results of the simulation process are given in table b 5 appendix b in each operational scenario the canal inflow is variable within a particular range due to the space limitation in the article two canal inflows were chosen as representatives for each scenario according to table b 5 in appendix b the reduction in canal inflow decreases off take delivery discharges in all operational scenarios the downward trend is more pronounced in downstream off takes the reason could be the upstream control of the roodasht awdds operational method in the upstream control the water level is maintained constant in the upstream of the regulating structure the changes are performed sequentially from supplier to consumer respectively in this way water is distributed from the upstream to the downstream regions the sc 1 sc 12 and sc 9 operational scenarios respectively had the most ordinary most undesirable and most desirable water distribution and delivery conditions in the awdds in sc 1 by reducing the canal inflow from 4 to 4 5 m3 s the delivery discharges in the downstream and upstream of the canal have decreased in the range of 11 16 and 11 14 respectively results show that the reduction in downstream off take delivery discharges was 2 more than upstream ones sc 12 is an operational scenario in which extensive changes were applied to the canal inflow in this scenario the canal inflow varies from 0 44 to 2 69 m3 s if the canal inflow reduces to 1 m3 s downstream off takes number 25 and 26 receive no water as expected further canal inflow reduction increases the number of off takes that receive no water when the canal inflow reaches the minimum value of 0 44 m3 s only off takes number 1 9 receive water in sc 9 the canal inflow increases between 40 and 46 compared to the normal operational scenario 4 5 m3 s and vary in the range of 6 31 6 6 m3 s in the 6 6 m3 s canal inflow the upstream off takes receive 40 61 more water than normal canal inflow the same value varies from 39 to 51 for downstream off takes in other words the increase in delivery discharges in downstream off takes is 1 10 less than the upstream ones canal inflow changes and accordingly off take discharge variations directly affect the water distribution and delivery condition in awdds in other words damages caused by such changes include undesirable distribution and delivery throughout the awdds which causes significant operational water waste hence the evaluation process to discover the system s distribution and the delivery condition is the first step toward improving the performance of awdds performance evaluation indicators are used for this purpose this study employed four indicators namely pe pa pf and agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability to specify the damages 3 3 evaluation of agricultural water distribution and delivery results the evaluation process was performed for the entire results obtained from the simulation of 12 operational scenarios each scenario contains 24 112 canal inflows the results are presented upon these levels besides just one canal inflow is selected as representing each scenario based on the occurrence frequency representative canal inflows are given in table 2 the pf pa and pe variables were calculated for the operational scenarios sc 1 12 depicted in graphs a to c in fig 4 to evaluate the performance of awdds comprehensively the obtained results enable the district manager to investigate the delivery and distribution problems it s worth mentioning that the indicators are incalculable in the sc 12 since many off takes have not received water according to fig 4 a the pa indicator has a minimum value of 34 in sc 11 canal inflow 3 5 m3 s and a maximum of 83 in sc 9 canal inflow 6 6 m3 s thus an 88 increase in the canal inflow has increased the pa indicator by 49 fig 4 b illustrates the pf indicator which varies in the range of 91 100 the 91 value is attributed to sc 9 and the 100 is related to the fluctuation decreasing and water shortage operational scenarios the pe indicator fig 4 c has a minimum value of 24 in sc 9 and a maximum value of 49 in sc 11 therefore an 88 increase in the canal inflow has decreased the pe indicator by 25 more desirable 3 3 1 the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability to calculate the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability the pa pf and pe indicators were aggregated therefore the results of calculating indicator weights in each scenario need to be discussed first the weights are extracted by expert preferences using the paired comparison method since indicators have different weights in various operational scenarios table 3 presents the weights of each indicator in the relevant operational scenario according to table 3 the pa pe and pf indicators were respectively ranked first second and third in all operational scenarios according to the expert s opinion the correspondence between the delivered and required water is essential for agricultural regions in the awdds of this study following the discussed issue a fair distribution of water throughout the system can affect the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability in the canal experts had relatively less confidence in the pf indicator since they believed wasted water in the system could less affect the distribution and delivery after determining the weights the indicator was calculated for all operational scenarios and depicted in fig 5 the optimum value for the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator is 1 according to expert s opinions for the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator three ranges of good fair and weak were determined as 0 91 1 0 8 0 89 and 0 8 respectively according to fig 5 the best water distribution and delivery desirability condition corresponded to sc 9 with 6 6 m3 s canal inflow in this scenario the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator is 82 the lowest value that could be calculated is 51 that corresponded to sc 11 with 3 5 m3 s canal inflow hence the 88 increase in canal inflow boosts agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability 31 3 4 results of simulation evaluation model by hybrid bayesian network the primary purpose of the present study is to develop the hbns model as a surrogate one to simulate and evaluate the agricultural water distribution and delivery in awdds table 4 demonstrates specified nodes in hbns derived from simulation and evaluation processes there are 93 nodes in 6 rows predictors are two nodes namely canal inflow and scenario which compose the first row of the hbns the second row contains 26 nodes for delivery discharges of off takes q 1 2 26 accordingly the adequacy pa 1 2 26 and efficiency pf 1 2 26 for each individual off take are calculated within the third row nodes in the fourth row perform the performance assessment for a group of off takes located in upstream midstream and downstream regions of the district therefore the adequacy pa us pa ms pa ds equity pe us pe ms pe ds and efficiency pf us pf ms pf ds in the upstream midstream and downstream regions of the canal are calculated adequacy pa canal equity pe canal and efficiency pf canal of the canal are situated on the fifth row eventually the sixth row consists of the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator it must be noted that represented hbns includes one discrete node namely scenario and 92 continuous nodes scenario node consists of nine classes including normal low fluctuation medium fluctuation harsh fluctuation water shortage5 water shortage10 water shortage15 water shortage20 and water shortage25 3 4 1 data splitting to calibration and validation of the hbns 522 data series were used extracted from two processes of simulation and evaluation of water distribution and delivery stratified random sampling method was performed to split the data into calibration and validation categories 80 of the data were used for calibration and 20 were allocated to validation 3 4 2 hybrid bayesian network training in the first step the hbns structure should be determined in the current study after the determination of nodes their casual connections were defined based on the operational method employed in the test case and the expert s knowledge in the field of operational management and water resource engineering since the operational method is the upstream control approach it is expected that upstream would influence midstream parts and consequently the midstream parts would influence downstream regions various hbns structures were defined due to different ways of connections between the elements to determine the best composition of the model all of the structures were validated after parameter learning accuracy of the models was assessed by making use of rmse mape and r2 statistical indicators to this aim the mentioned indicators were calculated for all of the nodes the last four nodes including pa pf and pe in the canal and agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability were selected as the main variables to this aim due to the statistical indicators shown in table 5 the superior model is selected fig 6 by the most acceptable range of accuracy compared to other ones in the selected hbns model delivery discharges of off takes q 1 2 26 have causal relationships with each other where upstream ones influence midstream off takes subsequently midstream delivery discharges of off takes have affection on downstream ones the superior model indicated that not implementing the same procedure for the rest of the nodes evaluation nodes gains more accuracy according to table 5 the mean values of r2 and mape between all of the nodes are17 31 and 0 96 respectively indicating the accuracy of the model s performance rmse of the last four nodes is represented in table 5 diagrams of fig 7 are drawn for the mentioned previous nodes to evaluate the accuracy of the model as it is clear from fig 7 the hbns model represents good accuracy the summary of the operational simulation and evaluation results is represented in table 6 in the normal operational scenario the pa and pe indicators are 61 and 38 respectively the pf indicator is 99 since no extra water delivered to the off takes the worst performance of the canal is related to sc 12 which it s indicators are incalculable since water is only devoted to a few upstream off takes canal inflow in sc 9 has increased 46 in comparison with normal canal inflow in this operational scenario as the best one the pa pe and pf indicators are 83 24 and 91 respectively the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability show that the test case performs weakly through the most operational scenarios validation results of the developed hbns model in this study are compared with other intelligent models using the mape r2 and rmse indicators given in table 7 to investigate the accuracy of the hbns model according to the results in similar studies the mape value varies from 4 47 to 24 therefore the 17 31 mape value in the present study demonstrates that the developed hbns model is accurate the coefficient of determination also varied from 0 73 to 0 99 the average value of r2 in the present study was 0 96 which means that the model is efficient since other studies have used different units for the rmse indicator they cannot be compared with a similar indicator in the hbns of this study however since these values are close to 0 the model s accuracy is proven comparing the validation results of this study with studies mentioned earlier confirms that the hbns model is reliable and can be used as a surrogate model for simulation and evaluation of agricultural water distribution and delivery in awdds to explain how the developed model of this study has application in agricultural water management it needs to demonstrate that improving agricultural water management can be evaluated from two perspectives of on farm and off farm water management guaranteeing the successful implementation of new methods for managing on farm water requires an efficient water distribution system the intelligent simulation evaluation model developed in this study is a practical step towards rehabilitation renovation and modernization of the irrigation district in other words before any structural and non structural actions for modernization system performance needs to be assessed in the form of an independent evaluation project for this purpose the following two conventional approaches have been defined in the awdds the first approach entails using observations completing questionnaires in a series of surveys and engineering judgments according to the awdds elshaikh et al 2018 conventional diagnosis performance appraisal approach gorantiwar and smout 2005 kuscu et al 2009 rapid appraisal procedure rap okada et al 2008 benchmarking approach borgia et al 2013 rani and singh 2018 are conventional methods for the first approach the employment of these approaches is associated with many limitations since such methods are inherently requires accurate measured on site data the second approach involves using hydrodynamic models to simulate water distribution and delivery in the system and operational performance evaluation indicators molden et al 1998 nam et al 2016 elshaikh et al 2018 shahdany et al 2018 in contrast modeling based evaluation methods require relatively few measurement data to calibrate the simulation model like the present study in that case measured data can be used over a limited period or recorded historical data the developed intelligent model in this study enables irrigation district managers to simulate and evaluate agricultural water distribution daily and in the shortest possible time without the need for scientific background related to hydraulic in the awdds using the different indicators in awdds will provide a practical perception of water distribution in the upstream downstream and midstream regions 4 conclusion this study presents a methodology to develop an intelligent surrogate model for simulation performance evaluation of agricultural water distribution systems supplied by surface water resources the developed model can serve for i improving daily operational management and ii as a preliminary phase for modernization projects in irrigation districts also this model is capable of providing a hierarchical appraisal procedure of the operating system since the developed hbns model can report the performance indicators in the three levels of local evaluating every single off take s performance and regional evaluating the performance of the off takes located in upstream midstream and downstream regions and overall evaluating the performance of the whole system scales in many irrigation districts in the developing countries areas that require operating performance improvement need to be identified due to budgetary constraints and regional evaluations can be a step toward achieving this objective the methodology proposed in this study can be applied to different irrigation districts with different operating systems moreover the model can be extended for simulation performance assessment of the lateral canal networks the operation of water distribution in the lateral canal networks significantly affected the optimal performance of the main canal system therefore the main suggestions for the future research would be i developing a comprehensive model for simulation evaluating of the main and lateral water distribution systems ii developing a master model including off farm i e awdds and on farm including pressurized irrigation systems as an agricultural water management model for irrigation districts also it is recommended to develop an

10281,regular appraisal performance of the irrigation water distribution systems from the adequacy equity and sustainable operation perspectives are essential due to the significant water losses that has been led by the improper adjustments of the hydraulic structures appropriate operational strategies could be adapted when the irrigation district authorities have a pragmatic approach to assess the hydraulic behavior of the system this study develops an intelligent model for i hydraulic simulation and ii operational performance evaluation of the agricultural water distribution systems by employing a hybrid bayesian networks hbns the developed model was tested on a real test case located in iran and under the different operational scenarios in this regard firstly a hydrodynamic model of the test case was developed calibrated and validated to simulate the hydraulic condition of the irrigation canal based on a wide range of the canal inflow variations called operational scenarios then performance assessment was conducted for the scenarios based on adequacy equity and efficiency of water distribution perspectives the results were employed for the training of the hbns model the hbns model configuration was selected based on the irrigation district manages expectations where the performance indicators of adequacy efficiency and equity of water delivery needs to be calculated for the canal inflow variations in different operational scenarios validation of the developed hbns model reveals that mean absolute percentage error mape and coefficient of determination r2 of the superior model within the entire output nodes are 17 31 and 0 96 respectively the results indicated the ability of the hbns model for the simulation performance appraisal of any operating systems in the irrigation districts the developed model is a useful tool for i periodic appraisal performance of the distribution system ii operational personals and ditch riders and iii regionalization of the district to facilitate the recurrent inspections and field visiting keywords intelligent model water distribution simulation performance appraisal hybrid bayesian network surrogate models irrigation canals 1 introduction irrigation canal networks are responsible for conveying distributing and delivering the agricultural water to farms the operating performance of these networks is below the expectations due to the significant water losses occurred including seepage losses alongside the canals kamrani et al 2020 and the improper operation of the hydraulic structures shahdany and firoozfar 2017 therefore operational performance appraisal of the system is essential to adopt appropriate management strategies the preliminary action to evaluate the agricultural water distribution and delivery systems awdds performance is the simulation of the hydraulic behavior of flow in canal networks to calculate the hydraulic parameters e g water level and discharge deliveries to individual off takes however diversification of the hydraulic structures and the operating systems employed in a water distribution system escalate complexities to estimate the hydraulic behavior the typical approach is employing a hydrodynamic model for hydraulic simulation and a set of indicators for evaluating the operational performance of an agricultural water distribution system tariq and latif 2011 kumar et al 2002 simulated water distribution conditions in the main canal in india by canalman hydrodynamic model shahrokhnia and javan 2005 simulated the same conditions in a canal in iran using the hec ras model and evaluated the operational condition in the status quo using three indicators of adequacy equity and efficiency of water delivery tariq and latif 2010 employed the sic hydrodynamic model for hydraulic simulation of a canal in pakistan and employed four indicators of i effective delivery ii adequacy iii delivery performance ratio and iv operational efficiency for the performance appraisal dejen 2015 simulated the hydraulic flow in the main canal in ethiopia using the dufflow hydrodynamic model and evaluated the desirability of water distribution using adequacy efficiency equity and sustainability indicators afrasiabikia et al 2017 investigated the operational conditions in the main canal in iran using the sobek hydrodynamic model and adequacy equity and surplus water indicators the studies mentioned above showed that the processes of simulation and evaluation of the awdds were conducted separately additionally hydraulic simulation and evaluation are time consuming and expert oriented processes needed an appropriate instruction moreover reliable operational management needs regular and periodic evaluations when different operational scenarios occurred in other words the practical decisions can be made by the irrigation district authorities based on accurate projections of the awddss operational status however employing these expert oriented models and the district managers do not embrace systematic techniques due to lack of educated personnel ditch riders and operators accordingly developing easy to use models would guarantee appropriate water distribution scheduling throughout the irrigation districts according to the constraints mentioned above the current study introduces a framework by which an intelligent surrogate model is developed using the bayesian networks bns for the simulation operational performance appraisal of awdds in irrigation districts in this regard various artificial intelligence models have been used to develop the surrogate models for different objectives including i artificial neural networks for the conjunctive operation of surface and groundwater resources karamouz et al 2005 ii polynomial neural network for online flood forecasting schmitz and cullmann 2008 iii adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for flood routing ghalkhani et al 2013 iv m5p model for prediction of the optimal groundwater abstraction of coastal aquifers triki et al 2017 and v bayesian networks for real time river water quality management mesbah et al 2009 investigation of the response of groundwater to sea level changes fienen et al 2013 conjunctive surface groundwater operation rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 and optimal water allocation to irrigation districts sherafatpour et al 2019 the studies showed that artificial intelligence models can make surrogate models due to their high speed ease of use computational efficiency ability to perform nonlinear simulations and numerical stability the literature review about applying bns as surrogate models have also indicated that they are capable tools that provide reliable outputs bayesian networks pearl 1988 are graphical models based on graph and probability theories they have various capabilities including the ability to develop by incomplete and little dataset uusitalo 2007 ease of use the capability to update with new data anbari et al 2017 and the ability to integrate different processes into an intelligent model bns can also graphically display cause and effect relationships between various variables allowing the user to identify specific factors affecting the problem quickly bns variables can be discrete continuous or a combination of both discrete and continuous random variables are usually seen together in many real phenomena aguilera et al 2013 the bns that include both discrete and continuous nodes are called hybrid bayesian networks hbns this feature makes it possible to implement the current bayesian model for different operational scenarios defined in the model by expressive phrases therefore the developed hbns has one discrete node called scenario meanwhile the model s other nodes are continuous which are related to simulation and evaluation of agricultural water distribution system studies including mittnik and starobinskaya 2010 aguilera et al 2013 xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 have made use of hbns these factors have turned bns into powerful tools in many scientific fields in this study the bns was employed to develop a surrogate model for awdds s simulation performance evaluation objective to the best of our knowledge this study for the first time employs a machine learning method to establish a framework for simultaneous simulation and evaluation of agricultural water distribution system the proposed framework was tested based on different operational scenarios including a wide range of possible patterns that occurred at the canal head gate in irrigation districts on a global scale the framework consists of three main components of i water distribution simulation ii operational performance appraisal of awdds and iii development of an intelligent model by employing a hybrid bayesian network hbns the methodology presented in this study was implemented on the awdds in the roodasht irrigation district located in a very arid region in the center of iran it is worth mentioning that the proposed framework of this study can be used in all the awdds in irrigation districts since different hydrodynamic models can be replaced by the hec ras and various appraisal indicators can be substituted by those employed in this study additionally one of the advantages of the proposed hbns model is the compatibility of the bayesian network with inadequate or incomplete data as mentioned in different studies such as uusitalo 2007 chickering and heckerman 2013 myers et al 2013 accordingly it can be claimed that the proposed model can be employed in irrigation districts where limited measured operational data are available for training bns 2 materials and methods the primary objective of this study is to present a framework for the development of the hbns as a surrogate model for awdds in irrigation districts fig 1 shows components of the proposed framework including operational simulation delivery and distribution evaluation and development of hbns model according to fig 1 the various steps conducted in developing the framework are explained as follows i measurement collecting of the geometrical and operational data required for developing calibrating and validating the hec ras hydrodynamic model ii developing a hydrodynamic simulation model based on observation data measured in the field and collected ones from the data source of the irrigation district head office iii calibrating and validating the hec ras model based on measured hydraulic and structural parameters during the operational period the hydraulic parameters include 1 water level elevations at the upstream side of the off take structures 2 discharge to each off takes and the structural setting consists of the opening closing configuration of sluices of the off take structure in this study the parameters mentioned above were measured on site by the research team members during 53 operational days in the water year 2014 2015 other required information included i canal inflow and ii water demands at each off take were collected from the head office of the district iv performing the validated hydrodynamic model 522 times to simulate hydraulic parameters water level and discharge delivered to individual off takes under the normal fluctuation and water shortage operational scenarios v calculating awdds performance indicators explained in section 2 3 vi calculating the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator vii collecting data from steps number iv to vi and using stratified random sampling to categorize them into two groups namely calibration and validation viii calibrating and validating the hbns model for different structures ix selecting the superior hbns model in terms of accuracy x using the hbns model as a surrogate model for simulating and evaluating water distribution and delivery in awdds it is worth noting that the data related to the stage iii including canal inflow and delivery discharges to the off takes are provided in table b 1 2 in appendix b 2 1 case study roodasht irrigation district is located in the southeastern of isfahan city in iran the roodasht north branch rnb main canal fig 2 is selected as a test case the rnb canal has 42 169 km length with a design discharge capacity of 9 cms at the head gate this canal has 13 canal reaches reach is the distance between the two water level regulating structures separated by 14 static head long crest weirs duckbill there are 26 off takes in the test canal taking water for the laterals the study area selection was conducted based on a set of reasons which created the roodasht irrigation district as the most vulnerable one in iran the logic behind this selection is as follows i unreliable supply of the required surface water by the river that resulted in inflow fluctuations and water shortages in the main canal khiabani et al 2020 ii the region s social tensions due to limited water supply shahdany et al 2018 iii the improper design and the multiplicity of water level regulating structures that have led to a significant water level drop along the main canal khiabani et al 2020 iv the multitude of groundwater wells and a substantial reduction in the region s aquifer khiabani et al 2020 2 2 operational simulation 2 2 1 hydrodynamic model hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras model is developed by the u s army corps of engineers hec ras allows users to simulate one dimensional steady one and two dimensional unsteady flow hydraulics in canals water surface profiles are obtained by solving the energy equation from one cross section to the next using a repetitive process called the standard step method the energy equation is defined as eq 1 brunner 2020 1 z 2 y 2 α 2 v 2 2 2 g z i y 1 α 1 v 1 2 2 g h e where z 1 and z 2 are elevations of the canal y 1 and y 2 indicate the depth of water at cross sections v 1 and v 2 are average velocities α 1 and α 2 show velocity weighting coefficients g is gravitational acceleration and he is energy head loss hydraulic simulation in roodasht main irrigation canal was performed using the hec ras model information such as canal layout geometrical and physical characteristics of the cross sections hydraulic structures upstream and downstream boundary conditions are required to create the hydrodynamic model of the canal the mentioned data were obtained from the water authority of isfahan province table b 3 in appendix b shows the data used to set up the model upstream and downstream boundary conditions were canal inflow and rating curves downstream of each off take respectively 2 2 2 calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model the hec ras model was calibrated and validated based on a set of measured hydraulic and structural parameters in this study the parameters mentioned above were measured on site by the research team members during 53 working days in the water year 2014 2015 the hydraulic parameters include i water level elevations at the upstream side of the off take structures ii discharge to each off takes and the structural setting consists of the opening closing configuration of sluices of the off take structure it is worth noting that the parameters mentioned above were measured by the research team members since there was no reliable measurement information in the head office of the irrigation district other required information included i canal inflow and ii water demands at each off take were collected from the head office of the district it should be mentioned that farmers of the case study supplied by the surface water just for 53 days in a water year while the groundwater resource is the primary source for supplying water for the rest of each year accordingly all the available data during the use of surface water in the district was used for model calibration and validation the hec ras simulation model was calibrated and validated using 100 of the data 50 of the data was used for calibration and the other 50 was allocated for validation discharge coefficients of water level regulating structure were used for model calibration after calibration the model was validated using the next data set the root mean square error rmse coefficient of residual mass crm and mean absolute error mae statistical indicators were used to compare the simulated and measured values the indicators are mathematically expressed as eqs 2 4 2 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 3 crm i 1 n x i i 1 n y i i 1 n x i 4 mae 1 n i 1 n y i x i where x i measured values y i simulated values n number of measurements the optimal value for the crm rmse and mae indicators is 0 if these indicators approach 0 simulated and measured values will be matched and the model performs better olyaie et al 2015 crm can be above or below 0 this indicator s negative values show a tendency to overestimate homaee et al 2002 it should be noted that the mentioned indicators have been used in studies such as shahrokhnia and javan 2005 dejen 2015 to evaluate the accuracy of hydrodynamic models 2 2 3 operational scenarios canal operation consists of all activities performed on canal structures to distribute and deliver agricultural water properly therefore the operational scenario represents specific conditions in the canal accordingly the relevant activities must be implemented all the operational conditions of the canal test case were determined in the form of various operational scenarios to simulate the hydraulic behavior of flow and the delivery discharges to off takes in different states hashemy et al 2017 operational scenarios were defined using patterns that are obtained from canal inflow data over the 53 day operational period fig 3 accordingly the operational scenarios are divided into three main groups normal operational scenario fluctuation operational scenarios and water shortage operational scenarios based on the extracted patterns the fluctuation operational scenarios and the water shortage operational scenarios were divided into six and five categories respectively fig 3 shows the system s 53 day operational status different days are distinguished by green yellow and purple colors green color represents days in which operation is normal also known as the normal operational scenario in other words there are no reductions or fluctuations in the canal inflow yellow color represents days in which the canal inflow has decreased from the normal value 4 5 m3 s according to graph a such conditions are called water shortage operational scenarios purple color represents the fluctuation operational scenarios which means that the canal inflow fluctuates over time graph b in fig 3 illustrates the fluctuation operational scenarios table 1 shows the range of canal inflow changes for different operational scenarios 2 3 evaluation of agricultural water distribution and delivery the primary purpose of evaluating awdds in the irrigation district is gathering information that allows the understanding of how well the system has been able to support the operational objectives in the current study the adequacy pa efficiency pf and equity pe of water distribution are evaluated based on eqs 5 7 molden and gates 1990 5 p a 1 t t 1 r r p a p a q d q r if q d q r otherwise p a 1 6 p f 1 t t 1 r r p f p f q r q d if q r q d otherwise p f 1 7 p e 1 t t cv r q d q r where q r and q d represent the required and the delivery discharges respectively 1 t and 1 r indicate the time and spatial average respectively cv r is spatial variations of the ratio q d q r throughout the canal pa shows the ability of the system to deliver enough water to off takes and pf indicates the relative amount of water loss in each off take pe demonstrates the fair distribution of water among consumers throughout the system the standard classification of pa pf and pe indicators can be seen in table b 4 in appendix b molden and gates 1990 the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator provides a comprehensive overview of how the water is distributed and delivered throughout the irrigation canal the calculated pa pf and pe indicators were merged to calculate the mentioned indicator to this end the weight of each indicator must be specified which can differ depending on each operational scenario further information about the calculation of the mentioned indicator is given in appendix a 2 4 bayesian networks bayesian networks are graphical models based on graph and probability theories in this regard bayesian networks consist of two qualitative and quantitative components the qualitative part is a directed acyclic graph dag in which each node represents a random variable and each linkage represents a causal relationship between the variables for instance when there is a linkage from node a to node c it means that a has a direct influence on the c the quantitative component is probabilistic relationships between random variables based on bayesian theory eq 8 8 p a b p b a p a p b in eq 8 p a is the probability of variable a p b is the probability of variable b p b a the conditional probability of b given a and p a b the conditional probability of a given b 2 4 1 bayesian network training 2 4 1 1 data splitting one of the primary requirements in machine learning models is to train them with high generalization capabilities therefore the data must be appropriately divided into two categories of calibration and validation to this end statistical sampling techniques can be developed in the present study the stratified random sampling method was used to classify the data into two groups of calibration and validation the main idea of this method is to investigate the distribution and structure of the dataset then divide it into smaller groups called strata samples are randomly selected within each stratum in such a case calibration data adequately covers the whole dataset therefore high precision is achieved within the validation process reitermanova 2010a 2010b in the current study the caret package in r software was used to make the above goal this package uses the createdatapartition function to classify the data in which the samples are split into quartiles and data are extracted randomly within each quartile it is worth mentioning that studies such as candanedo et al 2017 kim et al 2019 have utilized the same method for data splitting in addition to mentioned points one of the several features of bns which have made them useful in comparison with other modeling techniques is their ability to avoid overfitting heckerman 1998 uusitalo 2007 needham et al 2007 hänninen 2014 2 4 1 2 structure and parameter learning the training of bns is based on their division into quantitative parameter learning and qualitative structure learning components training of bns structure involves identifying dependent and independent variables and finding possible relationships between variables that are likely to have causal relationships structure learning of bayesian networks is done manually automatically and by combining the two methods aguilera et al 2013 in this study different hbns structures based on the operational method of the test case and expert s opinions were proposed calibrated and validated to find the most appropriate hbns structure the best structure was selected based on indicators including mape mean absolute percentage error rmse root mean square error and r2 coefficient of determination indicators mathematically expressed as 9 mape 1 n σ x i y i y i 10 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 11 r 2 x x y y x x 2 σ y y 2 2 where x i real values y i simulated values if the mape and rmse values become 0 the developed model is functioning correctly the closer these values are to 0 the accuracy of the model is higher homaee et al 2002 adoko et al 2013 the r2 indicator varies from 0 to 1 an r2 close to 1 indicates an approximately perfect relationship between the model and the data whereas an r2 close to 0 shows just fitting the mean is equivalent to the model fitted saunders et al 2012 mcmc markov chain monte carlo algorithm was used for parameter learning of hbns to some extent the training of the hbns was performed in r software using the hydenet package dalton 2020 2 4 2 hybrid bayesian networks bayesian network variables can be discrete continuous or a combination of discrete and continuous variables typically in many real phenomena discrete and continuous random variables are together which led to hybrid bayesian networks that simultaneously combine these two types of variables lerner 2002 the most common and convenient way to deal with such phenomena is the discretization of random variables since the discretization process reduces accuracy it is not acceptable to use such an approach in systems that require high precision neil et al 2008 in this study due to the existence of simultaneous discrete and continuous node the developed bayesian network is a hybrid type the hbns model has only one discrete node called scenario the existence of this node has led to implementing the proposed intelligent model separately in different operational scenarios therefore considering the expressive phrases for each scenario the node was deemed to be discrete the rest nodes are continuous type according to the accuracy required various methods have been developed to train hbns one of these approaches is the markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique which was used in this study mcmc is an approximation technique for the development of hbns they are popular since exact algorithms are computationally complicated markov chain monte carlo is a sampling method that uses previous sample values to produce subsequent ones randomly it means the values drawn at the ith iteration depend on those drawn at the i 1 th iteration carlo 2004 samples are extracted from the joint posterior distribution of the variables with complicated iterative algorithms scutari and denis 2014 one of the most straightforward mcmc strategies to fulfill the mentioned aim is gibbs sampling geman and geman 1984 in which a variable is selected and sampled according to the value of the other variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of hec ras model the results of calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model hec ras through statistical indicators including rmse mae and crm showed that the model was developed accurately mae rmse and crm indicators were 0 0027 m3 s 0 0028 m3 s and 0 043 respectively in calibration and 0 0038 m3 s 0 004 m3 s and 0 061 in the validation process comparing these results with the results gained from similar studies regarding the mentioned indicators shows the desirability of calibration and validation processes for instance the rmse and mae are respectively within the ranges of 0 0349 0 0369 and 0 020 0 022 m3 s in shahrokhnia and javan 2005 and in dejen 2015 rmse and crm indicators were reported acceptable within the ranges of 0 06 0 09 and 0 07 0 02 m3 s respectively according to the results of the current study it can be concluded that the present study s statistical indicators are closer to zero in comparison to the acceptable ranges of studies mentioned above therefore the accuracy of the developed hydrodynamic model is confirmed 3 2 operational simulation results after calibration and validation of the hec ras model various operational scenarios were simulated according to table 1 the results of the simulation process are given in table b 5 appendix b in each operational scenario the canal inflow is variable within a particular range due to the space limitation in the article two canal inflows were chosen as representatives for each scenario according to table b 5 in appendix b the reduction in canal inflow decreases off take delivery discharges in all operational scenarios the downward trend is more pronounced in downstream off takes the reason could be the upstream control of the roodasht awdds operational method in the upstream control the water level is maintained constant in the upstream of the regulating structure the changes are performed sequentially from supplier to consumer respectively in this way water is distributed from the upstream to the downstream regions the sc 1 sc 12 and sc 9 operational scenarios respectively had the most ordinary most undesirable and most desirable water distribution and delivery conditions in the awdds in sc 1 by reducing the canal inflow from 4 to 4 5 m3 s the delivery discharges in the downstream and upstream of the canal have decreased in the range of 11 16 and 11 14 respectively results show that the reduction in downstream off take delivery discharges was 2 more than upstream ones sc 12 is an operational scenario in which extensive changes were applied to the canal inflow in this scenario the canal inflow varies from 0 44 to 2 69 m3 s if the canal inflow reduces to 1 m3 s downstream off takes number 25 and 26 receive no water as expected further canal inflow reduction increases the number of off takes that receive no water when the canal inflow reaches the minimum value of 0 44 m3 s only off takes number 1 9 receive water in sc 9 the canal inflow increases between 40 and 46 compared to the normal operational scenario 4 5 m3 s and vary in the range of 6 31 6 6 m3 s in the 6 6 m3 s canal inflow the upstream off takes receive 40 61 more water than normal canal inflow the same value varies from 39 to 51 for downstream off takes in other words the increase in delivery discharges in downstream off takes is 1 10 less than the upstream ones canal inflow changes and accordingly off take discharge variations directly affect the water distribution and delivery condition in awdds in other words damages caused by such changes include undesirable distribution and delivery throughout the awdds which causes significant operational water waste hence the evaluation process to discover the system s distribution and the delivery condition is the first step toward improving the performance of awdds performance evaluation indicators are used for this purpose this study employed four indicators namely pe pa pf and agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability to specify the damages 3 3 evaluation of agricultural water distribution and delivery results the evaluation process was performed for the entire results obtained from the simulation of 12 operational scenarios each scenario contains 24 112 canal inflows the results are presented upon these levels besides just one canal inflow is selected as representing each scenario based on the occurrence frequency representative canal inflows are given in table 2 the pf pa and pe variables were calculated for the operational scenarios sc 1 12 depicted in graphs a to c in fig 4 to evaluate the performance of awdds comprehensively the obtained results enable the district manager to investigate the delivery and distribution problems it s worth mentioning that the indicators are incalculable in the sc 12 since many off takes have not received water according to fig 4 a the pa indicator has a minimum value of 34 in sc 11 canal inflow 3 5 m3 s and a maximum of 83 in sc 9 canal inflow 6 6 m3 s thus an 88 increase in the canal inflow has increased the pa indicator by 49 fig 4 b illustrates the pf indicator which varies in the range of 91 100 the 91 value is attributed to sc 9 and the 100 is related to the fluctuation decreasing and water shortage operational scenarios the pe indicator fig 4 c has a minimum value of 24 in sc 9 and a maximum value of 49 in sc 11 therefore an 88 increase in the canal inflow has decreased the pe indicator by 25 more desirable 3 3 1 the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability to calculate the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability the pa pf and pe indicators were aggregated therefore the results of calculating indicator weights in each scenario need to be discussed first the weights are extracted by expert preferences using the paired comparison method since indicators have different weights in various operational scenarios table 3 presents the weights of each indicator in the relevant operational scenario according to table 3 the pa pe and pf indicators were respectively ranked first second and third in all operational scenarios according to the expert s opinion the correspondence between the delivered and required water is essential for agricultural regions in the awdds of this study following the discussed issue a fair distribution of water throughout the system can affect the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability in the canal experts had relatively less confidence in the pf indicator since they believed wasted water in the system could less affect the distribution and delivery after determining the weights the indicator was calculated for all operational scenarios and depicted in fig 5 the optimum value for the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator is 1 according to expert s opinions for the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator three ranges of good fair and weak were determined as 0 91 1 0 8 0 89 and 0 8 respectively according to fig 5 the best water distribution and delivery desirability condition corresponded to sc 9 with 6 6 m3 s canal inflow in this scenario the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator is 82 the lowest value that could be calculated is 51 that corresponded to sc 11 with 3 5 m3 s canal inflow hence the 88 increase in canal inflow boosts agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability 31 3 4 results of simulation evaluation model by hybrid bayesian network the primary purpose of the present study is to develop the hbns model as a surrogate one to simulate and evaluate the agricultural water distribution and delivery in awdds table 4 demonstrates specified nodes in hbns derived from simulation and evaluation processes there are 93 nodes in 6 rows predictors are two nodes namely canal inflow and scenario which compose the first row of the hbns the second row contains 26 nodes for delivery discharges of off takes q 1 2 26 accordingly the adequacy pa 1 2 26 and efficiency pf 1 2 26 for each individual off take are calculated within the third row nodes in the fourth row perform the performance assessment for a group of off takes located in upstream midstream and downstream regions of the district therefore the adequacy pa us pa ms pa ds equity pe us pe ms pe ds and efficiency pf us pf ms pf ds in the upstream midstream and downstream regions of the canal are calculated adequacy pa canal equity pe canal and efficiency pf canal of the canal are situated on the fifth row eventually the sixth row consists of the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability indicator it must be noted that represented hbns includes one discrete node namely scenario and 92 continuous nodes scenario node consists of nine classes including normal low fluctuation medium fluctuation harsh fluctuation water shortage5 water shortage10 water shortage15 water shortage20 and water shortage25 3 4 1 data splitting to calibration and validation of the hbns 522 data series were used extracted from two processes of simulation and evaluation of water distribution and delivery stratified random sampling method was performed to split the data into calibration and validation categories 80 of the data were used for calibration and 20 were allocated to validation 3 4 2 hybrid bayesian network training in the first step the hbns structure should be determined in the current study after the determination of nodes their casual connections were defined based on the operational method employed in the test case and the expert s knowledge in the field of operational management and water resource engineering since the operational method is the upstream control approach it is expected that upstream would influence midstream parts and consequently the midstream parts would influence downstream regions various hbns structures were defined due to different ways of connections between the elements to determine the best composition of the model all of the structures were validated after parameter learning accuracy of the models was assessed by making use of rmse mape and r2 statistical indicators to this aim the mentioned indicators were calculated for all of the nodes the last four nodes including pa pf and pe in the canal and agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability were selected as the main variables to this aim due to the statistical indicators shown in table 5 the superior model is selected fig 6 by the most acceptable range of accuracy compared to other ones in the selected hbns model delivery discharges of off takes q 1 2 26 have causal relationships with each other where upstream ones influence midstream off takes subsequently midstream delivery discharges of off takes have affection on downstream ones the superior model indicated that not implementing the same procedure for the rest of the nodes evaluation nodes gains more accuracy according to table 5 the mean values of r2 and mape between all of the nodes are17 31 and 0 96 respectively indicating the accuracy of the model s performance rmse of the last four nodes is represented in table 5 diagrams of fig 7 are drawn for the mentioned previous nodes to evaluate the accuracy of the model as it is clear from fig 7 the hbns model represents good accuracy the summary of the operational simulation and evaluation results is represented in table 6 in the normal operational scenario the pa and pe indicators are 61 and 38 respectively the pf indicator is 99 since no extra water delivered to the off takes the worst performance of the canal is related to sc 12 which it s indicators are incalculable since water is only devoted to a few upstream off takes canal inflow in sc 9 has increased 46 in comparison with normal canal inflow in this operational scenario as the best one the pa pe and pf indicators are 83 24 and 91 respectively the agricultural water distribution and delivery desirability show that the test case performs weakly through the most operational scenarios validation results of the developed hbns model in this study are compared with other intelligent models using the mape r2 and rmse indicators given in table 7 to investigate the accuracy of the hbns model according to the results in similar studies the mape value varies from 4 47 to 24 therefore the 17 31 mape value in the present study demonstrates that the developed hbns model is accurate the coefficient of determination also varied from 0 73 to 0 99 the average value of r2 in the present study was 0 96 which means that the model is efficient since other studies have used different units for the rmse indicator they cannot be compared with a similar indicator in the hbns of this study however since these values are close to 0 the model s accuracy is proven comparing the validation results of this study with studies mentioned earlier confirms that the hbns model is reliable and can be used as a surrogate model for simulation and evaluation of agricultural water distribution and delivery in awdds to explain how the developed model of this study has application in agricultural water management it needs to demonstrate that improving agricultural water management can be evaluated from two perspectives of on farm and off farm water management guaranteeing the successful implementation of new methods for managing on farm water requires an efficient water distribution system the intelligent simulation evaluation model developed in this study is a practical step towards rehabilitation renovation and modernization of the irrigation district in other words before any structural and non structural actions for modernization system performance needs to be assessed in the form of an independent evaluation project for this purpose the following two conventional approaches have been defined in the awdds the first approach entails using observations completing questionnaires in a series of surveys and engineering judgments according to the awdds elshaikh et al 2018 conventional diagnosis performance appraisal approach gorantiwar and smout 2005 kuscu et al 2009 rapid appraisal procedure rap okada et al 2008 benchmarking approach borgia et al 2013 rani and singh 2018 are conventional methods for the first approach the employment of these approaches is associated with many limitations since such methods are inherently requires accurate measured on site data the second approach involves using hydrodynamic models to simulate water distribution and delivery in the system and operational performance evaluation indicators molden et al 1998 nam et al 2016 elshaikh et al 2018 shahdany et al 2018 in contrast modeling based evaluation methods require relatively few measurement data to calibrate the simulation model like the present study in that case measured data can be used over a limited period or recorded historical data the developed intelligent model in this study enables irrigation district managers to simulate and evaluate agricultural water distribution daily and in the shortest possible time without the need for scientific background related to hydraulic in the awdds using the different indicators in awdds will provide a practical perception of water distribution in the upstream downstream and midstream regions 4 conclusion this study presents a methodology to develop an intelligent surrogate model for simulation performance evaluation of agricultural water distribution systems supplied by surface water resources the developed model can serve for i improving daily operational management and ii as a preliminary phase for modernization projects in irrigation districts also this model is capable of providing a hierarchical appraisal procedure of the operating system since the developed hbns model can report the performance indicators in the three levels of local evaluating every single off take s performance and regional evaluating the performance of the off takes located in upstream midstream and downstream regions and overall evaluating the performance of the whole system scales in many irrigation districts in the developing countries areas that require operating performance improvement need to be identified due to budgetary constraints and regional evaluations can be a step toward achieving this objective the methodology proposed in this study can be applied to different irrigation districts with different operating systems moreover the model can be extended for simulation performance assessment of the lateral canal networks the operation of water distribution in the lateral canal networks significantly affected the optimal performance of the main canal system therefore the main suggestions for the future research would be i developing a comprehensive model for simulation evaluating of the main and lateral water distribution systems ii developing a master model including off farm i e awdds and on farm including pressurized irrigation systems as an agricultural water management model for irrigation districts also it is recommended to develop an operational appraisal model based on the sustainable development perspective by including economic social and environmental indicators declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10282,biochar amendment has many benefits for improving soil water holding capacity and plant growth particularly under reduced irrigation regimes yet the underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms remain largely elusive the combined effects of biochar addition and deficit irrigation under two n fertilizer regimes on tomato plant growth and physiology were investigated the results showed that despite a negative effect on leaf n content biochar amendment improved the plant water status and leaf gas exchange rates under deficit irrigation thereby enhanced the biomass dm of tomato plants irrespective of n regimes even though biochar amendment tended to reduce instantaneous water use efficiency it significantly enhanced plant water use efficiency wuep biochar increased soil ph and resulted in an increase in xylem ph which however did not amplify the root to shoot aba signalling inducing early stomatal closure during deficit irrigation the principal component analysis pca plot showed that plant water use pwu rather than wuep contributed significantly to the enhanced dm under biochar amendment thus the greater stomatal conductance and transpiration rate and consequently the higher pwu as exemplified by the lowered leaf δ 13c and δ 18o values might have contributed to the increased dm of the biochar treated tomato plants it is concluded that biochar amendment could be a promising practice to enhance tomato seedling growth under reduced irrigation and n fertilization regimes keywords aba signalling biochar nitrogen ph stomatal conductance 1 introduction climate change growing populations and the continuous degradation of soil fertility challenge the agricultural sector climate change may increase the frequency of drought events in many regions olesen et al 2011 connor 2015 and historical poor management such as over application of chemical fertilizers continue to decline soil fertility and cause environmental hazard rockström et al 2010 ray et al 2013 consequently sustainable use of water and fertilizer resources is of utmost importance in future agricultural systems and this calls for integrated sustainable solutions addressing several problems at a time deficit irrigation di is a good irrigation strategy to improve the water use efficiency wue of crops ararssa et al 2019 fereres and soriano 2007 jones 2004 di is a water saving approach where crops are irrigated below their evapotranspiration requirements for a certain period of time djurović et al 2016 however yield penalty due to soil water deficits under di has frequently been noticed in different crop species including tomatoes agbna et al 2017 in addition the photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs measured on tomato plants decreased significantly under di as compared with the fully irrigated plants akhtar et al 2014 thus improvement of di as a water saving irrigation strategy is necessary to increase the applicability and sustainability biochar is the solid product from the pyrolysis of biomass it can be used as a soil amendment in agriculture and it has the potential to improve soil fertility enhance crop productivity and sequester carbon c in the soil smith et al 2010 the application of biochar has many benefits for plant nutrient cycling such as increasing the soil nutrient retention and efficiency and reducing the leaching loss of n laird et al 2010 randolph et al 2017 consistent with this previous studies have observed significant interactions between n fertilizer and biochar addition li et al 2015 mete et al 2015 and cheng et al 2018 found that biochar addition reduced the need for n fertilizer in maize plants however biochar application could also reduce n uptake hereby negatively affect plant growth akhtar et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the discrepancy in influencing n nutrition by biochar addition between the different experimental studies could be due to the varied soil type and biochar combinations bornø et al 2018 to explore the combined effects of biochar amendment and n fertilization on plant n nutrition and growth further research is still needed in addition to the effects on soil chemical properties biochar amendment could also influence soil physical properties such as increasing the soil water holding capacity haider et al 2017 keabetswe et al 2019 akhtar et al 2014 found that the combined effect of reduced irrigation and biochar application positively affected the wue and fruit quality of tomato plants therefore biochar application to soil in combination with di may mitigate water stress and at the same time reduce the need for n fertilizer mulcahy et al 2013 koide et al 2015 however the underlying physiological mechanisms of the effects of biochar and n application on plants grown under di is still not clear the positive effects of biochar on plant productivity are partly due to the indirect effects of biochar application such as soil ph adjustment el naggar et al 2019 increasing the ph in the soil may affect the ionic charge balance inside and outside the root hedley et al 1982 gerendás and schurr 1999 and this change in the cation anion ratio may contribute to ph change in the xylem sap of the plant gollan et al 1992 increased xylem sap ph may result in a significant intensification of the abscisic acid aba signaling inducing partial stomatal closure in plants exposed to soil drying hartung 1983 wilkinson and davies 1997 accordingly biochar effects on plant water relations may reach beyond simple effects on the soil water holding capacity and additional mechanisms affecting plant internal signaling transduction may be an important effect of biochar application to soil moreover low n availability combined with soil water deficits under di could also increase xylem ph modulating the aba based root to shoot signalling hereby regulating stomatal aperture and plant water use bahrun et al 2002 however these relations remain largely elusive and merit further investigations carbon isotopic composition δ13c and oxygen isotopic composition δ18o are associated closely with plant wue it is well established that the increase of δ13c is due to the decrease of gs or the enhancement of pn or both condon et al 2004 δ18o reflects transpiration rates increasing gs thus transpiration rate results in less enrichment of δ18o in leaf barbour 2007 therefore the purpose of simultaneous analysis of leaf δ13c and δ18o is to reveal the relative effect of gs and photosynthetic capacity on changes in plant wue farquhar et al 1998 barbour et al 2000 chaves et al 2003 the objective of this study was to investigate the combined effects of biochar application and di under two n fertilizer regimes on tomato plant growth and physiology we performed principal component analysis pca based on the measured soil plant parameters in order to investigate the interactions between a range of parameters related to plant water relations it was hypothesized that the addition of biochar to soil would i increase the soil water retention and ii increase the soil ph which may increase the ph of the xylem sap affecting the root to shoot aba signaling under di furthermore it was hypothesized that biochar amendment affects the n uptake which would also affect the aba signalling particularly under reduced n fertilization and hence the stomatal regulation on plant transpirational water loss and ultimately increase the plant wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and biochar the biochar was obtained from the uk biochar research centre ukbrc university of edinburgh school of geosciences uk the feedstock was miscanthus straw pellets that were pyrolyzed in a pilot scale rotary kiln pyrolysis unit nominal peak temperature 700 c the soil was collected at the university of copenhagen experimental farm located in tåstrup denmark the soil is classified as a sandy loam the water holding capacity of the soil was 21 vol initially the soil was sieved through a 5 mm mesh and the biochar was ground into a fine powder and sieved through a 0 590 mm mesh the detailed properties of the soil and biochar are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental setup biochar was applied to the soil at a 2 w w ratio and the soil and biochar were mixed thoroughly before filling the 1 5 l pots pots without biochar served as controls to ensure sufficient nutrients supply during the experiment 70 mg p kg soil 1 and 88 mg k kg soil 1 were applied as kh2po4 in a nutrient solution to all pots half the pots received low n fertilization i e 100 mg n kg soil 1 applied as dissolved nh4no3 and the other half of the pots received high n fertilization i e 200 mg n kg soil 1 applied as dissolved nh4no3 the tomato solanum lycopersicum seeds cv ailsa craig were sown in peat on january 1st 2019 and the seedlings were transplanted into the pots at the fourth leaf stage the total duration of the experiment was 38 days after transplanting the seedlings to the pots initially all the pots were irrigated to 90 of pot water holding capacity two weeks after transplanting half the plants were irrigated to only 60 of pot water holding capacity deficit irrigation d whereas the rest of the pots were kept at 90 of pot water holding capacity well watered w throughout the experiment accordingly the treatments included two biochar levels 0 b0 or 2 b1 two n fertilizer regimes n1 and high n2 and two irrigation regimes w or d giving a total of eight treatments with each replicated eight times giving a total of 64 pots the pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at the experimental farm of the university of copenhagen taastrup denmark the climatic conditions in the glasshouse cell were set at 23 16 2 c day night air temperature 60 relative humidity 16 h photoperiod and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetic active radiation par supplied by sunlight plus led lamps the plants were harvested on two occasions four replicates were harvested at the onset of the irrigation treatments 14 days after transplanting to measure the initial biomass and four replicates were harvested for all additional measurements at day 38 after transplant 2 3 soil water content and plant water use at 15 00 h every day the pots were weighed and the irrigation volumes were calculated the volumetric soil water content vol was calculated from the difference between the weight of the irrigated pot and the pot weight with the dry soil determined during pot filling divided by the soil volume i e 1 5 l plant water use pwu was calculated as the sum of irrigation and changes in the soil water content during the treatment period 2 4 gas exchange measurements after initiation of the irrigation treatments photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr were determined daily on the youngest fully developed leaves one leaflet per plant and 4 replicates per treatment in total 32 plants at approximately 10 00 13 00 h the final result is the average of 24 days of measurements the measuring instrument was a portable photosynthetic system licor 6400xt li cor ne usa and the measurements were performed on one leaf per plant at 20 c chamber temperature and 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 photon flux density and at a co2 of 400 ppm instantaneous water use efficiency wueins mmol co2 mol 1 h2o was calculated as the ratio of pn μmol m 2 s 1 to tr mmol m 2 s 1 2 5 measurements on plant water relations and collection of xylem sap at the second harvest the following measurements were conducted firstly the youngest fully developed leaf was used to measure midday leaf water potential ψl by using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment santa barbara ca usa subsequently the same leaf was used for leaf aba measurements and immediately frozen in liquid n and saved at 80 c for further analysis the xylem sap of the stem was collected by pressurizing the potted plant in a scholander type pressure chamber following the procedure described by liu et al 2006 briefly the stem was cut at 5 10 cm above the soil surface and the pot was sealed into the chamber with the cut stem outside pressure was applied gradually to a value equals the ψl of the plant after discarding the first few droplets of the xylem sap by a piece of tissue paper to avoid contamination schurr 1998 the sap was collected into light tight eppendorf tubes and were immediately frozen in liquid n and stored at 80 for ph and aba analysis during the collection of xylem sap the time for collecting the sap was recorded and the stem cross section area was measured then the hydraulic conductance of the whole root system rhc g cm 2 min 1 mpa 1 was calculated as 1 rhc xylem mass t p s where xylem mass is the weight of the collected xylem sap g t is the collection time min p is the chamber pressure mpa which was maintained during collection and s is the stem cross section area cm2 xylem sap ph was determined with a microelectrode model phr 146 lazar research laboratories inc ca usa interfaced with a ph meter model 60 jenco instruments inc ca usa after the sap was allowed to thaw for 30 min the leaf aba and xylem aba concentrations were assayed by elisa enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay following the protocol described by asch 2000 finally the harvested biomass was divided into stem and leaf and the shoot dry mass dm was determined after the samples were dried in an oven at 70 c to a constant weight the c c and n n contents in the leaf were determined on ground dry samples using a chns o elemental analyzer flash 2000 thermo fisher scientific cambridge uk plant wue wuep was calculated as the ratio between the increment of dm between the first harvest at onset of irrigation treatment and the second harvest at the end of the irrigation treatment and pwu during the treatment period total aboveground dry matter dm was calculated as the sum of stem and leaf dry matter 2 6 stable isotope analysis the ground leaf samples were analysed for 13c 12c and 18o 16o ratios on an elemental analyser interfaced with a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms at the university of california stable isotope facility davis california usa isotope values are expressed in delta notation δ in per mill and calculated as 2

their interactions one way anova and tukey s multiple range test at the 5 confidence level was further used when there are significant interactions between the independent variables to test for significant differences between treatments before any analysis we checked to made sure that the data was normally distributed by using the shapiro wilks test and to test homogeniety of variance we

treatments is presented in fig 1 soil water content was determined daily in four pots per treatment the biochar treatments had comparatively higher soil water content with respect to the non biochar treatments under both w and d irrigation regardless of the n fertilizer 3 2 plant growth water use and water use efficiency tomato plants grown under d had significantly lower dm compared to plants grown under w still biochar application and high n supply significantly increased the dm under both d and w conditions table 2 there were no significant interactions between the factors i n and b predictably d decreased the pwu compared to w and pwu was significantly affected by all three factors where the n2 and b1 plants had significantly greater pwu than the n1 and b0 plants respectively however no significant interactions between them were detected table 2 interestingly although b1 plants possessed greater pwu than b0 plants they had significantly higher wuep than b0 plants across all i and n treatments on the other hand neither i nor n treatment had a significant effect on wuep table 2 3 3 leaf gas exchange and instantaneous water use efficiency leaf gas exchange parameters pn tr and gs were significantly affected by all three factors and were lower under d n1 b0 than under w n2 b1 treatments respectively there were significant interaction effects among the three factors on the leaf gas exchange parameters across the eight treatments wn2b1 plants possessed the highest and dn1b0 plants the lowest values table 3 wueins was significantly greater in d than in w and in b0 than in b1 plants as there was a significant interaction among the three factors the tukey s multiple range test showed that disregard the n treatment the d b0 plants had the highest wueins followed by d b1 plants and w plants the lowest table 3 3 4 plant water relations according to the three way anova all three factors b n and i had a significant effect on the ψl and rhc table 3 generally d reduced the rhc and ψ1 compared to the w treatments biochar addition increased both parameters under d accordingly there was a significant two way interaction between b and i for the two parameters i e ψl and rhc generally n2 increased the ψl compared to n1 whereas the rhc was less affected by the n supply table 3 3 5 soil ph and xylem ph biochar significantly increased the soil ph by 1 3 ph units on average table 2 correspondingly a significant increase by 0 4 ph units on average was observed in the xylem sap ph in the biochar treatments table 2 all main factors b i and n had a significant effect on the soil ph whereas only b had a significant main effect on the xylem sap ph table 2 however there was a significant three way interaction between b i and n supply on the xylem ph the soil ph was generally lower under w and n2 in the b treatments the soil ph and xylem sap ph did not correlate however in treatments without biochar application soil ph and xylem sap ph had a significant positive correlation where n1 and d treatments had higher soil and xylem ph than n2 and w treatments respectively fig 3 3 6 concentration of aba in the leaf and xylem sap the aba concentration in the tomato leaves was significantly affected by all three factors i b and n however the aba xylem were only affected by i table 3 d significantly increased the aba concentration in both the leaves and in the xylem sap compared to w table 3 furthermore there was a significant negative correlation between the aba leaf and gs yet for the aba xylem it was only significantly negatively correlated with gs in the b1 treatments fig 4 3 7 the carbon and nitrogen contents in the leaves leaf c was only significantly affected by biochar though there was a significant three way interaction among the main factors table 2 d and n2 plants had greater leaf n compared to w and n1 plants respectively table 2 the c n ratio was affected by all three factors where w n1 b1 treatments led to a greater c n ratio than d n2 b0 treatments respectively table 2 in addition there were significant two way interactions between i and n and b and n on the c n ratio in the leaves table 2 3 8 the carbon and oxygen isotope composition in the leaves the δ13c in tomato leaves was significantly affected by all three main factors b i and n b0 d and n1 plants possessed greater δ13c than b1 w and n2 plants respectively table 2 there was a significant interaction between b and n on δ13c table 2 the δ18o of the tomato leaves was only significantly affected by i where d plants had significantly higher δ18o than w plants table 2 across all treatments a significant negative linear relationship between gs and δ13c while a significant positive linear relationship between δ13c and wueins was observed figs 4 and 5 besides there was a significant positive linear relationship between δ13c and δ18o across all treatments fig 6 3 9 pca of soil plant variables as affected by the treatments the pca based on the measured soil plant parameters revealed that the treatment observations separated into distinct clusters fig 7 pc1 explained 53 1 of the variation whereas pc2 explained only 15 5 of the variation w and d treatments were separated by pc1 where w treatments were generally clustered more to the left and d treatments more to the right on the plot pn gs tr dm pwu ψ1 and rhc positively contributed to the clustering of the w treatments whereas the d treatments were mainly clustered according to the aba leaf aba xylem wueins δ13c and δ18o biochar application generally moved the treatment clusters towards the top left indicating a higher soil ph and ph in the xylem in the biochar treatments and that biochar application increased pn gs tr dm pwu ψ1 and rhc under both w and d conditions n1 and n2 treatments were mainly separated on the pc2 where the n vector strongly contributed to the clustering of the n2 treatments and the c n vector strongly contributed to the clustering of the n1 treatments 4 discussion consistent with other studies edeh et al 2020 obia et al 2020 we found that biochar improved the soil water holding capacity fig 1 and alleviated negative effects of deficit irrigation on several plant parameters for instance biochar amendment improved the plant water status ψl and rhc under deficit irrigation table 3 especially rhc which could be a proxy of embolism formation during drought stress in addition biochar application improved plant leaf gas exchange under deficit irrigation as exemplified by the greater pn gs and tr measured on the biochar as compared with the non biochar plants table 3 it was notable that compared to the non biochar controls biochar addition significantly enhanced the dm of all tomato plants irrespective of the irrigation and n fertilization treatments table 2 the enhancement of dm in the biochar treatments could be attributed to both increases in pwu and wuep table 2 however the pca plot showed that pwu was closely associated with dm and not wuep and wuep generally contributed little to the clustering of the treatments fig 7 thus the greater gs and tr and consequently the higher pwu might have contributed to the increased dm of the tomato plants grown in biochar compared to the non biochar treatments as expected biochar addition significantly increased the soil ph which may have affected the biochemistry in the rhizosphere resulting in an increase of the xylem ph fig 2 and table 2 it is well known that aba based chemical signaling can be amplified by several factors particularly increased ph in the xylem apoplast which could retain more anionic aba liu et al 2005 an increased xylem ph may sensitize the gs response to aba xylem wilkinson et al 1998 this was however not the case in the present study as shown in fig 3a where gs seemed less responsive to aba xylem of the biochar in relation to the non biochar treated plants this result partially goes against our second hypothesis nevertheless a common negative linear relationship between aba leaf and gs was observed for tomato plants grown under all treatments fig 3b indicating that rather than aba xylem aba leaf might have played a more important role in regulating gs in tomato plants in agreement with earlier findings by zhang et al 2018 it is known that reduced n availability in the soil could also induce an increase in the xylem ph bahrun et al 2002 further wang et al 2012 found that a lowered nitrate concentration likewise can cause an increase in xylem ph and in accordance the lowered n uptake in the biochar treatment could also have affected the xylem ph fig 5 accordingly biochar combined with a low n supply resulted in the highest xylem ph table 2 still from the results it is evident that biochar application resulted in greater increases in xylem ph than did n supply table 2 in the present study regardless of n supply and irrigation treatment leaf n was significantly lower in the biochar than in the non biochar treatments fig 5 in accordance with this akhtar et al 2015 and liu et al 2017 also observed a decreased leaf n content with biochar amendment despite the reduced leaf n content the dm of tomato plants was not negatively affected which might be due to increased soil water availability and hence improved plant physiology with biochar addition biochar can adsorb inorganic n species mainly nh4 by electrostatic attraction reducing the availability of applied n fertilizer nguyen et al 2017 hence n sorption by biochar may be the cause of the reduced n uptake observed in this study furthermore the increased plant dm may have lead to leaf n dilution according to the dilution effect loladze 2002 there were no obvious differences in the leaf c between the biochar and the non biochar plants and the leaf c was only affected by the n treatments table 2 as a consequence the leaf c n ratio which indicates the n use efficiency was generally greater in plants grown under biochar treatment table 2 accordingly the c n ratio affected the clustering of the biochar treatments as indicated on the pca plot fig 7 and the pca plot shows a positive correlation between c n ratio and pn consistent with the results reported by torres et al 1991 that the c n ratio increases with the increase in photosynthetic rate it is well established that leaf carbon isotope composition i e δ13c is associated closely with the stomatal regulation of gas exchange hereby the wue farquhar et al 1989 it has been widely used as a good proxy of long term integrated wue wang et al 2010 here full irrigation biochar addition and high n application all resulted in a lowered δ13c in tomato leaves as compared to those under deficit irrigation non biochar addition and reduced n application treatments respectively table 2 the leaf δ13c was found to be negatively correlated with gs fig 4 consistent with earlier findings in tomatoes wang et al 2010 also there was a significant positive linear relationship between δ13c and wueins fig 5 in good agreement with results from previous studies i e wang et al 2010 2018 besides variation in gs and tr can affect δ18o of the leaves whereas changes in pn cannot barbour 2007 while modulation of δ13c could be due to changes in both gs and pn as both can cause 13c fractionation the significant positive relationship between δ13c and δ18o observed here fig 6 indicates gs was the major factor affecting δ13c and hence wueins farquhar et al 1998 barbour and farquhar 2000 barbour et al 2000 therefore the main reason why the plant wue under deficit irrigation is significantly higher compared to the well watered treatment is that drought stress significantly reduces gs hence the transpiration rate often wue at the whole plant level wuep correlates well with that at the leaf level i e wueins pazzagli et al 2016 however this was not the case in the present study as the two variables were not apparently correlated tables 2 and 3 fig 7 thus the enhanced wuep by biochar addition could have been due to an overall improvement of plant performance i e better plant water status and greater leaf gas exchange rates despite a reduced leaf n in the present study we used pca to reveal the global association among the measured soil plant variables fig 7 irrigation and biochar treatments were mainly separated on pc1 explaining 52 7 of the variation whereas the n treatments were primarily separated on pc2 which only accounted for 13 7 of the variation indicating that irrigation and biochar treatments had stronger effects on the measured variables compared to the n treatments it was shown that variables including pn gs tr dm pwu ψ1 and rhc positively contributed to the clustering of the w treatments whereas the d treatments were mainly clustered according to the variables including aba leaf aba xylem wueins δ13c and δ18o in line with the results shown in tables 2 and 3 biochar notably increased the plant shoot biomass and improved photosynthesis in both w and d treatments however the proposed relation between increased xylem ph and aba xylem was not evident in the present study as also indicated by the pca plot as there was no obvious association between the two vectors fig 7 collectively based on the results from the present study it is clear that biochar application can counteract some of the negative consequences of deficit irrigation yet the main positive effect of biochar could be the improvement of the soil water holding capacity hereby sustaining a good plant water status and high leaf gas exchange rates biochar reduced the n in the leaves but without obvious negative effect on plant growth and functioning therefore biochar amendment could be a promising practice to enhance tomato seedling growth under reduced irrigation and n

10282,biochar amendment has many benefits for improving soil water holding capacity and plant growth particularly under reduced irrigation regimes yet the underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms remain largely elusive the combined effects of biochar addition and deficit irrigation under two n fertilizer regimes on tomato plant growth and physiology were investigated the results showed that despite a negative effect on leaf n content biochar amendment improved the plant water status and leaf gas exchange rates under deficit irrigation thereby enhanced the biomass dm of tomato plants irrespective of n regimes even though biochar amendment tended to reduce instantaneous water use efficiency it significantly enhanced plant water use efficiency wuep biochar increased soil ph and resulted in an increase in xylem ph which however did not amplify the root to shoot aba signalling inducing early stomatal closure during deficit irrigation the principal component analysis pca plot showed that plant water use pwu rather than wuep contributed significantly to the enhanced dm under biochar amendment thus the greater stomatal conductance and transpiration rate and consequently the higher pwu as exemplified by the lowered leaf δ 13c and δ 18o values might have contributed to the increased dm of the biochar treated tomato plants it is concluded that biochar amendment could be a promising practice to enhance tomato seedling growth under reduced irrigation and n fertilization regimes keywords aba signalling biochar nitrogen ph stomatal conductance 1 introduction climate change growing populations and the continuous degradation of soil fertility challenge the agricultural sector climate change may increase the frequency of drought events in many regions olesen et al 2011 connor 2015 and historical poor management such as over application of chemical fertilizers continue to decline soil fertility and cause environmental hazard rockström et al 2010 ray et al 2013 consequently sustainable use of water and fertilizer resources is of utmost importance in future agricultural systems and this calls for integrated sustainable solutions addressing several problems at a time deficit irrigation di is a good irrigation strategy to improve the water use efficiency wue of crops ararssa et al 2019 fereres and soriano 2007 jones 2004 di is a water saving approach where crops are irrigated below their evapotranspiration requirements for a certain period of time djurović et al 2016 however yield penalty due to soil water deficits under di has frequently been noticed in different crop species including tomatoes agbna et al 2017 in addition the photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs measured on tomato plants decreased significantly under di as compared with the fully irrigated plants akhtar et al 2014 thus improvement of di as a water saving irrigation strategy is necessary to increase the applicability and sustainability biochar is the solid product from the pyrolysis of biomass it can be used as a soil amendment in agriculture and it has the potential to improve soil fertility enhance crop productivity and sequester carbon c in the soil smith et al 2010 the application of biochar has many benefits for plant nutrient cycling such as increasing the soil nutrient retention and efficiency and reducing the leaching loss of n laird et al 2010 randolph et al 2017 consistent with this previous studies have observed significant interactions between n fertilizer and biochar addition li et al 2015 mete et al 2015 and cheng et al 2018 found that biochar addition reduced the need for n fertilizer in maize plants however biochar application could also reduce n uptake hereby negatively affect plant growth akhtar et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the discrepancy in influencing n nutrition by biochar addition between the different experimental studies could be due to the varied soil type and biochar combinations bornø et al 2018 to explore the combined effects of biochar amendment and n fertilization on plant n nutrition and growth further research is still needed in addition to the effects on soil chemical properties biochar amendment could also influence soil physical properties such as increasing the soil water holding capacity haider et al 2017 keabetswe et al 2019 akhtar et al 2014 found that the combined effect of reduced irrigation and biochar application positively affected the wue and fruit quality of tomato plants therefore biochar application to soil in combination with di may mitigate water stress and at the same time reduce the need for n fertilizer mulcahy et al 2013 koide et al 2015 however the underlying physiological mechanisms of the effects of biochar and n application on plants grown under di is still not clear the positive effects of biochar on plant productivity are partly due to the indirect effects of biochar application such as soil ph adjustment el naggar et al 2019 increasing the ph in the soil may affect the ionic charge balance inside and outside the root hedley et al 1982 gerendás and schurr 1999 and this change in the cation anion ratio may contribute to ph change in the xylem sap of the plant gollan et al 1992 increased xylem sap ph may result in a significant intensification of the abscisic acid aba signaling inducing partial stomatal closure in plants exposed to soil drying hartung 1983 wilkinson and davies 1997 accordingly biochar effects on plant water relations may reach beyond simple effects on the soil water holding capacity and additional mechanisms affecting plant internal signaling transduction may be an important effect of biochar application to soil moreover low n availability combined with soil water deficits under di could also increase xylem ph modulating the aba based root to shoot signalling hereby regulating stomatal aperture and plant water use bahrun et al 2002 however these relations remain largely elusive and merit further investigations carbon isotopic composition δ13c and oxygen isotopic composition δ18o are associated closely with plant wue it is well established that the increase of δ13c is due to the decrease of gs or the enhancement of pn or both condon et al 2004 δ18o reflects transpiration rates increasing gs thus transpiration rate results in less enrichment of δ18o in leaf barbour 2007 therefore the purpose of simultaneous analysis of leaf δ13c and δ18o is to reveal the relative effect of gs and photosynthetic capacity on changes in plant wue farquhar et al 1998 barbour et al 2000 chaves et al 2003 the objective of this study was to investigate the combined effects of biochar application and di under two n fertilizer regimes on tomato plant growth and physiology we performed principal component analysis pca based on the measured soil plant parameters in order to investigate the interactions between a range of parameters related to plant water relations it was hypothesized that the addition of biochar to soil would i increase the soil water retention and ii increase the soil ph which may increase the ph of the xylem sap affecting the root to shoot aba signaling under di furthermore it was hypothesized that biochar amendment affects the n uptake which would also affect the aba signalling particularly under reduced n fertilization and hence the stomatal regulation on plant transpirational water loss and ultimately increase the plant wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and biochar the biochar was obtained from the uk biochar research centre ukbrc university of edinburgh school of geosciences uk the feedstock was miscanthus straw pellets that were pyrolyzed in a pilot scale rotary kiln pyrolysis unit nominal peak temperature 700 c the soil was collected at the university of copenhagen experimental farm located in tåstrup denmark the soil is classified as a sandy loam the water holding capacity of the soil was 21 vol initially the soil was sieved through a 5 mm mesh and the biochar was ground into a fine powder and sieved through a 0 590 mm mesh the detailed properties of the soil and biochar are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental setup biochar was applied to the soil at a 2 w w ratio and the soil and biochar were mixed thoroughly before filling the 1 5 l pots pots without biochar served as controls to ensure sufficient nutrients supply during the experiment 70 mg p kg soil 1 and 88 mg k kg soil 1 were applied as kh2po4 in a nutrient solution to all pots half the pots received low n fertilization i e 100 mg n kg soil 1 applied as dissolved nh4no3 and the other half of the pots received high n fertilization i e 200 mg n kg soil 1 applied as dissolved nh4no3 the tomato solanum lycopersicum seeds cv ailsa craig were sown in peat on january 1st 2019 and the seedlings were transplanted into the pots at the fourth leaf stage the total duration of the experiment was 38 days after transplanting the seedlings to the pots initially all the pots were irrigated to 90 of pot water holding capacity two weeks after transplanting half the plants were irrigated to only 60 of pot water holding capacity deficit irrigation d whereas the rest of the pots were kept at 90 of pot water holding capacity well watered w throughout the experiment accordingly the treatments included two biochar levels 0 b0 or 2 b1 two n fertilizer regimes n1 and high n2 and two irrigation regimes w or d giving a total of eight treatments with each replicated eight times giving a total of 64 pots the pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at the experimental farm of the university of copenhagen taastrup denmark the climatic conditions in the glasshouse cell were set at 23 16 2 c day night air temperature 60 relative humidity 16 h photoperiod and 500 μmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetic active radiation par supplied by sunlight plus led lamps the plants were harvested on two occasions four replicates were harvested at the onset of the irrigation treatments 14 days after transplanting to measure the initial biomass and four replicates were harvested for all additional measurements at day 38 after transplant 2 3 soil water content and plant water use at 15 00 h every day the pots were weighed and the irrigation volumes were calculated the volumetric soil water content vol was calculated from the difference between the weight of the irrigated pot and the pot weight with the dry soil determined during pot filling divided by the soil volume i e 1 5 l plant water use pwu was calculated as the sum of irrigation and changes in the soil water content during the treatment period 2 4 gas exchange measurements after initiation of the irrigation treatments photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr were determined daily on the youngest fully developed leaves one leaflet per plant and 4 replicates per treatment in total 32 plants at approximately 10 00 13 00 h the final result is the average of 24 days of measurements the measuring instrument was a portable photosynthetic system licor 6400xt li cor ne usa and the measurements were performed on one leaf per plant at 20 c chamber temperature and 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 photon flux density and at a co2 of 400 ppm instantaneous water use efficiency wueins mmol co2 mol 1 h2o was calculated as the ratio of pn μmol m 2 s 1 to tr mmol m 2 s 1 2 5 measurements on plant water relations and collection of xylem sap at the second harvest the following measurements were conducted firstly the youngest fully developed leaf was used to measure midday leaf water potential ψl by using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment santa barbara ca usa subsequently the same leaf was used for leaf aba measurements and immediately frozen in liquid n and saved at 80 c for further analysis the xylem sap of the stem was collected by pressurizing the potted plant in a scholander type pressure chamber following the procedure described by liu et al 2006 briefly the stem was cut at 5 10 cm above the soil surface and the pot was sealed into the chamber with the cut stem outside pressure was applied gradually to a value equals the ψl of the plant after discarding the first few droplets of the xylem sap by a piece of tissue paper to avoid contamination schurr 1998 the sap was collected into light tight eppendorf tubes and were immediately frozen in liquid n and stored at 80 for ph and aba analysis during the collection of xylem sap the time for collecting the sap was recorded and the stem cross section area was measured then the hydraulic conductance of the whole root system rhc g cm 2 min 1 mpa 1 was calculated as 1 rhc xylem mass t p s where xylem mass is the weight of the collected xylem sap g t is the collection time min p is the chamber pressure mpa which was maintained during collection and s is the stem cross section area cm2 xylem sap ph was determined with a microelectrode model phr 146 lazar research laboratories inc ca usa interfaced with a ph meter model 60 jenco instruments inc ca usa after the sap was allowed to thaw for 30 min the leaf aba and xylem aba concentrations were assayed by elisa enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay following the protocol described by asch 2000 finally the harvested biomass was divided into stem and leaf and the shoot dry mass dm was determined after the samples were dried in an oven at 70 c to a constant weight the c c and n n contents in the leaf were determined on ground dry samples using a chns o elemental analyzer flash 2000 thermo fisher scientific cambridge uk plant wue wuep was calculated as the ratio between the increment of dm between the first harvest at onset of irrigation treatment and the second harvest at the end of the irrigation treatment and pwu during the treatment period total aboveground dry matter dm was calculated as the sum of stem and leaf dry matter 2 6 stable isotope analysis the ground leaf samples were analysed for 13c 12c and 18o 16o ratios on an elemental analyser interfaced with a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms at the university of california stable isotope facility davis california usa isotope values are expressed in delta notation δ in per mill and calculated as 2

their interactions one way anova and tukey s multiple range test at the 5 confidence level was further used when there are significant interactions between the independent variables to test for significant differences between treatments before any analysis we checked to made sure that the data was normally distributed by using the shapiro wilks test and to test homogeniety of variance we used levene s test correlation significance was tested using pearson s product moment correlation anova and correlation analysis were performed using the software ibm spss statistics 23 spss inc

treatments is presented in fig 1 soil water content was determined daily in four pots per treatment the biochar treatments had comparatively higher soil water content with respect to the non biochar treatments under both w and d irrigation regardless of the n fertilizer 3 2 plant growth water use and water use efficiency tomato plants grown under d had significantly lower dm compared to plants grown under w still biochar application and high n supply significantly increased the dm under both d and w conditions table 2 there were no significant interactions between the factors i n and b predictably d decreased the pwu compared to w and pwu was significantly affected by all three factors where the n2 and b1 plants had significantly greater pwu than the n1 and b0 plants respectively however no significant interactions between them were detected table 2 interestingly although b1 plants possessed greater pwu than b0 plants they had significantly higher wuep than b0 plants across all i and n treatments on the other hand neither i nor n treatment had a significant effect on wuep table 2 3 3 leaf gas exchange and instantaneous water use efficiency leaf gas exchange parameters pn tr and gs were significantly affected by all three factors and were lower under d n1 b0 than under w n2 b1 treatments respectively there were significant interaction effects among the three factors on the leaf gas exchange parameters across the eight treatments wn2b1 plants possessed the highest and dn1b0 plants the lowest values table 3 wueins was significantly greater in d than in w and in b0 than in b1 plants as there was a significant interaction among the three factors the tukey s multiple range test showed that disregard the n treatment the d b0 plants had the highest wueins followed by d b1 plants and w plants the lowest table 3 3 4 plant water relations according to the three way anova all three factors b n and i had a significant effect on the ψl and rhc table 3 generally d reduced the rhc and ψ1 compared to the w treatments biochar addition increased both parameters under d accordingly there was a significant two way interaction between b and i for the two parameters i e ψl and rhc generally n2 increased the ψl compared to n1 whereas the rhc was less affected by the n supply table 3 3 5 soil ph and xylem ph biochar significantly increased the soil ph by 1 3 ph units on average table 2 correspondingly a significant increase by 0 4 ph units on average was observed in the xylem sap ph in the biochar treatments table 2 all main factors b i and n had a significant effect on the soil ph whereas only b had a significant main effect on the xylem sap ph table 2 however there was a significant three way interaction between b i and n supply on the xylem ph the soil ph was generally lower under w and n2 in the b treatments the soil ph and xylem sap ph did not correlate however in treatments without biochar application soil ph and xylem sap ph had a significant positive correlation where n1 and d treatments had higher soil and xylem ph than n2 and w treatments respectively fig 3 3 6 concentration of aba in the leaf and xylem sap the aba concentration in the tomato leaves was significantly affected by all three factors i b and n however the aba xylem were only affected by i table 3 d significantly increased the aba concentration in both the leaves and in the xylem sap compared to w table 3 furthermore there was a significant negative correlation between the aba leaf and gs yet for the aba xylem it was only significantly negatively correlated with gs in the b1 treatments fig 4 3 7 the carbon and nitrogen contents in the leaves leaf c was only significantly affected by biochar though there was a significant three way interaction among the main factors table 2 d and n2 plants had greater leaf n compared to w and n1 plants respectively table 2 the c n ratio was affected by all three factors where w n1 b1 treatments led to a greater c n ratio than d n2 b0 treatments respectively table 2 in addition there were significant two way interactions between i and n and b and n on the c n ratio in the leaves table 2 3 8 the carbon and oxygen isotope composition in the leaves the δ13c in tomato leaves was significantly affected by all three main factors b i and n b0 d and n1 plants possessed greater δ13c than b1 w and n2 plants respectively table 2 there was a significant interaction between b and n on δ13c table 2 the δ18o of the tomato leaves was only significantly affected by i where d plants had significantly higher δ18o than w plants table 2 across all treatments a significant negative linear relationship between gs and δ13c while a significant positive linear relationship between δ13c and wueins was observed figs 4 and 5 besides there was a significant positive linear relationship between δ13c and δ18o across all treatments fig 6 3 9 pca of soil plant variables as affected by the treatments the pca based on the measured soil plant parameters revealed that the treatment observations separated into distinct clusters fig 7 pc1 explained 53 1 of the variation whereas pc2 explained only 15 5 of the variation w and d treatments were separated by pc1 where w treatments were generally clustered more to the left and d treatments more to the right on the plot pn gs tr dm pwu ψ1 and rhc positively contributed to the clustering of the w treatments whereas the d treatments were mainly clustered according to the aba leaf aba xylem wueins δ13c and δ18o biochar application generally moved the treatment clusters towards the top left indicating a higher soil ph and ph in the xylem in the biochar treatments and that biochar application increased pn gs tr dm pwu ψ1 and rhc under both w and d conditions n1 and n2 treatments were mainly separated on the pc2 where the n vector strongly contributed to the clustering of the n2 treatments and the c n vector strongly contributed to the clustering of the n1 treatments 4 discussion consistent with other studies edeh et al 2020 obia et al 2020 we found that biochar improved the soil water holding capacity fig 1 and alleviated negative effects of deficit irrigation on several plant parameters for instance biochar amendment improved the plant water status ψl and rhc under deficit irrigation table 3 especially rhc which could be a proxy of embolism formation during drought stress in addition biochar application improved plant leaf gas exchange under deficit irrigation as exemplified by the greater pn gs and tr measured on the biochar as compared with the non biochar plants table 3 it was notable that compared to the non biochar controls biochar addition significantly enhanced the dm of all tomato plants irrespective of the irrigation and n fertilization treatments table 2 the enhancement of dm in the biochar treatments could be attributed to both increases in pwu and wuep table 2 however the pca plot showed that pwu was closely associated with dm and not wuep and wuep generally contributed little to the clustering of the treatments fig 7 thus the greater gs and tr and consequently the higher pwu might have contributed to the increased dm of the tomato plants grown in biochar compared to the non biochar treatments as expected biochar addition significantly increased the soil ph which may have affected the biochemistry in the rhizosphere resulting in an increase of the xylem ph fig 2 and table 2 it is well known that aba based chemical signaling can be amplified by several factors particularly increased ph in the xylem apoplast which could retain more anionic aba liu et al 2005 an increased xylem ph may sensitize the gs response to aba xylem wilkinson et al 1998 this was however not the case in the present study as shown in fig 3a where gs seemed less responsive to aba xylem of the biochar in relation to the non biochar treated plants this result partially goes against our second hypothesis nevertheless a common negative linear relationship between aba leaf and gs was observed for tomato plants grown under all treatments fig 3b indicating that rather than aba xylem aba leaf might have played a more important role in regulating gs in tomato plants in agreement with earlier findings by zhang et al 2018 it is known that reduced n availability in the soil could also induce an increase in the xylem ph bahrun et al 2002 further wang et al 2012 found that a lowered nitrate concentration likewise can cause an increase in xylem ph and in accordance the lowered n uptake in the biochar treatment could also have affected the xylem ph fig 5 accordingly biochar combined with a low n supply resulted in the highest xylem ph table 2 still from the results it is evident that biochar application resulted in greater increases in xylem ph than did n supply table 2 in the present study regardless of n supply and irrigation treatment leaf n was significantly lower in the biochar than in the non biochar treatments fig 5 in accordance with this akhtar et al 2015 and liu et al 2017 also observed a decreased leaf n content with biochar amendment despite the reduced leaf n content the dm of tomato plants was not negatively affected which might be due to increased soil water availability and hence improved plant physiology with biochar addition biochar can adsorb inorganic n species mainly nh4 by electrostatic attraction reducing the availability of applied n fertilizer nguyen et al 2017 hence n sorption by biochar may be the cause of the reduced n uptake observed in this study furthermore the increased plant dm may have lead to leaf n dilution according to the dilution effect loladze 2002 there were no obvious differences in the leaf c between the biochar and the non biochar plants and the leaf c was only affected by the n treatments table 2 as a consequence the leaf c n ratio which indicates the n use efficiency was generally greater in plants grown under biochar treatment table 2 accordingly the c n ratio affected the clustering of the biochar treatments as indicated on the pca plot fig 7 and the pca plot shows a positive correlation between c n ratio and pn consistent with the results reported by torres et al 1991 that the c n ratio increases with the increase in photosynthetic rate it is well established that leaf carbon isotope composition i e δ13c is associated closely with the stomatal regulation of gas exchange hereby the wue farquhar et al 1989 it has been widely used as a good proxy of long term integrated wue wang et al 2010 here full irrigation biochar addition and high n application all resulted in a lowered δ13c in tomato leaves as compared to those under deficit irrigation non biochar addition and reduced n application treatments respectively table 2 the leaf δ13c was found to be negatively correlated with gs fig 4 consistent with earlier findings in tomatoes wang et al 2010 also there was a significant positive linear relationship between δ13c and wueins fig 5 in good agreement with results from previous studies i e wang et al 2010 2018 besides variation in gs and tr can affect δ18o of the leaves whereas changes in pn cannot barbour 2007 while modulation of δ13c could be due to changes in both gs and pn as both can cause 13c fractionation the significant positive relationship between δ13c and δ18o observed here fig 6 indicates gs was the major factor affecting δ13c and hence wueins farquhar et al 1998 barbour and farquhar 2000 barbour et al 2000 therefore the main reason why the plant wue under deficit irrigation is significantly higher compared to the well watered treatment is that drought stress significantly reduces gs hence the transpiration rate often wue at the whole plant level wuep correlates well with that at the leaf level i e wueins pazzagli et al 2016 however this was not the case in the present study as the two variables were not apparently correlated tables 2 and 3 fig 7 thus the enhanced wuep by biochar addition could have been due to an overall improvement of plant performance i e better plant water status and greater leaf gas exchange rates despite a reduced leaf n in the present study we used pca to reveal the global association among the measured soil plant variables fig 7 irrigation and biochar treatments were mainly separated on pc1 explaining 52 7 of the variation whereas the n treatments were primarily separated on pc2 which only accounted for 13 7 of the variation indicating that irrigation and biochar treatments had stronger effects on the measured variables compared to the n treatments it was shown that variables including pn gs tr dm pwu ψ1 and rhc positively contributed to the clustering of the w treatments whereas the d treatments were mainly clustered according to the variables including aba leaf aba xylem wueins δ13c and δ18o in line with the results shown in tables 2 and 3 biochar notably increased the plant shoot biomass and improved photosynthesis in both w and d treatments however the proposed relation between increased xylem ph and aba xylem was not evident in the present study as also indicated by the pca plot as there was no obvious association between the two vectors fig 7 collectively based on the results from the present study it is clear that biochar application can counteract some of the negative consequences of deficit irrigation yet the main positive effect of biochar could be the improvement of the soil water holding capacity hereby sustaining a good plant water status and high leaf gas exchange rates biochar reduced the n in the leaves but without obvious negative effect on plant growth and functioning therefore biochar amendment could be a promising practice to enhance tomato seedling growth under reduced irrigation and n

10283,actual evapotranspiration λet can be estimated with meteorological parameters using the penman monteith pm model where the canopy resistance r c plays an important role but is difficult to determine the katerji perrier kp and todorovic td models are widely used to determine the r c a comparative study was conducted to evaluate the performances of two models on hourly and daily scales in simulating the λet for a tea and a wheat field in southeast china the estimated λet was compared with the measured λet by the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the results indicated that the kp model simulated the λet of tea and wheat well for both hourly and daily scales while the td model simulated the λet well for the wheat for both time scales but significantly overestimated the tea λet by 44 9 therefore the kp model was preferred to estimate λet for both crops the td model should be avoided in tea fields keywords evapotranspiration canopy resistance penman monteith katerji perrier model todorovic model 1 introduction as the water for agricultural irrigation accounts for a large part of the total water consumption it is critical to establish a reasonable irrigation schedule accurate determination of evapotranspiration can provide a scientific basis for agricultural water management acquah et al 2018 xu and chen 2005 yan et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a evapotranspiration can be expressed in the form of mass or energy kool et al 2014 which is the latent heat flux λet when expressed in terms of energy penman 1948 numerous approaches have been developed to estimate and measure the λet using empirical and mechanistic approaches porporato et al 2004 such as the bowen ratio energy balance breb method for measuring λet and the penman monteith pm model and priestley taylor pt model for estimating λet among these methods the breb method is a micrometeorological method to determine λet zhang et al 2008 and it has been widely used over various surfaces such as crop fields todd et al 2000 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 grassland pauwels and samson 2006 forest ecosystems dawson 1996 and water surface burba et al 1999 wang et al 2019 the breb method relies on the assumption that eddy diffusivities of heat and vapor transport are equal heilman et al 1989 unlike other methods this method does not require data about wind and aerodynamic characteristics of the surface and only needs the temperature and humidity data at two different heights to estimate λet usually a fetch to height ratio of 100 1 is considered a good value but some studies reported that ratio of 20 1 also can obtain an acceptable λet result heilman et al 1989 however the conditions required to use the breb method are not always met and the method is easily affected by bad weather such as rainfall fog etc despite these defects the breb method has good performances in estimating λet pozníková et al 2018 yunusa et al 2004 thus the λet measured by the breb method was chosen as a benchmark for comparison in this study the pm model is one of the best known models allen et al 1998 gong et al 2017 ortega farias et al 2006 rana et al 1997a 1997b yan et al 2015 2018a and was derived from the principles of energy conservation and air diffusion theory canopy resistance r c and aerodynamic resistance r a were adopted on this model based on the assumption that water vapor has to overcome the canopy resistance when moving from the inside of the plant canopy to the momentum source sink and the aerodynamic resistance when diffusing into the atmosphere li et al 2014 since the pm model only needs the meteorological data to estimate λet and has high estimation accuracy it has been commonly used however in order to apply the pm method the r a and r c must be determined often the r a is determined by two approaches one proposed by perrier 1975 and the other by thom 1972 on the other hand many approaches have been developed to obtain r c such as the katerji perrier kp todorovic td jarvis and leuning models jarvis 1976 katerji et al 1983 leuning et al 2008 todorovic 1999 among them the kp model was tested successfully in many studies ayyoub et al 2015 peterschmitt and perrier 1991 rana et al 2001 zhu et al 2014 however the td model resulted in a heavy over or under estimation of r c and λet frequently li et al 2015 margonis et al 2018 rana et al 2011 nevertheless the td model still remains a good alternative method because it has an attractive advantage that it can be applied without any calibration however the td model needs to be further tested and investigated to exactly quantify the over or under estimation and to search for possible corrections and or adaptations to cropped surfaces in addition despite many studies on the penman monteith and canopy resistance models have been done only a few works focused on the performance of these models for tea camellia sinensis and wheat triticum aestivum of southeast china based on different time scales have been done the primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of λet simulated by the pm model with r c estimated by the kp and td models for two different vegetated covers tea and wheat and time scales hourly and daily scale the hourly and daily modeled λet were compared to the corresponding measured values using the breb method the causes of the discrepancies between the estimated and measured λet were analyzed the optimal approach to estimate λet at the tea and wheat fields was recommended for establishing a reasonable irrigation scheduling 2 material and methods

the end of march 2018 the area of the tea field is 0 32 ha 55 m 58 m and tea is the major crop cultivated in the ambient area anji white tea one of the main cultivars of tea in china was used for the experiment the tea was planted on march 5 2014 with row spacing of 52 cm and plant spacing of 120 cm according to the local traditional cultivated method the tea trees have been pruned to keep its height at 0 5 m sprinkler irrigation was adopted to water the plants and the total amount of irrigation applied during the experimental period was around 880 mm the mean annual rainfall in this area is 1475 mm and the average air temperature is 17 the maximum and minimum air temperatures through the year are 40 3 and 7 1 respectively the soil texture of the area is loam with a field capacity of

hc z 0 h is the roughness length governing transfer of heat and vapor m computed as z 0h 0 1z 0 u z is the wind speed at height z m s 1 and κ is the von karman constant the difference between the two r a equations is that the big leaf is located in the top of the canopy in the case of the kp approach while at level d z0 in the case of the formulation used by the td approach 2 3 2 1 estimation of r c using kp model the kp model is a semi empirical approach katerji and perrier 1983 found a linear relationship between the ratios r c r a and r r a with the following relation 6 r c r a a r r a b where a and b are empirical coefficients which need experimental determination r is climatic resistance monteith et al 1965 and defined as 7 r δ γ ρ c p v p d δ γ r n g 2 3 2 2 estimation of r c using

quadratic eq 8 which has only one positive solution the canopy resistance r c can be deduced from eq 12 afterwards the r c is incorporated into the eq 3 to estimate the λet 2 3 3 statistical evaluation comparisons were made between the estimates of λet and the corresponding measured ones with a linear regression based on the standard of trying to optimize the determination coefficient r 2 in the case of the kp model the empirical coefficients a and b were determined with the calibration data set moreover mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency

zhang et al 2019b 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of hourly evapotranspiration 3 1 1 calibration of the kp model the kp model was calibrated based on the data from a tea and wheat field individually the model coefficients a and b were yielded from the linear regression between r c r a and r r a for each site as it was proved that about 20 values of hourly data were sufficient to calibrate these parameters in the kp model for a reliable result katerji and rana 2006 in this study the kp model was calibrated using hourly data during four typical clear days which were randomly chosen from the experimental periods at tea and wheat fields data for the days used to calibrate the model were not used for the comparison between measured and estimated r c and λet the r c was computed by inverting the eq 3 with the measured λet fig 4 represents the results of the linear regression between r c r a and r r a for the tea and wheat the regression coefficients a and b of the kp model were 1 05 and 0 3 for tea and 0 59 and 0 12 for wheat respectively the determination coefficients ranged between 0 91 wheat and 0 96 tea moreover in order to make a better quantitative comparison between the calibration results of the kp model the results of some previous studies are summarized as shown in table 1 it can be seen that the coefficients in the kp model vary greatly with different climates and vegetation 3 1 2 comparison between estimated and measured λet at hourly scale six typical clear days were selected for analyzing the hourly variation of energy fluxes and bowen ratio in tea and wheat fields fig 5 where λet was calculated by breb method the maximum values of r n in the tea field ranged from 444 3 to 678 9 w m 2 and the maximum values of r n in the wheat field ranged from 587 9 to 704 2 w m 2 r n λet and h had similar diurnal trends which increased from the morning reached the maximum around noon and then decreased from 7 00 18 00 the values of β in the tea and wheat fields both ranged from 0 to 1 the comparisons between estimated hourly λet using pm equation and measured values by breb method in a tea and wheat field are presented in fig 6 it is apparent that the estimated and measured λet values using the kp and td methods are both highly correlated r 2 0 9 the statistical indices of different models are shown in table 2 for the kp model the slope of the linear relationships between estimated and measured λet values was 1 08 for tea and 1 01 for wheat during the whole growing period fig 6 a b thus the kp model overestimated λet slightly both in the cases of tea and wheat the intercepts were 2 9 and 0 61 with rmse of 24 37 and 33 2 w m 2 for tea and wheat respectively the slight overestimation maybe occur as a result of the calibration coefficients a and b being applied for the whole growing stage both for tea and wheat instead of calibrating these parameters for different growth stages as previously stated the data used to calibrate these coefficients were randomly selected from the experimental periods however these data cannot fully reflect the crop growing state for instance the conditions in sparse canopy periods are different from those in dense canopy periods these results are the same as gharsallah et al 2013 in that the λet simulated by the kp method was slightly overestimated at an irrigated maize field for the td model the slope of the linear relationships between estimated and measured λet was 1 37 for the tea fig 6 c with rmse of 86 47 w m 2 and nse of 0 47 indicating that the td model overestimated the λet significantly and the slope was 1 00 for the wheat fig 6 d with rmse of 34 59 w m 2 and nse of 0 93 therefore the td model can estimate the λet of wheat accurately according to the statistics reported in table 2 the best nse value 0 96 was obtained with the kp model for tea the worst nse value 0 47 was obtained with the td model for tea despite the td model giving an excellent nse value of 0 93 the best mae acquired on tea for both kp and td methods was equal to 13 1 w m 2 overall the kp model seems to be more reliable and robust than the td model for λet estimation and has already been applied successfully in many works gharsallah et al 2013 katerji et al 2011 katerji and rana 2006 lecina et al 2003 li et al 2015 margonis et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 3 1 3 analysis of the causes of discrepancy between estimated and measured λet values by the td model since the kp model achieved good results in simulating the λet value while the td model heavily overestimated the tea λet value the causes of errors in using the td model were analyzed in this paper the td model is based on a theoretical hypothesis and can be applied without calibration in contrast to the kp model which is a semi empirical approach the eq 4 was used to obtain the aerodynamic resistance in the kp model r a kp and the eq 5 was applied to calculate the aerodynamic resistance in the td model r a td in order to figure out the impact of different calculation methods of r a on the λet estimated by the td model λet td λet td was recalculated using r a kp instead of r a td and then the new λet td λet td new was compared with the measured λet λet measured the results are shown in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that the error of the λet td new was much larger than the λet td it can be concluded that the selection of the formula of r a was correct and the calculation values of r a were not responsible for the overestimation of λet using the td model in this study then the effect of vapor pressure deficit vpd on the overestimation of λet calculated by the td model in the tea field was analyzed the relationship of vpd and the difference between the estimated and measured λet is shown in fig 8 as for the tea with values of vpd mainly ranging between 1 and 3 kpa the errors λet td λet measured were positive values the td model was affected severely by vpd regardless of the vpd values and the errors increased almost linearly with the increase of vpd hence a possible reason for the overestimation is the relatively large vpd value from june to august 1 5kpa 4kpa in the tea field and the stomatal resistance of tea being sensitive to the change of vpd there are several published studies described the role of vpd in overestimating the λet values pauwels and samson 2006 shi et al 2008 srivastava et al 2018 moreover the diurnal evolutions of estimated r c and λet at the tea field were analyzed using the average values of three typical clear days only the daytime 7 00 18 00 variations of r c and λet for tea are shown in fig 9 the diurnal pattern of the r c estimated by kp model r c kp and td model r c td exhibited a similar pattern to the r c calculated by inverting the pm equation r c pm the pattern was characterized by the values being high both in the early morning and late afternoon low and relative stable between 9 00 15 00 fig 9a the values of r c td were smaller than the corresponding values of r c kp and r c pm throughout the day the values of r c kp were always close to the r c pm the diurnal variation of λet kp and λet td was similar to that of net radiation r n and λet measured however there existed differences in the magnitudes the λet kp was close to λet measured but the λet td was overestimated significantly all λet values increased sharply after sunrise reached a maximum at noon then slowly declined and decreased sharply after 15 00 other researchers also presented similar variations margonis et al 2018 yan et al 2018b zhang et al 2008 in combination with eq 3 the td method significantly underestimated the r c which led to a heavy overestimation of tea λet as for the effect of soil moisture since there was no water deficit during the experiment fig 2 the effect of soil moisture deficit on the model performance could be excluded finally as reported in katerji et al 2011 the errors of td model also might be due to the theory limitations of the model which based on several ideal assumptions that did not exist in reality and did not consider enough for climatic variables in the r c modeling 3 2 estimation of daily evapotranspiration the estimated and measured daily λet were computed by summing the hourly values for both crops from 7 00 18 00 on each day the comparison between the measured and estimated daily λet of the kp and td models for tea and wheat are presented in fig 10 the statistical evaluation of different methods is listed in table 2 for the tea crop the slope of the linear regression of the kp model was 1 08 fig 10 a which was much closer to 1 than the td model 1 47 fig 10 c and nse value of the kp model 0 95 was much closer to 1 than the td model 0 14 these statistics indicated that the td model overestimated the λet value significantly and the kp model overestimated the λet value slightly for the wheat crop fig 10 b d the slopes were 0 99 and 0 98 and the intercepts were 0 01 and 1 00 for the kp and td model respectively the r 2 and nse values of the two models were identical furthermore considering the mae and rmse values the kp model was superior to the td model as the mae of the kp model was 13 45 w m 2 lower than that for the td model and the rmse of the kp model was 23 03 w m 2 also lower than that for the td model generally similar to the hourly scale the td method performed less effectively for the tea field where λet was overestimated while performed well for the wheat field the kp approach performed well at both sites 4 conclusions in this study two r c models kp and td were applied and compared for the λet estimation the performances of the models were validated using the measured λet by the breb method in a tea and wheat field according to evaluating the performances of the two models on both hourly and daily time scales the model most suitable for the tea and wheat was suggested based on the analysis of statistical indices the following conclusions were made the kp model was the superior method for predicting hourly λet of tea and wheat while the td model was also a good option for simulating the hourly λet of wheat however the td model significantly overestimated the hourly λet of tea the error increased with the increase in vpd the kp model could simulate daily λet of tea and wheat well with slight overestimation and underestimation respectively the td model was a good alternative approach for estimating daily λet of wheat but it was completely unsuitable for modeling daily λet of tea the canopy resistance estimated by kp r c kp and td model r c td showed similar diurnal variations to it calculated by inverting the pm equation r c pm the r c kp agreed more closely with the r c pm while the r c td was always significantly lower than the r c pm the reason for the underestimation of the td model might due to the model theory limitations it should be noted that since only one year s data were used in this study the applicability of the two r c models to wheat and tea still needs to be further verification and the causes of model errors need to be further analyzed declaration of competing

10283,actual evapotranspiration λet can be estimated with meteorological parameters using the penman monteith pm model where the canopy resistance r c plays an important role but is difficult to determine the katerji perrier kp and todorovic td models are widely used to determine the r c a comparative study was conducted to evaluate the performances of two models on hourly and daily scales in simulating the λet for a tea and a wheat field in southeast china the estimated λet was compared with the measured λet by the bowen ratio energy balance breb method the results indicated that the kp model simulated the λet of tea and wheat well for both hourly and daily scales while the td model simulated the λet well for the wheat for both time scales but significantly overestimated the tea λet by 44 9 therefore the kp model was preferred to estimate λet for both crops the td model should be avoided in tea fields keywords evapotranspiration canopy resistance penman monteith katerji perrier model todorovic model 1 introduction as the water for agricultural irrigation accounts for a large part of the total water consumption it is critical to establish a reasonable irrigation schedule accurate determination of evapotranspiration can provide a scientific basis for agricultural water management acquah et al 2018 xu and chen 2005 yan et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a evapotranspiration can be expressed in the form of mass or energy kool et al 2014 which is the latent heat flux λet when expressed in terms of energy penman 1948 numerous approaches have been developed to estimate and measure the λet using empirical and mechanistic approaches porporato et al 2004 such as the bowen ratio energy balance breb method for measuring λet and the penman monteith pm model and priestley taylor pt model for estimating λet among these methods the breb method is a micrometeorological method to determine λet zhang et al 2008 and it has been widely used over various surfaces such as crop fields todd et al 2000 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 grassland pauwels and samson 2006 forest ecosystems dawson 1996 and water surface burba et al 1999 wang et al 2019 the breb method relies on the assumption that eddy diffusivities of heat and vapor transport are equal heilman et al 1989 unlike other methods this method does not require data about wind and aerodynamic characteristics of the surface and only needs the temperature and humidity data at two different heights to estimate λet usually a fetch to height ratio of 100 1 is considered a good value but some studies reported that ratio of 20 1 also can obtain an acceptable λet result heilman et al 1989 however the conditions required to use the breb method are not always met and the method is easily affected by bad weather such as rainfall fog etc despite these defects the breb method has good performances in estimating λet pozníková et al 2018 yunusa et al 2004 thus the λet measured by the breb method was chosen as a benchmark for comparison in this study the pm model is one of the best known models allen et al 1998 gong et al 2017 ortega farias et al 2006 rana et al 1997a 1997b yan et al 2015 2018a and was derived from the principles of energy conservation and air diffusion theory canopy resistance r c and aerodynamic resistance r a were adopted on this model based on the assumption that water vapor has to overcome the canopy resistance when moving from the inside of the plant canopy to the momentum source sink and the aerodynamic resistance when diffusing into the atmosphere li et al 2014 since the pm model only needs the meteorological data to estimate λet and has high estimation accuracy it has been commonly used however in order to apply the pm method the r a and r c must be determined often the r a is determined by two approaches one proposed by perrier 1975 and the other by thom 1972 on the other hand many approaches have been developed to obtain r c such as the katerji perrier kp todorovic td jarvis and leuning models jarvis 1976 katerji et al 1983 leuning et al 2008 todorovic 1999 among them the kp model was tested successfully in many studies ayyoub et al 2015 peterschmitt and perrier 1991 rana et al 2001 zhu et al 2014 however the td model resulted in a heavy over or under estimation of r c and λet frequently li et al 2015 margonis et al 2018 rana et al 2011 nevertheless the td model still remains a good alternative method because it has an attractive advantage that it can be applied without any calibration however the td model needs to be further tested and investigated to exactly quantify the over or under estimation and to search for possible corrections and or adaptations to cropped surfaces in addition despite many studies on the penman monteith and canopy resistance models have been done only a few works focused on the performance of these models for tea camellia sinensis and wheat triticum aestivum of southeast china based on different time scales have been done the primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of λet simulated by the pm model with r c estimated by the kp and td models for two different vegetated covers tea and wheat and time scales hourly and daily scale the hourly and daily modeled λet were compared to the corresponding measured values using the breb method the causes of the discrepancies between the estimated and measured λet were analyzed the optimal approach to estimate λet at the tea and wheat fields was recommended for establishing a reasonable irrigation scheduling 2 material and methods

zhang et al 2019b 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of hourly evapotranspiration 3 1 1 calibration of the kp model the kp model was calibrated based on the data from a tea and wheat field individually the model coefficients a and b were yielded from the linear regression between r c r a and r r a for each site as it was proved that about 20 values of hourly data were sufficient to calibrate these parameters in the kp model for a reliable result katerji and rana 2006 in this study the kp model was calibrated using hourly data during four typical clear days which were randomly chosen from the experimental periods at tea and wheat fields data for the days used to calibrate the model were not used for the comparison between measured and estimated r c and λet the r c was computed by inverting the eq 3 with the measured λet fig 4 represents the results of the linear regression between r c r a and r r a for the tea and wheat the regression coefficients a and b of the kp model were 1 05 and 0 3 for tea and 0 59 and 0 12 for wheat respectively the determination coefficients ranged between 0 91 wheat and 0 96 tea moreover in order to make a better quantitative comparison between the calibration results of the kp model the results of some previous studies are summarized as shown in table 1 it can be seen that the coefficients in the kp model vary greatly with different climates and vegetation 3 1 2 comparison between estimated and measured λet at hourly scale six typical clear days were selected for analyzing the hourly variation of energy fluxes and bowen ratio in tea and wheat fields fig 5 where λet was calculated by breb method the maximum values of r n in the tea field ranged from 444 3 to 678 9 w m 2 and the maximum values of r n in the wheat field ranged from 587 9 to 704 2 w m 2 r n λet and h had similar diurnal trends which increased from the morning reached the maximum around noon and then decreased from 7 00 18 00 the values of β in the tea and wheat fields both ranged from 0 to 1 the comparisons between estimated hourly λet using pm equation and measured values by breb method in a tea and wheat field are presented in fig 6 it is apparent that the estimated and measured λet values using the kp and td methods are both highly correlated r 2 0 9 the statistical indices of different models are shown in table 2 for the kp model the slope of the linear relationships between estimated and measured λet values was 1 08 for tea and 1 01 for wheat during the whole growing period fig 6 a b thus the kp model overestimated λet slightly both in the cases of tea and wheat the intercepts were 2 9 and 0 61 with rmse of 24 37 and 33 2 w m 2 for tea and wheat respectively the slight overestimation maybe occur as a result of the calibration coefficients a and b being applied for the whole growing stage both for tea and wheat instead of calibrating these parameters for different growth stages as previously stated the data used to calibrate these coefficients were randomly selected from the experimental periods however these data cannot fully reflect the crop growing state for instance the conditions in sparse canopy periods are different from those in dense canopy periods these results are the same as gharsallah et al 2013 in that the λet simulated by the kp method was slightly overestimated at an irrigated maize field for the td model the slope of the linear relationships between estimated and measured λet was 1 37 for the tea fig 6 c with rmse of 86 47 w m 2 and nse of 0 47 indicating that the td model overestimated the λet significantly and the slope was 1 00 for the wheat fig 6 d with rmse of 34 59 w m 2 and nse of 0 93 therefore the td model can estimate the λet of wheat accurately according to the statistics reported in table 2 the best nse value 0 96 was obtained with the kp model for tea the worst nse value 0 47 was obtained with the td model for tea despite the td model giving an excellent nse value of 0 93 the best mae acquired on tea for both kp and td methods was equal to 13 1 w m 2 overall the kp model seems to be more reliable and robust than the td model for λet estimation and has already been applied successfully in many works gharsallah et al 2013 katerji et al 2011 katerji and rana 2006 lecina et al 2003 li et al 2015 margonis et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 3 1 3 analysis of the causes of discrepancy between estimated and measured λet values by the td model since the kp model achieved good results in simulating the λet value while the td model heavily overestimated the tea λet value the causes of errors in using the td model were analyzed in this paper the td model is based on a theoretical hypothesis and can be applied without calibration in contrast to the kp model which is a semi empirical approach the eq 4 was used to obtain the aerodynamic resistance in the kp model r a kp and the eq 5 was applied to calculate the aerodynamic resistance in the td model r a td in order to figure out the impact of different calculation methods of r a on the λet estimated by the td model λet td λet td was recalculated using r a kp instead of r a td and then the new λet td λet td new was compared with the measured λet λet measured the results are shown in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that the error of the λet td new was much larger than the λet td it can be concluded that the selection of the formula of r a was correct and the calculation values of r a were not responsible for the overestimation of λet using the td model in this study then the effect of vapor pressure deficit vpd on the overestimation of λet calculated by the td model in the tea field was analyzed the relationship of vpd and the difference between the estimated and measured λet is shown in fig 8 as for the tea with values of vpd mainly ranging between 1 and 3 kpa the errors λet td λet measured were positive values the td model was affected severely by vpd regardless of the vpd values and the errors increased almost linearly with the increase of vpd hence a possible reason for the overestimation is the relatively large vpd value from june to august 1 5kpa 4kpa in the tea field and the stomatal resistance of tea being sensitive to the change of vpd there are several published studies described the role of vpd in overestimating the λet values pauwels and samson 2006 shi et al 2008 srivastava et al 2018 moreover the diurnal evolutions of estimated r c and λet at the tea field were analyzed using the average values of three typical clear days only the daytime 7 00 18 00 variations of r c and λet for tea are shown in fig 9 the diurnal pattern of the r c estimated by kp model r c kp and td model r c td exhibited a similar pattern to the r c calculated by inverting the pm equation r c pm the pattern was characterized by the values being high both in the early morning and late afternoon low and relative stable between 9 00 15 00 fig 9a the values of r c td were smaller than the corresponding values of r c kp and r c pm throughout the day the values of r c kp were always close to the r c pm the diurnal variation of λet kp and λet td was similar to that of net radiation r n and λet measured however there existed differences in the magnitudes the λet kp was close to λet measured but the λet td was overestimated significantly all λet values increased sharply after sunrise reached a maximum at noon then slowly declined and decreased sharply after 15 00 other researchers also presented similar variations margonis et al 2018 yan et al 2018b zhang et al 2008 in combination with eq 3 the td method significantly underestimated the r c which led to a heavy overestimation of tea λet as for the effect of soil moisture since there was no water deficit during the experiment fig 2 the effect of soil moisture deficit on the model performance could be excluded finally as reported in katerji et al 2011 the errors of td model also might be due to the theory limitations of the model which based on several ideal assumptions that did not exist in reality and did not consider enough for climatic variables in the r c modeling 3 2 estimation of daily evapotranspiration the estimated and measured daily λet were computed by summing the hourly values for both crops from 7 00 18 00 on each day the comparison between the measured and estimated daily λet of the kp and td models for tea and wheat are presented in fig 10 the statistical evaluation of different methods is listed in table 2 for the tea crop the slope of the linear regression of the kp model was 1 08 fig 10 a which was much closer to 1 than the td model 1 47 fig 10 c and nse value of the kp model 0 95 was much closer to 1 than the td model 0 14 these statistics indicated that the td model overestimated the λet value significantly and the kp model overestimated the λet value slightly for the wheat crop fig 10 b d the slopes were 0 99 and 0 98 and the intercepts were 0 01 and 1 00 for the kp and td model respectively the r 2 and nse values of the two models were identical furthermore considering the mae and rmse values the kp model was superior to the td model as the mae of the kp model was 13 45 w m 2 lower than that for the td model and the rmse of the kp model was 23 03 w m 2 also lower than that for the td model generally similar to the hourly scale the td method performed less effectively for the tea field where λet was overestimated while performed well for the wheat field the kp approach performed well at both sites 4 conclusions in this study two r c models kp and td were applied and compared for the λet estimation the performances of the models were validated using the measured λet by the breb method in a tea and wheat field according to evaluating the performances of the two models on both hourly and daily time scales the model most suitable for the tea and wheat was suggested based on the analysis of statistical indices the following conclusions were made the kp model was the superior method for predicting hourly λet of tea and wheat while the td model was also a good option for simulating the hourly λet of wheat however the td model significantly overestimated the hourly λet of tea the error increased with the increase in vpd the kp model could simulate daily λet of tea and wheat well with slight overestimation and underestimation respectively the td model was a good alternative approach for estimating daily λet of wheat but it was completely unsuitable for modeling daily λet of tea the canopy resistance estimated by kp r c kp and td model r c td showed similar diurnal variations to it calculated by inverting the pm equation r c pm the r c kp agreed more closely with the r c pm while the r c td was always significantly lower than the r c pm the reason for the underestimation of the td model might due to the model theory limitations it should be noted that since only one year s data were used in this study the applicability of the two r c models to wheat and tea still needs to be further verification and the causes of model errors need to be further analyzed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

10284,with the development of chinese economy more and more attention has been paid to environmental protection the implementation of water price policy affects economic and environmental changes in china this paper analyzes the impact of water price policy on agricultural land use and the scale of water pollution discharge in 240 cities in china between 2001 and 2017 by including data from china urban statistical yearbook and china land resources almanac the theoretical analysis of this study indicates that the optimal scale of pollution depends on the local initial endowment economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities furtherly the economic activities have a worsening impact on environmental pollution but when the government implements environmental protection and water price policy measures in response to environmental pollution caused by economic activities it has a significant impact on the decline in the scale of pollution the government has promoted the pollution suppression model in the formulation of water prices which has internalized the external cost of pollution in economic activities and can effectively reduce the scale of agricultural water pollution discharge keywords agricultural water conversation land use water pollution water price policy 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country with a large population therefore agricultural production food security and farmer s income are all important issues however all these agricultural activities are fundamentally related to soil and water resources which are a necessity for agricultural production it is obvious that agricultural irrigation water in china is subjected to double pressure from supply and demand on the supply side due to the shortage of water resources per capita uneven distribution between north and south prominent water pollution and ecosystem degradation water resource shortage has become an important constraint to social and economic development at the same time the rapid growth of industrial and domestic water demand and agricultural irrigation water has formed a fierce competition leading to a significant reduction in the irrigation water supply although rapid economic changes after china s reform and opening up have led to an increase in per capita income the destruction of the natural environment is becoming increasingly serious the available water resources in economic activities decrease year by year according to the china environment statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2018 china s total water resources in 2018 totaled 2876 1 billion cubic meters however it has only increased by 3 83 since 2000 at the same time water resources per capita have been reduced from 2193 9 cubic meters in 2000 2074 5 cubic meters in 2017 and water available per capita has been declining year by year the decline of available water resources per capita the demand for economic activities and the requirement of natural and ecological environment protection affect the current water utilization in china in addition with the growth of chinese economy and the acceleration of urbanization the transfer of rural labor force reduces the agricultural labor force but also increases the demand for agricultural products the requirements of products inevitably affect the needs of water resources utilization and cost considerations in the production process therefore it has become a meaningful topic for the government to adjust policies to achieve the goals of economic growth environmental protection and resource utilization as the agricultural population in china still accounts for the majority how to increase farmers income has become an urgent issue agricultural income is an important factor that affects farmers enthusiasm towards grain production meanwhile it is also a focus of policy since 1978 the income of farmers has increased greatly in rural areas of china hong and sun 2020 however all the time the development of agriculture is still faced with constraints from both financial resources and environmental resources jin and jin 2020 as the economy took off the flow of state finance shifted mainly to the non agricultural sector in order to respond various financial measures were adopted for example china has carried out tax sharing reform for the development of the agricultural sector and promoted the value added tax of major taxes to deal with the problems faced by agricultural workers since 1994 song 2020 moreover as agricultural activities have a huge demand for water for this reason water conservation has also become one of the goals need to be achieved because water supply needs to invest public resources and has the characteristics of natural monopoly it is necessary to use government power to conduct price regulation since 1994 chinese government has been promoting various measures related to water price reform water price improvement water price subsidies and allowance with a view to maintaining agricultural output value and reducing the economic burden of farmers the purpose of agricultural subsidies is to promote agricultural development and protect the interests of domestic agricultural producers the agricultural subsidy policy is one of the most important agricultural policies in china therefore it is widely discussed by both chinese and foreign scholars wang and cao 2008 sun 2011 cui et al 2017 love et al 2019 however over the years economic development has brought negative impacts on the environment to a certain degree coupled with population growth and other factors that restrict the supply of water resources per capita government revises water pricing regulations quite frequently current studies seldom explored the influence of china s water pricing regulations and policies on water management especially it s meaning for achieving sustainable soil and water protection the current regulation of water price in china originated from the water law of the people s republic of china in 1988 and was amended many times in august 2002 august 2009 and july 2016 respectively in addition to the regulations of the central government other departments often launch relevant measures as well for example in order to protect the utilization of agricultural water and soil resources in march 2006 the national development and reform commission and the ministry of water resources put forward the notice on strengthening the management of water price in agricultural end canal system hoping to carry out the terminal water price system that promotes the metering charge of agricultural water for farmers shao 2019 on the basis of clarifying the property right clearing up the assets and checking the capital controlling the personnel and constraining the cost it shall be checked and approved in accordance with the principle of compensating the operation and maintenance expenses of the agricultural end canal system from the perspective of economics this kind of specification is the type of internalizing external cost through the pricing mode of water price the environmental pollution problem can be internalized to promote production while carrying out economic activities the management and control of environmental pollution are considered simultaneously so as to achieve the goal of maintaining sustained economic activities and guaranteeing water and soil resources in recent years the chinese government has paid much more attention to environmental protection basically relevant improvement programs of water source and water price regulation are launched every year for example in 2017 the national development and reform commission and other five departments jointly issued the notice on solidly promoting the reform of agricultural water price in 2018 the national development and reform commission the ministry of finance the ministry of water resources and the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs jointly issued the notice on increasing efforts to promote the comprehensive reform of agricultural water price basically showing an annual adjustment pattern from this background it can be seen that china is trying to protect soil and water resources in various regions agricultural and forestry areas through water price and other policies the purpose of this study is to analyze the causal relationship between agricultural water price policy and environment and to explore the impact of water price measures referring to studies like cai and treisman 2005 zhang et al 2011 yu et al 2015 this paper considers the impact of regional endowment of chinese local government economic capital and water price policies and measures on environmental pollution and focus on water pollution in the next section the present study will review previous relevant theories and literature and clarify the supplementary role of this paper for the past research gap then on this basis the methodology and research results of this paper will be presented 2 literature review 2 1 water resources value theory estimating the value of water resources is the premise of setting the price of water resources western classical axiology mainly includes land rent theory labor theory of value utility theory of value equilibrium theory of value etc qin 2013 on this basis gan et al 2012 summarized the total attribute value of water resources into use value property value labor value and compensation value li et al 1987 1990 1991 pointed out that the basic criteria of resource accounting are economic returns and discussed the basic criteria and methods of water resource value accounting to some extent some scholars also believed that the value of water resources has time flow space flow and space time flow zhong et al 2012 aiming at the difference between value and price jiang et al 1993 conducted a study and pointed out that the former is essentially the capitalization of the land rent of water resources to obtain the right of use water users pay the money amount to the owners of water resources state or collective etc whether the water resources include human labor or not the latter is the amount of money paid to the operator when the water user purchases the water and proposes that the water resource value production cost and normal profit together constitute the water resource price jiang and wang 1996 however in recent years some scholars have discussed the strategic role of agricultural water saving on agricultural green development and rural revitalization and pointed out that the current price of agricultural water is much lower than the value of water resources and the comprehensive benefit of agricultural water saving is based on the value of water resources ma 2019 it can be seen that the research on the value theory of water resources is based on the value theory in the field of capital and economy in the early stage and ecology is gradually considered and become a new trend influenced by such cognition and actual demand countries have gradually begun to reflect the intention of ecological protection and resource conservation in water price setting 2 2 china s policy transformation towards sustainable water with regard to the issue of how to make water prices in china the chinese government has put forward relevant policies in the past table 1 summarizes some most important water price regulations and implementation objectives in recent years in china various policies mainly refer to the five year plan china s related environmental policy changes are mainly compared with the economic activities in the past five years which are cycled every five years in the past china s policies focused on economic growth however with the slowdown of economic activities and the deterioration of environmental pollution in recent years more and more emphasis has been placed on environmental protection under the covid 19 epidemic in 2020 the chinese government did not emphasize the economic growth target for the first time which can be seen as a shift of attention to social and environmental issues from the perspective of the government water is a kind of public service mainly provided by the government and the total amount of water resources distribution of water resources capacity of water conservancy facilities social equity of water supply and other issues are inseparable from the public service function played by the government however with the development of economy and the impact of various production activities on environmental pollution in the past the satisfaction of promoting public services is restricted by the level of development and the number of public resources therefore at certain stages part of public services must be chosen as basic public services to ensure satisfaction in this context we can find that the initial goal of the government s water price formulation and measures is not directly related to environmental protection as mentioned in the introduction the original goal of carrying out water subsidies levies or other related systems is to reduce the burden of chinese farmers however with the follow up development of economy and the deterioration of environment pollution control has become the direction of government when making water price in addition government needs to consider the reduction of water resources per capita simultaneously in the formulation of water price therefore the water price regulation is gradually moving towards the goal of water conservation from the perspective of input output the use of water resources in production is an input factor reaching the goal of water conservation while maintaining production capacity would help to gain economic efficiency 2 3 financial water policy in terms of fiscal policy tools subsidy policies have received widespread attention as china s economy has experienced rapid growth for more than 40 years since the 1980s zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 the contribution of agriculture to gdp in modern economic activities is relatively small therefore agricultural policies were mostly analyzed from the perspective of subsidies western scholars have different views on agricultural subsidies agricultural subsidies originated from the concept of effective protection corden 1966 proposed to measure the degree of agricultural subsidies by the ratio of the difference between the added value of agricultural products in the domestic market and the added value of agricultural products in the international market to the added value of agricultural products in the international market the comprehensive research on agricultural subsidy system is made by mccalla 1985 who pointed out that agricultural subsidies should be given based on various theories different scholars at home and abroad have studied agricultural subsidies the main theories include market failure theory zhang 2012 welfare changes in the economic system bahagwati 2004 public finance theory and agricultural defect theory the research on china s agricultural subsidy policy mainly involves two aspects policy design and simulation experiment the discussion of policy design mainly analyzes the possibility and effect of policy implementation according to the current practice of agricultural subsidies at home and abroad and the requirements of the agreement on agriculture of wto based on the features of water resources that exist in the form of water elements and water commodities at the same time li et al 2014 established a computable general equilibrium model cge of water resources which included water production and supply industry water resource element reward and production water subsidy three scenarios were established improving the price of water resource elements adjusting production water subsidies and technological progress and li et al 2014 discussed the economic and social changes of jiangxi province under the goal of water saving the results showed that increasing the price of water resources reducing production water subsidy and technological progress can improve the efficiency of water use and reduce the total water demand however no matter viewed from the index of total output gdp employment price level or the income of residents and enterprises increasing the price of water resources and adjusting production water subsidy will have negative impacts on the economy the negative impact of reducing production water subsidy is even greater however technological progress can promote economic development while achieving the goal of water conservation wang et al 2015 simulated and analyzed the impact of agricultural water use efficiency policy and water resource tax policy on the national economy by using the relevant data of 2007 interregional input output table the simulation results showed that the improvement of agricultural water use efficiency can save the production water consumption of each region and is conducive to economic growth the policy of levying water resources tax of agricultural sector can also save the production water consumption of each region but is not conducive to economic growth from the perspective of saving production water consumption and promoting economic growth compared with the water resources tax policy the effect of efficiency policy is better besides the author found that the same policy has different degrees of influence on the regional economic variables and the direction may also be different for the demand of production water the agricultural water use efficiency policy has a greater influence on the northeast north china huang huai hai and northwest regions but less influence on the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river southeast south china and southwest regions the policy of water resources tax imposed by the agricultural sector has a greater impact on the northeast northwest south china and southwest regions but a smaller impact on the north china huang huai hai the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and southeast regions using global trade analysis project gtap and its global trade and input output database cao et al 2012 set different policy projects to simulate the possible changes of chinese agricultural subsidy policies by designing changes in the total amount of policy subsidy and policy support the research points out that increasing the subsidy of chinese agricultural amber box policy and the support of green box policy will reduce the overall welfare of china but will promote agricultural production and import and export trade gao and yin 2016 pointed out that the resource tax of china is a pure mineral resource tax and its tax setting is determined by the urgency of resource protection and the operability of collection this study evaluated the burden level of water resource fee from three aspects the proportion of water resource fee in the unit price of tap water the proportion of urban water fee in disposable income per capita and the proportion of water resource fee in the burden of domestic enterprises and sorts out the existing problems in the collection and management of water resource fee 2 4 water conservation the purpose of water price promotion can be regarded as the internalization of pollution generated by economic activities through pricing so as to achieve the effect of users and polluters paying the benefit of its promotion is to achieve water conservation through the implementation of the water price system the literature points out that the use of water conservation has an impact on agriculture huang and zhang 2020 indicated that most studies discussing the economic and management issues of water and soil conservation employed various econometric models to analyze the factors affecting farmers decision in adopting the water and soil conservation strategies mathieu et al 2019 applied a probit model to analyze the factors that determine the adoption of water conservation techniques among bam cotton producers the authors concluded that early warning group membership smartphone ownership and cotton income are decisive factors however technical assistance and access to the pesticide were negative factors kpadonou et al 2017 applied multivariate and ordered probit models to analyze farmers adoption decisions for eleven on farm water and soil conservation practices in western african drylands and the results showed that labor knowledge and capital intensive farmers were more likely to make adoption decisions some studies pointed out that water conservation can help increase the output of crops for example bowley 2015 found that wind and water which were unimpeded by forest cover would devastate crops and the soil and water conservation practices promoted by the government as well as the management of farmland would improve crop production janssen and swinnen 2019 zilberman et al 2019 huang and zhang 2020 furtherly concluded that culture is a critical factor that affects water conservation and then causes the influence on the food chain agricultural supply and other economic behavior 2 5 summary from the above literature review it can be found that scholars have long studied the value and pricing of water with the need for a sustainable future scholars find that china gradually takes the adjustment of water related financial policies as one of the means to achieve sustainable development among these financial policies water price policy and environmental subsidy policy play an important role however due to the limitations of research objects and data previous literature mostly focused on the implementation of subsidy policies as a macro policy implemented by a country the purpose of environmental subsidy is mainly to protect the specific industries of the country realize the balance between product structure and total amount guarantee a fair life of producers in the industry and achieve the goal of environmental protection and sustainable development however the present study found that current literature on water policy pays too much attention to subsidy but ignored the things that happened in the water price to achieve a sustainable future the agricultural water price policy in china experienced a huge change between 2001 and 2019 as shown in fig 1 the price policy reform reveals the chinese government s ambition in addition to economic development the government gradually hopes to ensure the rational use of water resources in particular the important government documents such as no 1 central document issued relevant instructions on the reform of agricultural water price which makes the impact of agricultural water price on the environment a question worth discussing 3 methodology the chinese government or other entities have not announced micro data on water resources such as tax charge fee or other costs related to water resources the empirical analysis encounters data constraints therefore we analyze the impact of water price norms on the economy and the environment through theoretical construction in this paper policy variables are added to the framework of cai and treisman 2005 zhang et al 2011 and yu et al 2015 to investigate the impact of local government s water price policy and changes in local officials on economy and environment to be specific it investigates an economy composed of i regions with a central planner and a local government in each region the total amount of capital owned by the whole economy is k i k i represents the amount of environmental investment in the region i each region may be different in two aspects first the endowment of resources climate and economic basis is different in each region second each local government may adopt different endogenous policies local governments carry out relevant environmental protection investment and economic policies and measures through fiscal revenue fiscal expenditure and the supervision of the central government in addition in combination with the government s public water price policy in a specific year it will have an impact on the water pollution and economic output value of the region first the budget of local government can be expressed as formula 1 1 p i 1 t i θ i t i g i s i t y i p i t i t i is the amount of environmental pollution caused by agricultural economic activities in the region y i θ i t i represent the economic output value in the region and the investment or control measures used for pollution caused by agricultural economic activities respectively in terms of the research subject of this paper θ i t i is the water price measures in different periods and the degree of strictness of the implementation of measures θ i is affected by water pollution caused by agricultural activities or whether water resources are insufficient or not t i θ i 0 economic output needs economic activities of supplied land so p i 1 and p i represent the unit cost and land transfer price of local government to prevent and control pollution caused by agricultural economic activities respectively assuming p i p i 1 the utility function of local government is shown as formula 2 2 u i g u i 1 δ u i 2 φ u c i y i δ g i φ c i u i 1 y i is used to indicate that whether the governor of local government has been promoted or changed u i 2 g i is the regional economic and environmental performance under the governance if the economic growth is strong or the environmental protection is effective for example the water price policy effectively controls water conservation or the water price regulation internalizes the water pollution which effectively suppresses the scale of water pollution it means the policies of current government are effective and the utility level of local governments has been improved finally u c i c i is the economic level of the residents on employment in this region if the macro economy is improved so will the income per capita and the overall economic and environmental level assuming that the household budget of residents on employment and the production function of region are as follows 3 c i p i 0 t i 0 t i p i 1 t i 4 y i a i k i α t i β a i represents regional endowment k i is the input capital of the regional economy α and β are the input variant parameters both of them are greater than 0 α β 1 by substituting 1 and 3 into 2 the condition for maximizing the utility of local government is as follows 5 y i t i τ i p i τ i p i φ p i 0 p i 1 δ θ i p i 1 p i δ t 1 is the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by local government s economic activities eq 5 shows that when considering economic activities and environmental protection the marginal output of the regional land sold for economic activities under the relevant environmental protection measures such as the amount of environmental investment water price policy etc is equal to the marginal cost then from formula 4 and formula 5 the optimal pollution quantity can be obtained 6 ln t i 1 1 β ln a i ln β α 1 β ln k i 1 1 β ln τ i p i eq 6 shows that when the local government is faced with the problem of substitution between economic activities and environmental protection the optimal scale of pollution depends on the initial local endowment ln a i ln β economic investment capital ln k i and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities ln τ i p i in other words the scale of regional pollution may be affected by three factors first when other conditions remain unchanged the better the initial endowment is the lower the cost of economic activity exploitation or resource utilization is which may lead to resource abuse and pollution aggravation second when more capital is invested in the economic production process the overall output value is promoted but the scale of pollution is also increased finally the marginal cost of economic activities is the factor of pollution control from the research theme of this paper water price policy or regulation promoted by local government or central government can be regarded as an alternative variable of the marginal cost of environmental pollution empirically based on the data of prefecture level cities in china the impact of water price policy on environmental pollution can be further explored 4 results empirical analysis adopts formula 7 7 ln t it a i r 1 ln p it r 2 ln k it r 3 policy r 4 ln capit a it u it in eq 6 we can find that initial local endowment economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities are the critical factors in order to compare with the theory implementation and the empirical analyze we assume variable wage capit a it as the proxy variable of ln k i in eq 6 variable ln p it and ln k it reflect the initial local endowment finally due to we cannot find the exact water price criteria we use the dummy variable as the policy affect in order to explore the impact of urban water price policy and economic development on soil and water environment the selection of explained variable ln t it is the discharge amount of water pollution of agricultural industry in prefecture level cities of china over the years variable ln p it is the transfer price of urban land supply for economic output variable ln k it is the amount of financial lending in each city over the years variable policy is whether water price policy is carried out in the current year variable ln capit a it is the urban labor income over the years reflecting the economic level of residents on employment in the region it should be noted that why transfer price of urban land supply is used as the variable of economic investment capital as the land administration law of the people s republic of china makes local government the only land transfer or in the primary market of the region the land transfer has become one of the options for local government to raise financial resources quickly as is pointed out in the document another factor is that the promotion of chinese public officials is affected by the performance of economic growth accumulating short term capital while promoting economic activities through land transfer has become one of the strategies for local governments to achieve economic results quickly zhou 2007 zhang et al 2011 yu et al 2015 in addition we also include the variable change to explore the impact of the change of urban governance team the empirical data of this paper is from china urban statistical yearbook and china land and resources almanac between 2001 and 2017 the research objects include 240 cities in china table 1 summarizes the definitions and descriptive statistics of each empirical variable based on the theoretical analysis above both economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution can explain environmental pollution therefore we test the impact of them on the environment respectively through empirical analysis in the analysis considering the income from the sale of state owned land and control the cost of environmental pollution we take the deposit balance of financial institutions at the end of the year and whether to implement the water price measures as explanatory variables to explore their impact on the agricultural wastewater discharge as a result we will know about which explanatory capacity is stronger and carry out relevant stability test table 2 summarizes the main empirical results in order to get reliable results we use ols and random effects in the analysis process from the empirical results when discussing the impact of economic aspect and environmental aspect respectively it can be found that both of them had significant impact on explanatory variables first of all the empirical estimation of ols 1indicates that variable ln p it is significant to the regression coefficient of water pollution discharge being as a positive solution it is corresponded to intuition that economic activities have a deteriorating impact on environmental pollution ols 2 discusses that variable ln k it is significant to the regression coefficient of water pollution discharge being as a positive solution it can be found that the influence direction is consistent with ln p it in order to determine the white test which is the additional test of ols 1 and ols 2 of the empirical estimation combination table 2 to test the omitted variable test to estimate whether there are missing variables in the combination and the variance inflation factor to test collinearity when verifying the original assumption of heteroscedasticity and missing variables that there is possibility to mutate or omit the heteroscedasticity the estimation results are significant and the original hypothesis is rejected according to nerlove 1963 if the variance influence factor vif is greater than 10 the influence of the estimated variable collinearity is higher the results show that the vif values of the other variables are less than 10 indicating that there is no collinearity problem in the overall empirical portfolio re 1 re 2 of table 2 extend the empirical combination of ols 1 and ols 2 and analyze the influence of each explanatory variable through the panel in accordance with the results of ols analysis it can be found that ln p it ln k it still had a significant impact on water pollution it is noteworthy that the environmental protection and water price policy in response to the environmental pollution caused by economic activities had a significant impact on the reduction of pollution scale taking re1 as an example the estimated coefficient is 0 033 which was significant it shows that the water price policy policy or regulation promoted by government has increased the marginal cost of environmental pollution faced by producers in economic activities and the increase of cost has further restrained the scale of pollution through the implementation of water price policy and the cause and effect analysis of economy and environment it is found that the government is pushing forward the mode of restraining pollution in the formulation of water price internalizing the external cost of pollution in economic activities and effectively reducing the scale of urban water pollution discharge in order to guarantee the accuracy of the analysis explanatory variables in table 3 are analyzed from the perspective of pollution lag the judgment of the empirical portfolio mainly considers the possible time sequence of policy implementation we also consider whether the government has changed compared with table 2 variable change in table 3 analyses when the secretary of the municipal party committee changed in the previous year will it affect the scale of agricultural sewage discharge the estimation results show that the variable ln p it ln k it and policy still have significant influence on the explanatory variables which is in consistent with foresaid theoretical inference second variable change is not significant through the empirical results we can infer that the behavior of local governments in land transfer is rational they want to stimulate economic activities and promote economic growth through land supply however in order to suppress the pollution problems caused by economic activities producers are regulated through the water price policy of internalizing the exogenous cost which is revealed in the variable policy that significantly reduces the scale of urban water pollution finally in table 5 we estimate and compare with the difference of regions it can be seen from table 5 that the empirical results are consistent with tables 3 and 4 the results show that except for estimation 2 the variable ln p it has a significant positive impact on the explained variable ln t it the empirical results show that economic activities have a worsening effect on environmental pollution secondly environmental protection and water pricing policies in response to environmental pollution caused by economic activities have a significant impact on the reduction of the scale of pollution policy variables have the greatest impact on the eastern region and the least impact on the western region similar results are also shown in the estimation of variable ln capit a it it is estimated that when labor wages increase the impact on the eastern region is the largest at 0 751 followed by the coastal region at 0 482 the central region at 0 480 and the western region at 0 344 finally the estimate of the variable change showed that there was no statistically significant influence on each explained variable 5 conclusion in the past 50 years the world s population and income have increased dramatically and people have a large demand for clean water and are concerned about whether the supply of water can meet these needs in the future people s demand for water will certainly continue to increase unless we try to reduce demand so that the growth curve of water supply can be slowed especially when global warming changes the distribution of rainfall and increases water evaporation the best way to balance supply and demand is to introduce reasonable water charges the scarcer the supply of natural resources the more important the mechanism for efficient allocation of demand whether it is now or in the future in this regard the available freshwater resources are no different from other scarce resources such as oil or gas among them the word usable is the key point for example the problem of global warming has not reduced the world s freshwater but it has indeed reduced the available freshwater becker and posner 2009 for instance in many parts of the world snowmelt is an important freshwater resource however when global warming continues the pattern of precipitation in many areas has changed from snowfall to rainfall compared with snowmelt rainfall is relatively difficult to collect and distribute affected the supply of water resources with the development of economy in china more and more attention has been paid to environmental protection among these policies the implementation of water price policy affected the economic and environmental changes in china this paper analyzes the impact of water price measures on the scale of water pollution discharge in 240 cities in china between 2001 and 2017 referring to china urban statistical yearbook and china land resources almanac this paper analyzes the impact of local government s land sales revenue deposits balance of financial institutions at the end of the year and the implementation of water price policy on pollution discharge from the perspective of theory and practice in theory this paper indicates that in an economy of political centralization and economic decentralization the local initial endowment economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities affect regional environmental pollution simultaneously empirically through panel data it can be found that environmental protection and water price policy in response to environmental pollution caused by economic activities have a significant impact on the decline of the pollution scale this paper argues that local governments in china respond rationally to political incentives through land supply or related economic policies from the perspective of local government s behavior in land transfer and financial lending the implementation of such kind of economic policy is the response to the current political incentive mechanism if the current incentive mechanism is changed it will have coupling effects on chinese environment such as cultivated area environmental conservation water and soil resources maintenance and other factors the central government should pay attention to the control of land transfer and the optimization of land use from the design of official incentives in pursuit of their political achievements during their term of office local government officials sold agricultural and industrial land at a low price and commercial and residential land at a high price which results in the loss of land use efficiency and fails to maximize the welfare of subjects of local economic activities the chinese government may speed up the improvement of the cadre appraisal program to optimize the structure of land use changing the view of political achievements which considers gdp only adding the assessment dimensions of economic development efficiency and social benefits of economic development could also help in recent years the chinese government has been making water prices towards the goal of water conservation which can be regarded as the improvement of the government s governance in the social benefits of economic development through the internalization of negative environmental externality in economic activities the pollution discharge problem can be effectively adjusted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10284,with the development of chinese economy more and more attention has been paid to environmental protection the implementation of water price policy affects economic and environmental changes in china this paper analyzes the impact of water price policy on agricultural land use and the scale of water pollution discharge in 240 cities in china between 2001 and 2017 by including data from china urban statistical yearbook and china land resources almanac the theoretical analysis of this study indicates that the optimal scale of pollution depends on the local initial endowment economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities furtherly the economic activities have a worsening impact on environmental pollution but when the government implements environmental protection and water price policy measures in response to environmental pollution caused by economic activities it has a significant impact on the decline in the scale of pollution the government has promoted the pollution suppression model in the formulation of water prices which has internalized the external cost of pollution in economic activities and can effectively reduce the scale of agricultural water pollution discharge keywords agricultural water conversation land use water pollution water price policy 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country with a large population therefore agricultural production food security and farmer s income are all important issues however all these agricultural activities are fundamentally related to soil and water resources which are a necessity for agricultural production it is obvious that agricultural irrigation water in china is subjected to double pressure from supply and demand on the supply side due to the shortage of water resources per capita uneven distribution between north and south prominent water pollution and ecosystem degradation water resource shortage has become an important constraint to social and economic development at the same time the rapid growth of industrial and domestic water demand and agricultural irrigation water has formed a fierce competition leading to a significant reduction in the irrigation water supply although rapid economic changes after china s reform and opening up have led to an increase in per capita income the destruction of the natural environment is becoming increasingly serious the available water resources in economic activities decrease year by year according to the china environment statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2018 china s total water resources in 2018 totaled 2876 1 billion cubic meters however it has only increased by 3 83 since 2000 at the same time water resources per capita have been reduced from 2193 9 cubic meters in 2000 2074 5 cubic meters in 2017 and water available per capita has been declining year by year the decline of available water resources per capita the demand for economic activities and the requirement of natural and ecological environment protection affect the current water utilization in china in addition with the growth of chinese economy and the acceleration of urbanization the transfer of rural labor force reduces the agricultural labor force but also increases the demand for agricultural products the requirements of products inevitably affect the needs of water resources utilization and cost considerations in the production process therefore it has become a meaningful topic for the government to adjust policies to achieve the goals of economic growth environmental protection and resource utilization as the agricultural population in china still accounts for the majority how to increase farmers income has become an urgent issue agricultural income is an important factor that affects farmers enthusiasm towards grain production meanwhile it is also a focus of policy since 1978 the income of farmers has increased greatly in rural areas of china hong and sun 2020 however all the time the development of agriculture is still faced with constraints from both financial resources and environmental resources jin and jin 2020 as the economy took off the flow of state finance shifted mainly to the non agricultural sector in order to respond various financial measures were adopted for example china has carried out tax sharing reform for the development of the agricultural sector and promoted the value added tax of major taxes to deal with the problems faced by agricultural workers since 1994 song 2020 moreover as agricultural activities have a huge demand for water for this reason water conservation has also become one of the goals need to be achieved because water supply needs to invest public resources and has the characteristics of natural monopoly it is necessary to use government power to conduct price regulation since 1994 chinese government has been promoting various measures related to water price reform water price improvement water price subsidies and allowance with a view to maintaining agricultural output value and reducing the economic burden of farmers the purpose of agricultural subsidies is to promote agricultural development and protect the interests of domestic agricultural producers the agricultural subsidy policy is one of the most important agricultural policies in china therefore it is widely discussed by both chinese and foreign scholars wang and cao 2008 sun 2011 cui et al 2017 love et al 2019 however over the years economic development has brought negative impacts on the environment to a certain degree coupled with population growth and other factors that restrict the supply of water resources per capita government revises water pricing regulations quite frequently current studies seldom explored the influence of china s water pricing regulations and policies on water management especially it s meaning for achieving sustainable soil and water protection the current regulation of water price in china originated from the water law of the people s republic of china in 1988 and was amended many times in august 2002 august 2009 and july 2016 respectively in addition to the regulations of the central government other departments often launch relevant measures as well for example in order to protect the utilization of agricultural water and soil resources in march 2006 the national development and reform commission and the ministry of water resources put forward the notice on strengthening the management of water price in agricultural end canal system hoping to carry out the terminal water price system that promotes the metering charge of agricultural water for farmers shao 2019 on the basis of clarifying the property right clearing up the assets and checking the capital controlling the personnel and constraining the cost it shall be checked and approved in accordance with the principle of compensating the operation and maintenance expenses of the agricultural end canal system from the perspective of economics this kind of specification is the type of internalizing external cost through the pricing mode of water price the environmental pollution problem can be internalized to promote production while carrying out economic activities the management and control of environmental pollution are considered simultaneously so as to achieve the goal of maintaining sustained economic activities and guaranteeing water and soil resources in recent years the chinese government has paid much more attention to environmental protection basically relevant improvement programs of water source and water price regulation are launched every year for example in 2017 the national development and reform commission and other five departments jointly issued the notice on solidly promoting the reform of agricultural water price in 2018 the national development and reform commission the ministry of finance the ministry of water resources and the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs jointly issued the notice on increasing efforts to promote the comprehensive reform of agricultural water price basically showing an annual adjustment pattern from this background it can be seen that china is trying to protect soil and water resources in various regions agricultural and forestry areas through water price and other policies the purpose of this study is to analyze the causal relationship between agricultural water price policy and environment and to explore the impact of water price measures referring to studies like cai and treisman 2005 zhang et al 2011 yu et al 2015 this paper considers the impact of regional endowment of chinese local government economic capital and water price policies and measures on environmental pollution and focus on water pollution in the next section the present study will review previous relevant theories and literature and clarify the supplementary role of this paper for the past research gap then on this basis the methodology and research results of this paper will be presented 2 literature review 2 1 water resources value theory estimating the value of water resources is the premise of setting the price of water resources western classical axiology mainly includes land rent theory labor theory of value utility theory of value equilibrium theory of value etc qin 2013 on this basis gan et al 2012 summarized the total attribute value of water resources into use value property value labor value and compensation value li et al 1987 1990 1991 pointed out that the basic criteria of resource accounting are economic returns and discussed the basic criteria and methods of water resource value accounting to some extent some scholars also believed that the value of water resources has time flow space flow and space time flow zhong et al 2012 aiming at the difference between value and price jiang et al 1993 conducted a study and pointed out that the former is essentially the capitalization of the land rent of water resources to obtain the right of use water users pay the money amount to the owners of water resources state or collective etc whether the water resources include human labor or not the latter is the amount of money paid to the operator when the water user purchases the water and proposes that the water resource value production cost and normal profit together constitute the water resource price jiang and wang 1996 however in recent years some scholars have discussed the strategic role of agricultural water saving on agricultural green development and rural revitalization and pointed out that the current price of agricultural water is much lower than the value of water resources and the comprehensive benefit of agricultural water saving is based on the value of water resources ma 2019 it can be seen that the research on the value theory of water resources is based on the value theory in the field of capital and economy in the early stage and ecology is gradually considered and become a new trend influenced by such cognition and actual demand countries have gradually begun to reflect the intention of ecological protection and resource conservation in water price setting 2 2 china s policy transformation towards sustainable water with regard to the issue of how to make water prices in china the chinese government has put forward relevant policies in the past table 1 summarizes some most important water price regulations and implementation objectives in recent years in china various policies mainly refer to the five year plan china s related environmental policy changes are mainly compared with the economic activities in the past five years which are cycled every five years in the past china s policies focused on economic growth however with the slowdown of economic activities and the deterioration of environmental pollution in recent years more and more emphasis has been placed on environmental protection under the covid 19 epidemic in 2020 the chinese government did not emphasize the economic growth target for the first time which can be seen as a shift of attention to social and environmental issues from the perspective of the government water is a kind of public service mainly provided by the government and the total amount of water resources distribution of water resources capacity of water conservancy facilities social equity of water supply and other issues are inseparable from the public service function played by the government however with the development of economy and the impact of various production activities on environmental pollution in the past the satisfaction of promoting public services is restricted by the level of development and the number of public resources therefore at certain stages part of public services must be chosen as basic public services to ensure satisfaction in this context we can find that the initial goal of the government s water price formulation and measures is not directly related to environmental protection as mentioned in the introduction the original goal of carrying out water subsidies levies or other related systems is to reduce the burden of chinese farmers however with the follow up development of economy and the deterioration of environment pollution control has become the direction of government when making water price in addition government needs to consider the reduction of water resources per capita simultaneously in the formulation of water price therefore the water price regulation is gradually moving towards the goal of water conservation from the perspective of input output the use of water resources in production is an input factor reaching the goal of water conservation while maintaining production capacity would help to gain economic efficiency 2 3 financial water policy in terms of fiscal policy tools subsidy policies have received widespread attention as china s economy has experienced rapid growth for more than 40 years since the 1980s zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 the contribution of agriculture to gdp in modern economic activities is relatively small therefore agricultural policies were mostly analyzed from the perspective of subsidies western scholars have different views on agricultural subsidies agricultural subsidies originated from the concept of effective protection corden 1966 proposed to measure the degree of agricultural subsidies by the ratio of the difference between the added value of agricultural products in the domestic market and the added value of agricultural products in the international market to the added value of agricultural products in the international market the comprehensive research on agricultural subsidy system is made by mccalla 1985 who pointed out that agricultural subsidies should be given based on various theories different scholars at home and abroad have studied agricultural subsidies the main theories include market failure theory zhang 2012 welfare changes in the economic system bahagwati 2004 public finance theory and agricultural defect theory the research on china s agricultural subsidy policy mainly involves two aspects policy design and simulation experiment the discussion of policy design mainly analyzes the possibility and effect of policy implementation according to the current practice of agricultural subsidies at home and abroad and the requirements of the agreement on agriculture of wto based on the features of water resources that exist in the form of water elements and water commodities at the same time li et al 2014 established a computable general equilibrium model cge of water resources which included water production and supply industry water resource element reward and production water subsidy three scenarios were established improving the price of water resource elements adjusting production water subsidies and technological progress and li et al 2014 discussed the economic and social changes of jiangxi province under the goal of water saving the results showed that increasing the price of water resources reducing production water subsidy and technological progress can improve the efficiency of water use and reduce the total water demand however no matter viewed from the index of total output gdp employment price level or the income of residents and enterprises increasing the price of water resources and adjusting production water subsidy will have negative impacts on the economy the negative impact of reducing production water subsidy is even greater however technological progress can promote economic development while achieving the goal of water conservation wang et al 2015 simulated and analyzed the impact of agricultural water use efficiency policy and water resource tax policy on the national economy by using the relevant data of 2007 interregional input output table the simulation results showed that the improvement of agricultural water use efficiency can save the production water consumption of each region and is conducive to economic growth the policy of levying water resources tax of agricultural sector can also save the production water consumption of each region but is not conducive to economic growth from the perspective of saving production water consumption and promoting economic growth compared with the water resources tax policy the effect of efficiency policy is better besides the author found that the same policy has different degrees of influence on the regional economic variables and the direction may also be different for the demand of production water the agricultural water use efficiency policy has a greater influence on the northeast north china huang huai hai and northwest regions but less influence on the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river southeast south china and southwest regions the policy of water resources tax imposed by the agricultural sector has a greater impact on the northeast northwest south china and southwest regions but a smaller impact on the north china huang huai hai the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and southeast regions using global trade analysis project gtap and its global trade and input output database cao et al 2012 set different policy projects to simulate the possible changes of chinese agricultural subsidy policies by designing changes in the total amount of policy subsidy and policy support the research points out that increasing the subsidy of chinese agricultural amber box policy and the support of green box policy will reduce the overall welfare of china but will promote agricultural production and import and export trade gao and yin 2016 pointed out that the resource tax of china is a pure mineral resource tax and its tax setting is determined by the urgency of resource protection and the operability of collection this study evaluated the burden level of water resource fee from three aspects the proportion of water resource fee in the unit price of tap water the proportion of urban water fee in disposable income per capita and the proportion of water resource fee in the burden of domestic enterprises and sorts out the existing problems in the collection and management of water resource fee 2 4 water conservation the purpose of water price promotion can be regarded as the internalization of pollution generated by economic activities through pricing so as to achieve the effect of users and polluters paying the benefit of its promotion is to achieve water conservation through the implementation of the water price system the literature points out that the use of water conservation has an impact on agriculture huang and zhang 2020 indicated that most studies discussing the economic and management issues of water and soil conservation employed various econometric models to analyze the factors affecting farmers decision in adopting the water and soil conservation strategies mathieu et al 2019 applied a probit model to analyze the factors that determine the adoption of water conservation techniques among bam cotton producers the authors concluded that early warning group membership smartphone ownership and cotton income are decisive factors however technical assistance and access to the pesticide were negative factors kpadonou et al 2017 applied multivariate and ordered probit models to analyze farmers adoption decisions for eleven on farm water and soil conservation practices in western african drylands and the results showed that labor knowledge and capital intensive farmers were more likely to make adoption decisions some studies pointed out that water conservation can help increase the output of crops for example bowley 2015 found that wind and water which were unimpeded by forest cover would devastate crops and the soil and water conservation practices promoted by the government as well as the management of farmland would improve crop production janssen and swinnen 2019 zilberman et al 2019 huang and zhang 2020 furtherly concluded that culture is a critical factor that affects water conservation and then causes the influence on the food chain agricultural supply and other economic behavior 2 5 summary from the above literature review it can be found that scholars have long studied the value and pricing of water with the need for a sustainable future scholars find that china gradually takes the adjustment of water related financial policies as one of the means to achieve sustainable development among these financial policies water price policy and environmental subsidy policy play an important role however due to the limitations of research objects and data previous literature mostly focused on the implementation of subsidy policies as a macro policy implemented by a country the purpose of environmental subsidy is mainly to protect the specific industries of the country realize the balance between product structure and total amount guarantee a fair life of producers in the industry and achieve the goal of environmental protection and sustainable development however the present study found that current literature on water policy pays too much attention to subsidy but ignored the things that happened in the water price to achieve a sustainable future the agricultural water price policy in china experienced a huge change between 2001 and 2019 as shown in fig 1 the price policy reform reveals the chinese government s ambition in addition to economic development the government gradually hopes to ensure the rational use of water resources in particular the important government documents such as no 1 central document issued relevant instructions on the reform of agricultural water price which makes the impact of agricultural water price on the environment a question worth discussing 3 methodology the chinese government or other entities have not announced micro data on water resources such as tax charge fee or other costs related to water resources the empirical analysis encounters data constraints therefore we analyze the impact of water price norms on the economy and the environment through theoretical construction in this paper policy variables are added to the framework of cai and treisman 2005 zhang et al 2011 and yu et al 2015 to investigate the impact of local government s water price policy and changes in local officials on economy and environment to be specific it investigates an economy composed of i regions with a central planner and a local government in each region the total amount of capital owned by the whole economy is k i k i represents the amount of environmental investment in the region i each region may be different in two aspects first the endowment of resources climate and economic basis is different in each region second each local government may adopt different endogenous policies local governments carry out relevant environmental protection investment and economic policies and measures through fiscal revenue fiscal expenditure and the supervision of the central government in addition in combination with the government s public water price policy in a specific year it will have an impact on the water pollution and economic output value of the region first the budget of local government can be expressed as formula 1 1 p i 1 t i θ i t i g i s i t y i p i t i t i is the amount of environmental pollution caused by agricultural economic activities in the region y i θ i t i represent the economic output value in the region and the investment or control measures used for pollution caused by agricultural economic activities respectively in terms of the research subject of this paper θ i t i is the water price measures in different periods and the degree of strictness of the implementation of measures θ i is affected by water pollution caused by agricultural activities or whether water resources are insufficient or not t i θ i 0 economic output needs economic activities of supplied land so p i 1 and p i represent the unit cost and land transfer price of local government to prevent and control pollution caused by agricultural economic activities respectively assuming p i p i 1 the utility function of local government is shown as formula 2 2 u i g u i 1 δ u i 2 φ u c i y i δ g i φ c i u i 1 y i is used to indicate that whether the governor of local government has been promoted or changed u i 2 g i is the regional economic and environmental performance under the governance if the economic growth is strong or the environmental protection is effective for example the water price policy effectively controls water conservation or the water price regulation internalizes the water pollution which effectively suppresses the scale of water pollution it means the policies of current government are effective and the utility level of local governments has been improved finally u c i c i is the economic level of the residents on employment in this region if the macro economy is improved so will the income per capita and the overall economic and environmental level assuming that the household budget of residents on employment and the production function of region are as follows 3 c i p i 0 t i 0 t i p i 1 t i 4 y i a i k i α t i β a i represents regional endowment k i is the input capital of the regional economy α and β are the input variant parameters both of them are greater than 0 α β 1 by substituting 1 and 3 into 2 the condition for maximizing the utility of local government is as follows 5 y i t i τ i p i τ i p i φ p i 0 p i 1 δ θ i p i 1 p i δ t 1 is the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by local government s economic activities eq 5 shows that when considering economic activities and environmental protection the marginal output of the regional land sold for economic activities under the relevant environmental protection measures such as the amount of environmental investment water price policy etc is equal to the marginal cost then from formula 4 and formula 5 the optimal pollution quantity can be obtained 6 ln t i 1 1 β ln a i ln β α 1 β ln k i 1 1 β ln τ i p i eq 6 shows that when the local government is faced with the problem of substitution between economic activities and environmental protection the optimal scale of pollution depends on the initial local endowment ln a i ln β economic investment capital ln k i and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities ln τ i p i in other words the scale of regional pollution may be affected by three factors first when other conditions remain unchanged the better the initial endowment is the lower the cost of economic activity exploitation or resource utilization is which may lead to resource abuse and pollution aggravation second when more capital is invested in the economic production process the overall output value is promoted but the scale of pollution is also increased finally the marginal cost of economic activities is the factor of pollution control from the research theme of this paper water price policy or regulation promoted by local government or central government can be regarded as an alternative variable of the marginal cost of environmental pollution empirically based on the data of prefecture level cities in china the impact of water price policy on environmental pollution can be further explored 4 results empirical analysis adopts formula 7 7 ln t it a i r 1 ln p it r 2 ln k it r 3 policy r 4 ln capit a it u it in eq 6 we can find that initial local endowment economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities are the critical factors in order to compare with the theory implementation and the empirical analyze we assume variable wage capit a it as the proxy variable of ln k i in eq 6 variable ln p it and ln k it reflect the initial local endowment finally due to we cannot find the exact water price criteria we use the dummy variable as the policy affect in order to explore the impact of urban water price policy and economic development on soil and water environment the selection of explained variable ln t it is the discharge amount of water pollution of agricultural industry in prefecture level cities of china over the years variable ln p it is the transfer price of urban land supply for economic output variable ln k it is the amount of financial lending in each city over the years variable policy is whether water price policy is carried out in the current year variable ln capit a it is the urban labor income over the years reflecting the economic level of residents on employment in the region it should be noted that why transfer price of urban land supply is used as the variable of economic investment capital as the land administration law of the people s republic of china makes local government the only land transfer or in the primary market of the region the land transfer has become one of the options for local government to raise financial resources quickly as is pointed out in the document another factor is that the promotion of chinese public officials is affected by the performance of economic growth accumulating short term capital while promoting economic activities through land transfer has become one of the strategies for local governments to achieve economic results quickly zhou 2007 zhang et al 2011 yu et al 2015 in addition we also include the variable change to explore the impact of the change of urban governance team the empirical data of this paper is from china urban statistical yearbook and china land and resources almanac between 2001 and 2017 the research objects include 240 cities in china table 1 summarizes the definitions and descriptive statistics of each empirical variable based on the theoretical analysis above both economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution can explain environmental pollution therefore we test the impact of them on the environment respectively through empirical analysis in the analysis considering the income from the sale of state owned land and control the cost of environmental pollution we take the deposit balance of financial institutions at the end of the year and whether to implement the water price measures as explanatory variables to explore their impact on the agricultural wastewater discharge as a result we will know about which explanatory capacity is stronger and carry out relevant stability test table 2 summarizes the main empirical results in order to get reliable results we use ols and random effects in the analysis process from the empirical results when discussing the impact of economic aspect and environmental aspect respectively it can be found that both of them had significant impact on explanatory variables first of all the empirical estimation of ols 1indicates that variable ln p it is significant to the regression coefficient of water pollution discharge being as a positive solution it is corresponded to intuition that economic activities have a deteriorating impact on environmental pollution ols 2 discusses that variable ln k it is significant to the regression coefficient of water pollution discharge being as a positive solution it can be found that the influence direction is consistent with ln p it in order to determine the white test which is the additional test of ols 1 and ols 2 of the empirical estimation combination table 2 to test the omitted variable test to estimate whether there are missing variables in the combination and the variance inflation factor to test collinearity when verifying the original assumption of heteroscedasticity and missing variables that there is possibility to mutate or omit the heteroscedasticity the estimation results are significant and the original hypothesis is rejected according to nerlove 1963 if the variance influence factor vif is greater than 10 the influence of the estimated variable collinearity is higher the results show that the vif values of the other variables are less than 10 indicating that there is no collinearity problem in the overall empirical portfolio re 1 re 2 of table 2 extend the empirical combination of ols 1 and ols 2 and analyze the influence of each explanatory variable through the panel in accordance with the results of ols analysis it can be found that ln p it ln k it still had a significant impact on water pollution it is noteworthy that the environmental protection and water price policy in response to the environmental pollution caused by economic activities had a significant impact on the reduction of pollution scale taking re1 as an example the estimated coefficient is 0 033 which was significant it shows that the water price policy policy or regulation promoted by government has increased the marginal cost of environmental pollution faced by producers in economic activities and the increase of cost has further restrained the scale of pollution through the implementation of water price policy and the cause and effect analysis of economy and environment it is found that the government is pushing forward the mode of restraining pollution in the formulation of water price internalizing the external cost of pollution in economic activities and effectively reducing the scale of urban water pollution discharge in order to guarantee the accuracy of the analysis explanatory variables in table 3 are analyzed from the perspective of pollution lag the judgment of the empirical portfolio mainly considers the possible time sequence of policy implementation we also consider whether the government has changed compared with table 2 variable change in table 3 analyses when the secretary of the municipal party committee changed in the previous year will it affect the scale of agricultural sewage discharge the estimation results show that the variable ln p it ln k it and policy still have significant influence on the explanatory variables which is in consistent with foresaid theoretical inference second variable change is not significant through the empirical results we can infer that the behavior of local governments in land transfer is rational they want to stimulate economic activities and promote economic growth through land supply however in order to suppress the pollution problems caused by economic activities producers are regulated through the water price policy of internalizing the exogenous cost which is revealed in the variable policy that significantly reduces the scale of urban water pollution finally in table 5 we estimate and compare with the difference of regions it can be seen from table 5 that the empirical results are consistent with tables 3 and 4 the results show that except for estimation 2 the variable ln p it has a significant positive impact on the explained variable ln t it the empirical results show that economic activities have a worsening effect on environmental pollution secondly environmental protection and water pricing policies in response to environmental pollution caused by economic activities have a significant impact on the reduction of the scale of pollution policy variables have the greatest impact on the eastern region and the least impact on the western region similar results are also shown in the estimation of variable ln capit a it it is estimated that when labor wages increase the impact on the eastern region is the largest at 0 751 followed by the coastal region at 0 482 the central region at 0 480 and the western region at 0 344 finally the estimate of the variable change showed that there was no statistically significant influence on each explained variable 5 conclusion in the past 50 years the world s population and income have increased dramatically and people have a large demand for clean water and are concerned about whether the supply of water can meet these needs in the future people s demand for water will certainly continue to increase unless we try to reduce demand so that the growth curve of water supply can be slowed especially when global warming changes the distribution of rainfall and increases water evaporation the best way to balance supply and demand is to introduce reasonable water charges the scarcer the supply of natural resources the more important the mechanism for efficient allocation of demand whether it is now or in the future in this regard the available freshwater resources are no different from other scarce resources such as oil or gas among them the word usable is the key point for example the problem of global warming has not reduced the world s freshwater but it has indeed reduced the available freshwater becker and posner 2009 for instance in many parts of the world snowmelt is an important freshwater resource however when global warming continues the pattern of precipitation in many areas has changed from snowfall to rainfall compared with snowmelt rainfall is relatively difficult to collect and distribute affected the supply of water resources with the development of economy in china more and more attention has been paid to environmental protection among these policies the implementation of water price policy affected the economic and environmental changes in china this paper analyzes the impact of water price measures on the scale of water pollution discharge in 240 cities in china between 2001 and 2017 referring to china urban statistical yearbook and china land resources almanac this paper analyzes the impact of local government s land sales revenue deposits balance of financial institutions at the end of the year and the implementation of water price policy on pollution discharge from the perspective of theory and practice in theory this paper indicates that in an economy of political centralization and economic decentralization the local initial endowment economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government s economic activities affect regional environmental pollution simultaneously empirically through panel data it can be found that environmental protection and water price policy in response to environmental pollution caused by economic activities have a significant impact on the decline of the pollution scale this paper argues that local governments in china respond rationally to political incentives through land supply or related economic policies from the perspective of local government s behavior in land transfer and financial lending the implementation of such kind of economic policy is the response to the current political incentive mechanism if the current incentive mechanism is changed it will have coupling effects on chinese environment such as cultivated area environmental conservation water and soil resources maintenance and other factors the central government should pay attention to the control of land transfer and the optimization of land use from the design of official incentives in pursuit of their political achievements during their term of office local government officials sold agricultural and industrial land at a low price and commercial and residential land at a high price which results in the loss of land use efficiency and fails to maximize the welfare of subjects of local economic activities the chinese government may speed up the improvement of the cadre appraisal program to optimize the structure of land use changing the view of political achievements which considers gdp only adding the assessment dimensions of economic development efficiency and social benefits of economic development could also help in recent years the chinese government has been making water prices towards the goal of water conservation which can be regarded as the improvement of the government s governance in the social benefits of economic development through the internalization of negative environmental externality in economic activities the pollution discharge problem can be effectively adjusted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
