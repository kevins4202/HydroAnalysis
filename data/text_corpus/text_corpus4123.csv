significance to reveal the mechanism of breakout force of mat foundation to ensure the safety and stability of offshore platform in this study field tests with different consolidation times were conducted to investigate the breakout force of mat foundation on soft marine clay seabed field results show that the suction generated by negative pore pressure in the seabed soil accounted for most of the breakout force generally up to 90 then the effects of consolidation time preloading and uplift rate on the effective stress and breakout force were numerically studied numerical results show that the breakout force has a linear relationship with the consolidation degree of seabed soil under the same degree of consolidation the breakout force per unit area increases with the increase of preloading the uplift process changes from drained to undrained as the uplift rate increases keywords breakout force mat foundation field test numerical analysis effective stress 1 introduction jack up platforms are extensive used as exploratory drilling platforms and offshore and wind farm service platforms when the platform needs to move from one location to another the process of foundation lifting is necessary generally the penetration depth of a traditional spudcan is very deep on soft clay seabed even up to 30 m deep so the process of extract the embedded spudcan is time consuming na 2005 mat foundations are more suitable on soft clay seabed due to its good terrain adaptability shallow penetration depth and short foundation lifting time yuan et al 2019 during the operation of the platform only the lower part of the mat foundation is sunk into the seabed so the uplifting process does not need to overcome the weight of the overlying soil fang et al 2019 however the breakout force acting on the mat foundation during the uplift process is a critical issue which is related to the stability and safety of the platform li et al 2015 the breakout phenomenon of uplift an object from the seabed surface was explained by sawicki et al 2003 generally the uplift force of an object is equal to the submerged weight when the object is in water however the force needed to extract an object from the seabed surface is much larger than the submerged weight of the object itself in order to raise the object from the seabed surface the uplift force should be applied which has to overcome both the submerged weight and some additional force r s which is the resultant of some stresses generated at the contact between the object and seabed surface therefore the breakout force should be larger than r s researches on the breakout process of an object lying on seabed surface is relatively scarce vesic et al 1971 pointed out that the breakout force could defined as the difference in pore pressure between the two sides of the embedded structure for mat foundation the breakout force also includes the friction force between soil and the side wall of the mat foundation and the adhesion force between soil and mat foundation bottom surface foda 1982 proposed an analytical model to describe the negative pressures developing underneath a body as it detaches from the seabed mei et al 1985 proposed an alternative theory to study the breakout process of object lying on a porous but rigid seabed zhou et al 2008 numerically investigated the breakout process of a disk lying on the porous elastic saturated seabed surface chang et al 2015 analytically reinvestigates the lift up problem for a rigid porous bed that was studied by mei et al with a more general model existing research on breakout force has focused on marine structures such as plate anchors mudmats and suction foundations acosta martinez et al 2012 gourvenec et al 2009 lehane et al 2008 in laboratory model tests indirect method was usually used to measure the breakout force of plate anchor the hollow bolt was vented to eliminate the breakout force and the results were compared with those without ventilation bemben et al 1975 the filter paper was placed at the bottom of the anchor to make the results breakout force more accurate singh and ramaswamy 2008 chen et al 2012 conducted a series of centrifuge tests to investigate the uplift resistance of plain mudmats resting on lightly over consolidated clay the suction developing of the mudmat was instrumented with pore pressure transducers the centrifuge tests results shown that the uplift resistance increases as pull out velocity increases li et al 2014 investigated the uplift resistance of rectangular mudmats resting on lightly over consolidated kaolin clay through centrifuge model tests the effects of perforation on the uplift resistance and suction generation at the foundation were discussed and the results shown that perforations could only alter the magnitude of suction force the breakout mechanism of the foundation was discussed through the pore pressure variations under the foundation li and cassidy 2018 besides du et al 2017 conducted a series of uplift tests on a suction foundation by using a beam centrifuge in which the uplift displacement suction force and loading rate were monitored centrifuge tests results shown that the pull out resistance increases as the uplift loading rate increases the shape effects on the undrained uplift capacity of skirted suction foundations in clay were investigated through centrifuge model tests fan et al 2013 to date studies on the breakout force of large mat foundations are limited besides there are few researches on the effect of sitting time which also represents the consolidation time on the breakout force of mat foundation lying on soft marine clay seabed therefore it is essential to understand the mechanism of breakout force of mat foundation on soft marine clay seabed in this research a serious of field tests were carried out to investigate the mechanism of the breakout force of mat foundation the pore pressure at the top and bottom of mat foundation were measured by pore pressure transducers ppt the breakout force was measured by a dynamometer the effects of mat foundation sitting time on the uplift force and pore pressure were investigated then numerical analysis was carried out to investigate the effects of consolidation time external load and uplift rate on the breakout force 2 field test in order to measure the breakout force and investigate the relationship between the negative pore pressure at the bottom of mat foundation and the breakout force a serious of field tests were conducted at east china sea as shown by the red dot in fig 1 the average water depth near the wharf is about 5 m the physical properties of different soil layers near the field test is shown in table 1 2 1 field test set up the mat foundation model was designed as a hollow cuboid steel box with the scale of 2 m length 2 m width 1 m depth the weight of mat foundation is 10 tons pore pressure transducers ppts were used to measure the pore pressure at the top and bottom of mat foundation in which one ppt at the top and six at the bottom as shown in fig 2 therefore the average pore pressure at the bottom of mat foundation could calculated by the six ppts the mat foundation model is connected to the lifting device with a dynamometer 2 2 test procedure the field test procedure was adopted as follows 1 number the transducers and calibrate the initial values 2 connect all the testing and recording apparatuses including the crane dynamometer mat foundation model transducer data collectors and computer etc record the initial dynamometer value which equals to the self weight of the mat foundation model 3 pull up the model slowly the dynamometer value is about 10 tons which equals to the self weight of mat foundation model 4 place the mat foundation model on the seabed surface slowly until the dynamometer reading equals to zero 5 pull up the mat foundation model and record the dynamometer reading every 25 s in this research a total of five field tests with different sitting times were conducted as shown in table 2 fig 3 shows some apparatuses used in the field test the pore pressure transducer ppt is a vibrating wire transducer with a range of 170 kpa the range of the dynamometer is 15 tons 2 3 field test results the pore pressure at the bottom of the mat foundation can be calculated as 1 u u bottom u top ρ h in which u bottom is the average ppts readings at the bottom of mat foundation u top is the ppt reading at the top of mat foundation ρ is the fluid density h is the mat foundation height according to the field test results the depth of the mat foundation sunk into the seabed is shallow due to the large bottom area of the foundation this can be determined by the reading of the ppt at the upper surface of the mat foundation fig 4 illustrate the top and average bottom pore pressure results during 2 5 days due to the influence of tides both the top and bottom pore pressure fluctuates but the top pore pressure basically fluctuates around 40 kpa indicating that the top surface of the mat foundation is basically at a water depth of about 4 m therefore there was no need to overcome the weight of the top cover soil based on the weight and buoyancy of the mat foundation model the dynamometer reading is equal to 60 kn after the foundation model is immersed in water so the partial load exceeding 60 kn is the breakout force generated during the lifting of the mat foundation the breakout force can be expressed as 2 f f t g 3 g g f b where f is the breakout force f t is the uplift force g is the submerged weight of mat foundation model g is the self weight of mat foundation model and f b is the buoyancy fig 5 shows the total uplift force f t and the pore pressure u at the bottom of the mat foundation after different sitting time the uplift process of the mat foundation can be divided into three stages in the first stage the reading of the dynamometer increases gradually but the mat foundation remained in contact with the seabed surface the second stage is the moment when the mat foundation leaves the seabed surface the reading of the dynamometer reaches the maximum value meanwhile the absolute value of negative pore pressure reaches the maximum value then the mat foundation is suspended in the water which is considered as the third stage the reading of the dynamometer is basically equal to g it can be seen that the increase in absolute value of negative pore pressure is synchronized with the increase in uplift force it should be noted that there exists a re lifting stage in case b due to some operation reasons of the field test in the field tests the large crane was operated by professional technicians the lifting rate and continuity were not well controlled in case b resulting in the failure of the mat foundation lifting as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the fluctuation of uplift force f t is large in stage a therefore the first lifting stage was terminated and a re lifting of the mat foundation was carried out stage b so that the uplift force ft decreases to zero in stage a and then increases gradually to the maximum value in stage b meanwhile the negative pore pressure decreases slightly at the end of stage a and the increases to the maximum value at stage b according to eqs 1 and 2 the breakout force and the suction force are listed in table 3 in which the suction force is equal to the absolute value of the average negative pore pressure multiplied by the mat foundation bottom area the proportion in table 3 is the proportion of the suction force on the breakout force it is clear that the proportion is larger than 90 in most cases except in case d which is equal to 78 12 this is due to the fact that the lifting speed of the mat foundation is relatively fast in case d and the low collection frequency of ppt which resulted in not recording the maximum negative pore pressure it can be seen that the uplift force f t takes only 0 1 min to increase from zero to the maximum value in other four cases the uplift force f t takes 1 2 min from zero to the maximum value meanwhile the maximum uplift force appeared at t 0 8 min in case d however the maximum negative pore pressure appeared at t 0 83 min fig 6 shows uplift force and negative pore pressure versus consolidation time respectively it can be seen that both the breakout force and the absolute value of negative pore pressure increase as consolidation time increases and the increasing rate gradually slows down the breakout force is related to the excess pore pressure at the bottom of the mat foundation settlement of the mat foundation on the seabed will cause excess pore pressure in the soil 3 numerical model and mesh due to the large crane was operated by professional technicians in the field tests the lifting rate and continuity were difficult to control as shown in case b meanwhile due to the long test time only five sets of field tests were conducted therefore in order to fully understand the effects of consolidation time external load and uplift rate on the breakout force a further numerical analysis was carried out 3 1 seabed soil property in this research the modified cam clay mcc model was adopted to analyze the behavior of the seabed based on the assumptions that the soil is homogeneous and normally consolidated the parameters of mcc model are listed in table 4 which are based on existing shanghai clay parameters fang et al 2019 ye and ye 2016 the yield surface is considered isotropic so the consistent parameter m is used in compression and extension whilst p is the mean effective stress q is the deviatoric stress 3 2 model and mesh in order to reveal the generation mechanism of negative pore pressure an axisymmetric element model is first established based on the element model triaxial compression and tension tests are simulated the boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the element model are completely smooth the soil specimen is a cylinder with a diameter of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm the soil specimen is first consolidated by a confining pressure σ 3 200 kpa after the pore pressure generated by the application of confining pressure is dissipated reduce the axial pressure gradually and keep the confining pressure constant under undrained condition as shown in fig 7 σ d represents the negative deviator stress then a three dimensional numerical model is established to simulate the breakout force of the mat foundation as shown in fig 8 the mat foundation is considered a rigid structure in order to avoid boundary effects the seabed soil model is set as a cube with a side length of 10b in which b is the width of the mat foundation the grids are refined under the mat foundation to improve the accuracy of the analysis previous research results show that the soil under the foundation is still in compression when the soil reaches the maximum negative pore pressure during the uplift process li et al 2015 therefore the interface between the bottom of mat foundation and seabed surface is assumed to be rough in tangential direction and cannot be separated in the normal direction in this research the top boundary of the mat foundation model is free drainage surface while the rest are impermeable force controlled analysis was used in the simulation 3 3 verification of numerical model numerical verification of field tests is carried out to verify the accuracy of the numerical model based on the principle of force balance the upward force on the mat foundation is the uplift force while the downward force is the submerged weight and the breakout force as shown in fig 9 since field test results shown that the negative pore pressure accounted for the majority of the breakout force the negative pore pressure was considered to characterize the breakout force in the numerical analysis therefore the mat foundation is considered to be detached from the seabed once the upward force acting on the mat foundation exceeds the downward force the analysis procedure in this study consists four steps 1 geostatic the purpose of the geostatic step is to obtain the initial in situ stress conditions 2 load vertical load is applied on the mat foundation to simulate the submerged weight 3 consolidation set the same consolidation time as the field test situation as shown in table 2 4 uplift simulate the uplifting process by applying a vertical load on the mat foundation fig 10 shows the typical pore pressure time history curve at the bottom of the mat foundation during the whole process after the initial in situ stress condition of seabed soil is obtained the excess pore pressure under the mat foundation increases rapidly during the load step then excess pore pressure gradually dissipates with the increase of consolidation time during the uplift step the excess pore pressure becomes negative pore pressure and then dissipates quickly fig 11 shows the comparison between the numerical and field test results of breakout force under various consolidation times it is clear that the agreement between the two values is acceptable fig 12 shows the comparison of time history results of pore pressure below the mat foundation between the field tests and simulated results when the consolidation time is 2 5 days it can be seen that the development trend of the negative pore pressure between the field tests and simulated results are basically the same the absolute value of simulated negative pore pressure increases faster however the maximum absolute value of simulated negative pore pressure is slightly smaller than the field test value fig 13 illustrates the comparison of negative pore pressure between the numerical and field test results under various consolidation times it can be seen that compared to the breakout force results the numerical and field test results of pore pressure are closer therefore the present numerical method is capable to study the mechanism of breakout force of mat foundation 4 results and discussion 4 1 mechanism of negative pore pressure during the entire operation of the mat foundation the seabed soil undergoes the processes of loading consolidation and unloading the mechanism of negative pore pressure during the unloading process can be explained by triaxial test therefore numerical triaxial tests under isotropic consolidation and k 0 consolidation are carried out by using the element model the shearing process of the test is undrained the element model is subjected to pressures in both axial and radial directions fig 14 presents the total and effective stress paths for triaxial compression and tension under isotropic consolidation in which p σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 is the mean total stress δ u p p is the excess pore pressure and csl represents the critical state line it can be seen that the total stress path line ab starts from the initial yield surface and develops upward with a slope of 3 in the compression process the effective stress path line ac starts at the initial yield surface and ends at the final yield surface due to the hardening of the soil during the shearing process the pore pressure is always positive δ u 0 in the triaxial tension process the slope of the total stress path line a b is the same as the slope of the compression process line ab but develops in the opposite direction the effective stress paths line a c of tension and compression line ac are symmetric with respect to q 0 therefore it can be seen that the pore pressure is first negative δ u 0 and then positive δ u 0 during the tension process the relationship between pore pressure and axial strain is shown in fig 15 in practical engineering the stress state of soil is not under isotropic consolidation so the triaxial tension test under k 0 state is carried out and the result of stress path is shown in fig 16 it is clear that the total stress path is still develops downwards with a slope of 3 however the starting point is not on the q 0 line the effective stress path first develops in the initial yield surface during which the negative pore pressure continues to increase after the effective stress path reaches the initial yield surface the negative pore pressure then begins to decrease during the whole tension process the pore pressure is always negative the relationship between pore pressure and axial strain is shown in fig 17 4 2 influence of factors on breakout force and stress path 4 2 1 effect of consolidation time the field tests results shown that the sitting time of the mat foundation have significant effects on the breakout force therefore further numerical simulations are conducted to discuss the increase law of the breakout force with mat foundation sitting time herein the sitting time of the mat foundation is the consolidation time analysis of mat foundation with different areas is also added in the research fig 18 illustrates the relationship between breakout force per unit area of mat foundation and the consolidation time the consolidation time has a great influence on the breakout force in the early stage but as the consolidation time increases the breakout force gradually stabilizes the trend of the numerical result is consistent with the field test result fig 19 shows the effective stress path and total stress path of the soil under the foundation with various consolidation times 1 2 5 and 5 days the effective stress path includes the whole process of loading consolidation and uplift while the total stress path only illustrates the uplift process take the effective stress path with consolidation time of 1 day as an example point a is the initial state line ab represents the loading step line bc represents the consolidation step and line cd represents the uplift step c d is the total stress path during the uplift process it is obvious that the residual excess pore pressure u t decrease as the consolidation time increases the negative pore pressure generated during the uplift process first needs to offset the residual excess pore pressure so the negative pore pressure increases as the consolidation time increases the relationship between normalized breakout force and degree of consolidation is summarized in fig 20 in which the normalized breakout force is the breakout force divided by the maximum breakout force the results show that the relationship is basically linear herein the consolidation degree can be expressed as 4 u u 0 u t u 0 where u 0 is the excess pore pressure before consolidation u t is the residual excess pore pressure at time t fig 21 illustrates the distributions of pore pressure along normalized depth for different consolidation degrees u 95 and 63 in which the normalized depth is h s b h s is the seabed depth b is the width of mat foundation position 1 2 and 3 p1 p2 p3 respectively represent the soil below the center 1 4b from the center and the edge of the mat foundation it can be seen that for the case of high consolidation degree u 95 the pore pressure along the depth direction is negative and the absolute value of negative pore pressure decreases along the depth in the horizontal direction the absolute value of negative pore pressures at p1 and p2 are larger than that at p3 for the case of low consolidation degree u 63 the pore pressure is negative when the normalized depth h s b is less than 0 6 and the deeper soil pore pressure is positive in the horizontal direction the maximum absolute value of negative pore pressure appears at p3 and minimum value appears at p1 which is due to the low degree of consolidation and the incomplete dissipation of excess pore pressure below the center of the mat foundation the negative pore pressure first needs to offset this part of the excess pore pressure so the absolute value of negative pore pressure is the smallest at p1 4 2 2 effect of preloading most scholars have studied the influence of preload on the bearing capacity of foundation by centrifuge test or numerical simulation the results shown that preload effectively improves the bearing capacity of foundation fu et al 2015 considering the over consolidation of soil the preloading improved the normal consolidated clay more significantly than the over consolidation clay potts and jackson 2003 in order to investigate the effect of preloading on the breakout force different external loads were applied in the loading step in the numerical analysis the dissipation degree of the excess pore pressure after consolidation is basically the same and the uplift procedure is completely consistent fig 22 illustrates the relationship between the breakout force per unit area of the mat foundation and the preloading the breakout force was analyzed under the preloading of 5 15 30 and 45 kpa numerical results show that the breakout force increases with the increase of preloading fig 23 compares the effective stress path and total stress path of the soil below the foundation under the preloading of 15 kpa 30 kpa and 45 kpa respectively both the three effective stress paths start from the same point a the effective stress path in the loading phase is closer to the csl line as the preloading increases after consolidation the excess pore pressure in the three cases dissipate completely and reach the same degree of consolidation the final negative pore pressure is more significant under the condition of high preloading 4 2 3 effect of uplift rate the breakout force of mat foundation is also closely related to the uplift rate therefore seven sets of numerical analyses are carried out with normalized uplift rates ranging from 5 to 1700 the normalized uplift rate can be expressed as 5 v v b c v where b is the width of the foundation c v is the coefficient of consolidation which can be expressed as 6 c v k m v γ w k 1 e 0 γ w λ p 0 where k is the permeability coefficient γ w is the fluid weight p 0 is the initial mean effective stress e 0 is the initial void rate fig 24 shows the relationship between breakout force and normalization uplift rate the breakout force is positively correlated with the normalization rate when the normalization rate increased to a certain value the breakout force tends to be stable meanwhile the uplift process changes from partially drained to undrained fig 25 compares the effective stress path and the total stress path of the soil under mat foundation with the normalized uplift rates of 50 180 and 350 respectively the initial stress states the effective stress paths for the loading and consolidation processes are exactly the same in the three cases the results show that the effective stress path and the total stress path of the uplift process converge with each other as the normalized uplift rate decreases therefore it is foreseeable that if the uplift process is totally drained the total stress path and the effective stress path will coincide whilst the foundation detachment will not be affected by the breakout force 4 2 4 effect of drainage point the negative pore pressure under three types of drainage point arrangement scheme are investigated in which the number of drainage points is 2 4 and 8 as shown in fig 26 each drainage point has an area of 0 0625 m2 fig 27 illustrates the effects of number of drainage points on the break force it is clear that the drainage point could reduce the breakout force effectively the breakout force per unit area decreases as the number of drainage points increases fig 28 shows the comparison of seepage fields with and without drainage points in which the downward seepage is negative and upward seepage is positive it can be seen that in the absence of drainage points the downward seepage into the seabed only occurs outside the mat foundation and the seepage velocity is the highest near the edge of the foundation the suction of soil below the mat foundation is larger resulting in the upward seepage after the drainage point is arranged the drainage distance is effectively shortened the maximum downward seepage occurs at the drainage point and the suction in the foundation area is reduced therefore suction plays an active role in maintaining the stability of the mat foundation during the working stage however proper setting of drainage points during the uplift stage helps to avoid the safety problems of mat foundation lifting 5 conclusions in this research field tests were carried out to investigate mechanism of the breakout force of mat foundation with different sitting time a model box installed with pore pressure transducers was designed to simulate the mat foundation the effects of consolidation time preloading and uplift rate on the breakout force were discussed numerically based on the field tests and numerical results the following conclusions are drawn 1 the suction force caused by the negative pore pressure accounts for a large proportion of the breakout force beneath the mat foundation which can reach more than 90 therefore the breakout force can be characterized by the negative pore pressure under the mat foundation 2 in the numerical analysis of breakout force it is feasible to determine the disengagement of mat foundation by force balance principle the simulated results are in good agreement with the measured ones 3 under the condition that the loading and uplift processes are consistent the breakout force per unit area has a linear relationship with the consolidation degree of the surface soil beneath the foundation the breakout force per unit area is positively correlated with preloading under the condition that the consolidation degree and the process of uplift are consistent 4 under the condition that the consolidation degree and preloading are consistent the breakout force per unit area increases with the increase of the normalized uplift rate and finally tends to be stable when the normalization rate reaches about 350 the uplift process can be considered to be completely undrained credit authorship contribution statement qi zhang writing original draft visualization

the dynamometer is basically equal to g it can be seen that the increase in absolute value of negative pore pressure is synchronized with the increase in uplift force it should be noted that there exists a re lifting stage in case b due to some operation reasons of the field test in the field tests the large crane was operated by professional technicians the lifting rate and continuity were not well controlled in case b resulting in the failure of the mat foundation lifting as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the fluctuation of uplift force f t is large in stage a therefore the first lifting stage was terminated and a re lifting of the mat foundation was carried out stage b so that the uplift force ft decreases to zero in stage a and then increases gradually to the maximum value in stage b meanwhile the negative pore pressure decreases slightly at the end of stage a and the increases to the maximum value at stage b according to eqs 1 and 2 the breakout force and the suction force are listed in table 3 in which the suction force is equal to the absolute value of the average negative pore pressure multiplied by the mat foundation bottom area the proportion in table 3 is the proportion of the suction force on the breakout force it is clear that the proportion is larger than 90 in most cases except in case d which is equal to 78 12 this is due to the fact that the lifting speed of the mat foundation is relatively fast in case d and the low collection frequency of ppt which resulted in not recording the maximum negative pore pressure it can be seen that the uplift force f t takes only 0 1 min to increase from zero to the maximum value in other four cases the uplift force f t takes 1 2 min from zero to the maximum value meanwhile the maximum uplift force appeared at t 0 8 min in case d however the maximum negative pore pressure appeared at t 0 83 min fig 6 shows uplift force and negative pore pressure versus consolidation time respectively it can be seen that both the breakout force and the absolute value of negative pore pressure increase as consolidation time increases and the increasing rate gradually slows down the breakout force is related to the excess pore pressure at the bottom of the mat foundation settlement of the mat foundation on the seabed will cause excess pore pressure in the soil 3 numerical model and mesh due to the large crane was operated by professional technicians in the field tests the lifting rate and continuity were difficult to control as shown in case b meanwhile due to the long test time only five sets of field tests were conducted therefore in order to fully understand the effects of consolidation time external load and uplift rate on the breakout force a further numerical analysis was carried out 3 1 seabed soil property in this research the modified cam clay mcc model was adopted to analyze the behavior of the seabed based on the assumptions that the soil is homogeneous and normally consolidated the parameters of mcc model are listed in table 4 which are based on existing shanghai clay parameters fang et al 2019 ye and ye 2016 the yield surface is considered isotropic so the consistent parameter m is used in compression and extension whilst p is the mean effective stress q is the deviatoric stress 3 2 model and mesh in order to reveal the generation mechanism of negative pore pressure an axisymmetric element model is first established based on the element model triaxial compression and tension tests are simulated the boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the element model are completely smooth the soil specimen is a cylinder with a diameter of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm the soil specimen is first consolidated by a confining pressure σ 3 200 kpa after the pore pressure generated by the application of confining pressure is dissipated reduce the axial pressure gradually and keep the confining pressure constant under undrained condition as shown in fig 7 σ d represents the negative deviator stress then a three dimensional numerical model is established to simulate the breakout force of the mat foundation as shown in fig 8 the mat foundation is considered a rigid structure in order to avoid boundary effects the seabed soil model is set as a cube with a side length of 10b in which b is the width of the mat foundation the grids are refined under the mat foundation to improve the accuracy of the analysis previous research results show that the soil under the foundation is still in compression when the soil reaches the maximum negative pore pressure during the uplift process li et al 2015 therefore the interface between the bottom of mat foundation and seabed surface is assumed to be rough in tangential direction and cannot be separated in the normal direction in this research the top boundary of the mat foundation model is free drainage surface while the rest are impermeable force controlled analysis was used in the simulation 3 3 verification of numerical model numerical verification of field tests is carried out to verify the accuracy of the numerical model based on the principle of force balance the upward force on the mat foundation is the uplift force while the downward force is the submerged weight and the breakout force as shown in fig 9 since field test results shown that the negative pore pressure accounted for the majority of the breakout force the negative pore pressure was considered to characterize the breakout force in the numerical analysis therefore the mat foundation is considered to be detached from the seabed once the upward force acting on the mat foundation exceeds the downward force the analysis procedure in this study consists four steps 1 geostatic the purpose of the geostatic step is to obtain the initial in situ stress conditions 2 load vertical load is applied on the mat foundation to simulate the submerged weight 3 consolidation set the same consolidation time as the field test situation as shown in table 2 4 uplift simulate the uplifting process by applying a vertical load on the mat foundation fig 10 shows the typical pore pressure time history curve at the bottom of the mat foundation during the whole process after the initial in situ stress condition of seabed soil is obtained the excess pore pressure under the mat foundation increases rapidly during the load step then excess pore pressure gradually dissipates with the increase of consolidation time during the uplift step the excess pore pressure becomes negative pore pressure and then dissipates quickly fig 11 shows the comparison between the numerical and field test results of breakout force under various consolidation times it is clear that the agreement between the two values is acceptable fig 12 shows the comparison of time history results of pore pressure below the mat foundation between the field tests and simulated results when the consolidation time is 2 5 days it can be seen that the development trend of the negative pore pressure between the field tests and simulated results are basically the same the absolute value of simulated negative pore pressure increases faster however the maximum absolute value of simulated negative pore pressure is slightly smaller than the field test value fig 13 illustrates the comparison of negative pore pressure between the numerical and field test results under various consolidation times it can be seen that compared to the breakout force results the numerical and field test results of pore pressure are closer therefore the present numerical method is capable to study the mechanism of breakout force of mat foundation 4 results and discussion 4 1 mechanism of negative pore pressure during the entire operation of the mat foundation the seabed soil undergoes the processes of loading consolidation and unloading the mechanism of negative pore pressure during the unloading process can be explained by triaxial test therefore numerical triaxial tests under isotropic consolidation and k 0 consolidation are carried out by using the element model the shearing process of the test is undrained the element model is subjected to pressures in both axial and radial directions fig 14 presents the total and effective stress paths for triaxial compression and tension under isotropic consolidation in which p σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 is the mean total stress δ u p p is the excess pore pressure and csl represents the critical state line it can be seen that the total stress path line ab starts from the initial yield surface and develops upward with a slope of 3 in the compression process the effective stress path line ac starts at the initial yield surface and ends at the final yield surface due to the hardening of the soil during the shearing process the pore pressure is always positive δ u 0 in the triaxial tension process the slope of the total stress path line a b is the same as the slope of the compression process line ab but develops in the opposite direction the effective stress paths line a c of tension and compression line ac are symmetric with respect to q 0 therefore it can be seen that the pore pressure is first negative δ u 0 and then positive δ u 0 during the tension process the relationship between pore pressure and axial strain is shown in fig 15 in practical engineering the stress state of soil is not under isotropic consolidation so the triaxial tension test under k 0 state is carried out and the result of stress path is shown in fig 16 it is clear that the total stress path is still develops downwards with a slope of 3 however the starting point is not on the q 0 line the effective stress path first develops in the initial yield surface during which the negative pore pressure continues to increase after the effective stress path reaches the initial yield surface the negative pore pressure then begins to decrease during the whole tension process the pore pressure is always negative the relationship between pore pressure and axial strain is shown in fig 17 4 2 influence of factors on breakout force and stress path 4 2 1 effect of consolidation time the field tests results shown that the sitting time of the mat foundation have significant effects on the breakout force therefore further numerical simulations are conducted to discuss the increase law of the breakout force with mat foundation sitting time herein the sitting time of the mat foundation is the consolidation time analysis of mat foundation with different areas is also added in the research fig 18 illustrates the relationship between breakout force per unit area of mat foundation and the consolidation time the consolidation time has a great influence on the breakout force in the early stage but as the consolidation time increases the breakout force gradually stabilizes the trend of the numerical result is consistent with the field test result fig 19 shows the effective stress path and total stress path of the soil under the foundation with various consolidation times 1 2 5 and 5 days the effective stress path includes the whole process of loading consolidation and uplift while the total stress path only illustrates the uplift process take the effective stress path with consolidation time of 1 day as an example point a is the initial state line ab represents the loading step line bc represents the consolidation step and line cd represents the uplift step c d is the total stress path during the uplift process it is obvious that the residual excess pore pressure u t decrease as the consolidation time increases the negative pore pressure generated during the uplift process first needs to offset the residual excess pore pressure so the negative pore pressure increases as the consolidation time increases the relationship between normalized breakout force and degree of consolidation is summarized in fig 20 in which the normalized breakout force is the breakout force divided by the maximum breakout force the results show that the relationship is basically linear herein the consolidation degree can be expressed as 4 u u 0 u t u 0 where u 0 is the excess pore pressure before consolidation u t is the residual excess pore pressure at time t fig 21 illustrates the distributions of pore pressure along normalized depth for different consolidation degrees u 95 and 63 in which the normalized depth is h s b h s is the seabed depth b is the width of mat foundation position 1 2 and 3 p1 p2 p3 respectively represent the soil below the center 1 4b from the center and the edge of the mat foundation it can be seen that for the case of high consolidation degree u 95 the pore pressure along the depth direction is negative and the absolute value of negative pore pressure decreases along the depth in the horizontal direction the absolute value of negative pore pressures at p1 and p2 are larger than that at p3 for the case of low consolidation degree u 63 the pore pressure is negative when the normalized depth h s b is less than 0 6 and the deeper soil pore pressure is positive in the horizontal direction the maximum absolute value of negative pore pressure appears at p3 and minimum value appears at p1 which is due to the low degree of consolidation and the incomplete dissipation of excess pore pressure below the center of the mat foundation the negative pore pressure first needs to offset this part of the excess pore pressure so the absolute value of negative pore pressure is the smallest at p1 4 2 2 effect of preloading most scholars have studied the influence of preload on the bearing capacity of foundation by centrifuge test or numerical simulation the results shown that preload effectively improves the bearing capacity of foundation fu et al 2015 considering the over consolidation of soil the preloading improved the normal consolidated clay more significantly than the over consolidation clay potts and jackson 2003 in order to investigate the effect of preloading on the breakout force different external loads were applied in the loading step in the numerical analysis the dissipation degree of the excess pore pressure after consolidation is basically the same and the uplift procedure is completely consistent fig 22 illustrates the relationship between the breakout force per unit area of the mat foundation and the preloading the breakout force was analyzed under the preloading of 5 15 30 and 45 kpa numerical results show that the breakout force increases with the increase of preloading fig 23 compares the effective stress path and total stress path of the soil below the foundation under the preloading of 15 kpa 30 kpa and 45 kpa respectively both the three effective stress paths start from the same point a the effective stress path in the loading phase is closer to the csl line as the preloading increases after consolidation the excess pore pressure in the three cases dissipate completely and reach the same degree of consolidation the final negative pore pressure is more significant under the condition of high preloading 4 2 3 effect of uplift rate the breakout force of mat foundation is also closely related to the uplift rate therefore seven sets of numerical analyses are carried out with normalized uplift rates ranging from 5 to 1700 the normalized uplift rate can be expressed as 5 v v b c v where b is the width of the foundation c v is the coefficient of consolidation which can be expressed as 6 c v k m v γ w k 1 e 0 γ w λ p 0 where k is the permeability coefficient γ w is the fluid weight p 0 is the initial mean effective stress e 0 is the initial void rate fig 24 shows the relationship between breakout force and normalization uplift rate the breakout force is positively correlated with the normalization rate when the normalization rate increased to a certain value the breakout force tends to be stable meanwhile the uplift process changes from partially drained to undrained fig 25 compares the effective stress path and the total stress path of the soil under mat foundation with the normalized uplift rates of 50 180 and 350 respectively the initial stress states the effective stress paths for the loading and consolidation processes are exactly the same in the three cases the results show that the effective stress path and the total stress path of the uplift process converge with each other as the normalized uplift rate decreases therefore it is foreseeable that if the uplift process is totally drained the total stress path and the effective stress path will coincide whilst the foundation detachment will not be affected by the breakout force 4 2 4 effect of drainage point the negative pore pressure under three types of drainage point arrangement scheme are investigated in which the number of drainage points is 2 4 and 8 as shown in fig 26 each drainage point has an area of 0 0625 m2 fig 27 illustrates the effects of number of drainage points on the break force it is clear that the drainage point could reduce the breakout force effectively the breakout force per unit area decreases as the number of drainage points increases fig 28 shows the comparison of seepage fields with and without drainage points in which the downward seepage is negative and upward seepage is positive it can be seen that in the absence of drainage points the downward seepage into the seabed only occurs outside the mat foundation and the seepage velocity is the highest near the edge of the foundation the suction of soil below the mat foundation is larger resulting in the upward seepage after the drainage point is arranged the drainage distance is effectively shortened the maximum downward seepage occurs at the drainage point and the suction in the foundation area is reduced therefore suction plays an active role in maintaining the stability of the mat foundation during the working stage however proper setting of drainage points during the uplift stage helps to avoid the safety problems of mat foundation lifting 5 conclusions in this research field tests were carried out to investigate mechanism of the breakout force of mat foundation with different sitting time a model box installed with pore pressure transducers was designed to simulate the mat foundation the effects of consolidation time preloading and uplift rate on the breakout force were discussed numerically based on the field tests and numerical results the following conclusions are drawn 1 the suction force caused by the negative pore pressure accounts for a large proportion of the breakout force beneath the mat foundation which can reach more than 90 therefore the breakout force can be characterized by the negative pore pressure under the mat foundation 2 in the numerical analysis of breakout force it is feasible to determine the disengagement of mat foundation by force balance principle the simulated results are in good agreement with the measured ones 3 under the condition that the loading and uplift processes are consistent the breakout force per unit area has a linear relationship with the consolidation degree of the surface soil beneath the foundation the breakout force per unit area is positively correlated with preloading under the condition that the consolidation degree and the process of uplift are consistent 4 under the condition that the consolidation degree and preloading are consistent the breakout force per unit area increases with the increase of the normalized uplift rate and finally tends to be stable when the normalization rate reaches about 350 the uplift process can be considered to be completely undrained credit authorship contribution statement qi zhang writing original draft visualization

in the closed loop trajectory tracking control system are bounded simulation results and comparison illustrate the effectiveness of the developed schemes keywords unmanned marine surface vessel trajectory tracking control nonparametric uncertainty single parameter learning input saturation 1 introduction with the rise of ocean development unmanned marine surface vessels umsvs have played an irreplaceable role and have been widely applied in various marine tasks such as marine transportation oil harvesting coastal surveillance etc ma et al 2020 wen et al 2011 liu et al 2016 ma et al 2018 for the control problem of umsvs in engineering practice controlling an umsv to track a pre set trajectory or follow a predefined path which involves the control problem of trajectory tracking or path following has received a great deal of attention from control and marine engineering communities zhao et al 2020 yu et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020 compared with the control problem of path following the control problem of trajectory tracking is more challenging since the designed tracking control laws need to steer the vessels reach and track a time varying trajectory in time besides owing to the internal and external uncertainties and inherent nonlinearity of the dynamic system of umsvs the design of control law for the trajectory tracking problem becomes even more difficult qiao and zhang 2017 deng et al 2019a in addition another important issue for the tracking control problem of umsvs is the input saturation nonlinearity due to the physical constraints of vessel propulsion systems alme 2008 in the last few decades for the tracking control problem of umsvs subject to unknown external disturbances several effective methods have been proposed to handle the effect of external disturbances such as the disturbance observer do 2010 abdelaal et al 2018 extended state observer sun et al 2017 fu et al 2018 passivity based controller with integral action donaire et al 2017 h theory alfi et al 2015 etc in qu et al 2018 yin and xiao 2017 van 2019 the model parameter perturbed and the unknown external disturbances are deemed as the lumped uncertainties and the disturbance observer was employed to recover the lumped uncertainties in do 2010 abdelaal et al 2018 sun et al 2017 fu et al 2018 donaire et al 2017 alfi et al 2015 qu et al 2018 yin and xiao 2017 van 2019 an implicit assumption is that the knowledge of the dynamic model or nominal model can be obtained accurately in fact the assumption is conservative the parametric uncertainties and unknown environmental disturbances being taken into account simultaneously the trajectory tracking and path following control solutions were developed by utilizing the adaptive backstepping design tool for the fully actuated umsvs chen and jiang 2013 skjetne et al 2004 bell et al 2018 and under actuated umsvs gao et al 2017 jia et al 2019 respectively it should be pointed out that the dynamic parameters of umsvs need to satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition that is these control solutions which are sensitive to the character of the uncertainties can not solve the tracking control problem of umsvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties for such problem the adaptive nn fuzzy tracking control solutions were provided zouari et al 2019 mohammed et al 2019 tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 chen and jiang 2013 lin et al 2018 nie and lin 2019 where neural networks nns tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and fuzzy logic systems flss chen and tan 2013 lin et al 2018 nie and lin 2019 were applied to reconstruct the compound uncertainties lumped by unknown dynamics and external disturbances however due to the nn fuzzy approximation technique the heavy computation burden issue inevitably arises in mohammed et al 2019 tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 chen and jiang 2013 nie and lin 2019 to deal with this issue the minimum learning parameter mlp based adaptive neural tracking control schemes were developed for the umsvs subject to uncertain dynamics and external disturbances in zhang and zhang 2014 shen et al 2020 among which the designed adaptive laws only need to estimate the 2 norm of nn weights instead of themselves it should be emphasized that the external disturbance can be reconstructed by nns or flss according to the approximation performance of nns flss kurdila et al 1995 boubellouta et al 2019 boulkroune et al 2019 such a method may result in a reduced control performance to enhance the robustness of control scheme against external disturbance the robust adaptive control technique was adopted to solve the tracking control problem shen et al 2020 auto berthing problem zhang et al 2019 and dynamic positioning problem du et al 2015 among which an adaptive law with leakage term was designed to estimate the bound of the sum of the external disturbance and approximation error and the leakage term was used to enhance the robustness as a practical matter the input saturation issue is inevitable for the tracking control problem of umsvs the effect of input saturation being taken into account for the trajectory tracking control of umsvs some effective methods have been proposed like the hyperbolic tangent function method huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 the gaussian error function gef method deng et al 2019b zhu and du 2020 liu and chen 2020 the auxiliary design system method chen et al 2016 mu et al 2018 the position error modification method hu et al 2020 etc however in huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 and liu and chen 2020 the dynamic parameters of umsvs are required to be precisely known in zhu and du 2020 chen et al 2016 hu et al 2020 the dynamic parameters of umsvs need to satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition in addition there exists the heavy computation burden issue caused by the nn fuzzy technique in deng et al 2019a mu et al 2018 motivated by the above discussions this paper investigates the trajectory tracking problem of umsvs with nonparametric uncertainties and external disturbances under input saturation firstly a gef is applied to replace the non smooth nonlinearity of input saturation such that the backstepping design tool can be applied directly then the compounded uncertainty including nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and approximate error is formulated by a linear parametric form with a single parameter instead of being approximated finally both the full state and output feedback schemes are developed for achieving trajectory tracking control of umsvs with the high gain observer employed to handle the latter the main contributions of this work include 1 our proposed trajectory tracking control schemes address several practical factors including nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and input saturation compared with huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 our work does not require any prior knowledge regarding of model parameters and avoids the augmentation of the original model which reduces the complexity of the whole control design 2 unlike chen and jiang 2013 skjetne et al 2004 bell et al 2018 gao et al 2017 jia et al 2019 deng et al 2019a and zhu and du 2020 where the uncertainties need to satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition the uncertainties in our work are formulated by a linear parametric form with a single parameter such that our proposed schemes are insensitive to the character of the uncertainties 3 compared with tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 chen and tan 2013 nie and lin 2019 and chen et al 2016 mu et al 2018 our proposed schemes are approximation free and only one parameter needs to be updated online as a result our proposed schemes are featured by low computational burden the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the problem formulation of this paper is addressed in section 2 the main results of our research are introduced in section 3 including two parts the first part is the design of full state feedback control law and the second is output feedback control law in section 4 the simulations with the comparison are afforded to testify the effectiveness of our control law section 5 provides a conclusion of our paper notations in this paper represents the 2 norm of a matrix or vector sgn is the sign function λ m and λ m denote the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of a matrix respectively ˆ denotes the estimation of unknown parameter and ˆ is the estimation error 2 problem formulation according to skjetne et al 2004 the 3 dof motion mathematical model of umsvs is usually described by the following nonlinear mathematical model 1 η j ψ υ 2 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ d where 3 j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 is the rotation matrix η x y ψ t and υ u ν r t are the position vector in the earth fixed frame and the velocity vector in the body fixed frame respectively m r 3 3 c υ r 3 3 and d υ r 3 3 are the inertial matrix the matrix of coriolis and centripetal terms and the damping matrix respectively d r 3 expresses the unknown time varying disturbance vector and τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t expresses the control input provided by propulsion system in practice the control forces and moment are subject to input saturation due to the physical limitations of vessel thrusters which is descried by 4 τ i sgn τ i c τ i m if τ i c τ i m τ i c if τ i c τ i m where τ i m is the maximum control force or moment and τ i c is the command control signal calculated by control law τ c τ 1 c τ 2 c τ 3 c t which is to be designed later in the mathematical model described in 1 2 j ψ m c υ and d υ have the following properties zhu and du 2020 chen et al 2016 property 1 the matrix j ψ is orthogonal that is j ψ 1 and j 1 ψ j t ψ property 2 the matrix m is positive definite and symmetric and there exist two positive constants m and m satisfying m m m property 3 c d r d f r and d d r such that c υ c d υ and d υ d f d d υ to facilitate the control design the following assumptions are given assumption 1 the disturbance d i i 1 2 3 is bounded i e there exists an unknown positive constant d such that d d assumption 2 the dynamic model parameters m c υ and d υ are unknown assumption 3 for t 0 the reference trajectory η d x d y d ψ d t and its first order derivative η d are bounded and the second order derivative η d of η d exists but is unknown remark 1 assumption 1 is a mild condition to make a feasible control strategy and the similar assumption was involved in qu et al 2018 yin and xiao 2017 van 2019 gao et al 2017 jia et al 2019 zouari et al 2019 in practice the energy of the marine environmental disturbances is finite i e the disturbance τ d is bounded m c υ and d υ are related with environmental conditions and vessel operational as well as vessel s own characteristics it is difficult to obtain the accurate knowledge of these parameters thus assumptions 1 2 are reasonable assumption 3 indicates that the reference trajectory η is smooth moreover from assumption 3 the η d just has to exist whereas it must be available in tee and ge 2006 chen and tan 2013 shen et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 zhu and du 2020 chen et al 2016 in contrast it indicates that the condition is less stringent in our work in addition according to assumption 2 and properties 2 3 m m c d d f and d d are unknown remark 2 it should be pointed out that there exists an implicit condition between τ and τ d i e τ d τ which implies that the propulsion system under saturation constraint can effectively resist the disturbance arose from wind wave and current otherwise it is the safety problem of the umsvs rather than the tracking control problem that needs to be considered in practice the control objective of this paper is to find a robust adaptive control law τ c for the msv 1 2 under assumption 1 3 such that the actual trajectory η of the msv is able to track a desired reference η d while guaranteeing the uniformly ultimately boundedness of all signals in the closed loop trajectory tracking system it is clear from 4 that τ i is a piecewise continuous function in regard to τ i c i 1 2 3 and is featured by a non smooth nonlinearity such that the backstepping design tool is not able to be employed directly wen et al 2011 krstić et al 1995 in this way to circumvent the barrier the saturation nonlinearity τ i is replaced by the following smooth function 5 ξ i τ i c τ i m f π τ i c 2 τ i m where f is a gef defined as f ς 2 π 0 ς exp t 2 d ς in view of 4 and 5 one can get 6 τ i τ i c ξ i τ i c æ i τ i c where æ i τ i c is approximation error satisfying æ i τ i c τ i τ i c ξ i τ i c e i m with e i m being a positive constant utilizing the mean value theorem ξ i τ i c is rewritten as 7 ξ i τ i c ξ i τ i c ϑ i τ i c τ i c where ϑ i exp π τ i c ı 2 τ i m 2 and τ i c ı ı τ i c 1 ı τ i c with ı 0 1 let τ i c 0 and then we have 8 τ i τ i c ϑ i τ i c æ i τ i c remark 3 from the expression of ϑ i we know that ξ i τ i c is a non increasing function i e ϑ i is bounded and satisfies ϑ i 0 1 for τ i c r therefore there is a constant ϑ 0 i satisfying 0 ϑ 0 i ϑ i in addition according to æ i τ i c e i m e τ c e æ holds where e τ c æ 1 τ 1 c æ 2 τ 2 c æ 3 τ 3 c t and e æ is a positive constant remark 4 in huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 to overcome the design difficulty caused by non smooth input saturation nonlinearity the the hyperbolic tangent function is used to approximate the non smooth input saturation nonlinearity however a defect of this method is that the control input τ c can not be designed directly to remedy this issue the original motion model of msvs is augmented in the form of first order which increases the complexity of the control design unquestionably in this work it can be clearly found from 5 7 that the nonaffine form of τ i c is transformed into affine one thus the complicated operation in huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 is discarded by utilizing the mean value theorem 3 control design in this section referring to the umsv with nonparametric uncertainties and external disturbances under input saturation two trajectory tracking schemes are proposed by parameter adaptive technique and vector backstepping design tool firstly a full state feedback control law is designed by using a single parameter learning method then based on this an output feedback control law is designed and the velocity υ is estimated by employing a high gain observer hgo before the control design define the error vectors e 1 r 3 and e 2 r 3 as follows 9 e 1 η η d 10 e 2 υ α 1 where α 1 r 3 is the intermediate control function to be determined later in the control design both full state feedback and output feedback control laws are based on the above transformations 3 1 control scheme i state feedback control law design the design process is implemented through the following two steps step 1 differentiating e 1 and using 1 we have 11 e 1 j ψ υ η d choose the intermediate control function α 1 as follows 12 α 1 j t ψ c 1 e 1 η d where c 1 c 1 t r 3 3 is a positive definite matrix from 12 and property 1 one can get 13 α 1 c 1 e 1 η d step 2 differentiating e 2 and using 2 and 8 we have 14 m e 2 m υ m α 1 c υ d υ υ m α 1 ϑ τ d e where ϑ d i a g ϑ 1 ϑ 2 ϑ 3 and d e d e τ c is the disturbance like term which contains the external

according to 1 9 11 and 12 we obtain 15 α 1 j t ψ c 1 j ψ υ c 1 η d η d r ξ α 1 with r ψ and ξ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 according to 15 and using young s inequality yield 16 α 1 λ m c 1 υ β 1 r α 1 λ m c 1 υ

it is called virtual parameter remark 5 from assumption 2 properties 2 3 and the expression of ϱ υ α we know that ϱ υ α is a composite function vector which contains the uncertain term m α c υ d υ υ disturbance like term d æ and known term j t ϕ e 1 it is known from 27 that ϱ υ α is transformed into the linear parameterization like form with a single parameter θ therefore in the following design only one unknown parameter θ needs to be online updated in this way the computational burden is greatly reduced note that the extracted basis function φ e is not unique for the ϱ υ α that is the different φ e must lead to a different virtual parameter θ synthesizing 14 and 27 yields 29 e 2 t m e 2 e 2 θ φ e e 2 t ϑ τ c according to 29 design the following control law 30 τ c c 2 e 2 χ θ ˆ φ 2

satisfy satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition in tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2014 chen and tan 2013 nie and lin 2019 the parameterized decomposition condition is removed by applying the nn fuzzy approximation technique in zhang and zhang 2014 shen et al 2020 the mlp is employed to reduce the heavy computational burden caused by the nn fuzzy approximation technique compared with skjetne et al 2004 bell et al 2018 the parameterized decomposition condition is not emphasized in this work compared with tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2014 chen and tan 2013 shen et al 2020 our designed control law τ c in 30 is approximation free specifically there is only one unknown parameter θ to be estimated online in our work remark 7 it should be noted that there exists an implicit assumption in tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2014 chen and tan 2013 nie and lin 2019 zhang and zhang 2014 shen et al 2020 i e the variable υ is presupposed to be bounded obviously the bound of υ is unknown which leads to another difficulty i e the boundary of the domain of basis function is difficult to determine as a result the approximate accuracy of nn fuzzy is also difficult to be guaranteed in this work such a problem is well avoided since there are not assumptions on the boundedness of υ from 28 in contrast the control law 30 is simple to compute and easy to implement in engineering applications consider the following lyapunov function 32 v 1 1 2 e 1 t e 1 1 2 e 2 t m e 2 1 2 ϑ 0 θ ϑ 0 θ ˆ 2 taking the time derivative of v 1

m γ and ω γ θ 2 ϑ 0 θ 4 χ the above conclusion is given by the following theorem theorem 1 consider the closed loop trajectory tracking control system consisting of the mathematical model of umsvs 1 2 subject to nonparametric uncertainties unknown disturbances and input saturation under assumptions 1 3 and the control law 30 with the adaptive law 31 and the intermediate control function 12 the tracking error e 1 η η d is able to settle within a small residual set π e 1 r 3 e 1 ζ ζ 2 ω κ through appropriately choosing design parameters c 1 c 2 χ and γ and uub of all signals in the closed loop tracking control system is achieved proof solving 35 yields 36 v 1 v 1 0 ω κ e κ t ω κ where v 1 0 is the initial value of v 1 according to 36 v 1 is bounded thus we obtain that e 1 e 2 and θ ϑ 0 θ ˆ are bounded from 32 furthermore the boundedness of θ ˆ and φ e can be ensured from which τ c is also bounded from assumption 3 and the boundedness of e 1 we obtain that η and α 1 are bounded further υ is also bounded from the boundedness of α 1 and e 2 therefore all the signals in the closed loop control system are bounded in addition in the light of 32 and 36 we have 37 e 1 2 v 1 0 ω κ e κ t 2 ω κ it is clear from 36 that for ζ 2 ω κ there is a constant t ζ 0 such that e 1 ζ for t t ζ therefor the tracking error e 1 of the umsv can settle within π e 1 r 3 e 1 ζ ζ 2 ω κ thus theorem 1 is proved in addition the schematic diagram of the full state feedback control scheme is given in fig 1 3 2 control scheme ii output feedback control law design in subsection 3 1 the case of the full state measurability has been taken into account i e η and υ are available in the control design nevertheless in practice owing to the sensor failure or other factors the vessel velocity is not easy to obtain in this subsection we will employ a hgo to recover the unavailable velocity υ for handling the tracking control problem of umsvs consider the following system 38 ε ς 1 ς 2 ε ς 2 ι 1 ς 2 ς 1 η where ς 1 r 3 and ς 2 r 3 are the systems states and ε is a small positive constant with ε 1 according to lemma 3 in tee and ge 2006 for t t f ς 2 ε η is bounded therefore ς 2 ε can be used to obtain an approximation of η i e one can get 39 η ˆ ς 2 ε in the light of 1 and 38 the velocity vector estimate υ ˆ of the umsv can be represented as 40 υ ˆ j t ψ ς 2 ε due to the boundedness of ς 2 ε η there exists a positive constant ℓ such that ς 2 ε η ℓ further using 1 and 39 the estimation error υ υ ˆ υ of velocity υ is given by 41 υ j t ψ ς 2 ε η recalling property 1 and ς 2 ε η ℓ we obtain 42 υ ε ℓ in view of 10 and 39 the estimate of velocity error vector is defined as 43 e ˆ 2 υ ˆ α 1 where α 1 is defined in 12 and it is bounded from the boundedness of η and assumption 3 then the tracking error e 1 η η d is bounded in addition from 40 and the boundedness of α 1 we can obtain that e ˆ 2 is bounded by β based on that the following lemma about the nonlinear function φ e in 28 will be involved in control design lemma 1 for the nonlinear function φ e in 28 there exists a positive constant φ such that the following inequality holds 44 φ e φ e ˆ φ where e e e ˆ with e ˆ e 1 t e ˆ 2 t t and φ e ˆ e 1 2 e 1 e ˆ 2 2 e ˆ 2 1 proof from 10 42 and 43 we obtain 45 e 2 υ υ ˆ ε ℓ recalling 28 and using 45 e 2 e 2 e ˆ 2 and young s inequality we have 46 φ e e 1 2 e 1 e 2 e ˆ 2 2 e 2

c 2 χ γ ε and ι 1 and uub of all signals in the closed loop tracking control system is achieved proof the proof on theorem 2 follows the same as theorem 1 for the conciseness we omit the detailed analysis in addition the schematic diagram of the output feedback control scheme is given in fig 2 remark 8 it should be pointed out that the hgo based output feedback control scheme for the umsvs involves a conservative condition i e the position vector η needs to be bounded in this context the works jia et al 2019 introduced the prescribed performance control ppc method kostarigka et al 2013 it is undeniable that the ppc based method is also one of the ways to solve the problem but even so the conservative condition is not still completely removed since the control law can t guarantee that the prescribed performance is achieved before the closed loop tracking control system is established in this work we adopt the traditional operation i e two structurally identical control laws are designed where one is the state feedback control law 30 and another one is the output feedback control law 48 for this problem the existing works tee and ge 2006 chen et al 2020 also adopt such an operation remark 9 in practice since the propulsion forces and moment provided by the propulsion system are finite always the velocity υ is bounded which denotes as υ m a x from 2 and property 3 we can obtain that d τ c d d d υ m a x 2 d f υ m a x d υ 0 if υ υ m a x therefore there exists an explicit relationship between the amplitude constraint and the disturbances bound and the model parameters also the initial conditions such as e 1 0 and e 2 0 affect the control commands τ c and τ c o since τ c and τ c 0 include the term φ e and φ e ˆ respectively however it is very difficult to establish explicit relationship among the amplitude constraint and the initial conditions e 1 0 and e 2 0 4 simulation in this section a scale model is used as the test object to verify the effectiveness of our developed control schemes where the dynamic parameters of the umsv given by 1 2 can be got in detail in skjetne et al 2004 further to illuminate the superiority of the developed control laws in this work the simulation comparisons are carried out with the control laws proposed in tee and ge 2006 and chen et al 2016 in simulation the reference trajectory is generated by η d j ψ d υ d m υ d c υ d υ d d υ d υ d τ d with τ d 0 5 0 2 cos 0 01 π t 0 1 sin 0 02 π t t the external disturbances are taken as d j t ψ b where b ϒ 1 b γ ℏ is the first order markov process and ℏ r 3 is the gaussian white noise processes the magnitudes of the driving forces and moment are given by τ 1 m τ 2 m 5 n and τ 3 m 3 5 n m two cases including full state feedback control and output feedback control are carried out in this section firstly using the full state feedback control scheme the robust adaptive trajectory tracking control law τ o is taken into account secondly with unknown vessel velocity υ using the output feedback control scheme the robust adaptive output feedback trajectory tracking control law τ co is applied for the state feedback and output feedback control schemes the design parameters and the initial states are shown in table 1 4 1 full state feedback control simulation results under the control law 30 are shown in fig 3 in addition to quantitatively evaluate the trajectory tracking control performance of control law 30 the performance indices on the tracking error and the control effort are summarized in table 2 where the integrated time absolute error itae the integrated absolute error iae and the mean integrated absolute control miac are used to assess the steady state performance and the properties of energy consumption in trajectory tracking control and tiae iae and miac are defined as itae 0 t s t e i t d t iae 0 t s e i t d t miac 1 t s 0 t s τ i t d t i 1 2 3 fig 3 a b show that the actual trajectory of the vessel tracks the reference trajectory in the presence of nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and input saturation which indicates that the control law 30 can ensure the boundedness of the umvs s positions x y and yaw angle the duration curve of tracking error e 1 is drawn in fig 3 c which indicates that tracking error e 1 is bounded fig 3 d shows that the surge velocity u the sway velocity ν and the yaw rate r are bounded and fig 3 e presents the curve of control input τ from which it is seen that the control forces and moment are bounded and reasonable under our proposed scheme fig 3 f shows the estimation of the adaptive parameter θ ˆ these results show that all signals of closed loop control system are bounded moreover to further illustrate the superiority of our designed control law the simulation comparisons with the control laws proposed in chen et al 2016 and tee and ge 2006 are taken into account respectively the control law designed in chen et al 2016 is given by 53 τ m j t ψ e 1 c e 2 φ 1 z θ ˆ c ζ sgn e 2 d ˆ with the adaptive laws 54 θ ˆ c ξ 1 φ 1 t z e 2 σ 1 θ ˆ c 55 d ˆ ξ 2 d i a g sgn e 2 e 2 σ 2 d ˆ where d i a g s i g e 2 d i a g sgn e 2 1 sgn e 2 2 sgn e 2 3 c c t r 3 3 ξ 1 ξ 1 t r 19 19 and ξ 2 ξ 2 t r 3 3 are positive definite design matrices σ i 0 i 1 2 are design constants and the auxiliary variable ζ r 3 3 is applied to deal with the effect of input saturation d ˆ d ˆ 1 d ˆ 2 d ˆ 3 t the detailed expression of ζ θ c r 19 and φ 1 z r 3 19 in 54 are given in chen et al 2016 in addition the control law developed in tee and ge 2006 is given by 56 τ k j t ψ e 1 k e 2 w ˆ s x with the adaptive laws 57 w ˆ i λ i s i x e 2 i σ i w ˆ i i 1 2 3 with x η t υ t α 1 t α 1 t t w r 3 ℓ 3 ℓ and s x r 3 ℓ being the weight vector and the radial basis function vector ℓ 20 being the node numbers of nn k r 3 3 and λ i r ℓ ℓ being design matrices and σ i being the design constant simulation results under the control laws τ m and τ k are drawn in fig 3 a e using the dash line and dash dot line respectively and the performance indices are also summarized in table ii from fig 3 a d it can be seen clearly that τ m and τ k exhibit superior transient performance to our proposed scheme whereas our proposed scheme exhibit superior steady state performance from table ii and fig 3 c in addition fig 3 e and table ii indicate that the miac under our proposed control law are smaller than that under τ m and τ k and the control forces and moment under τ m are chattering owing to the use of term d i a g sgn e 2 e 2 in 54 it would be specially mentioned that only one unknown parameter θ needs to be updated online in our work whereas 22 and 3 ℓ parameters need to be updated online in chen et al 2016 and tee and ge 2006 respectively by contrast the computational burden is low in our work besides it can be clearly found from the indexes tiae iae and miac in table 2 that under our designed control τ c the steady state performance is the best and the energy consumption is the lowest therefore for the trajectory tracking of umsvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and input saturation our proposed scheme achieves better control performance and has a low computational burden 4 2 output feedback control in this subsection we test the effectiveness of our proposed output feedback control scheme and a comparison with the adaptive nn output feedback control scheme proposed in tee and ge 2006 is implemented the output feedback control law developed in tee and ge 2006 is 58 τ k o j t ψ e 1 k e ˆ 2 w ˆ s x ˆ with the adaptive laws 59 w ˆ i λ i s i x ˆ e ˆ 2 i σ i w ˆ i i 1 2 3 in simulation the design parameters and the initial states of our proposed scheme can be seen in table 1 and the design parameters of τ k o can be got in tee and ge 2006 the simulation results under the control law τ co and τ k o are shown in fig 4 and the performance indices on the two control schemes are also summarized in table 2 fig 4 a b show the tracking control performance under the two control laws which indicates that τ k o exhibits the superior transient performance to the control law τ co in contrast however the control law τ co exhibits the superior steady state performance which can also be obtained from table 2 from fig 4 e and table ii we can find that the miac under the control law τ co 48 is less than that of τ k o which indicates that the energy consumption of control law τ co is relatively low in addition the simulation results presented in fig 4 and table 2 demonstrate that compared with the scheme proposed in tee and ge 2006 under the same scenario our control scheme not only saves energy but also is of a low computational burden therefore simulation results and comparison show that our developed output feedback control law is effective and achieves well control performance for the trajectory tracking of umsvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and unmeasured velocity under input saturation 4 3 robustness test considering the model parameters of the umsv affected by the maneuvering conditions and external disturbances the perturbation of umsv s model parameters exists in this context the model parameters with perturbation are taken into account in this subsection and simulations are carried out to test the robustness of the tracking scheme under two cases in case 1 the perturbations of model parameters are δ m 30 m δ c υ 30 c υ and δ d υ 30 d υ and the external disturbance is taken the same as subsection 4 1 in case 2 the perturbations of model parameters are taken the same as case 1 and the external disturbance is taken as d j t ψ b ϖ where ϖ is taken as 0 8 sin 0 02 π t π 4 cos 0 01 π t 0 8 cos 0 02 π t π 8 sin 0 05 π t 0 8 sin 0 01 π t π 3 cos 0 01 π t in simulation the design parameters and initial states are consistent with the one given in table 2 simulation results and quantization indexes under control laws τ c and τ co are shown in figs 3 and 4 and table 3 respectively figs 5 and 6 present the tracking errors and control input under the state feedback and output feedback control schemes which indicates that our proposed schemes are effective even if there exist the perturbation of model parameters and external disturbances in addition it can be found from table 3 that the control performance decreases with the increase of uncertainties including parameter perturbation and external disturbances moreover from the index of tables 2 and 3 the influence of parameter perturbation on tracking control accuracy is slight compared with the parameter perturbation the influence of perturbation on tracking control accuracy is relatively larger from tables 2 and 3 and figs 3 b and 4 b it can be found that the index of miac becomes larger with the increase of uncertainties including parameter perturbation and external disturbances which is reasonable and in accordance with nautical practice 5 conclusion in this paper we have addressed the robust adaptive trajectory tracking control problem for msvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties and external disturbances under input saturation in the control design the gef is applied to replace the non smooth saturation nonlinearity for the convenience of control design and the lumped uncertain term including unknown vessel dynamic and external disturbances is formulated by the linear parameterization like form with a single unknown parameter based on the backstepping design tool and the parameter adaptive technique the full state feedback control scheme and the output feedback control scheme are developed via a single parameter learning the theoretical analysis indicates that under our proposed schemes all signals in the closed loop tracking control system are bounded and the steady state compact set of error signals can be made small through appropriate selection of design parameters the simulation results show that the trajectory tracking control of umsvs is reached with better performance under our proposed schemes compared with the existing robust adaptive control scheme and adaptive nn control scheme in the developed trajectory tracking control techniques we only focus on how to reduce the computational load of the control algorithm without emphasizing the efficiency of parameter learning in the future we will discuss the application of some emerging learning techniques such as the finite time learning luan et al 2019 lv et al 2016 and the composite learning pan et al 2017 guo et al 2019 to enhance the control performance of the proposed

20616,this paper investigates the robust adaptive trajectory tracking control problem for unmanned marine surface vessels umsvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties and external disturbances under input saturation the non smooth saturation nonlinearity is replaced by the gaussian error function the lumped uncertain term including nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and approximation error is formulated by the linear parameterization like form with a single unknown parameter combining the parameter adaptive technique with backstepping design tool single parameter

in the closed loop trajectory tracking control system are bounded simulation results and comparison illustrate the effectiveness of the developed schemes keywords unmanned marine surface vessel trajectory tracking control nonparametric uncertainty single parameter learning input saturation 1 introduction with the rise of ocean development unmanned marine surface vessels umsvs have played an irreplaceable role and have been widely applied in various marine tasks such as marine transportation oil harvesting coastal surveillance etc ma et al 2020 wen et al 2011 liu et al 2016 ma et al 2018 for the control problem of umsvs in engineering practice controlling an umsv to track a pre set trajectory or follow a predefined path which involves the control problem of trajectory tracking or path following has received a great deal of attention from control and marine engineering communities zhao et al 2020 yu et al 2019a b zhu et al 2020 compared with the control problem of path following the control problem of trajectory tracking is more challenging since the designed tracking control laws need to steer the vessels reach and track a time varying trajectory in time besides owing to the internal and external uncertainties and inherent nonlinearity of the dynamic system of umsvs the design of control law for the trajectory tracking problem becomes even more difficult qiao and zhang 2017 deng et al 2019a in addition another important issue for the tracking control problem of umsvs is the input saturation nonlinearity due to the physical constraints of vessel propulsion systems alme 2008 in the last few decades for the tracking control problem of umsvs subject to unknown external disturbances several effective methods have been proposed to handle the effect of external disturbances such as the disturbance observer do 2010 abdelaal et al 2018 extended state observer sun et al 2017 fu et al 2018 passivity based controller with integral action donaire et al 2017 h theory alfi et al 2015 etc in qu et al 2018 yin and xiao 2017 van 2019 the model parameter perturbed and the unknown external disturbances are deemed as the lumped uncertainties and the disturbance observer was employed to recover the lumped uncertainties in do 2010 abdelaal et al 2018 sun et al 2017 fu et al 2018 donaire et al 2017 alfi et al 2015 qu et al 2018 yin and xiao 2017 van 2019 an implicit assumption is that the knowledge of the dynamic model or nominal model can be obtained accurately in fact the assumption is conservative the parametric uncertainties and unknown environmental disturbances being taken into account simultaneously the trajectory tracking and path following control solutions were developed by utilizing the adaptive backstepping design tool for the fully actuated umsvs chen and jiang 2013 skjetne et al 2004 bell et al 2018 and under actuated umsvs gao et al 2017 jia et al 2019 respectively it should be pointed out that the dynamic parameters of umsvs need to satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition that is these control solutions which are sensitive to the character of the uncertainties can not solve the tracking control problem of umsvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties for such problem the adaptive nn fuzzy tracking control solutions were provided zouari et al 2019 mohammed et al 2019 tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 chen and jiang 2013 lin et al 2018 nie and lin 2019 where neural networks nns tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and fuzzy logic systems flss chen and tan 2013 lin et al 2018 nie and lin 2019 were applied to reconstruct the compound uncertainties lumped by unknown dynamics and external disturbances however due to the nn fuzzy approximation technique the heavy computation burden issue inevitably arises in mohammed et al 2019 tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 chen and jiang 2013 nie and lin 2019 to deal with this issue the minimum learning parameter mlp based adaptive neural tracking control schemes were developed for the umsvs subject to uncertain dynamics and external disturbances in zhang and zhang 2014 shen et al 2020 among which the designed adaptive laws only need to estimate the 2 norm of nn weights instead of themselves it should be emphasized that the external disturbance can be reconstructed by nns or flss according to the approximation performance of nns flss kurdila et al 1995 boubellouta et al 2019 boulkroune et al 2019 such a method may result in a reduced control performance to enhance the robustness of control scheme against external disturbance the robust adaptive control technique was adopted to solve the tracking control problem shen et al 2020 auto berthing problem zhang et al 2019 and dynamic positioning problem du et al 2015 among which an adaptive law with leakage term was designed to estimate the bound of the sum of the external disturbance and approximation error and the leakage term was used to enhance the robustness as a practical matter the input saturation issue is inevitable for the tracking control problem of umsvs the effect of input saturation being taken into account for the trajectory tracking control of umsvs some effective methods have been proposed like the hyperbolic tangent function method huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 the gaussian error function gef method deng et al 2019b zhu and du 2020 liu and chen 2020 the auxiliary design system method chen et al 2016 mu et al 2018 the position error modification method hu et al 2020 etc however in huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 and liu and chen 2020 the dynamic parameters of umsvs are required to be precisely known in zhu and du 2020 chen et al 2016 hu et al 2020 the dynamic parameters of umsvs need to satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition in addition there exists the heavy computation burden issue caused by the nn fuzzy technique in deng et al 2019a mu et al 2018 motivated by the above discussions this paper investigates the trajectory tracking problem of umsvs with nonparametric uncertainties and external disturbances under input saturation firstly a gef is applied to replace the non smooth nonlinearity of input saturation such that the backstepping design tool can be applied directly then the compounded uncertainty including nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and approximate error is formulated by a linear parametric form with a single parameter instead of being approximated finally both the full state and output feedback schemes are developed for achieving trajectory tracking control of umsvs with the high gain observer employed to handle the latter the main contributions of this work include 1 our proposed trajectory tracking control schemes address several practical factors including nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and input saturation compared with huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 our work does not require any prior knowledge regarding of model parameters and avoids the augmentation of the original model which reduces the complexity of the whole control design 2 unlike chen and jiang 2013 skjetne et al 2004 bell et al 2018 gao et al 2017 jia et al 2019 deng et al 2019a and zhu and du 2020 where the uncertainties need to satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition the uncertainties in our work are formulated by a linear parametric form with a single parameter such that our proposed schemes are insensitive to the character of the uncertainties 3 compared with tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 chen and tan 2013 nie and lin 2019 and chen et al 2016 mu et al 2018 our proposed schemes are approximation free and only one parameter needs to be updated online as a result our proposed schemes are featured by low computational burden the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the problem formulation of this paper is addressed in section 2 the main results of our research are introduced in section 3 including two parts the first part is the design of full state feedback control law and the second is output feedback control law in section 4 the simulations with the comparison are afforded to testify the effectiveness of our control law section 5 provides a conclusion of our paper notations in this paper represents the 2 norm of a matrix or vector sgn is the sign function λ m and λ m denote the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of a matrix respectively ˆ denotes the estimation of unknown parameter and ˆ is the estimation error 2 problem formulation according to skjetne et al 2004 the 3 dof motion mathematical model of umsvs is usually described by the following nonlinear mathematical model 1 η j ψ υ 2 m υ c υ υ d υ υ τ d where 3 j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 is the rotation matrix η x y ψ t and υ u ν r t are the position vector in the earth fixed frame and the velocity vector in the body fixed frame respectively m r 3 3 c υ r 3 3 and d υ r 3 3 are the inertial matrix the matrix of coriolis and centripetal terms and the damping matrix respectively d r 3 expresses the unknown time varying disturbance vector and τ τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 t expresses the control input provided by propulsion system in practice the control forces and moment are subject to input saturation due to the physical limitations of vessel thrusters which is descried by 4 τ i sgn τ i c τ i m if τ i c τ i m τ i c if τ i c τ i m where τ i m is the maximum control force or moment and τ i c is the command control signal calculated by control law τ c τ 1 c τ 2 c τ 3 c t which is to be designed later in the mathematical model described in 1 2 j ψ m c υ and d υ have the following properties zhu and du 2020 chen et al 2016 property 1 the matrix j ψ is orthogonal that is j ψ 1 and j 1 ψ j t ψ property 2 the matrix m is positive definite and symmetric and there exist two positive constants m and m satisfying m m m property 3 c d r d f r and d d r such that c υ c d υ and d υ d f d d υ to facilitate the control design the following assumptions are given assumption 1 the disturbance d i i 1 2 3 is bounded i e there exists an unknown positive constant d such that d d assumption 2 the dynamic model parameters m c υ and d υ are unknown assumption 3 for t 0 the reference trajectory η d x d y d ψ d t and its first order derivative η d are bounded and the second order derivative η d of η d exists but is unknown remark 1 assumption 1 is a mild condition to make a feasible control strategy and the similar assumption was involved in qu et al 2018 yin and xiao 2017 van 2019 gao et al 2017 jia et al 2019 zouari et al 2019 in practice the energy of the marine environmental disturbances is finite i e the disturbance τ d is bounded m c υ and d υ are related with environmental conditions and vessel operational as well as vessel s own characteristics it is difficult to obtain the accurate knowledge of these parameters thus assumptions 1 2 are reasonable assumption 3 indicates that the reference trajectory η is smooth moreover from assumption 3 the η d just has to exist whereas it must be available in tee and ge 2006 chen and tan 2013 shen et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 zhu and du 2020 chen et al 2016 in contrast it indicates that the condition is less stringent in our work in addition according to assumption 2 and properties 2 3 m m c d d f and d d are unknown remark 2 it should be pointed out that there exists an implicit condition between τ and τ d i e τ d τ which implies that the propulsion system under saturation constraint can effectively resist the disturbance arose from wind wave and current otherwise it is the safety problem of the umsvs rather than the tracking control problem that needs to be considered in practice the control objective of this paper is to find a robust adaptive control law τ c for the msv 1 2 under assumption 1 3 such that the actual trajectory η of the msv is able to track a desired reference η d while guaranteeing the uniformly ultimately boundedness of all signals in the closed loop trajectory tracking system it is clear from 4 that τ i is a piecewise continuous function in regard to τ i c i 1 2 3 and is featured by a non smooth nonlinearity such that the backstepping design tool is not able to be employed directly wen et al 2011 krstić et al 1995 in this way to circumvent the barrier the saturation nonlinearity τ i is replaced by the following smooth function 5 ξ i τ i c τ i m f π τ i c 2 τ i m where f is a gef defined as f ς 2 π 0 ς exp t 2 d ς in view of 4 and 5 one can get 6 τ i τ i c ξ i τ i c æ i τ i c where æ i τ i c is approximation error satisfying æ i τ i c τ i τ i c ξ i τ i c e i m with e i m being a positive constant utilizing the mean value theorem ξ i τ i c is rewritten as 7 ξ i τ i c ξ i τ i c ϑ i τ i c τ i c where ϑ i exp π τ i c ı 2 τ i m 2 and τ i c ı ı τ i c 1 ı τ i c with ı 0 1 let τ i c 0 and then we have 8 τ i τ i c ϑ i τ i c æ i τ i c remark 3 from the expression of ϑ i we know that ξ i τ i c is a non increasing function i e ϑ i is bounded and satisfies ϑ i 0 1 for τ i c r therefore there is a constant ϑ 0 i satisfying 0 ϑ 0 i ϑ i in addition according to æ i τ i c e i m e τ c e æ holds where e τ c æ 1 τ 1 c æ 2 τ 2 c æ 3 τ 3 c t and e æ is a positive constant remark 4 in huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 to overcome the design difficulty caused by non smooth input saturation nonlinearity the the hyperbolic tangent function is used to approximate the non smooth input saturation nonlinearity however a defect of this method is that the control input τ c can not be designed directly to remedy this issue the original motion model of msvs is augmented in the form of first order which increases the complexity of the control design unquestionably in this work it can be clearly found from 5 7 that the nonaffine form of τ i c is transformed into affine one thus the complicated operation in huang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 is discarded by utilizing the mean value theorem 3 control design in this section referring to the umsv with nonparametric uncertainties and external disturbances under input saturation two trajectory tracking schemes are proposed by parameter adaptive technique and vector backstepping design tool firstly a full state feedback control law is designed by using a single parameter learning method then based on this an output feedback control law is designed and the velocity υ is estimated by employing a high gain observer hgo before the control design define the error vectors e 1 r 3 and e 2 r 3 as follows 9 e 1 η η d 10 e 2 υ α 1 where α 1 r 3 is the intermediate control function to be determined later in the control design both full state feedback and output feedback control laws are based on the above transformations 3 1 control scheme i state feedback control law design the design process is implemented through the following two steps step 1 differentiating e 1 and using 1 we have 11 e 1 j ψ υ η d choose the intermediate control function α 1 as follows 12 α 1 j t ψ c 1 e 1 η d where c 1 c 1 t r 3 3 is a positive definite matrix from 12 and property 1 one can get 13 α 1 c 1 e 1 η d step 2 differentiating e 2 and using 2 and 8 we have 14 m e 2 m υ m α 1 c υ d υ υ m α 1 ϑ τ d e where ϑ d i a g ϑ 1 ϑ 2 ϑ 3 and d e d e τ c is the disturbance like term which contains the external disturbance d and the approximation error e τ c in view of 6 and assumption 1 one gets d e d e æ d æ in addition according to remark 2 there exists an unknown constant ϑ 0 0 satisfying ϑ 0 λ m ϑ according to 1 9 11 and 12 we obtain 15 α 1 j t ψ c 1 j ψ υ c 1 η d η d r ξ α 1 with r ψ and ξ 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 according to 15 and using young s inequality yield 16 α 1 λ m c 1 υ β 1 r α 1 λ m c 1 υ β 1 0 5 r 2 0 5 α 1 2 λ m c 1 υ 0 5 υ 2 β 1 0 5 α 1 2 where β 1 c 1 η d η d substituting 13 into 16 yields 17 α 1 λ m c 1 υ 0 5 υ 2 β 1 0 5 λ m c 1 e 1 η d 2 λ m c 1 υ 0 5 υ 2 β 2 0 5 λ m 2 c 1 e 1 2 λ m c 1 η d e 1 where β 2 β 1 0 5 η d 2 let ϱ υ α c υ d υ υ m α d e j ψ e 1 from assumptions 1 2 ϱ υ α is unavailable in the control design using properties 1 3 and 17 the following transformation on ϱ υ α can be taken as 18 ϱ υ α c d d d υ 2 d f υ m α d æ e 1 c d d d 0 5 m υ 2 d f λ m c 1 m υ 0 5 λ m 2 c 1 m e 1 2 m λ m c 1 η d e 1 e 1 m β 2 d æ in view of 10 13 and young s inequality one has 19 υ e 2 α 1 e 2 λ m c 1 e 1 η d 20 υ 2 2 e 2 2 2 λ m c 1 e 1 η d 2 2 e 2 2 2 λ m 2 c 1 e 1 2 4 λ m c 1 η d e 1 2 η d 2 synthesizing 18 19 and 20 yields 21 ϱ υ α θ 1 e 1 2 θ 2 e 1 θ 3 e 2 2 θ 4 e 2 θ 5 where 22 θ 1 2 λ m 2 c 1 c d d d 0 5 m 0 5 λ m 2 c 1 m 23 θ 2 4 λ m c 1 η d c d d d 0 5 m m λ m c 1 η d λ m c 1 d f λ m c 1 m 1 24 θ 3 2 c d d d 0 5 m 25 θ 4 d f λ m c 1 m 26 θ 5 η d d f λ m c 1 m m β 2 d æ 2 η d 2 c d d d 0 5 m in the light of assumptions 1 3 and properties 2 3 c d d d and m are unknown and η d and η d are bounded that is there exist unknown positive constants θ i i 1 5 satisfying θ i θ i let θ max θ 1 θ 5 and then 18 can be written as 27 ϱ υ α θ φ e where 28 φ e e 1 2 e 1 e 2 2 e 2 1 with e e 1 t e 2 t t obviously θ is unknown and is not of a clear physical significance here it is called virtual parameter remark 5 from assumption 2 properties 2 3 and the expression of ϱ υ α we know that ϱ υ α is a composite function vector which contains the uncertain term m α c υ d υ υ disturbance like term d æ and known term j t ϕ e 1 it is known from 27 that ϱ υ α is transformed into the linear parameterization like form with a single parameter θ therefore in the following design only one unknown parameter θ needs to be online updated in this way the computational burden is greatly reduced note that the extracted basis function φ e is not unique for the ϱ υ α that is the different φ e must lead to a different virtual parameter θ synthesizing 14 and 27 yields 29 e 2 t m e 2 e 2 θ φ e e 2 t ϑ τ c according to 29 design the following control law 30 τ c c 2 e 2 χ θ ˆ φ 2 e e 2 with the adaptive law 31 θ ˆ χ φ 2 e e 2 2 γ θ ˆ where c 2 0 χ 0 γ 0 and δ 0 are design parameters remark 6 in skjetne et al 2004 bell et al 2018 the matrixes m c υ and d υ are required to satisfy satisfy the parameterized decomposition condition in tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2014 chen and tan 2013 nie and lin 2019 the parameterized decomposition condition is removed by applying the nn fuzzy approximation technique in zhang and zhang 2014 shen et al 2020 the mlp is employed to reduce the heavy computational burden caused by the nn fuzzy approximation technique compared with skjetne et al 2004 bell et al 2018 the parameterized decomposition condition is not emphasized in this work compared with tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2014 chen and tan 2013 shen et al 2020 our designed control law τ c in 30 is approximation free specifically there is only one unknown parameter θ to be estimated online in our work remark 7 it should be noted that there exists an implicit assumption in tee and ge 2006 peng et al 2017 zhang and zhang 2014 chen and tan 2013 nie and lin 2019 zhang and zhang 2014 shen et al 2020 i e the variable υ is presupposed to be bounded obviously the bound of υ is unknown which leads to another difficulty i e the boundary of the domain of basis function is difficult to determine as a result the approximate accuracy of nn fuzzy is also difficult to be guaranteed in this work such a problem is well avoided since there are not assumptions on the boundedness of υ from 28 in contrast the control law 30 is simple to compute and easy to implement in engineering applications consider the following lyapunov function 32 v 1 1 2 e 1 t e 1 1 2 e 2 t m e 2 1 2 ϑ 0 θ ϑ 0 θ ˆ 2 taking the time derivative of v 1

young s inequality we have 34 e 2 θ φ e θ χ e 2 2 φ 2 e θ 4 χ substituting 30 31 and 34 into 33 yields 35 v 1 e 1 t c 1 e 1 θ χ e 2 2 φ 2 e ϑ 0 χ θ ˆ φ 2 e e 2 2 θ 4 χ c 2 ϑ 0 e 2 t e 2 θ ϑ 0 θ ˆ χ φ

m γ and ω γ θ 2 ϑ 0 θ 4 χ the above conclusion is given by the following theorem theorem 1 consider the closed loop trajectory tracking control system consisting of the mathematical model of umsvs 1 2 subject to nonparametric uncertainties unknown disturbances and input saturation under assumptions 1 3 and the control law 30 with the adaptive law 31 and the intermediate control function 12 the tracking error e 1 η η d is able to settle within a small residual set π e 1 r 3 e 1 ζ ζ 2 ω κ through appropriately choosing design parameters c 1 c 2 χ and γ and uub of all signals in the closed loop tracking control system is achieved proof solving 35 yields 36 v 1 v 1 0 ω κ e κ t ω κ where v 1 0 is the initial value of v 1 according to 36 v 1 is bounded thus we obtain that e 1 e 2 and θ ϑ 0 θ ˆ are bounded from 32 furthermore the boundedness of θ ˆ and φ e can be ensured from which τ c is also bounded from assumption 3 and the boundedness of e 1 we obtain that η and α 1 are bounded further υ is also bounded from the boundedness of α 1 and e 2 therefore all the signals in the closed loop control system are bounded in addition in the light of 32 and 36 we have 37 e 1 2 v 1 0 ω κ e κ t 2 ω κ it is clear from 36 that for ζ 2 ω κ there is a constant t ζ 0 such that e 1 ζ for t t ζ therefor the tracking error e 1 of the umsv can settle within π e 1 r 3 e 1 ζ ζ 2 ω κ thus theorem 1 is proved in addition the schematic diagram of the full state feedback control scheme is given in fig 1 3 2 control scheme ii output feedback control law design in subsection 3 1 the case of the full state measurability has been taken into account i e η and υ are available in the control design nevertheless in practice owing to the sensor failure or other factors the vessel velocity is not easy to obtain in this subsection we will employ a hgo to recover the unavailable velocity υ for handling the tracking control problem of umsvs consider the following system 38 ε ς 1 ς 2 ε ς 2 ι 1 ς 2 ς 1 η where ς 1 r 3 and ς 2 r 3 are the systems states and ε is a small positive constant with ε 1 according to lemma 3 in tee and ge 2006 for t t f ς 2 ε η is bounded therefore ς 2 ε can be used to obtain an approximation of η i e one can get 39 η ˆ ς 2 ε in the light of 1 and 38 the velocity vector estimate υ ˆ of the umsv can be represented as 40 υ ˆ j t ψ ς 2 ε due to the boundedness of ς 2 ε η there exists a positive constant ℓ such that ς 2 ε η ℓ further using 1 and 39 the estimation error υ υ ˆ υ of velocity υ is given by 41 υ j t ψ ς 2 ε η recalling property 1 and ς 2 ε η ℓ we obtain 42 υ ε ℓ in view of 10 and 39 the estimate of velocity error vector is defined as 43 e ˆ 2 υ ˆ α 1 where α 1 is defined in 12 and it is bounded from the boundedness of η and assumption 3 then the tracking error e 1 η η d is bounded in addition from 40 and the boundedness of α 1 we can obtain that e ˆ 2 is bounded by β based on that the following lemma about the nonlinear function φ e in 28 will be involved in control design lemma 1 for the nonlinear function φ e in 28 there exists a positive constant φ such that the following inequality holds 44 φ e φ e ˆ φ where e e e ˆ with e ˆ e 1 t

the design parameter c 2 should satisfy c 2 2 the above conclusion is given by the following theorem theorem 2 consider the closed loop trajectory tracking control system consisting of the mathematical model of umsvs 1 2 subject to nonparametric uncertainties unknown disturbances and input saturation under assumptions 1 3 and the control law 48 with the adaptive law 49 the intermediate

c 2 χ γ ε and ι 1 and uub of all signals in the closed loop tracking control system is achieved proof the proof on theorem 2 follows the same as theorem 1 for the conciseness we omit the detailed analysis in addition the schematic diagram of the output feedback control scheme is given in fig 2 remark 8 it should be pointed out that the hgo based output feedback control scheme for the umsvs involves a conservative condition i e the position vector η needs to be bounded in this context the works jia et al 2019 introduced the prescribed performance control ppc method kostarigka et al 2013 it is undeniable that the ppc based method is also one of the ways to solve the problem but even so the conservative condition is not still completely removed since the control law can t guarantee that the prescribed performance is achieved before the closed loop tracking control system is established in this work we adopt the traditional operation i e two structurally identical control laws are designed where one is the state feedback control law 30 and another one is the output feedback control law 48 for this problem the existing works tee and ge 2006 chen et al 2020 also adopt such an operation remark 9 in practice since the propulsion forces and moment provided by the propulsion system are finite always the velocity υ is bounded which denotes as υ m a x from 2 and property 3 we can obtain that d τ c d d d υ m a x 2 d f υ m a x d υ 0 if υ υ m a x therefore there exists an explicit relationship between the amplitude constraint and the disturbances bound and the model parameters also the initial conditions such as e 1 0 and e 2 0 affect the control commands τ c and τ c o since τ c and τ c 0 include the term φ e and φ e ˆ respectively however it is very difficult to establish explicit relationship among the amplitude constraint and the initial conditions e 1 0 and e 2 0 4 simulation in this section a scale model is used as the test object to verify the effectiveness of our developed control schemes where the dynamic parameters of the umsv given by 1 2 can be got in detail in skjetne et al 2004 further to illuminate the superiority of the developed control laws in this work the simulation comparisons are carried out with the control laws proposed in tee and ge 2006 and chen et al 2016 in simulation the reference trajectory is generated by η d j

the gaussian white noise processes the magnitudes of the driving forces and moment are given by τ 1 m τ 2 m 5 n and τ 3 m 3 5 n m two cases including full state feedback control and output feedback control are carried out in this section firstly using the full state feedback control scheme the robust adaptive trajectory tracking control law τ o is taken into account secondly with unknown vessel velocity υ using the output feedback control scheme the robust adaptive output feedback trajectory tracking control law τ co is applied for the state feedback and output feedback control schemes the design parameters and the initial states are shown in table 1 4 1 full state feedback control simulation results under the control law 30 are shown in fig 3 in addition to quantitatively evaluate the trajectory tracking control performance of control law 30 the performance indices on the tracking error and the control effort are summarized in table 2 where the integrated time absolute error itae the integrated absolute error iae and the mean integrated absolute control miac are used to assess the steady state performance and the properties of energy consumption in trajectory tracking control

trajectory in the presence of nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and input saturation which indicates that the control law 30 can ensure the boundedness of the umvs s positions x y and yaw angle the duration curve of tracking error e 1 is drawn in fig 3 c which indicates that tracking error e 1 is bounded fig 3 d shows that the surge velocity u the sway velocity ν and the yaw rate r are bounded and fig 3 e presents the curve of control input τ from which it is seen that the control forces and moment are bounded and reasonable under our proposed scheme fig 3 f shows the estimation of the adaptive parameter θ ˆ these results show that all signals of closed loop control system are bounded moreover to further illustrate the superiority of our designed control law the simulation comparisons with the control laws proposed in chen et al 2016 and tee and ge 2006 are taken into account respectively the control law designed in chen et al 2016 is given by 53 τ m j t ψ e 1 c e 2 φ 1 z θ ˆ c ζ sgn e 2 d ˆ with the adaptive laws 54 θ ˆ c ξ 1 φ 1 t z e 2 σ 1 θ ˆ c 55 d ˆ ξ 2 d i a g sgn e 2 e 2 σ 2 d ˆ where d i a g s i g e 2 d i a g sgn e 2 1 sgn e 2 2 sgn e 2 3 c c t r 3 3 ξ 1 ξ 1 t r 19 19 and ξ 2 ξ 2 t r 3 3 are positive definite design matrices σ i 0 i 1 2 are design constants and the auxiliary variable ζ r 3 3 is applied to deal with the effect of input saturation d ˆ d ˆ 1 d ˆ 2 d ˆ 3 t the detailed expression of ζ θ c r 19 and φ 1 z r 3 19 in 54 are given in chen et al 2016 in addition the control law developed in tee and ge 2006 is given by 56 τ k j t ψ e 1 k e 2 w ˆ s x with the adaptive laws 57 w ˆ i λ i s i x e 2 i σ i w ˆ i i 1 2 3 with x η t υ t α 1 t α 1 t t w r 3 ℓ 3 ℓ and s x r 3 ℓ being the weight vector and the radial basis function vector ℓ 20 being the node numbers of nn k r 3 3 and λ i r ℓ ℓ being design matrices and σ i being the design constant simulation results under the control laws τ m and τ k are drawn in fig 3 a e using the dash line and dash dot line respectively and the performance indices are also summarized in table ii from fig 3 a d it can be seen clearly that τ m and τ k exhibit superior transient performance to our proposed scheme whereas our proposed scheme exhibit superior steady state performance from table ii and fig 3 c in addition fig 3 e and table ii indicate that the miac under our proposed control law are smaller than that under τ m and τ k and the control forces and moment under τ m are chattering owing to the use of term d i a g sgn e 2 e 2 in 54 it would be specially mentioned that only one unknown parameter θ needs to be updated online in our work whereas 22 and 3 ℓ parameters need to be updated online in chen et al 2016 and tee and ge 2006 respectively by contrast the computational burden is low in our work besides it can be clearly found from the indexes tiae iae and miac in table 2 that under our designed control τ c the steady state performance is the best and the energy consumption is the lowest therefore for the trajectory tracking of umsvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and input saturation our proposed scheme achieves better control performance and has a low computational burden 4 2 output feedback control in this subsection we test the effectiveness of our proposed output feedback control scheme and a comparison with the adaptive nn output feedback control scheme proposed in tee and ge 2006 is implemented the output feedback control law developed in tee and ge 2006 is 58 τ k o j t ψ e 1 k e ˆ 2 w ˆ s x ˆ with the adaptive laws 59 w ˆ i λ i s i x ˆ e ˆ 2 i σ i w ˆ i i 1 2 3 in simulation the design parameters and the initial states of our proposed scheme can be seen in table 1 and the design parameters of τ k o can be got in tee and ge 2006 the simulation results under the control law τ co and τ k o are shown in fig 4 and the performance indices on the two control schemes are also summarized in table 2 fig 4 a b show the tracking control performance under the two control laws which indicates that τ k o exhibits the superior transient performance to the control law τ co in contrast however the control law τ co exhibits the superior steady state performance which can also be obtained from table 2 from fig 4 e and table ii we can find that the miac under the control law τ co 48 is less than that of τ k o which indicates that the energy consumption of control law τ co is relatively low in addition the simulation results presented in fig 4 and table 2 demonstrate that compared with the scheme proposed in tee and ge 2006 under the same scenario our control scheme not only saves energy but also is of a low computational burden therefore simulation results and comparison show that our developed output feedback control law is effective and achieves well control performance for the trajectory tracking of umsvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties external disturbances and unmeasured velocity under input saturation 4 3 robustness test considering the model parameters of the umsv affected by the maneuvering conditions and external disturbances the perturbation of umsv s model parameters exists in this context the model parameters with perturbation are taken into account in this subsection and simulations are carried out to test the robustness of the tracking scheme under two cases in case 1 the perturbations of model parameters are δ m 30 m δ c υ 30 c υ and δ d υ 30 d υ and the external disturbance is taken the same as subsection 4 1 in case 2 the perturbations of model parameters are taken the same as case 1 and the external disturbance is taken as d j t ψ b ϖ where ϖ is taken as 0 8 sin 0 02 π t π 4 cos 0 01 π t 0 8 cos 0 02 π t π 8 sin 0 05 π t 0 8 sin 0 01 π t π 3 cos 0 01 π t in simulation the design parameters and initial states are consistent with the one given in table 2 simulation results and quantization indexes under control laws τ c and τ co are shown in figs 3 and 4 and table 3 respectively figs 5 and 6 present the tracking errors and control input under the state feedback and output feedback control schemes which indicates that our proposed schemes are effective even if there exist the perturbation of model parameters and external disturbances in addition it can be found from table 3 that the control performance decreases with the increase of uncertainties including parameter perturbation and external disturbances moreover from the index of tables 2 and 3 the influence of parameter perturbation on tracking control accuracy is slight compared with the parameter perturbation the influence of perturbation on tracking control accuracy is relatively larger from tables 2 and 3 and figs 3 b and 4 b it can be found that the index of miac becomes larger with the increase of uncertainties including parameter perturbation and external disturbances which is reasonable and in accordance with nautical practice 5 conclusion in this paper we have addressed the robust adaptive trajectory tracking control problem for msvs subject to nonparametric uncertainties and external disturbances under input saturation in the control design the gef is applied to replace the non smooth saturation nonlinearity for the convenience of control design and the lumped uncertain term including unknown vessel dynamic and external disturbances is formulated by the linear parameterization like form with a single unknown parameter based on the backstepping design tool and the parameter adaptive technique the full state feedback control scheme and the output feedback control scheme are developed via a single parameter learning the theoretical analysis indicates that under our proposed schemes all signals in the closed loop tracking control system are bounded and the steady state compact set of error signals can be made small through appropriate selection of design parameters the simulation results show that the trajectory tracking control of umsvs is reached with better performance under our proposed schemes compared with the existing robust adaptive control scheme and adaptive nn control scheme in the developed trajectory tracking control techniques we only focus on how to reduce the computational load of the control algorithm without emphasizing the efficiency of parameter learning in the future we will discuss the application of some emerging learning techniques such as the finite time learning luan et al 2019 lv et al 2016 and the composite learning pan et al 2017 guo et al 2019 to enhance the control performance of the proposed

20617,a bidirectional gated recurrent units bigru network is proposed for the prediction of wave height during tropical cyclones tc we used a data set of 28 tc events collected from 14 buoys in different environments over the past 9 years we use buoy data and tc data collected from 27 tc events for training and use six different parameters to predict the wave height in different lead time the trained model was used to predict the wave heights of 10 buoys during a new typhoon compared to machine learning models the results illustrate that bigru s predictive performance is stable especially for prediction 24 hours in advance and the model can still be effectively used for real time wave height prediction when the performance of traditional machine learning methods is severely degraded in terms of long term prediction the model s performance exceeds that of existing methods keywords deep learning wave height prediction tropical cyclones bigru 1 introduction accurate wave height prediction plays an essential role in ports marine shipping fisheries and various types of marine operations etc yorucu and katircio lu 2014 wu 2011 agarwal et al 2013 nazir et al 2008 the offshore oil and gas industry has an urgent need for accurate wave height forecasts in the next period of time in order to plan and execute effective operations tropical cyclones also referred to as hurricanes typhoons and cyclones which is one of the most destructive natural disaster in the world has always caused heavy losses to economy and life goldenberg et al 2001 the pacific northwest is the region that produces the most tropical cyclones china is the country most affected by tropical cyclones in the world zhang et al 2009 typhoon transit causes a variety of natural disasters strong winds carry heavy rainfall and huge wind waves causing huge wave heights therefore during typhoons wave height prediction has a very significant role real time prediction can be used for disaster preparation and early evacuation of various offshore operations during typhoons for analyzing the wind induced wave fields empirical methods or semi analytical methods were first used sverdrup and munk 1947 bretschneider 1951 bretschneider and tamaye 1977 donelan et al 1985 but their applicability was limited kamranzad et al 2011 and they depended on the influence of many factors such as other wind systems chang et al 2011 in the past few decades numerical models have been widely used such as wam komen et al 1996 and swan booij et al 1999 are used to predict wave height but because these models require a large number of complex input boundary conditions and detailed geographic information using grid computing from the global to the appropriate target area scale it consumes a lot of computing resources and perform long term calculations wang et al 2018 which not only delays the prediction zamani et al 2008 but is also easily limited when predicting extreme conditions such as typhoons chang et al 2011 in contrast recent data driven models have made a lot of progress in wave height prediction especially using machine learning methods such as using artificial neural networks ann deo and naidu 1998 deo et al 2001 support vector machine svm berbić et al 2017 linear regressions lr deka and prahlada 2012 support vector regression svr savitha et al 2017 extreme learning machine elm savitha et al 2017 k nearest neighbor knn zamani et al 2008 locally weighted regression lwr zamani et al 2008 these models have low computational cost and ability to mine data potential interrelationships some studies have found that machine learning models outperform numerical models for short term wave prediction berbić et al 2017 james et al 2018 browne et al 2007 however research on extreme weather conditions such as the impact of tropical cyclones is very limited while the prediction of wave heights under extreme weather conditions is more crucial for ensuring property and life safety therefore a method for effectively predicting wave heights during tropical cyclones is urgently needed mafi et al mafi and amirinia 2017 applied three soft calculation methods including svm ann and random forest to predict the wave height caused by hurricane the buoy data from 6 locations in the gulf of mexico were used and two hurricanes including hurricane ike and gustav were observed and recorded the model uses 7 parameters for training but this study only involves two typhoons and the data collection period is only 1 month the observation time used in the test is the same as the training observation time so it cannot be proved whether it is effective to predict the wave height caused by the new tropical cyclone chen et al chen 2019 used a buoy data located in hualien to use machine learning methods to make a probabilistic prediction of the typhoon wave height 1 3 hours in advance chen et al chen and wang 2020 used two buoy data combined with meteorological data and typhoon data applied svr model to predict the typhoon wave height 1 3 h in advance wei 2018 developed a model for predicting typhoon induced wave height near coastal areas this study employed various popular data mining models wei et al wei and cheng 2020 used the buoy data in longdong to develop a two step machine learning model to predict the typhoon wind wave 1 6 hours in advance the above related studies have only used data from one or two buoys the scope of the study is very limited and the predicted lead time is short and the practical significance is relatively limited recently deep learning methods have gained many successful applications in the meteorological and marine fields bolton and zanna 2019 ducournau and fablet 2016 lima et al 2017 among many deep learning models long short term memory lstm is very suitable for processing and predicting time series recently there have been studies using lstm for wave height prediction fan et al 2020 used lstm to predict the wave height 6 h in advance pirhooshyaran et al pirhooshyaran and snyder 2020 used lstm to make multi step and multi step predictions hindcasting and feature selection of ocean wave parameters gated recurrent units gru cho et al 2014 is a popular variant of lstm which replaces the forget gate and the input gate with only one update gate because gru has fewer parameters training is slightly faster and requires few data to generalize and gru achieves the similar performance in multiple tasks with less computation the purpose of this study is to predict the wave height of the next 3 24 hours during the tropical cyclones previous related researches used traditional machine learning methods which did not fully consider the continuity of spatiotemporal sequences bigru can be used to learn and extract the feature expression of data more accurately and to mine the deeper internal expression of historical data it can not only remember the new information but also fully consider the old information making it easier for the model to learn the long term interdependent relationships in the sequence most of the previous studies only used the wave height data of one or two buoys or only involved individual typhoons our research scope involves large areas of the east china sea and the yellow sea in china the number of buoys studied has reached 14 and there are 28 typical tc in the 9 years from 2010 to 2018 which cover a wide range of geographical terrain and locations as well as typhoons with wide wind speeds and wave heights and different levels and paths we tested the model with a brand new typhoon and compared it with ann svm mlr and univariate lstm models section 2 introduces the buoy data and typhoon data we used and section 3 describes the method used and the construction of bidirectional gru model in section 4 based on the data of 27 tcs and 14 buoys the training model predicts wave heights of 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h the finally trained model is applied to the wave heights prediction of 10 buoys passed by the super typhoon kong rey in 2018 and used different methods to compare the performance and accuracy of the results section 5 conclusions are summarized 2 materials fig 1 shows the geographic scope of this study and the location of 14 buoys 38 45 35 n 29 45 14 n 124 00 00 e 119 35 13 e specific areas include sea area near zhangzi island in

2019 2020 was collected from china scientific data website http www csdata org p 405 the data contains the observation data of the maximum wind speed and direction the minimum pressure and the maximum wave height obtained by each buoy during the passage of the typhoon at the huanghai station and the east china sea station from 2010 to 2018 all the wave heights mentioned in this study refer to the significant wave heights the best track data of typhoon ying et al 2014 adopts the data released by china meteorological administration http tcdata typhoon org cn fig 2 shows the trajectories of 28 typhoons involved in this research table 1 lists the typhoon events involved in this research including the name central pressure hpa maximum sustained wind speed km h and data acquisition buoys among them peak classification is the tropical cyclone classification level when the tropical cyclone reaches its maximum intensity sustained wind speed refers to the maximum sustained wind speed which is a common indicator to measure the intensity of a storm specifically the average value is obtained by measuring the location 10 meters above the surface for 10 minutes in terms of data acquisition buoy it means the number of the buoy that records the tropical cyclone table 2 summary of buoys data these statistical results are the statistics of the data obtained by each buoy used in this study the aforementioned data were organized and processed with interpolation and supplementing the tropical cyclones data and buoy data were considered simultaneously divide the data into two parts which are training data and test data we normalize the data and input it into the neural network we used the 10 buoys obtained by the last typhoon namely kong rey in the data set as the test data to simulate the effect of the model on the arrival of the new typhoon and other data as the training set 3 method bigru algorithms recurrent neural network rnn is a kind of neural network for processing sequence data the basic neural network only establishes weight connection between layers the biggest difference of rnn is that weight connection is also established between neurons between layers with the continuous advancement of sequence the hidden layer in front affects the hidden layer in the back because rnn particularly depends on sequence or time rnn processes the time steps of the input sequence in sequence and disrupting the time steps completely changes the extraction representation of rnn from the sequence bi directional rnn uses this idea to improve the performance of unidirctional rnn as shown in fig 3 each rnn processes the input sequence in one direction that is the time sequence is positive and the time sequence is negative and then they are combined together this method looks at the data from two directions basically bidirectional rnn can be thought of as two rnns in a network one is moving forwards in time and the other one is moving backward and both are contributing to producing prediction this method provides a new perspective for viewing data and can extract the contents of data that are ignored by other methods so bidirectional rnn can capture patterns that may be ignored by unidirectional rnn gru is a widely used variant of rnn at present gru uses gating mechanism to effectively alleviate the problem of gradient disappearance and the network can better remember the long term dependence problem fig 5 is the structural diagram of a gru unit there are only two gates called an update gate r t and a reset gate z t the update gate controls how much information from the previous hidden state will carry over to the current hidden state the reset gate mainly determines how much information will be forgotten which represents the importance of the previous hidden state to the current hidden state long ago information can be retained and information affecting training can be deleted as shown in fig 5 when the gru unit calculates forward it will first take the last transmitted state ht 1 and the current input x t as inputs the equations of gru are described as followed 1 z t σ w z h t 1 x t r t σ w r h t 1 x t h t tanh w r t h t 1 x t h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where w r w and w z represent weight matrix σ represents sigmoid activation function ranging from 0 to 1 to control how much information passes through both gates use the sigmoid function to help update and filter data information because any number multiplied by 0 is 0 which will cause the value to disappear or be forgotten multiplying any number by 1 is the same value so the value remains the same or remains the same through the sigmod function network it can be understood which data is not significant to discard or which significant data needs to be maintained and it use the tanh activation function to shrink the data to the range from 1 to 1 the overall architecture of bigru used is shown in fig 4 which consists of two unidirectional oppositely oriented grus and they are connected to the same output layer therefore the output layer has complete past and future information of each point in the input sequence and can fuse more sequence information the following equations define the corresponding hidden layer function and the and denote the forward and backward process respectively 2 z t σ w z h t 1 x t r t σ w r h t 1 x t h t tanh w r t h t 1 x t h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t 3 z t σ w z h t 1 x t r t σ w r h t 1 x t h t tanh w r t h t 1 x t h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t the current hidden layer state of bigru is determined by the input x t at the current time t the hidden layer state output h t 1 at time t 1 and the output h t 1 of the reverse hidden layer state because bigru could be considered as two unidirectional grus the hidden layer state of bigru at time t is obtained by weighted summation of the forward hidden layer state h t 1 and the reverse hidden layer state h t 1 finally the vectors generated by the forward and backward processes are concatenated to obtain the complete bigru hidden element representation h t and the formula is as follows 4 h t h t h t fig 6 shows the flow chart of the wave height model used in this study first we cleaned the buoy data and tropical cyclone data to remove some missing data and based on the buoy data we merged the data at the same time point then linearly interpolated the acquired data to get the training set and calculated the distance between the typhoon center and each buoy by longitude and latitude the following is a detailed description of the method of filling missing values and interpolating data the missing values filled are the missing values existing in the buoy data these missing values are very few and do not affect the overall data the method of fill is to directly fill in the mean value of the two time points before and after we interpolate the tropical cyclone best track data based on the buoy data since the wave height data is collected every 10 minutes or 20 minutes and the best track data of tropical cyclones is collected every 3 hours or 6 hours our method is to first match the best track data of the tropical cyclone with the data of the buoy at the same time point due to the low time resolution of tropical cyclones only tropical cyclone related data will be missing the missing values of tropical cyclones are linearly interpolated according to the time resolution of the buoy data through many previous related studies mafi and amirinia 2017 hashim et al 2016 fernández et al 2015 nitsure et al 2012 the main factors affecting wave height are previous wave height wind speed and air pressure etc we selected six parameters namely wave height air pressure and wind speed obtained by buoys the lowest pressure in the center of typhoons and real time wind speed and the calculated distance between typhoon center and buoy as the model input we used the first 27 captured tropical cyclones as training input during the training process the predicted value obtained by forward propagation is compared with the true value and the loss function is reduced by updating the model parameters by backward propagation this process will gradually narrow the gap between the predicted value and the true value 4 performance study table 3 shows the specific parameters of the five algorithms used in this study s 0 represents the number of input layer units s 1 represents the number of hidden layer units in particular s 11 represents the first hidden layer unit number s 12 represents the second hidden layer unit number g represents the learning rate and optimizer represents the type of optimizer used kernel specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm tol is the tolerance for stopping criterion gamma is the kernel confidence eps is the upper limit of regression c is the regularization parameter to evaluate the performance of our proposed model statistical and standardized indicators are used including correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and scatter index si among them si can be measure the percentage of rmse difference with respect to mean observation the mathematical formulations of these assessment metrics are given as follows 5 r i n x i x y i y i n x i x 2 i n y i y 2 6 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 7 r m s e i n x i y i 2 n 8 s i r m s e x where x i is the observed value y i is the predicted values x is the mean observed values y is the mean predicted values and n is the number of observations tables 4 7 show the comparison of error indices of different models in different lead times and we display the best results in bold we can observe that the bigru model has the best effect except the linear regression with 6 hours lead time especially in the prediction with 24 hours lead time and the indicators are obviously better than the other four comparative models which indicates that bigru can make better long term prediction fig 7 intuitively shows the performance of different algorithms in different error indexes in the same lead time and fig 7a shows the changes of mae of all methods as can be observed that although mae of bigru algorithm is similar to unilstm and lr in 3 hours and 6 hours in advance mae differs by about 0 2 after 12 hours and the effect of svm is not satisfactory fig 7b and c show rmse and si with different lead times respectively it can be found that the traditional method has little change in the short term of 3 hours and 6 hours but the effect of long term prediction is seriously attenuated bigru is relatively stable and the long term prediction effect is acceptable fig 7d shows the change of correlation coefficient with the increase of lead time the correlation coefficient of all algorithms gradually decreases it is worth noting that the correlation coefficient of bigru remains above 0 8 for 24 hours in advance figs 8 11 show the comparison between the real values of buoy no 11 buoy no 17 buoy no 18 and buoy no 20 in different lead times and the predicted values of the experimental algorithm we have chosen two buoys in two sea areas among which buoy no 11 and buoy no 20 are in the east china sea and buoy no 17 and buoy no 18 are in the yellow sea we can observe that the predictions made by the four buoys three hours in advance are well trained which can basically fit the changing trend of wave height however we can notice that the predicted values of ann algorithm and svm in figs 9a and 10a have an upward trend in the late period of typhoon transit and in fig 10a our bilstm algorithm has sequence autocorrelation in the prediction 6 hours ahead of schedule we know from table 5 that the linear regression algorithm has achieved the best results but we can see from the images that the prediction of linear regression on all buoys has autocorrelation with the observed values and we have not learned the trend of sequence change at the same time we can notice that bigru algorithm can well predict the trend of wave height change which is very important in practical application in theprediction of 12 hours and 24 hours in advance we can intuitively find that there are big differences between the prediction and true values of various algorithms compared with other algorithms it is basically impossible to predict the wave height normally bigru has the best overall fitting effect and can predict the changing trend of wave height more accurately in a long time in advance but it can be found that the prediction results are not stable and robust especially after tropical cyclones transit the predicted values still rise in the initial stage of prediction there is a phenomenon that there is a big difference between the predicted value and the true value because of the lack of sufficient information we can find in fig 10 that the model can hardly predict the bimodal phenomenon after 3 hours but can only predict the overall trend which may be related to the absence of this phenomenon in the training set since our proposed model is more effective for long term forecasting we will describe it in more detail bigru can predict the overall trend especially for the size and time point of the peak prediction compared with other machine learning models it has a great improvment the size of the peak value after 24 hours and the time point when the peak value occurs we believe that these two indicators are the most important indicators in disaster forecasting when we carefully analyze the images of these four buoys we can find that the prediction stability of the other methods is proor and there are some phenomenon that the prediction peak is small and the prediction is lagging as shown in figs 8 11 in the 24 hour forecast results some predicted values deviated greatly from the actual values at different positions for all the four buoys for the buoys 11 17 18 and 20 the position of its over fitting is essentially an abnormal rise in the predicted data we find that the reasons for this phenomenon are as follows since we input the distance between the tropical cyclone and the buoy the wind speed of the tropical cyclone and the lowest central pressure as important parameters into the model if the intensity of the tropical cyclone increases after passing the buoy it will lead to an increase in the predicted wave height for buoy 11 and buoy 20 we check the data of the tropical cyclone kong rey found that kong ray experienced an increase in intensity at around 0 00 utc on october 5 and the intensity of tc increased after passing the buoy it can be revealed that the intensity of tropical cyclones has a greater impact on the forecast for buoy 17 and buoy 18 the latitude is relatively high the intensity of kong ray began to increase again at 0 00 utc on october 7 which caused the predicted wave heights of buoys 17 and 18 to increase in the last period of time it can be implyed again that tc intensity is an important parameter of the model it can be further inferred that the bigru model can predict the intensity of tropical cyclones will increase after a period of time fig 13 shows the direct comparison between the predicted and observed values of bigru algorithm with different lead times and the four algorithms involved in this study with the increase of prediction time the correlation of data will decrease and the prediction results of 3 hours are excellent however the prediction results of 24 hours ahead can be found that the prediction of large wave height has a higher degree of dispersion through all the comparison of scatter charts it can be found that the dispersion degree of bigru algorithm is lower than other algorithms in the prediction 24 hours in advance bigru also has many data points with large deviation values however through the comparison between the real values and the predicted values in figs 8 11 it can be known that although the predicted values of many points are quite different the algorithm can better predict the maximum height and variation trend of wave height which is valuable for practical application many previous studies were based on traditional algorithms or machine learning algorithms to predict wave heights with different parameters as inputs özger and şen 2007 kamranzad et al 2011 mafi and amirinia 2017 table 8 summarizes the previous related studies including the comparison of correlation coefficients and si with different lead times different methods and different input parameters because each study has different regions and different specific wave heights we use the two parameters of r and si proposed by mafi et al mafi and amirinia 2017 for comprehensive comparison fig 12 shows the comparison of the evaluation indexes in different lead times between our proposed bigru method and the above methods it can also be found from the comparison charts of these two parameters that our method can well maintain the prediction performance in a longer prediction time 5 conclusion the main purpose of this study is to predict the wave height during the period affected by tropical cyclone by deep learning method this paper proposes to use the bidirectional gru model to fully mine historical information to assist decision making this study used buoys distributed in the south china sea and the east china sea to obtain data during the transit of 28 tropical cyclones at the same time we use the buoy data and tropical cyclone feature data a total of 6 parameters as input to train the deep learning model and predict the wave height 3 24 hours in advance the trained model is used to predict the wave height obtained by buoys distributed in different places and different environments when a new typhoon passes in this paper five different algorithms are used to carry out experiments and four indexes are used to analyze the prediction results at the same time we also compare the results with the previous related research results the results illustrate that all the algorithms can effectively predict the wave height in the 3 hour and 6 hour prediction with the increase of lead time the performance of the algorithms has greatly decreased but bigru algorithm can not only get accurate prediction results in short term prediction but also maintains sound accuracy and stability in the longer term prediction through the visual comparison between the real value and the predicted value the wave height prediction result 24 hours ahead of time is acceptable which can predict the typhoon trend and maximum wave height in advance and can play a role in the actual coastal disaster early warning moreover because the trained deep learning model does not need a lot of computing resources and time like the numerical model it can serve as a fast and effective wave height prediction system during typhoons the deficiency of this work is that the data of different buoys are input into the model as

20617,a bidirectional gated recurrent units bigru network is proposed for the prediction of wave height during tropical cyclones tc we used a data set of 28 tc events collected from 14 buoys in different environments over the past 9 years we use buoy data and tc data collected from 27 tc events for training and use six different parameters to predict the wave height in different lead time the trained model was used to predict the wave heights of 10 buoys during a new typhoon compared to machine learning models the results illustrate that bigru s predictive performance is stable especially for prediction 24 hours in advance and the model can still be effectively used for real time wave height prediction when the performance of traditional machine learning methods is severely degraded in terms of long term prediction the model s performance exceeds that of existing methods keywords deep learning wave height prediction tropical cyclones bigru 1 introduction accurate wave height prediction plays an essential role in ports marine shipping fisheries and various types of marine operations etc yorucu and katircio lu 2014 wu 2011 agarwal et al 2013 nazir et al 2008 the offshore oil and gas industry has an urgent need for accurate wave height forecasts in the next period of time in order to plan and execute effective operations tropical cyclones also referred to as hurricanes typhoons and cyclones which is one of the most destructive natural disaster in the world has always caused heavy losses to economy and life goldenberg et al 2001 the pacific northwest is the region that produces the most tropical cyclones china is the country most affected by tropical cyclones in the world zhang et al 2009 typhoon transit causes a variety of natural disasters strong winds carry heavy rainfall and huge wind waves causing huge wave heights therefore during typhoons wave height prediction has a very significant role real time prediction can be used for disaster preparation and early evacuation of various offshore operations during typhoons for analyzing the wind induced wave fields empirical methods or semi analytical methods were first used sverdrup and munk 1947 bretschneider 1951 bretschneider and tamaye 1977 donelan et al 1985 but their applicability was limited kamranzad et al 2011 and they depended on the influence of many factors such as other wind systems chang et al 2011 in the past few decades numerical models have been widely used such as wam komen et al 1996 and swan booij et al 1999 are used to predict wave height but because these models require a large number of complex input boundary conditions and detailed geographic information using grid computing from the global to the appropriate target area scale it consumes a lot of computing resources and perform long term calculations wang et al 2018 which not only delays the prediction zamani et al 2008 but is also easily limited when predicting extreme conditions such as typhoons chang et al 2011 in contrast recent data driven models have made a lot of progress in wave height prediction especially using machine learning methods such as using artificial neural networks ann deo and naidu 1998 deo et al 2001 support vector machine svm berbić et al 2017 linear regressions lr deka and prahlada 2012 support vector regression svr savitha et al 2017 extreme learning machine elm savitha et al 2017 k nearest neighbor knn zamani et al 2008 locally weighted regression lwr zamani et al 2008 these models have low computational cost and ability to mine data potential interrelationships some studies have found that machine learning models outperform numerical models for short term wave prediction berbić et al 2017 james et al 2018 browne et al 2007 however research on extreme weather conditions such as the impact of tropical cyclones is very limited while the prediction of wave heights under extreme weather conditions is more crucial for ensuring property and life safety therefore a method for effectively predicting wave heights during tropical cyclones is urgently needed mafi et al mafi and amirinia 2017 applied three soft calculation methods including svm ann and random forest to predict the wave height caused by hurricane the buoy data from 6 locations in the gulf of mexico were used and two hurricanes including hurricane ike and gustav were observed and recorded the model uses 7 parameters for training but this study only involves two typhoons and the data collection period is only 1 month the observation time used in the test is the same as the training observation time so it cannot be proved whether it is effective to predict the wave height caused by the new tropical cyclone chen et al chen 2019 used a buoy data located in hualien to use machine learning methods to make a probabilistic prediction of the typhoon wave height 1 3 hours in advance chen et al chen and wang 2020 used two buoy data combined with meteorological data and typhoon data applied svr model to predict the typhoon wave height 1 3 h in advance wei 2018 developed a model for predicting typhoon induced wave height near coastal areas this study employed various popular data mining models wei et al wei and cheng 2020 used the buoy data in longdong to develop a two step machine learning model to predict the typhoon wind wave 1 6 hours in advance the above related studies have only used data from one or two buoys the scope of the study is very limited and the predicted lead time is short and the practical significance is relatively limited recently deep learning methods have gained many successful applications in the meteorological and marine fields bolton and zanna 2019 ducournau and fablet 2016 lima et al 2017 among many deep learning models long short term memory lstm is very suitable for processing and predicting time series recently there have been studies using lstm for wave height prediction fan et al 2020 used lstm to predict the wave height 6 h in advance pirhooshyaran et al pirhooshyaran and snyder 2020 used lstm to make multi step and multi step predictions hindcasting and feature selection of ocean wave parameters gated recurrent units gru cho et al 2014 is a popular variant of lstm which replaces the forget gate and the input gate with only one update gate because gru has fewer parameters training is slightly faster and requires few data to generalize and gru achieves the similar performance in multiple tasks with less computation the purpose of this study is to predict the wave height of the next 3 24 hours during the tropical cyclones previous related researches used traditional machine learning methods which did not fully consider the continuity of spatiotemporal sequences bigru can be used to learn and extract the feature expression of data more accurately and to mine the deeper internal expression of historical data it can not only remember the new information but also fully consider the old information making it easier for the model to learn the long term interdependent relationships in the sequence most of the previous studies only used the wave height data of one or two buoys or only involved individual typhoons our research scope involves large areas of the east china sea and the yellow sea in china the number of buoys studied has reached 14 and there are 28 typical tc in the 9 years from 2010 to 2018 which cover a wide range of geographical terrain and locations as well as typhoons with wide wind speeds and wave heights and different levels and paths we tested the model with a brand new typhoon and compared it with ann svm mlr and univariate lstm models section 2 introduces the buoy data and typhoon data we used and section 3 describes the method used and the construction of bidirectional gru model in section 4 based on the data of 27 tcs and 14 buoys the training model predicts wave heights of 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h the finally trained model is applied to the wave heights prediction of 10 buoys passed by the super typhoon kong rey in 2018 and used different methods to compare the performance and accuracy of the results section 5 conclusions are summarized 2 materials fig 1 shows the geographic scope of this study and the location of 14 buoys 38 45 35 n 29 45 14 n 124 00 00 e 119 35 13 e specific areas include sea area near zhangzi island in north yellow sea 1 off shore area of shandong in yellow sea 07 09 17 18 and 19 and sea area from yangtze river estuary to the zhoushan archipelago 06 11 14 12 13 14 15 and 20 the data wangle et al 2019 2020 was collected from china scientific data website http www csdata org p 405 the data contains the observation data of the maximum wind speed and direction the minimum pressure and the maximum wave height obtained by each buoy during the passage of the typhoon at the huanghai station and the east china sea station from 2010 to 2018 all the wave heights mentioned in this study refer to the significant wave heights the best track data of typhoon ying et al 2014 adopts the data released by china meteorological administration http tcdata typhoon org cn fig 2 shows the trajectories of 28 typhoons involved in this research table 1 lists the typhoon events involved in this research including the name central pressure hpa maximum sustained wind speed km h and data acquisition buoys among them peak classification is the tropical cyclone classification level when the tropical cyclone reaches its maximum intensity sustained wind speed refers to the maximum sustained wind speed which is a common indicator to measure the intensity of a storm specifically the average value is obtained by measuring the location 10 meters above the surface for 10 minutes in terms of data acquisition buoy it means the number of the buoy that records the tropical cyclone table 2 summary of buoys data these statistical results are the statistics of the data obtained by each buoy used in this study the aforementioned data were organized and processed with interpolation and supplementing the tropical cyclones data and buoy data were considered simultaneously divide the data into two parts which are training data and test data we normalize the data and input it into the neural network we used the 10 buoys obtained by the last typhoon namely kong rey in the data set as the test data to simulate the effect of the model on the arrival of the new typhoon and other data as the training set 3 method bigru algorithms recurrent neural network rnn is a kind of neural network for processing sequence data the basic neural network only establishes weight connection between layers the biggest difference of rnn is that weight connection is also established between neurons between layers with the continuous advancement of sequence the hidden layer in front affects the hidden layer in the back because rnn particularly depends on sequence or time rnn processes the time steps of the input sequence in sequence and disrupting the time steps completely changes the extraction representation of rnn from the sequence bi directional rnn uses this idea to improve the performance of unidirctional rnn as shown in fig 3 each rnn processes the input sequence in one direction that is the time sequence is positive and the time sequence is negative and then they are combined together this method looks at the data from two directions basically bidirectional rnn can be thought of as two rnns in a network one is moving forwards in time and the other one is moving backward and both are contributing to producing prediction this method provides a new perspective for viewing data and can extract the contents of data that are ignored by other methods so bidirectional rnn can capture patterns that may be ignored by unidirectional rnn gru is a widely used variant of rnn at present gru uses gating mechanism to effectively alleviate the problem of gradient disappearance and the network can better remember the long term dependence problem fig 5 is the structural diagram of a gru unit there are only two gates called an update gate r t and a reset gate z t the update gate controls how much information from the previous hidden state will carry over to the current hidden state the reset gate mainly determines how much information will be forgotten which represents the importance of the previous hidden state to the current hidden state long ago information can be retained and information affecting training can be deleted as shown in fig 5 when the gru unit calculates forward it will first take the last transmitted state ht 1 and the current input x t as inputs the equations of gru are described as followed 1 z t σ w z h t 1 x t r t σ w r h t 1 x t h t tanh w r t h t 1 x t h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where w r w and w z represent weight matrix σ represents sigmoid activation function ranging from 0 to 1 to control how much information passes through both gates use the sigmoid function to help update and filter data information because any number multiplied by 0 is 0 which will cause the value to disappear or be forgotten multiplying any number by 1 is the same value so the value remains the same or remains the same through the sigmod function network it can be understood which data is not significant to discard or which significant data needs to be maintained and it use the tanh activation function to shrink the data to the range from 1 to 1 the overall architecture of bigru used is shown in fig 4 which consists of two unidirectional oppositely oriented grus and they are connected to the same output layer therefore the output layer has complete past and future information of each point in the input sequence and can fuse more sequence information the following equations define the corresponding hidden layer function and the and denote the forward and backward process respectively 2 z t σ w z h t 1 x t r t σ w r h t 1 x t h t tanh w r t h t 1 x t h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t 3 z t σ w z h t 1 x t r t σ w r h t 1 x t h t tanh w r t h t 1 x t h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t the current hidden layer state of bigru is determined by the input x t at the current time t the hidden layer state output h t 1 at time t 1 and the output h t 1 of the reverse hidden layer state because bigru could be considered as two unidirectional grus the hidden layer state of bigru at time t is obtained by weighted summation of the forward hidden layer state h t 1 and the reverse hidden layer state h t 1 finally the vectors generated by the forward and backward processes are concatenated to obtain the complete bigru hidden element representation h t and the formula is as follows 4 h t h t h t fig 6 shows the flow chart of the wave height model used in this study first we cleaned the buoy data and tropical cyclone data to remove some missing data and based on the buoy data we merged the data at the same time point then linearly interpolated the acquired data to get the training set and calculated the distance between the typhoon center and each buoy by longitude and latitude the following is a detailed description of the method of filling missing values and interpolating data the missing values filled are the missing values existing in the buoy data these missing values are very few and do not affect the overall data the method of fill is to directly fill in the mean value of the two time points before and after we interpolate the tropical cyclone best track data based on the buoy data since the wave height data is collected every 10 minutes or 20 minutes and the best track data of tropical cyclones is collected every 3 hours or 6 hours our method is to first match the best track data of the tropical cyclone with the data of the buoy at the same time point due to the low time resolution of tropical cyclones only tropical cyclone related data will be missing the missing values of tropical cyclones are linearly interpolated according to the time resolution of the buoy data through many previous related studies mafi and amirinia 2017 hashim et al 2016 fernández et al 2015 nitsure et al 2012 the main factors affecting wave height are previous wave height wind speed and air pressure etc we selected six parameters namely wave height air pressure and wind speed obtained by buoys the lowest pressure in the center of typhoons and real time wind speed and the calculated distance between typhoon center and buoy as the model input we used the first 27 captured tropical cyclones as training input during the training process the predicted value obtained by forward propagation is compared with the true value and the loss function is reduced by updating the model parameters by backward propagation this process will gradually narrow the gap between the predicted value and the true value 4 performance study table 3 shows the specific parameters of the five algorithms used in this study s 0 represents the number of input layer units s 1 represents the number of hidden layer units in particular s 11 represents the first hidden layer unit number s 12 represents the second hidden layer unit number g represents the learning rate and optimizer represents the type of optimizer used kernel specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm tol is the tolerance for stopping criterion gamma is the kernel confidence eps is the upper limit of regression c is the regularization parameter to evaluate the performance of our proposed model statistical and standardized indicators are used including correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and scatter index si among them si can be measure the percentage of rmse difference with respect to mean observation the mathematical formulations of these assessment metrics are given as follows 5 r i n x i x y i y i n x i x 2 i n y i y 2 6 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 7 r m s e i n x i y i 2 n 8 s i r m s e x where x i is the observed value y i is the predicted values x is the mean observed values y is the mean predicted values and n is the number of observations tables 4 7 show the comparison of error indices of different models in different lead times and we display the best results in bold we can observe that the bigru model has the best effect except the linear regression with 6 hours lead time especially in the prediction with 24 hours lead time and the indicators are obviously better than the other four comparative models which indicates that bigru can make better long term prediction fig 7 intuitively shows the performance of different algorithms in different error indexes in the same lead time and fig 7a shows the changes of mae of all methods as can be observed that although mae of bigru algorithm is similar to unilstm and lr in 3 hours and 6 hours in advance mae differs by about 0 2 after 12 hours and the effect of svm is not satisfactory fig 7b and c show rmse and si with different lead times respectively it can be found that the traditional method has little change in the short term of 3 hours and 6 hours but the effect of long term prediction is seriously attenuated bigru is relatively stable and the long term prediction effect is acceptable fig 7d shows the change of correlation coefficient with the increase of lead time the correlation coefficient of all algorithms gradually decreases it is worth noting that the correlation coefficient of bigru remains above 0 8 for 24 hours in advance figs 8 11 show the comparison between the real values of buoy no 11 buoy no 17 buoy no 18 and buoy no 20 in different lead times and the predicted values of the experimental algorithm we have chosen two buoys in two sea areas among which buoy no 11 and buoy no 20 are in the east china sea and buoy no 17 and buoy no 18 are in the yellow sea we can observe that the predictions made by the four buoys three hours in advance are well trained which can basically fit the changing trend of wave height however we can notice that the predicted values of ann algorithm and svm in figs 9a and 10a have an upward trend in the late period of typhoon transit and in fig 10a our bilstm algorithm has sequence autocorrelation in the prediction 6 hours ahead of schedule we know from table 5 that the linear regression algorithm has achieved the best results but we can see from the images that the prediction of linear regression on all buoys has autocorrelation with the observed values and we have not learned the trend of sequence change at the same time we can notice that bigru algorithm can well predict the trend of wave height change which is very important in practical application in theprediction of 12 hours and 24 hours in advance we can intuitively find that there are big differences between the prediction and true values of various algorithms compared with other algorithms it is basically impossible to predict the wave height normally bigru has the best overall fitting effect and can predict the changing trend of wave height more accurately in a long time in advance but it can be found that the prediction results are not stable and robust especially after tropical cyclones transit the predicted values still rise in the initial stage of prediction there is a phenomenon that there is a big difference between the predicted value and the true value because of the lack of sufficient information we can find in fig 10 that the model can hardly predict the bimodal phenomenon after 3 hours but can only predict the overall trend which may be related to the absence of this phenomenon in the training set since our proposed model is more effective for long term forecasting we will describe it in more detail bigru can predict the overall trend especially for the size and time point of the peak prediction compared with other machine learning models it has a great improvment the size of the peak value after 24 hours and the time point when the peak value occurs we believe that these two indicators are the most important indicators in disaster forecasting when we carefully analyze the images of these four buoys we can find that the prediction stability of the other methods is proor and there are some phenomenon that the prediction peak is small and the prediction is lagging as shown in figs 8 11 in the 24 hour forecast results some predicted values deviated greatly from the actual values at different positions for all the four buoys for the buoys 11 17 18 and 20 the position of its over fitting is essentially an abnormal rise in the predicted data we find that the reasons for this phenomenon are as follows since we input the distance between the tropical cyclone and the buoy the wind speed of the tropical cyclone and the lowest central pressure as important parameters into the model if the intensity of the tropical cyclone increases after passing the buoy it will lead to an increase in the predicted wave height for buoy 11 and buoy 20 we check the data of the tropical cyclone kong rey found that kong ray experienced an increase in intensity at around 0 00 utc on october 5 and the intensity of tc increased after passing the buoy it can be revealed that the intensity of tropical cyclones has a greater impact on the forecast for buoy 17 and buoy 18 the latitude is relatively high the intensity of kong ray began to increase again at 0 00 utc on october 7 which caused the predicted wave heights of buoys 17 and 18 to increase in the last period of time it can be implyed again that tc intensity is an important parameter of the model it can be further inferred that the bigru model can predict the intensity of tropical cyclones will increase after a period of time fig 13 shows the direct comparison between the predicted and observed values of bigru algorithm with different lead times and the four algorithms involved in this study with the increase of prediction time the correlation of data will decrease and the prediction results of 3 hours are excellent however the prediction results of 24 hours ahead can be found that the prediction of large wave height has a higher degree of dispersion through all the comparison of scatter charts it can be found that the dispersion degree of bigru algorithm is lower than other algorithms in the prediction 24 hours in advance bigru also has many data points with large deviation values however through the comparison between the real values and the predicted values in figs 8 11 it can be known that although the predicted values of many points are quite different the algorithm can better predict the maximum height and variation trend of wave height which is valuable for practical application many previous studies were based on traditional algorithms or machine learning algorithms to predict wave heights with different parameters as inputs özger and şen 2007 kamranzad et al 2011 mafi and amirinia 2017 table 8 summarizes the previous related studies including the comparison of correlation coefficients and si with different lead times different methods and different input parameters because each study has different regions and different specific wave heights we use the two parameters of r and si proposed by mafi et al mafi and amirinia 2017 for comprehensive comparison fig 12 shows the comparison of the evaluation indexes in different lead times between our proposed bigru method and the above methods it can also be found from the comparison charts of these two parameters that our method can well maintain the prediction performance in a longer prediction time 5 conclusion the main purpose of this study is to predict the wave height during the period affected by tropical cyclone by deep learning method this paper proposes to use the bidirectional gru model to fully mine historical information to assist decision making this study used buoys distributed in the south china sea and the east china sea to obtain data during the transit of 28 tropical cyclones at the same time we use the buoy data and tropical cyclone feature data a total of 6 parameters as input to train the deep learning model and predict the wave height 3 24 hours in advance the trained model is used to predict the wave height obtained by buoys distributed in different places and different environments when a new typhoon passes in this paper five different algorithms are used to carry out experiments and four indexes are used to analyze the prediction results at the same time we also compare the results with the previous related research results the results illustrate that all the algorithms can effectively predict the wave height in the 3 hour and 6 hour prediction with the increase of lead time the performance of the algorithms has greatly decreased but bigru algorithm can not only get accurate prediction results in short term prediction but also maintains sound accuracy and stability in the longer term prediction through the visual comparison between the real value and the predicted value the wave height prediction result 24 hours ahead of time is acceptable which can predict the typhoon trend and maximum wave height in advance and can play a role in the actual coastal disaster early warning moreover because the trained deep learning model does not need a lot of computing resources and time like the numerical model it can serve as a fast and effective wave height prediction system during typhoons the deficiency of this work is that the data of different buoys are input into the model as continuous data which makes the data of different buoys interact with each other thus the model learns a lot of irrelevant information future work can focus on designing a step by step deep learning model and inputting data from different buoys into the model step by step to improve prediction accuracy credit authorship contribution statement fan meng conceptualization methodology software

20618,to countermeasure the scouring and tsunami energy reduction this study conducted a series of laboratory experiments where vertically double layered vegetation vdlv was introduced behind the seaward embankment on a gravel bed the experimental results demonstrated that the overtopping flow from the embankment experienced a submerged hydraulic jump over the embankment against all the considered cases the dense vdlv i e dense g d 0 041 where g is the clear gap between the cylinders in the cross stream direction and d is the cylinder diameter short submerged vegetation l1 incorporated within a sparse g d 2 125 tall emergent vegetation l2 influenced the scour phenomena it reduced the relative scoured depth by approximately 29 41 at the embankment toe the maximum scoured depth by approximately 29 37 and the scoured length by approximately 28 34 as compared to that of single embankment system furthermore dense vdlv provided the maximum i e 49 53 loss to the total flow energy the increase in the density of l1 in vdlv offered a larger drag to the flow by shifting the position of the submerged hydraulic jump more towards the embankment top hence consequently resulted in significant reduction of scoured depth scoured length and energy of the tsunami flow keywords sea embankment tsunami overflow erosion scour coastal forest energy loss 1 introduction following the great east japan tsunami gejt in 2011 a large scale tsunami broke numerous coastal structures i e large embankments tsunami gates sea walls etc tappin et al 2012 and caused a fatal damage to the people lives both socioeconomic and household properties as well as the natural structures suppasri et al 2012 tanaka 2012 based on field surveys kato et al 2012 mikami et al 2012 tokida and tanimoto 2014 tanaka and sato 2015 many studies reported that the possible mechanism of the seaward embankment failure was due to the local scouring on the ground since such a massive tsunami is likely to happen in the near future the effective countermeasure against scouring caused by such tsunami is highly important many researches revealed afreen et al 2015 tanaka and sato 2015 takegawa et al 2017 and demonstrated noguchi et al 1997 bricker et al 2012 sassa et al 2016 takegawa et al 2017 the scour process behind an embankment by experimental investigations but the effective design procedure against scour countermeasure along with the reduction of tsunami flow is still limited for scour countermeasure motobe et al 2014 2016 and yoshida et al 2018 did laboratory experiments and concluded that the placement of concrete blocks followed by seaward embankment can allow the overflowing water in stream wise direction and shift the generation of scour hole further downstream from the embankment toe takegawa et al 2019 conducted an experimental study for the scour countermeasures by putting a geogrid over a gravel bed average particle diameter d 50 3 mm starting from the toe of the embankment they clarified that due to the influence of geogrid mainly due to closer mesh size scour holes moves away from the embankment however it is difficult to install geogrid along the coastal regions as vast areas are needed to be filled by gravel beds and the land will be of no further use if the scour hole moves further downstream of embankment it would be dangerous to the downstream structures also the countermeasure against scour by using concrete blocks requires the transportation of heavy construction materials and massive excavation process will increase the construction cost which is not feasible based on the economic point of view in present age the significance of coastal vegetation natural structures as a function of tsunami mitigation has drawn much attention in the research field due to its multipurpose function such as energy loss a smooth landing location and debris trapping shuto 1987 moreover vegetated foreshore can effectively reduce the wave loads on coastal dykes by offering resistance vuik et al 2016 for the mitigation of tsunami energy the coastal forest is being considered as an effective natural protection measure with respect to both environmental and economic aspects tanaka 2009 yanagisawa et al 2010 after a lesson learned from the gejt the mitigation strategy against tsunami inundation is drifting from only sea embankment to hybrid system arrangement of seaward levee and coastal vegetation for instance several studies investigated different types of mitigation systems against tsunamis such as tanaka et al 2006 examined the effect of coastal forest over a sand dune behind the seaward levee fadly and murakami 2013 studied the combination of forest and moat zaha et al 2019 investigated embankment with moat and vegetation an investigation by pasha and tanaka 2017 showed that the maximum energy reduction of tsunami current could be obtained by providing a dense forest with emergent condition but in real scenario it could be difficult to implement a dense forest in the field tanaka et al 2013 clarified that a vertically double layered vegetation vdlv with the combination of p odoratissimus and casuarina equisetifolia in sri lanka was found to be more efficient in tsunami mitigation in addition a post survey reported that vdlv showed significant effectiveness in reducing the damage behind the forest in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami iot in kalutara sri lanka 2005 tanaka et al 2007 some studies on investigating the effectiveness of vdlv have also been performed to countermeasure the disasters caused due to flood flows and tsunamis e g anjum and tanaka 2019a b recently rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 experimentally clarified the mitigation effect of compound system with a combination of a coastal embankment followed by the coastal vegetation the study showed that the different configurations of vdlv short as submerged and tall as emergent can effectively reduce the tsunami energy increase the flow resistance compared to that of single layered vegetation slv and could form different types of hydraulic jumps which further contributes in reduction of the tsunami energy in addition anjum and tanaka 2019c experimentally investigated the effectiveness of discontinued vdlv but there might be space limitation in the coastal regions the previous studies have mainly focused on investigating the flow structures in the hybrid or compound defense structures under rigid bed conditions and they neglected scour phenomena which is very important however there was no research on scour countermeasure behind a sea embankment with the introduction of vdlv against the tsunami flow on a gravel bed has been reported yet thus the main objectives of this study were to study the flow structures and to reduce the scouring behind an embankment with the introduction of vdlv in the downstream to attain such objectives laboratory tests were conducted with the arrangement of an embankment model em followed by coastal vegetation model i e vdlv or slv over a gravel bed under the supercritical flow conditions to justify the effectiveness of vdlv at the back of em a vertically slv was also considered three vdlv configurations were tested by varying porosity of the vegetation model vm against different hydraulic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures physical model experiments were performed in a glass sided flume channel with the dimensions of 5 m long 0 7 m wide and 0 5 m deep with a constant bed slope of 1 200 at saitama university japan the schematic diagram of model setup in the experimental flume is shown in fig 1 i the characteristics of tsunami flow and ground conditions implemented in this experimental study does not imply to any particular locations but were considered generally in the gejt the froude number fr v gh 0 5 where v is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and h is the water depth m in the coastal area was estimated about 1 5 in maximum by the moment of tsunami arrival near the coast of misawa and hachinohe regions in japan nandasena et al 2012 also foytong et al 2013 by video analysis estimated that the froude number of flooding water depth varied from 1 to 1 5 in iwaki and kesennuma city in japan therefore taking those areas as a reference to assure model and replicate the actual tsunami inundations the flow conditions were attained in an empty channel in model scale experiments many studies also attained the flow conditions in an empty channel igarashi and tanaka 2016 pasha and tanaka 2017 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 anjum and tanaka 2019a in addition tsunami flow can be modeled by a pump driven flow aniel quiroga et al 2018 thus the targeted flow conditions were assured in the experimental runs since the tsunami flow was supercritical in coastal regions nandasena et al 2012 foytong et al 2013 therefore a downward facing slope has been selected in order to obtain supercritical flow conditions also sometimes embankments were constructed on a sand dune where the landward slope was downslope tanaka et al 2013 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 rashedunnabi et al 2019 the tsunami flood does not involve the wave crest and continues towards the inland regions with a prolonged time hence the representation of tsunami inundation can be investigated by a quasi steady flow nandasena et al 2012 ali et al 2014 igarashi and tanaka 2016 rahman et al 2020 therefore considering the supercritical and steady inland flow froude number similarity has been employed to decide the flow conditions representing the actual tsunami inundation in this experiments four initial froude numbers fr v o gh o 0 5 where v o is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and h o is the initial water depth m of 1 28 1 33 1 38 and 1 44 were selected under the supercritical flow conditions to select the initial flow conditions i e initial water depths h o and initial froude numbers fr the discharges have been selected by the flow meter of the channel signet 8150 flow totalizer against every discharge the water depth was measured along the center of the channel by a roller mounted point gauge depending on the variation of the water surface with an interval of 2 cm 10 cm therefore four average initial water depths and the initial froude numbers were selected corresponding to each known discharge the depth averaged velocity was calculated by utilizing the continuity equation v q hb where q is the discharge m3 s h is the water depth m and b is the flume width m against the known discharge after installing the em the initial froude numbers resulted in the overflowing water depths of 2 32 2 9 3 77 and 4 93 cm respectively at the crest of the em for the bed materials as a soil layer gravel particle with a median grain size d 50 of 4 47 mm and dry density ρ s of 2650 kg m3 was selected due to the higher threshold value for scouring by the cohesive soil material as a bed the local souring occurred around the coastal dikes and trees at clear water condition in gejt bricker et al 2012 ali and tanaka 2020 many researchers have performed the laboratory investigations under clear water sour conditions by taking grain size of 4 5 mm as bed material for the soil layer to attain the maximum scouring lenzi and comiti 2003 pagliara 2007 afreen et al 2015 ali and tanaka 2020 therefore the grain size of the bed material has been selected to maintain the scouring at clear water condition for which the similarity law is not applicable the gravel bed was placed starting from the toe of the em to the further downstream with an area of 4 m in length 0 7 m wide and 0 23 m deep a wooden flat plate having the same depth of soil layer was placed at the end of the channel as a support to prevent the washout of the soil layer during the flow from the backend of the vm the distance of the flat plate was kept approximately 3 25 m in which the data was taken up to 2 m from the backend of the vm and a sufficient distance in the downstream region i e approximately 1 25 m was also made available ignored for measurement to eliminate the influence of the flat wooden plate at the end of flume channel the scouring phenomena depends much on the characteristic of soil bed layer i e cohesive and non cohesive material in terms of water soil bed interaction since it is very difficult to use cohesive material as a soil layer in model scale experiments many researchers adopted non cohesive particles as a soil layer in context of scouring study mitobe et al 2014 2016 yoshida et al 2018 takegawa et al 2019 ali and tanaka 2020 however the selection of particle size is an important factor when a non cohesive particle is being used as a soil layer another important factor is the scour development for a specific particle size the maximum scouring for a specific non cohesive particle can be obtained when the scouring reaches an equilibrium condition takegawa et al 2019 ali and tanaka 2020 due to this reason the overflow duration in this study has been selected when the scoured depths reached the equilibrium stage the development of scouring s m maximum scoured depth with respect to the overflow duration in seconds for case 1 of fr 1 44 during the trial experiment is presented in fig 1iv it can be clearly seen that the equilibrium scoured depth can be achieved after the overflow duration from em was around 160 s 2 min 40 s in the actual physical scale of 1 100 it was around 1600 s considering the froude similarity law of physical scale the duration of overflowing water can be occurred in an actual tsunami so the equilibrium state should be reproduced in the study since the objective of this study was to reduce the maximum scouring with the introduction of vdlv this overflow duration was selected after doing several trial cases to obtain the maximum scouring in the trial cases no significant variation of the scour profile was confirmed after this overflow duration fig 1iv the whole experiment during the flow duration was recorded with hd high definition video camera olympus tg 835 with a frame rate of 1 30 the elevation of the water surface was measured by video analysis because the flow structures were very complex within the defense system and oscillation of the water surface and duration of the experiment was small the minimum and maximum depths were measured in multiple consecutive frames at a fixed point upon the variations in water surface and subsequently averaged however since the total duration of the experiment was small only the water depth at section 1 section 2 section 3 and section 4 fig 1ii was measured with two roller mounted point gauges along the center of the channel operated by two persons after completion of the experiments the scour properties of the gravel bed were measured with a one dimensional laser displacement meter keyence lk 500 the measurement interval of the data is 1 5 5 cm based on the variations of the gravel bed in both the cross sectional and the longitudinal directions 2 2 model design and conditions of vegetation model vm in this flume experiments a physical model scale of 1 100 was selected for the experimental models after the gejt an innovative coastal dyke system has been planned alongside the coast of fukushima miyagi and iwate prefectures in japan including increasing the height and or reconstruction of coastal dykes strusinska 2017 where the proposed height of coastal dykes in koizumi in miyagi prefecture is around 14 5 m for this instance the embankment height was scaled down to 14 5 cm height 64 cm width and side slope of 1 2 representing an embankment height of 14 5 m in the fukushima miyagi and iwate prefectures in japan rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 rahman et al 2020 in coastal areas the seaward embankment are generally made of concrete and or protected by concrete igarashi and tanaka 2016 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 rahman et al 2020 sometimes to prevent seepage a short pile sheet was provided at the toe of the embankment thus in context of the scouring studies followed by afreen et al 2015 and takegawa et al 2019 the foundation of the embankment was considered as fixed and em was placed above the fixed bed and the seepage phenomena beneath the em was ignored however if the em would have been placed over a soil layer both the scour and the flow phenomena may be slightly different compared with the results obtained in this study since the foundation of the em was considered as fixed bed which is an impermeable soil solid plate the associated effects were ignored further studies can be however considered to clarify this effect by making the foundation of the em as a soil layer as for the vms the japanese pine tree with median height of 15 m and diameter of 40 cm was available in sendai plain japan tanaka 2012 was taken as a reference tree referring to the previous study iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha et al 2017 the trees were modeled by wooden cylinders having diameter d of 0 4 cm the cylinders in vms were designed in a staggered arrangement in the gejt the trees having diameter larger than 0 4 m were found unbroken tanaka et al 2014 and during the 2004 iot the trees having diameter more than 0 3 m were also observed to be unbroken therefore the tall cylinders l2 in both slv and vdlv were modeled as circular wooden cylinders with a diameter of 0 4 cm and height of 20 cm in vdlv the short cylinder with a height of 5 cm was taken as submerged vegetation l1 pandanus odoratissimus in tropical region and pittosporum tobira in temperate region trees grow with dense areal roots and a complex structure that offers a significant moment of the drag force tanaka et al 2007 both trees are representative trees in the coastal areas tanaka et al 2007 in real situation when tsunami inundation appears less than 5 m high p odoratissimus was found to be more effective tanaka et al 2007 thuy et al 2018 therefore the height of l1 in all vdlv was taken as 5 cm from the ground level considering 5 m in real scale for enhancing the potentiality of the defense system as scour countermeasure along with tsunami mitigation in this experiment three vertically double layer vms was constructed on a wooden plate by inserting a short layer l1 within a sparse tall layer l2 and was arranged in a staggered arrangement the layers in vdlv models were divided by varying the porosity pr of vm the porosities of l1 were 0 78 dense 0 91 intermediate and 0 95 partially intermediate whereas the porosity of l2 was fixed i e 0 98 the porosity of l2 in slv was also kept constant i e 0 98 the models were constructed with long cylinders so that the bed materials can be inserted easily the density of each models was represented by g d value where g clear gap between the cylinders in cross stream direction d diameter of cylinder the details of vms configurations is presented in fig 1iii and table 1 four different vms were considered i e slv and vldv and were designed by varying condition of porosity density and thickness of vms these models were installed within the gravel bed in the experimental flume covering the full width of the flume as shown fig 1i the width of vegetation w in stream wise direction can be represented by vegetation thickness dn which is a function of cumulative breast height diameter of the trees and is described as a function of the tree diameter at breast height and the number of trees n per unit area m 2 in a rectangle with a frontal unit length along the coast and depth equal to the forest width w pasha and tanaka 2017 referring to shutto 1987 the value of dn in model scale was estimated as follows 1 d n 2 3 d 2 w d where the ratio 2 3 d 2 means the density of the cylinder and 2 means the cylinder numbers included inside a rectangular area under staggered system of arrangement fig 1iii w is the width of the forest d is the distance among the cylinders in transverse direction respectively fig 1iii and the porosity pr of vm is calculated by following iimura and tanaka 2012 2 p r 1 n t π d 2 4 where n t is the density of vegetation based on field surveys matsuba et al 2014 and tanaka and sato 2015 reported that due to the overtopping of tsunami flow in the gejt severe erosion occurred and scoured length were varied from 4 to 31 78 m however the scour properties i e scour length and depth rose when the energy head and the force of the tsunami current increased tanaka and sato 2015 a study by matsuba et al 2014 observed that the trees that were planted in close proximity to the levee on the landslide were displaced and generated a significant amount of floating debris on the other hand the coastal forest that has no gap in between the embankment and forest was entirely destroyed due to overtopping tsunami for this instance in the present study a gap was kept as 0 5 m in between the em and vms considering an effective measure as scour countermeasure and energy reduction of tsunami flow since the embankments in the coastal regions were protected by concrete so em was considered as a fixed bed condition and was placed over the fixed bed in the flume channel at 1 m distance as of the inlet tank both the slv and vdlvs were placed on a gravel bed downstream of the em with a gap of 0 5 m the vms occupied almost full width of the flume channel while keeping a small space amongst the exterior vegetation cylinder and the flume wall several researches jsfm 1998 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 tang et al 2019 showed that to reduce the side wall influence on the water surface profiles the ratio amongst the flume width and the diameter of cylinder should to be larger than 5 for this reason this proportion was maintained to reduce the side wall effect 2 3 non dimensional parameters used in this study in this model scale experiment the physical models of the prototypes were scaled down to reduced sizes considering a model scale of 1 100 to represent the real phenomena under controlled conditions the schematic diagram of the basic flow structure and associated important parameters are shown in fig 1ii and 1iii the following non dimensional groups were derived by adopting the buckingham s pi theorem f p r f r f r 1 f r i f r s g d d n p j p s h t h 0 δ e t e 1 δ e 1 e 1 δ e 3 h 3 0 where pr is the porosity of the vm fr v o gh o 0 5 is the initial froude number fr 1 v 1 gh 1 0 5 is the approach upstream of hydraulic jump froude number of jump fr i v i gh i 0 5 is the averaged froude number within the defense system fr s v s gh s 0 5 is the averaged froude number within the scour hole g is the clear gap of every single cylinder in the cross stream direction d is the diameter of cylinder p j p j s is the non dimensional position of hydraulic jump on the downstream face of the em p j is the position of the hydraulic jump on the downward face of the em s is the space in between the em and the vms p s p s h e p s is the position of the maximum scoured depth h e is the em height h t is the elevation of tail water δ

the vms e 1 is the specific energy at section 1 for a better understanding the defined non dimensional parameters used in this study were further divided into two groups i e group 1 non dimensional parameters which can be manually controlled and group 2 uncontrolled non dimensional parameters based on the experimental results thus group 1 includes pr fr g d dn and group 2 includes f r 1 f r i f r s p j p s h t h 0 δ e t e 1 δ e 1 e 1 δ e 3 h 3 2 4 energy loss to evaluate the effectiveness of the defense system as a function of mitigation from the effect of tsunami the energy head was estimated based on the following equation chow 1959 4 e z y α v 2 2 g where e is the specific energy z is the elevation of the bottom y is the water depth v is the depth averaged velocity and α is the co efficient for calculating the variations in velocity in this study the value of α is considered as 1 for slv whereas it is taken as 1 1 for vdlvs anjum and tanaka 2019c since a hydraulic jump was formed in the gap between the em and vms as well as the downstream of the vms thus the energy loss was subdivided as i total energy loss δ e t e 1 e 4 due to the defense system downstream of vm and ii energy loss due to hydraulic jump inside the defense system δ e 1 e 1 e 2 and energy loss due to the formation of hydraulic jump downstream of vms δ e 1 h 4 h 3 3 4 h 4 h 3 where e 1 e 2 e 3 and e 4 is the specific energy at section 1 in front of jump section 2 downstream of jump section 3 in the undular jumps downstream of vm and section 4 downstream of the vm respectively 3 results 3 1 submerged hydraulic jump and its characteristics fig 2 shows the resulting water surface profiles against the varying condition of initial froude number fr after the placement of models in the flume the representative photos of the scour and water surface profiles are presented in fig 3 within the defense system the overtopping flow experienced a submerged hydraulic jump over the downface of the em slope for all the cases against the considered initial froude numbers the non dimensional position p j p j s of the submerged hydraulic jump toe on the downface slope of the em is shown in fig 4 i two different p j 1 and 1 are described in this study where p j 1 denotes that the jump starts in between the em toe and vm and p j 1 denotes that the jump starts on the downface of the em it can be clearly seen that in all considered cases the starting position of the submerged hydraulic jump lies on the downface of the em slope i e p j 1 in case 1 the p j was much closer to the em toe however when the vms of different configuration were installed followed by an em the p j moved towards the em top upon increasing the fr for the lowest fr of 1 28 the p j was much closer to the em toe but with the further increment of fr the p j moved towards the em top in all the cases a gradually increasing trend of p j was observed in all the cases however the maximum value of p j was witnessed for case 5 i e when a dense vdlv was placed on the gravel bed behind an em whereas minimum values of p j were observed for case 1 for the case 4 and case 5 these results are consistent with rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 as the value of p j increased the approach froude number fr 1 decreased because of gradually varied flow on the downface of em and consequently resulted in a comparatively higher relative elevation of tail water h t h 0 thus a sharp decreasing trend of fr 1 was observed for all the considered cases fig 4ii in comparison to that of slv a comparatively higher h t h 0 was observed in all the vdlv cases fig 4iii 3 2 variation of scour profile 3 2 1 variation of scour profile inside the defense system in all the cases scour starts from the toe of the em and progresses further downstream as shown in figs 2 and 5 which ultimately resulted a significant scour hole the scoured depth increased gradually and after reaching the maximum scoured depth it decreased to the deposition level in all the considered cases for the fr 1 38 to 1 44 the level of deposition of soil particles was greater than the height of l1 in cases 3 to case 5 fig 5 c d e and fig 2 iii iv v whereas in case 2 a comparatively lower deposition of soil particles was observed however the deposition of soil particles reached to ground level about 10 cm just in front of the vm in cases 2 to 5 when fr was 1 28 fig 5 b c d e and fig 2 a variation in resulted scour phenomena within the defense system in the cross stream direction of the flume was observed in all the considered cases against different fr conditions fig 5 the scour profiles and the scour hole were large in case 1 against all fr similar scour profiles were observed by takegawa et al 2019 for case 1 the magnitudes of scour profiles were significantly affected upon varying the different configurations of vm and the vdlv cases reduced more scour compared to that of slv case in addition a noticeable scour reduction is recognized in intermediate vdlv case 4 g d 0 563 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 and dense vdlv case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 in case 5 it can be clearly witnessed that the scour hole at every fr is significantly smaller than that in case 1 3 2 2 scour and or deposition phenomena at the downstream of vm fig 6 illustrates the contour plots of the scour and or deposition phenomena in the downstream of the vms it can be clearly seen that the downstream region of vm was almost undisturbed and no significant scouring and or deposition of soil particles was observed in all the considered cases when fr was 1 28 and 1 33 despite of the fact that some changes in the soil bed was observed due to flow the removed soil particles between the defense system were travelled with the flow and deposited in the downstream region of vm for the fr of 1 33 and 1 44 the travelled soil material was deposited in the downstream in case 2 to 5 just behind the slv model the deposition was lowest and it increased to maximum to further downstream when fr was 1 33 and 1 44 fig 2ii and fig 6b i ii whereas in vdlv cases the lowest point of the deposition in soil particles scouring phenomenon was observed just below the generated hydraulic jumps fig 2c d e and fig 6c d e i ii in case 3 when the fr was 1 44 an undulation of the soil bed was witnessed fig 2c and fig 6cii just beneath the generated hydraulic jump point for the case 5 very small scouring was noticed when the fr was 1 44 3 3 effect of vm in scour characteristics 3 3 1 effect of the porosity of vm on scour characteristics within the defense system with the introduction of vms behind the em as a scour countermeasure the scoured region within defense system was influenced significantly the comparison of scour characteristics is presented in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that the scour characteristics i e scoured depth and scoured length were significantly reduced by the decrease in porosity of l1 the characteristics of scour were lowest in dense vdlv pr 0 78 for l1 and pr 0 98 for l2 as compared to that of the intermediate vldv pr 0 91 for l1 and pr 0 98 for l2 partially intermediate vdlv pr 0 95 for l1 and pr 0 98 for l2 and slv pr 0 98 for l2 this indicates that both the scoured depth and scour length could be significantly influenced with decrement in porosity of l1 this implies that the construction of a submerged layer along with its porosity within an emergent sparse forest plays a significant role in reduced scouring within the defense system 3 3 2 effect of vm on scoured depth the scoured depth is also significantly reduced because of the resistance offered by the vm so the assessment in comparison with single em is needed fig 7 shows the comparison of scoured depth at the toe of the em and the maximum scoured depth caused by the overtopping flow a sharp increasing trend in both the scoured depth at the toe of the em s t and maximum scoured depth s m caused by overtopping flow as shown in fig 7iii and 7i is observed for case 1 with the increase in fr from 1 28 to 1 44 whereas a gradually increasing trend with comparatively lower magnitudes is found for slv and vdlv cases i e case 2 to case 5 in reducing the scoured depth at toe of the em and the maximum scour within the defense system the vdlv cases performed better than slv case against the considered initial flow conditions among the vdlv cases the dense vdlv case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 reduced more scour at the toe of the em as well as within the defense system the vdlv cases and sparse slv case 2 g d 2 125 for l2 reduced the toe scour approximately 12 2 41 and 6 3 26 table 3 in addition the maximum reduction of s t was found to be 29 41 in case 5 compared to that of case 1 on the other hand case 5 reduced the s t approximately 15 24 compared with the case 2 the relative reduction of s m for vdlv cases was found to be 17 1 37 table 4 compared to that of case 1 on the contrary slv reduced s m approximately by 7 2 19 5 the maximum s m was found to be 10 18 cm for case 5 whereas it was 16 cm for case 1 fig 7i when the fr was 1 44 the relative maximum reduction of s m for case 5 varied from approximately 29 37 table 4 against the considered fr compared with the case 1 whereas the corresponding variations were found to be 21 23 compared to that of case 2 in all the cases a sharp increasing trend is witnessed for the non dimensional position p s of the maximum scoured depth s m with the increase in fr from 1 28 to 1 44 fig 7ii however like s t and s m the vdlv cases were effective enough in positioning the p s in all the cases with the increasing in fr the p s moved away from the toe of the em but still lied in the center region which could ensure the safety of the defense structure however when there is no vm i e case 1 the p s moved further downstream compared to the vegetated conditions which might destroy the structures downstream of it 3 3 3 effect of vm on scoured length the relationship regarding the reduction in scoured length by the application of vm followed by an em is shown in fig 7iv in all the cases a sharp increasing trend of scoured length s l within the gap between the defense system is witnessed against the varying condition of fr however the magnitude was slightly reduced in case 4 and case 5 the slv reduced the relative s l around 9 7 19 1 approximately table 5 whereas the corresponding variations were found to be approximately 18 3 34 for the vdlv cases the vdlv cases reduced the scoured length at about 6 23 compared to that of slv against the considered fr among the three vdlv cases the dense vdlv i e case 5 is witnessed to be more effective in reducing the scoured length fig 7iv the maximum scoured length was found to be 32 cm for case 5 whereas in case 1 s l was 48 2 cm when fr was 1 44 the range of the maximum reduction obtained for case 5 was about 28 34 compared to that of case 1 whereas the corresponding reduction was found to be 18 21 compared to that of case 2 3 4 energy loss 3 4 1 effect of the density of vm on total energy loss the density of the vm significantly affected the relative total energy loss fig 8 i indicates the difference of the relative total energy loss for each vm against varying condition of fr it can be clearly observed that the relative total energy loss is maximum for dense vdlv i e case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 as compared to the intermediate vldv i e case 4 g d 0 563 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 and partially intermediate i e case 3 g d 1 083 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 as well as sparse slv g d 2 125 for l2 only in addition both intermediate and partially intermediate vdlv cases reduced more energy compared to that of sparse slv this implies that the introduction of a submerged shorter layer along with the variation in its porosity within an emergent sparse forest offered significant flow resistance and caused greater energy loss 3 4 2 energy loss through the defense system the total energy reduction of the tsunami flow by the defense system δet e1 was defined in eq 4 and shown in fig 8i the total energy loss consists of both the losses due to em and vm along with the formation of hydraulic jumps downstream of vm for all the considered cases the relative total energy loss followed a gradually increasing trend when fr increased from 1 28 to 1 38 but with the further increase in fr from 1 38 to 1 44 the relative energy loss decreased gradually for case 1 and case 2 whereas a slightly decreasing trend was noted for the vdlv cases case 3 to case 5 this outcome of gradually increasing and decreasing trend in relative total energy loss against fr for vdlv is consistent with that witnessed in the experimental investigation of the flow through vdlv rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 under the similar vm conditions vm porosity and density when slv and vdlv were implemented at the back of an em the highest relative total energy loss was found to be around 12 and 26 respectively compared to that of case 1 oe case in addition the vdlv cases reduced further energy by approximately 20 26 compared to that of case 1 nevertheless the maximum relative total energy loss was found to be approximately 49 53 for the dense vdlv case i e case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 with respect to the initial froude number conditions 3 4 3 energy loss due to hydraulic jump since the formation of hydraulic jump contributes to energy loss hence the calculation of energy loss due to jump is important the relative energy loss because of the formed hydraulic jump in the gap s δe1 e1 and the relationship of the relative loss of energy due to generation of the hydraulic jump behind the vms δe3 h3 against fr is shown in fig 8ii and 8iii within the defense system the relative energy loss followed a sharp decreasing trend in case 2 i e slv fig 8ii for all the initial froude number fr conditions however when the fr increased from 1 28 to 1 33 the energy reduction rate increased rapidly in case 3 to 5 i e vdlv cases but with the further increasing in fr from 1 33 to 1 44 the energy loss followed a sharp decreasing trend for case 3 and a gradually decreasing trend for case 4 and case 5 fig 8ii the maximum value in energy loss was solely dependent on the relationship in between the higher value of p j and the inundation depth in the downstream of the vdlv cases became inverse i e maximum and the minimum respectively because of the higher density and the lower porosity of l1 in vm the maximum relative energy loss is found to be around 35 in case 2 for the lowest fr of 1 28 however when the fr increased from 1 33 to 1 44 the vdlv cases reduced more energy compared to that of case 2 for the highest fr of 1 44 both case 4 and 5 performs better by reducing the energy loss by more than 10 compared to that of case 2 the proper hydraulic jumps were formed only with the vdlv cases case 3 to case 5 when fr ranged from 1 33 to 1 44 fig 2iii 2iv and 2v a sharp decreasing trend was observed for case 3 to case 5 when fr ranged from 1 33 to 1 38 fig 8iii but with the further increase in fr from 1 33 to 1 44 the relative energy loss follows an increasing trend in all vdlv cases fig 8iii this phenomena was occurred because the deposition of the bed materials was started behind vm for both fr of 1 33 and 1 44 fig 6c d e i ii however dense vdlv case case 5 showed a comparatively higher percentage of relative energy reduction due to the generated hydraulic jump behind vm against the initial froude number conditions the loss of relative energy due to hydraulic jump in case 5 contributed 13 19 to the total energy loss moreover for the case 2 and the lowest fr of 1 28 for the case 3 to 5 the energy loss could not be correctly calculated because of no proper formation of hydraulic jumps rather than a small undulation of water surface and or undular jump type phenomena was observed fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 flow and scour characteristics this study examined the function of vm in fixed width condition as a scour countermeasure as well as reduction of tsunami energy and revealed the unique distribution of scour phenomena along with the interaction of an overtopping flow from the em when a vdlv was implemented behind it the overtopping flow generally approached to the downward slope of em with a higher flow gradient which resulted in a higher velocity and froude numbers due to which the approach froude numbers were high fig 4ii and significantly reduced the average froude number in the scour hole fr s as well as within the defense system table 2 when this overtopping flow hits the ground it causes a significant scouring which makes the defense structures vulnerable as was found that the coastal embankments were severely destroyed in the gejt tanaka and sato 2015 jayaratne et al 2016 some of the previous research discussed that the counterclockwise roller vortex plays a significant role in the formation of increased scour hole bricker et al 2012 afreen et al 2015 takegawa et al 2017 in the oe case i e case 1 the roller vortex became large and it increased the turbulence intensity which consequently resulted a subcritical flow in the scour hole table 2 due to the increased turbulence intensity the shear stress also increased which ultimately resulted in an increased scour hole however after installing the vm of different configurations behind the em the intensity of the roller vortex was reduced significantly because of shifting of the position of generated submerged hydraulic jump toward the embankment top thus the froude numbers in the scour hole were increased slightly in the vm cases compared to that of the oe case as a scour countermeasure at the embankment toe experimental investigation by mitobe et al 2014 2016 and yoshida et al 2018 recommended that implementation of concrete block behind a seaward embankment had allowed the direction of the overtopping water in streamwise direction and directed the production of scour hole away from the embankment takegawa et al 2019 proposed that the placement of geogrid with a mesh size of smaller than the average gravel particle diameter over a gravel bed can reduce the magnitude of scouring that starts from the embankment toe however if the scour hole propagates to the further downstream then there is a significance chance that the downstream structures could be destroyed moreover installation of large concrete blocks and placement of geogrid having size less than gravel particles is very difficult to implement in real fields and not feasible based on economic and environmental point of view as these includes heavy construction process requiring massive amount of construction materials and manpower these literature gave us understanding about the implementation of a secondary structure as a countermeasure against the scouring and reduction of tsunami energy many recent studies indicated the significance of coastal forest as a function of tsunami mitigation tanaka et al 2013 pasha and tanaka 2017 anjum and tanaka 2019c rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 the problem regarding scouring could be solved by constructing a defense system by implementing vm behind a little remote position of a seaward em the scour profiles within the defense system i e in the gap region in between em and vm showed that the scouring could be significantly reduced when a vdlv and slv were implemented behind an em figs 2 and 7 the dense vdlv reduced the scour characteristics i e scoured depths and length by offering a higher drag and reflection to the flow because of the reduced porosity in the short layer pr 0 78 for l1 as compared to the other vm cases fig 7 table 3 tables 4 and 5 on the other hand because of high porosity pr 0 98 for l2 of slv it offered a lesser amount of resistance to the overtopping flow and resulted a more scouring compared to the vdlv hence this phenomena i e decrement of porosity of vm is in support for the protection of both defense structures in reducing the scouring phenomena the major reason of increased scour hole is the higher energy of the overtopping flow depth with the increase in fr the overtopping flow depth increases thus the increased scour holes was witnessed in all the considered cases these results are consistent with the previous studies afreen et al 2015 tanaka and sato 2015 takegawa et al 2017 the elevated submerged jump toe on the upstream of em results in a greater decline in the transverse velocity kawagoshi 1990 therefore in a submerged jump the near bed velocity alongside the flume becomes very low compared to that of the mean velocity that is why when p j of the submerged hydraulic jump became larger scouring was reduced significantly in this study when slv and vdlv were placed followed by an em as a secondary defense structure the intensity of the submerged hydraulic jump was increased and also water level inside the defense system was increased significantly fig 2 due to the drag and resistance posed by the vms according to chow 1959 these phenomena could be safest for the embankment structure since the coastal embankments are protected by concrete in addition an experimental investigation by rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 had reported the same phenomena the p j was greater when the porosity of l1 in vdlv became low due to this reason when a dense vdlv was placed behind an em the p j became larger i e the location of the submerged hydraulic jump toe shifted towards the toe of the em top and elevation of tail water due to vms became higher because of low porosity in l1 fig 4i and 4iii which consequently resulted less scouring within the gap between the defense system compared to that of oe and slv so p j is found to be an important parameter to the flow structure which reduces the scouring significantly thus controlling the p j is very important in reducing the magnitude of the scour hole due to the significant erosion in case 1 the increased scoured depth at the toe of the em and the maximum scoured depth inside the defense system may result in a seepage failure at the toe of the em due to the removal of base soil layer these phenomena can cause the foundation failure bearing capacity failure and can make the em structure unstable sassa et al 2016 however due to the increased water cushion effect by the vm the scouring was reduced and a maximum 41 reduction of scoured depth at the toe of em was observed when a dense vdlv was placed behind the em an investigation by sassa et al 2016 discussed the tsunami overflow on seepage which may significantly affect the stability of the embankment due to the increased water cushion within the defense system the vdlv models have reduced the scouring by causing less seepage due to suppressing the coupling effect of the overflow thus decreasing the scouring phenomena within the defense system is safer for the stability of the em 4 2 energy loss despite the fact that the scour holes developing just behind the seaward embankments are considered to be the reason of breaching these holes were reported to decrease the tsunami energy in the downstream region mitobe et al 2016 tanimoto and tokida 2012 tanimoto et al 2012 when a downstream structure is provided behind the seaward embankment it can effectively reduce the fluid force radhedunnabi and tanaka 2020 moment index zaha et al 2019 and momentum flux park et al 2017 by posing resistance to the overtopping flow these studies gave understanding that the energy loss can also be effectively reduced by implementing a vm behind a seaward em when vm was implemented it reduced more energy compared to that of oe fig 8i an exponentially decreasing trend in energy loss was observed with increase in fr from 1 38 to 1 44 for all the considered cases because the effect of energy loss by hitting the ground became relatively low with the rise of overtopping flow fig 8i the energy loss due to the hydraulic jump within the defense system is solely dependent on the jump characteristics rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 due to the drag and reflection offered by vms the elevation of tail water increased and consequently p j was also increased fig 4i and 4iii as p j was increased the scour hole was also reduced due to this a slight decrement in energy loss due to jump was witnessed fig 8ii when porosity of l1 was reduced the same phenomena was observed by rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 this study witnessed that the intensity of hydraulic jump behind vm was increased upon the increment of the density of vm along with the increment of fr in addition the formed hydraulic jump contributed a significant amount of energy loss into the total relative energy loss in the vdlv cases fig 8iii however the total energy loss was varied based on the larger p j value and the intensity of formed hydraulic jump just behind vms thus in the present study p j is found to be an important parameter in reducing the total energy in the downstream of the vms in this paper it is witnessed that when a dense vdlv was implemented behind a seaward em it provided the satisfactory outcomes of maximum reduced scoured depth at the em toe maximum scoured depth within the defense system scoured length as well as the overall energy loss out of all the considered configurations therefore as an effective design procedure against scour countermeasure and energy reduction of the tsunami flow a landward dense vdlv g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 could be implemented followed by a seaward em i e case 5 however depending on the soil condition if it becomes difficult to construct a dense vdlv along the coast then in such case the intermediate vdlv g d 0 563 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 could also be considered i e case 4 5 conclusion in the present study model scale flume experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of vegetation as a scour countermeasure as well as reduction of the tsunami energy behind a seaward embankment against supercritical flow conditions with a gravel bed the conclusions derived from the current study are as follows the overtopping flow from em experienced a submerged hydraulic jump over the em slope against all the initial froude numbers fr for all the considered model configurations the flow caused significant scouring at the toe of em due to direct collision with the ground which initiated from the toe of em and progressed towards downstream however the placement of the vms behind an em significantly influenced the intensity of the submerged hydraulic jump characteristics position of jump approach froude number and tail water depth within the defense system the scoured depth within the defense system was significantly reduced with the introduction of vm behind the em the maximum reduction in scoured depth at the toe of the em the maximum scoured depth and the scoured length were found to be approximately 29 41 29 37 and 28 34 respectively for dense vdlv i e the combined arrangement of an em and dense vdlv compared to the percentage difference with oe the presence of vdlv model behind the em played a significant role in offering reflection resistance to the overtopping flow and thus caused a noteworthy reduction in scoured depth and scoured length in comparison to that of slv maximum energy reduction of flow was found to be approximately 49 53 for the dense vdlv in addition the formed hydraulic jump behind vm in case of vdlv cases contributed significantly to the total relative energy loss the loss of relative energy varied due to the combined effect upon the movement of the position of the submerged hydraulic jump toe toward the top of em the intensity of the formed hydraulic jump just behind vm and the inundation depth at the downstream of the defense system therefore when a dense vdlv was implemented behind an em it gave the maximum dissipation of energy to the flow compared with those of other vm cases with the decrease in porosity and increase in density of short submerged vegetation layer the position of the submerged hydraulic jump toe p j shifted towards the top of em in this study significant reduction in scouring phenomena was witnessed when the p j shifted more towards the top of em and also resulted more energy loss the findings of this paper are important for the ideal design procedures of the defense structures in the coastal regions this study investigated a fixed width of vm but if there is abundant space in coastal belt then increasing the width of vm might be a viable option in reducing more scouring within the defense system as it can shift p j shifts more towards the em top by offering increased drag and reflection resistance to the flow in this study a non cohesive gravel particle was used as a soil layer and a constant gap was maintained between the embankment and forest however to make the findings of this paper more fruitful further experimental investigation by changing the gap condition and increasing the width of the vm is needed credit author statement md abedur

20618,to countermeasure the scouring and tsunami energy reduction this study conducted a series of laboratory experiments where vertically double layered vegetation vdlv was introduced behind the seaward embankment on a gravel bed the experimental results demonstrated that the overtopping flow from the embankment experienced a submerged hydraulic jump over the embankment against all the considered cases the dense vdlv i e dense g d 0 041 where g is the clear gap between the cylinders in the cross stream direction and d is the cylinder diameter short submerged vegetation l1 incorporated within a sparse g d 2 125 tall emergent vegetation l2 influenced the scour phenomena it reduced the relative scoured depth by approximately 29 41 at the embankment toe the maximum scoured depth by approximately 29 37 and the scoured length by approximately 28 34 as compared to that of single embankment system furthermore dense vdlv provided the maximum i e 49 53 loss to the total flow energy the increase in the density of l1 in vdlv offered a larger drag to the flow by shifting the position of the submerged hydraulic jump more towards the embankment top hence consequently resulted in significant reduction of scoured depth scoured length and energy of the tsunami flow keywords sea embankment tsunami overflow erosion scour coastal forest energy loss 1 introduction following the great east japan tsunami gejt in 2011 a large scale tsunami broke numerous coastal structures i e large embankments tsunami gates sea walls etc tappin et al 2012 and caused a fatal damage to the people lives both socioeconomic and household properties as well as the natural structures suppasri et al 2012 tanaka 2012 based on field surveys kato et al 2012 mikami et al 2012 tokida and tanimoto 2014 tanaka and sato 2015 many studies reported that the possible mechanism of the seaward embankment failure was due to the local scouring on the ground since such a massive tsunami is likely to happen in the near future the effective countermeasure against scouring caused by such tsunami is highly important many researches revealed afreen et al 2015 tanaka and sato 2015 takegawa et al 2017 and demonstrated noguchi et al 1997 bricker et al 2012 sassa et al 2016 takegawa et al 2017 the scour process behind an embankment by experimental investigations but the effective design procedure against scour countermeasure along with the reduction of tsunami flow is still limited for scour countermeasure motobe et al 2014 2016 and yoshida et al 2018 did laboratory experiments and concluded that the placement of concrete blocks followed by seaward embankment can allow the overflowing water in stream wise direction and shift the generation of scour hole further downstream from the embankment toe takegawa et al 2019 conducted an experimental study for the scour countermeasures by putting a geogrid over a gravel bed average particle diameter d 50 3 mm starting from the toe of the embankment they clarified that due to the influence of geogrid mainly due to closer mesh size scour holes moves away from the embankment however it is difficult to install geogrid along the coastal regions as vast areas are needed to be filled by gravel beds and the land will be of no further use if the scour hole moves further downstream of embankment it would be dangerous to the downstream structures also the countermeasure against scour by using concrete blocks requires the transportation of heavy construction materials and massive excavation process will increase the construction cost which is not feasible based on the economic point of view in present age the significance of coastal vegetation natural structures as a function of tsunami mitigation has drawn much attention in the research field due to its multipurpose function such as energy loss a smooth landing location and debris trapping shuto 1987 moreover vegetated foreshore can effectively reduce the wave loads on coastal dykes by offering resistance vuik et al 2016 for the mitigation of tsunami energy the coastal forest is being considered as an effective natural protection measure with respect to both environmental and economic aspects tanaka 2009 yanagisawa et al 2010 after a lesson learned from the gejt the mitigation strategy against tsunami inundation is drifting from only sea embankment to hybrid system arrangement of seaward levee and coastal vegetation for instance several studies investigated different types of mitigation systems against tsunamis such as tanaka et al 2006 examined the effect of coastal forest over a sand dune behind the seaward levee fadly and murakami 2013 studied the combination of forest and moat zaha et al 2019 investigated embankment with moat and vegetation an investigation by pasha and tanaka 2017 showed that the maximum energy reduction of tsunami current could be obtained by providing a dense forest with emergent condition but in real scenario it could be difficult to implement a dense forest in the field tanaka et al 2013 clarified that a vertically double layered vegetation vdlv with the combination of p odoratissimus and casuarina equisetifolia in sri lanka was found to be more efficient in tsunami mitigation in addition a post survey reported that vdlv showed significant effectiveness in reducing the damage behind the forest in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami iot in kalutara sri lanka 2005 tanaka et al 2007 some studies on investigating the effectiveness of vdlv have also been performed to countermeasure the disasters caused due to flood flows and tsunamis e g anjum and tanaka 2019a b recently rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 experimentally clarified the mitigation effect of compound system with a combination of a coastal embankment followed by the coastal vegetation the study showed that the different configurations of vdlv short as submerged and tall as emergent can effectively reduce the tsunami energy increase the flow resistance compared to that of single layered vegetation slv and could form different types of hydraulic jumps which further contributes in reduction of the tsunami energy in addition anjum and tanaka 2019c experimentally investigated the effectiveness of discontinued vdlv but there might be space limitation in the coastal regions the previous studies have mainly focused on investigating the flow structures in the hybrid or compound defense structures under rigid bed conditions and they neglected scour phenomena which is very important however there was no research on scour countermeasure behind a sea embankment with the introduction of vdlv against the tsunami flow on a gravel bed has been reported yet thus the main objectives of this study were to study the flow structures and to reduce the scouring behind an embankment with the introduction of vdlv in the downstream to attain such objectives laboratory tests were conducted with the arrangement of an embankment model em followed by coastal vegetation model i e vdlv or slv over a gravel bed under the supercritical flow conditions to justify the effectiveness of vdlv at the back of em a vertically slv was also considered three vdlv configurations were tested by varying porosity of the vegetation model vm against different hydraulic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures physical model experiments were performed in a glass sided flume channel with the dimensions of 5 m long 0 7 m wide and 0 5 m deep with a constant bed slope of 1 200 at saitama university japan the schematic diagram of model setup in the experimental flume is shown in fig 1 i the characteristics of tsunami flow and ground conditions implemented in this experimental study does not imply to any particular locations but were considered generally in the gejt the froude number fr v gh 0 5 where v is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and h is the water depth m in the coastal area was estimated about 1 5 in maximum by the moment of tsunami arrival near the coast of misawa and hachinohe regions in japan nandasena et al 2012 also foytong et al 2013 by video analysis estimated that the froude number of flooding water depth varied from 1 to 1 5 in iwaki and kesennuma city in japan therefore taking those areas as a reference to assure model and replicate the actual tsunami inundations the flow conditions were attained in an empty channel in model scale experiments many studies also attained the flow conditions in an empty channel igarashi and tanaka 2016 pasha and tanaka 2017 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 anjum and tanaka 2019a in addition tsunami flow can be modeled by a pump driven flow aniel quiroga et al 2018 thus the targeted flow conditions were assured in the experimental runs since the tsunami flow was supercritical in coastal regions nandasena et al 2012 foytong et al 2013 therefore a downward facing slope has been selected in order to obtain supercritical flow conditions also sometimes embankments were constructed on a sand dune where the landward slope was downslope tanaka et al 2013 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 rashedunnabi et al 2019 the tsunami flood does not involve the wave crest and continues towards the inland regions with a prolonged time hence the representation of tsunami inundation can be investigated by a quasi steady flow nandasena et al 2012 ali et al 2014 igarashi and tanaka 2016 rahman et al 2020 therefore considering the supercritical and steady inland flow froude number similarity has been employed to decide the flow conditions representing the actual tsunami inundation in this experiments four initial froude numbers fr v o gh o 0 5 where v o is the depth averaged velocity m s g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and h o is the initial water depth m of 1 28 1 33 1 38 and 1 44 were selected under the supercritical flow conditions to select the initial flow conditions i e initial water depths h o and initial froude numbers fr the discharges have been selected by the flow meter of the channel signet 8150 flow totalizer against every discharge the water depth was measured along the center of the channel by a roller mounted point gauge depending on the variation of the water surface with an interval of 2 cm 10 cm therefore four average initial water depths and the initial froude numbers were selected corresponding to each known discharge the depth averaged velocity was calculated by utilizing the continuity equation v q hb where q is the discharge m3 s h is the water depth m and b is the flume width m against the known discharge after installing the em the initial froude numbers resulted in the overflowing water depths of 2 32 2 9 3 77 and 4 93 cm respectively at the crest of the em for the bed materials as a soil layer gravel particle with a median grain size d 50 of 4 47 mm and dry density ρ s of 2650 kg m3 was selected due to the higher threshold value for scouring by the cohesive soil material as a bed the local souring occurred around the coastal dikes and trees at clear water condition in gejt bricker et al 2012 ali and tanaka 2020 many researchers have performed the laboratory investigations under clear water sour conditions by taking grain size of 4 5 mm as bed material for the soil layer to attain the maximum scouring lenzi and comiti 2003 pagliara 2007 afreen et al 2015 ali and tanaka 2020 therefore the grain size of the bed material has been selected to maintain the scouring at clear water condition for which the similarity law is not applicable the gravel bed was placed starting from the toe of the em to the further downstream with an area of 4 m in length 0 7 m wide and 0 23 m deep a wooden flat plate having the same depth of soil layer was placed at the end of the channel as a support to prevent the washout of the soil layer during the flow from the backend of the vm the distance of the flat plate was kept approximately 3 25 m in which the data was taken up to 2 m from the backend of the vm and a sufficient distance in the downstream region i e approximately 1 25 m was also made available ignored for measurement to eliminate the influence of the flat wooden plate at the end of flume channel the scouring phenomena depends much on the characteristic of soil bed layer i e cohesive and non cohesive material in terms of water soil bed interaction since it is very difficult to use cohesive material as a soil layer in model scale experiments many researchers adopted non cohesive particles as a soil layer in context of scouring study mitobe et al 2014 2016 yoshida et al 2018 takegawa et al 2019 ali and tanaka 2020 however the selection of particle size is an important factor when a non cohesive particle is being used as a soil layer another important factor is the scour development for a specific particle size the maximum scouring for a specific non cohesive particle can be obtained when the scouring reaches an equilibrium condition takegawa et al 2019 ali and tanaka 2020 due to this reason the overflow duration in this study has been selected when the scoured depths reached the equilibrium stage the development of scouring s m maximum scoured depth with respect to the overflow duration in seconds for case 1 of fr 1 44 during the trial experiment is presented in fig 1iv it can be clearly seen that the equilibrium scoured depth can be achieved after the overflow duration from em was around 160 s 2 min 40 s in the actual physical scale of 1 100 it was around 1600 s considering the froude similarity law of physical scale the duration of overflowing water can be occurred in an actual tsunami so the equilibrium state should be reproduced in the study since the objective of this study was to reduce the maximum scouring with the introduction of vdlv this overflow duration was selected after doing several trial cases to obtain the maximum scouring in the trial cases no significant variation of the scour profile was confirmed after this overflow duration fig 1iv the whole experiment during the flow duration was recorded with hd high definition video camera olympus tg 835 with a frame rate of 1 30 the elevation of the water surface was measured by video analysis because the flow structures were very complex within the defense system and oscillation of the water surface and duration of the experiment was small the minimum and maximum depths were measured in multiple consecutive frames at a fixed point upon the variations in water surface and subsequently averaged however since the total duration of the experiment was small only the water depth at section 1 section 2 section 3 and section 4 fig 1ii was measured with two roller mounted point gauges along the center of the channel operated by two persons after completion of the experiments the scour properties of the gravel bed were measured with a one dimensional laser displacement meter keyence lk 500 the measurement interval of the data is 1 5 5 cm based on the variations of the gravel bed in both the cross sectional and the longitudinal directions 2 2 model design and conditions of vegetation model vm in this flume experiments a physical model scale of 1 100 was selected for the experimental models after the gejt an innovative coastal dyke system has been planned alongside the coast of fukushima miyagi and iwate prefectures in japan including increasing the height and or reconstruction of coastal dykes strusinska 2017 where the proposed height of coastal dykes in koizumi in miyagi prefecture is around 14 5 m for this instance the embankment height was scaled down to 14 5 cm height 64 cm width and side slope of 1 2 representing an embankment height of 14 5 m in the fukushima miyagi and iwate prefectures in japan rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 rahman et al 2020 in coastal areas the seaward embankment are generally made of concrete and or protected by concrete igarashi and tanaka 2016 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 rahman et al 2020 sometimes to prevent seepage a short pile sheet was provided at the toe of the embankment thus in context of the scouring studies followed by afreen et al 2015 and takegawa et al 2019 the foundation of the embankment was considered as fixed and em was placed above the fixed bed and the seepage phenomena beneath the em was ignored however if the em would have been placed over a soil layer both the scour and the flow phenomena may be slightly different compared with the results obtained in this study since the foundation of the em was considered as fixed bed which is an impermeable soil solid plate the associated effects were ignored further studies can be however considered to clarify this effect by making the foundation of the em as a soil layer as for the vms the japanese pine tree with median height of 15 m and diameter of 40 cm was available in sendai plain japan tanaka 2012 was taken as a reference tree referring to the previous study iimura and tanaka 2012 pasha et al 2017 the trees were modeled by wooden cylinders having diameter d of 0 4 cm the cylinders in vms were designed in a staggered arrangement in the gejt the trees having diameter larger than 0 4 m were found unbroken tanaka et al 2014 and during the 2004 iot the trees having diameter more than 0 3 m were also observed to be unbroken therefore the tall cylinders l2 in both slv and vdlv were modeled as circular wooden cylinders with a diameter of 0 4 cm and height of 20 cm in vdlv the short cylinder with a height of 5 cm was taken as submerged vegetation l1 pandanus odoratissimus in tropical region and pittosporum tobira in temperate region trees grow with dense areal roots and a complex structure that offers a significant moment of the drag force tanaka et al 2007 both trees are representative trees in the coastal areas tanaka et al 2007 in real situation when tsunami inundation appears less than 5 m high p odoratissimus was found to be more effective tanaka et al 2007 thuy et al 2018 therefore the height of l1 in all vdlv was taken as 5 cm from the ground level considering 5 m in real scale for enhancing the potentiality of the defense system as scour countermeasure along with tsunami mitigation in this experiment three vertically double layer vms was constructed on a wooden plate by inserting a short layer l1 within a sparse tall layer l2 and was arranged in a staggered arrangement the layers in vdlv models were divided by varying the porosity pr of vm the porosities of l1 were 0 78 dense 0 91 intermediate and 0 95 partially intermediate whereas the porosity of l2 was fixed i e 0 98 the porosity of l2 in slv was also kept constant i e 0 98 the models were constructed with long cylinders so that the bed materials can be inserted easily the density of each models was represented by g d value where g clear gap between the cylinders in cross stream direction d diameter of cylinder the details of vms configurations is presented in fig 1iii and table 1 four different vms were considered i e slv and vldv and were designed by varying condition of porosity density and thickness of vms these models were installed within the gravel bed in the experimental flume covering the full width of the flume as shown fig 1i the width of vegetation w in stream wise direction can be represented by vegetation thickness dn which is a function of cumulative breast height diameter of the trees and is described as a function of the tree diameter at breast height and the number of trees n per unit area m 2 in a rectangle with a frontal unit length along the coast and depth equal to the forest width w pasha and tanaka 2017 referring to shutto 1987 the value of dn in model scale was estimated as follows 1 d n 2 3 d 2 w d where the ratio 2 3 d 2 means the density of the cylinder and 2 means the cylinder numbers included inside a rectangular area under staggered system of arrangement fig 1iii w is the width of the forest d is the distance among the cylinders in transverse direction respectively fig 1iii and the porosity pr of vm is calculated by following iimura and tanaka 2012 2 p r 1 n t π d 2 4 where n t is the density of vegetation based on field surveys matsuba et al 2014 and tanaka and sato 2015 reported that due to the overtopping of tsunami flow in the gejt severe erosion occurred and scoured length were varied from 4 to 31 78 m however the scour properties i e scour length and depth rose when the energy head and the force of the tsunami current increased tanaka and sato 2015 a study by matsuba et al 2014 observed that the trees that were planted in close proximity to the levee on the landslide were displaced and generated a significant amount of floating debris on the other hand the coastal forest that has no gap in between the embankment and forest was entirely destroyed due to overtopping tsunami for this instance in the present study a gap was kept as 0 5 m in between the em and vms considering an effective measure as scour countermeasure and energy reduction of tsunami flow since the embankments in the coastal regions were protected by concrete so em was considered as a fixed bed condition and was placed over the fixed bed in the flume channel at 1 m distance as of the inlet tank both the slv and vdlvs were placed on a gravel bed downstream of the em with a gap of 0 5 m the vms occupied almost full width of the flume channel while keeping a small space amongst the exterior vegetation cylinder and the flume wall several researches jsfm 1998 rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 tang et al 2019 showed that to reduce the side wall influence on the water surface profiles the ratio amongst the flume width and the diameter of cylinder should to be larger than 5 for this reason this proportion was maintained to reduce the side wall effect 2 3 non dimensional parameters used in this study in this model scale experiment the physical models of the prototypes were scaled down to reduced sizes considering a model scale of 1 100 to represent the real phenomena under controlled conditions the schematic diagram of the basic flow structure and associated important parameters are shown in fig 1ii and 1iii the following non dimensional groups were derived by adopting the buckingham s pi theorem f p r f r f r 1 f r i f

estimated based on the following equation chow 1959 4 e z y α v 2 2 g where e is the specific energy z is the elevation of the bottom y is the water depth v is the depth averaged velocity and α is the co efficient for calculating the variations in velocity in this study the value of α is considered as 1 for slv whereas it is taken as 1 1 for vdlvs anjum and tanaka 2019c since a hydraulic jump was formed in the gap between the em and vms as well as the downstream of the vms thus the energy loss was subdivided as i total energy loss δ e t e 1 e 4 due to the defense system downstream of vm and ii energy loss due to hydraulic jump inside the defense system δ e 1 e 1 e 2 and energy loss due to the formation of hydraulic jump downstream of vms δ e 1 h 4 h 3 3 4 h 4 h 3 where e 1 e 2 e 3 and e 4 is the specific energy at section 1 in front of jump section 2 downstream of jump section 3 in the undular jumps downstream of vm and section 4 downstream of the vm respectively 3 results 3 1 submerged hydraulic jump and its characteristics fig 2 shows the resulting water surface profiles against the varying condition of initial froude number fr after the placement of models in the flume the representative photos of the scour and water surface profiles are presented in fig 3 within the defense system the overtopping flow experienced a submerged hydraulic jump over the downface of the em slope for all the cases against the considered initial froude numbers the non dimensional position p j p j s of the submerged hydraulic jump toe on the downface slope of the em is shown in fig 4 i two different p j 1 and 1 are described in this study where p j 1 denotes that the jump starts in between the em toe and vm and p j 1 denotes that the jump starts on the downface of the em it can be clearly seen that in all considered cases the starting position of the submerged hydraulic jump lies on the downface of the em slope i e p j 1 in case 1 the p j was much closer to the em toe however when the vms of different configuration were installed followed by an em the p j moved towards the em top upon increasing the fr for the lowest fr of 1 28 the p j was much closer to the em toe but with the further increment of fr the p j moved towards the em top in all the cases a gradually increasing trend of p j was observed in all the cases however the maximum value of p j was witnessed for case 5 i e when a dense vdlv was placed on the gravel bed behind an em whereas minimum values of p j were observed for case 1 for the case 4 and case 5 these results are consistent with rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 as the value of p j increased the approach froude number fr 1 decreased because of gradually varied flow on the downface of em and consequently resulted in a comparatively higher relative elevation of tail water h t h 0 thus a sharp decreasing trend of fr 1 was observed for all the considered cases fig 4ii in comparison to that of slv a comparatively higher h t h 0 was observed in all the vdlv cases fig 4iii 3 2 variation of scour profile 3 2 1 variation of scour profile inside the defense system in all the cases scour starts from the toe of the em and progresses further downstream as shown in figs 2 and 5 which ultimately resulted a significant scour hole the scoured depth increased gradually and after reaching the maximum scoured depth it decreased to the deposition level in all the considered cases for the fr 1 38 to 1 44 the level of deposition of soil particles was greater than the height of l1 in cases 3 to case 5 fig 5 c d e and fig 2 iii iv v whereas in case 2 a comparatively lower deposition of soil particles was observed however the deposition of soil particles reached to ground level about 10 cm just in front of the vm in cases 2 to 5 when fr was 1 28 fig 5 b c d e and fig 2 a variation in resulted scour phenomena within the defense system in the cross stream direction of the flume was observed in all the considered cases against different fr conditions fig 5 the scour profiles and the scour hole were large in case 1 against all fr similar scour profiles were observed by takegawa et al 2019 for case 1 the magnitudes of scour profiles were significantly affected upon varying the different configurations of vm and the vdlv cases reduced more scour compared to that of slv case in addition a noticeable scour reduction is recognized in intermediate vdlv case 4 g d 0 563 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 and dense vdlv case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 in case 5 it can be clearly witnessed that the scour hole at every fr is significantly smaller than that in case 1 3 2 2 scour and or deposition phenomena at the downstream of vm fig 6 illustrates the contour plots of the scour and or deposition phenomena in the downstream of the vms it can be clearly seen that the downstream region of vm was almost undisturbed and no significant scouring and or deposition of soil particles was observed in all the considered cases when fr was 1 28 and 1 33 despite of the fact that some changes in the soil bed was observed due to flow the removed soil particles between the defense system were travelled with the flow and deposited in the downstream region of vm for the fr of 1 33 and 1 44 the travelled soil material was deposited in the downstream in case 2 to 5 just behind the slv model the deposition was lowest and it increased to maximum to further downstream when fr was 1 33 and 1 44 fig 2ii and fig 6b i ii whereas in vdlv cases the lowest point of the deposition in soil particles scouring phenomenon was observed just below the generated hydraulic jumps fig 2c d e and fig 6c d e i ii in case 3 when the fr was 1 44 an undulation of the soil bed was witnessed fig 2c and fig 6cii just beneath the generated hydraulic jump point for the case 5 very small scouring was noticed when the fr was 1 44 3 3 effect of vm in scour characteristics 3 3 1 effect of the porosity of vm on scour characteristics within the defense system with the introduction of vms behind the em as a scour countermeasure the scoured region within defense system was influenced significantly the comparison of scour characteristics is presented in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that the scour characteristics i e scoured depth and scoured length were significantly reduced by the decrease in porosity of l1 the characteristics of scour were lowest in dense vdlv pr 0 78 for l1 and pr 0 98 for l2 as compared to that of the intermediate vldv pr 0 91 for l1 and pr 0 98 for l2 partially intermediate vdlv pr 0 95 for l1 and pr 0 98 for l2 and slv pr 0 98 for l2 this indicates that both the scoured depth and scour length could be significantly influenced with decrement in porosity of l1 this implies that the construction of a submerged layer along with its porosity within an emergent sparse forest plays a significant role in reduced scouring within the defense system 3 3 2 effect of vm on scoured depth the scoured depth is also significantly reduced because of the resistance offered by the vm so the assessment in comparison with single em is needed fig 7 shows the comparison of scoured depth at the toe of the em and the maximum scoured depth caused by the overtopping flow a sharp increasing trend in both the scoured depth at the toe of the em s t and maximum scoured depth s m caused by overtopping flow as shown in fig 7iii and 7i is observed for case 1 with the increase in fr from 1 28 to 1 44 whereas a gradually increasing trend with comparatively lower magnitudes is found for slv and vdlv cases i e case 2 to case 5 in reducing the scoured depth at toe of the em and the maximum scour within the defense system the vdlv cases performed better than slv case against the considered initial flow conditions among the vdlv cases the dense vdlv case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 reduced more scour at the toe of the em as well as within the defense system the vdlv cases and sparse slv case 2 g d 2 125 for l2 reduced the toe scour approximately 12 2 41 and 6 3 26 table 3 in addition the maximum reduction of s t was found to be 29 41 in case 5 compared to that of case 1 on the other hand case 5 reduced the s t approximately 15 24 compared with the case 2 the relative reduction of s m for vdlv cases was found to be 17 1 37 table 4 compared to that of case 1 on the contrary slv reduced s m approximately by 7 2 19 5 the maximum s m was found to be 10 18 cm for case 5 whereas it was 16 cm for case 1 fig 7i when the fr was 1 44 the relative maximum reduction of s m for case 5 varied from approximately 29 37 table 4 against the considered fr compared with the case 1 whereas the corresponding variations were found to be 21 23 compared to that of case 2 in all the cases a sharp increasing trend is witnessed for the non dimensional position p s of the maximum scoured depth s m with the increase in fr from 1 28 to 1 44 fig 7ii however like s t and s m the vdlv cases were effective enough in positioning the p s in all the cases with the increasing in fr the p s moved away from the toe of the em but still lied in the center region which could ensure the safety of the defense structure however when there is no vm i e case 1 the p s moved further downstream compared to the vegetated conditions which might destroy the structures downstream of it 3 3 3 effect of vm on scoured length the relationship regarding the reduction in scoured length by the application of vm followed by an em is shown in fig 7iv in all the cases a sharp increasing trend of scoured length s l within the gap between the defense system is witnessed against the varying condition of fr however the magnitude was slightly reduced in case 4 and case 5 the slv reduced the relative s l around 9 7 19 1 approximately table 5 whereas the corresponding variations were found to be approximately 18 3 34 for the vdlv cases the vdlv cases reduced the scoured length at about 6 23 compared to that of slv against the considered fr among the three vdlv cases the dense vdlv i e case 5 is witnessed to be more effective in reducing the scoured length fig 7iv the maximum scoured length was found to be 32 cm for case 5 whereas in case 1 s l was 48 2 cm when fr was 1 44 the range of the maximum reduction obtained for case 5 was about 28 34 compared to that of case 1 whereas the corresponding reduction was found to be 18 21 compared to that of case 2 3 4 energy loss 3 4 1 effect of the density of vm on total energy loss the density of the vm significantly affected the relative total energy loss fig 8 i indicates the difference of the relative total energy loss for each vm against varying condition of fr it can be clearly observed that the relative total energy loss is maximum for dense vdlv i e case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 as compared to the intermediate vldv i e case 4 g d 0 563 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 and partially intermediate i e case 3 g d 1 083 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 as well as sparse slv g d 2 125 for l2 only in addition both intermediate and partially intermediate vdlv cases reduced more energy compared to that of sparse slv this implies that the introduction of a submerged shorter layer along with the variation in its porosity within an emergent sparse forest offered significant flow resistance and caused greater energy loss 3 4 2 energy loss through the defense system the total energy reduction of the tsunami flow by the defense system δet e1 was defined in eq 4 and shown in fig 8i the total energy loss consists of both the losses due to em and vm along with the formation of hydraulic jumps downstream of vm for all the considered cases the relative total energy loss followed a gradually increasing trend when fr increased from 1 28 to 1 38 but with the further increase in fr from 1 38 to 1 44 the relative energy loss decreased gradually for case 1 and case 2 whereas a slightly decreasing trend was noted for the vdlv cases case 3 to case 5 this outcome of gradually increasing and decreasing trend in relative total energy loss against fr for vdlv is consistent with that witnessed in the experimental investigation of the flow through vdlv rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 under the similar vm conditions vm porosity and density when slv and vdlv were implemented at the back of an em the highest relative total energy loss was found to be around 12 and 26 respectively compared to that of case 1 oe case in addition the vdlv cases reduced further energy by approximately 20 26 compared to that of case 1 nevertheless the maximum relative total energy loss was found to be approximately 49 53 for the dense vdlv case i e case 5 g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 with respect to the initial froude number conditions 3 4 3 energy loss due to hydraulic jump since the formation of hydraulic jump contributes to energy loss hence the calculation of energy loss due to jump is important the relative energy loss because of the formed hydraulic jump in the gap s δe1 e1 and the relationship of the relative loss of energy due to generation of the hydraulic jump behind the vms δe3 h3 against fr is shown in fig 8ii and 8iii within the defense system the relative energy loss followed a sharp decreasing trend in case 2 i e slv fig 8ii for all the initial froude number fr conditions however when the fr increased from 1 28 to 1 33 the energy reduction rate increased rapidly in case 3 to 5 i e vdlv cases but with the further increasing in fr from 1 33 to 1 44 the energy loss followed a sharp decreasing trend for case 3 and a gradually decreasing trend for case 4 and case 5 fig 8ii the maximum value in energy loss was solely dependent on the relationship in between the higher value of p j and the inundation depth in the downstream of the vdlv cases became inverse i e maximum and the minimum respectively because of the higher density and the lower porosity of l1 in vm the maximum relative energy loss is found to be around 35 in case 2 for the lowest fr of 1 28 however when the fr increased from 1 33 to 1 44 the vdlv cases reduced more energy compared to that of case 2 for the highest fr of 1 44 both case 4 and 5 performs better by reducing the energy loss by more than 10 compared to that of case 2 the proper hydraulic jumps were formed only with the vdlv cases case 3 to case 5 when fr ranged from 1 33 to 1 44 fig 2iii 2iv and 2v a sharp decreasing trend was observed for case 3 to case 5 when fr ranged from 1 33 to 1 38 fig 8iii but with the further increase in fr from 1 33 to 1 44 the relative energy loss follows an increasing trend in all vdlv cases fig 8iii this phenomena was occurred because the deposition of the bed materials was started behind vm for both fr of 1 33 and 1 44 fig 6c d e i ii however dense vdlv case case 5 showed a comparatively higher percentage of relative energy reduction due to the generated hydraulic jump behind vm against the initial froude number conditions the loss of relative energy due to hydraulic jump in case 5 contributed 13 19 to the total energy loss moreover for the case 2 and the lowest fr of 1 28 for the case 3 to 5 the energy loss could not be correctly calculated because of no proper formation of hydraulic jumps rather than a small undulation of water surface and or undular jump type phenomena was observed fig 2 4 discussion 4 1 flow and scour characteristics this study examined the function of vm in fixed width condition as a scour countermeasure as well as reduction of tsunami energy and revealed the unique distribution of scour phenomena along with the interaction of an overtopping flow from the em when a vdlv was implemented behind it the overtopping flow generally approached to the downward slope of em with a higher flow gradient which resulted in a higher velocity and froude numbers due to which the approach froude numbers were high fig 4ii and significantly reduced the average froude number in the scour hole fr s as well as within the defense system table 2 when this overtopping flow hits the ground it causes a significant scouring which makes the defense structures vulnerable as was found that the coastal embankments were severely destroyed in the gejt tanaka and sato 2015 jayaratne et al 2016 some of the previous research discussed that the counterclockwise roller vortex plays a significant role in the formation of increased scour hole bricker et al 2012 afreen et al 2015 takegawa et al 2017 in the oe case i e case 1 the roller vortex became large and it increased the turbulence intensity which consequently resulted a subcritical flow in the scour hole table 2 due to the increased turbulence intensity the shear stress also increased which ultimately resulted in an increased scour hole however after installing the vm of different configurations behind the em the intensity of the roller vortex was reduced significantly because of shifting of the position of generated submerged hydraulic jump toward the embankment top thus the froude numbers in the scour hole were increased slightly in the vm cases compared to that of the oe case as a scour countermeasure at the embankment toe experimental investigation by mitobe et al 2014 2016 and yoshida et al 2018 recommended that implementation of concrete block behind a seaward embankment had allowed the direction of the overtopping water in streamwise direction and directed the production of scour hole away from the embankment takegawa et al 2019 proposed that the placement of geogrid with a mesh size of smaller than the average gravel particle diameter over a gravel bed can reduce the magnitude of scouring that starts from the embankment toe however if the scour hole propagates to the further downstream then there is a significance chance that the downstream structures could be destroyed moreover installation of large concrete blocks and placement of geogrid having size less than gravel particles is very difficult to implement in real fields and not feasible based on economic and environmental point of view as these includes heavy construction process requiring massive amount of construction materials and manpower these literature gave us understanding about the implementation of a secondary structure as a countermeasure against the scouring and reduction of tsunami energy many recent studies indicated the significance of coastal forest as a function of tsunami mitigation tanaka et al 2013 pasha and tanaka 2017 anjum and tanaka 2019c rashedunnabi and tanaka 2020 the problem regarding scouring could be solved by constructing a defense system by implementing vm behind a little remote position of a seaward em the scour profiles within the defense system i e in the gap region in between em and vm showed that the scouring could be significantly reduced when a vdlv and slv were implemented behind an em figs 2 and 7 the dense vdlv reduced the scour characteristics i e scoured depths and length by offering a higher drag and reflection to the flow because of the reduced porosity in the short layer pr 0 78 for l1 as compared to the other vm cases fig 7 table 3 tables 4 and 5 on the other hand because of high porosity pr 0 98 for l2 of slv it offered a lesser amount of resistance to the overtopping flow and resulted a more scouring compared to the vdlv hence this phenomena i e decrement of porosity of vm is in support for the protection of both defense structures in reducing the scouring phenomena the major reason of increased scour hole is the higher energy of the overtopping flow depth with the increase in fr the overtopping flow depth increases thus the increased scour holes was witnessed in all the considered cases these results are consistent with the previous studies afreen et al 2015 tanaka and sato 2015 takegawa et al 2017 the elevated submerged jump toe on the upstream of em results in a greater decline in the transverse velocity kawagoshi 1990 therefore in a submerged jump the near bed velocity alongside the flume becomes very low compared to that of the mean velocity that is why when p j of the submerged hydraulic jump became larger scouring was reduced significantly in this study when slv and vdlv were placed followed by an em as a secondary defense structure the intensity of the submerged hydraulic jump was increased and also water level inside the defense system was increased significantly fig 2 due to the drag and resistance posed by the vms according to chow 1959 these phenomena could be safest for the embankment structure since the coastal embankments are protected by concrete in addition an experimental investigation by rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 had reported the same phenomena the p j was greater when the porosity of l1 in vdlv became low due to this reason when a dense vdlv was placed behind an em the p j became larger i e the location of the submerged hydraulic jump toe shifted towards the toe of the em top and elevation of tail water due to vms became higher because of low porosity in l1 fig 4i and 4iii which consequently resulted less scouring within the gap between the defense system compared to that of oe and slv so p j is found to be an important parameter to the flow structure which reduces the scouring significantly thus controlling the p j is very important in reducing the magnitude of the scour hole due to the significant erosion in case 1 the increased scoured depth at the toe of the em and the maximum scoured depth inside the defense system may result in a seepage failure at the toe of the em due to the removal of base soil layer these phenomena can cause the foundation failure bearing capacity failure and can make the em structure unstable sassa et al 2016 however due to the increased water cushion effect by the vm the scouring was reduced and a maximum 41 reduction of scoured depth at the toe of em was observed when a dense vdlv was placed behind the em an investigation by sassa et al 2016 discussed the tsunami overflow on seepage which may significantly affect the stability of the embankment due to the increased water cushion within the defense system the vdlv models have reduced the scouring by causing less seepage due to suppressing the coupling effect of the overflow thus decreasing the scouring phenomena within the defense system is safer for the stability of the em 4 2 energy loss despite the fact that the scour holes developing just behind the seaward embankments are considered to be the reason of breaching these holes were reported to decrease the tsunami energy in the downstream region mitobe et al 2016 tanimoto and tokida 2012 tanimoto et al 2012 when a downstream structure is provided behind the seaward embankment it can effectively reduce the fluid force radhedunnabi and tanaka 2020 moment index zaha et al 2019 and momentum flux park et al 2017 by posing resistance to the overtopping flow these studies gave understanding that the energy loss can also be effectively reduced by implementing a vm behind a seaward em when vm was implemented it reduced more energy compared to that of oe fig 8i an exponentially decreasing trend in energy loss was observed with increase in fr from 1 38 to 1 44 for all the considered cases because the effect of energy loss by hitting the ground became relatively low with the rise of overtopping flow fig 8i the energy loss due to the hydraulic jump within the defense system is solely dependent on the jump characteristics rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 due to the drag and reflection offered by vms the elevation of tail water increased and consequently p j was also increased fig 4i and 4iii as p j was increased the scour hole was also reduced due to this a slight decrement in energy loss due to jump was witnessed fig 8ii when porosity of l1 was reduced the same phenomena was observed by rashedunnabi and tanaka 2019 this study witnessed that the intensity of hydraulic jump behind vm was increased upon the increment of the density of vm along with the increment of fr in addition the formed hydraulic jump contributed a significant amount of energy loss into the total relative energy loss in the vdlv cases fig 8iii however the total energy loss was varied based on the larger p j value and the intensity of formed hydraulic jump just behind vms thus in the present study p j is found to be an important parameter in reducing the total energy in the downstream of the vms in this paper it is witnessed that when a dense vdlv was implemented behind a seaward em it provided the satisfactory outcomes of maximum reduced scoured depth at the em toe maximum scoured depth within the defense system scoured length as well as the overall energy loss out of all the considered configurations therefore as an effective design procedure against scour countermeasure and energy reduction of the tsunami flow a landward dense vdlv g d 0 041 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 could be implemented followed by a seaward em i e case 5 however depending on the soil condition if it becomes difficult to construct a dense vdlv along the coast then in such case the intermediate vdlv g d 0 563 for l1 and g d 2 125 for l2 could also be considered i e case 4 5 conclusion in the present study model scale flume experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of vegetation as a scour countermeasure as well as reduction of the tsunami energy behind a seaward embankment against supercritical flow conditions with a gravel bed the conclusions derived from the current study are as follows the overtopping flow from em experienced a submerged hydraulic jump over the em slope against all the initial froude numbers fr for all the considered model configurations the flow caused significant scouring at the toe of em due to direct collision with the ground which initiated from the toe of em and progressed towards downstream however the placement of the vms behind an em significantly influenced the intensity of the submerged hydraulic jump characteristics position of jump approach froude number and tail water depth within the defense system the scoured depth within the defense system was significantly reduced with the introduction of vm behind the em the maximum reduction in scoured depth at the toe of the em the maximum scoured depth and the scoured length were found to be approximately 29 41 29 37 and 28 34 respectively for dense vdlv i e the combined arrangement of an em and dense vdlv compared to the percentage difference with oe the presence of vdlv model behind the em played a significant role in offering reflection resistance to the overtopping flow and thus caused a noteworthy reduction in scoured depth and scoured length in comparison to that of slv maximum energy reduction of flow was found to be approximately 49 53 for the dense vdlv in addition the formed hydraulic jump behind vm in case of vdlv cases contributed significantly to the total relative energy loss the loss of relative energy varied due to the combined effect upon the movement of the position of the submerged hydraulic jump toe toward the top of em the intensity of the formed hydraulic jump just behind vm and the inundation depth at the downstream of the defense system therefore when a dense vdlv was implemented behind an em it gave the maximum dissipation of energy to the flow compared with those of other vm cases with the decrease in porosity and increase in density of short submerged vegetation layer the position of the submerged hydraulic jump toe p j shifted towards the top of em in this study significant reduction in scouring phenomena was witnessed when the p j shifted more towards the top of em and also resulted more energy loss the findings of this paper are important for the ideal design procedures of the defense structures in the coastal regions this study investigated a fixed width of vm but if there is abundant space in coastal belt then increasing the width of vm might be a viable option in reducing more scouring within the defense system as it can shift p j shifts more towards the em top by offering increased drag and reflection resistance to the flow in this study a non cohesive gravel particle was used as a soil layer and a constant gap was maintained between the embankment and forest however to make the findings of this paper more fruitful further experimental investigation by changing the gap condition and increasing the width of the vm is needed credit author statement md abedur

detection and accurate evaluation of those anomalies are essential to guarantee the integrity of subsea oil and gas pipeline systems amaya gómez et al 2019 chen et al 2015 asme b31g 2012 recommend practice 2017 since the early 2000s a number of researchers concentrated on the buckling failure mechanism of subsea pipeline under external pressure such as kyriakides et al kyriakides and corona 2007 yu et al 2019 gong et al 2018 2019 silva et al 2020 karampour et al karampour 2018 yang et al 2020a 2020b liu and wang 2019 li et al 2019 in term of subsea pipeline with corrosion defects bai and hauch 1998 proposed an analytical solution for predicting buckling pressure of pipeline with constant depth corrosion xue 2008 xue and hoo fatt xue and fatt 2005 investigated the buckling failure of corroded pipeline using wkb method and finite element method in a separate study the buckling failure of pipeline with constant depth corrosion was investigated via small scale experimental test by sakakibara sakakibara et al 2008 and meaningful suggestions for integrity assessment of pipeline with groove corrosion were provided another contribution was made by netto netto et al 2007 netto 2009 2010 who investigated buckling pressure of subsea pipelines numerically and proposed solutions for buckling pressure prediction of pipelines with constant depth corrosion considering material anisotropy he et al 2014 used finite element method to investigate the buckling failure of thick wall pipeline with constant depth corrosion recently yan et al 2015 2016 conducted elastic plastic analysis of corroded subsea pipelines with plasticity effect being involved more recently the buckling failure of subsea pipelines with random corrosion defects was investigated by yu et al 2017 and wang et al 2018a 2018b experimentally and numerically in practice corrosive deterioration in pipeline will exhibit various geometries in the circumferential direction nevertheless rare attention has been paid to the influence of those complex corrosion geometries on pipelines buckling failure under external pressure meanwhile methods for integrity assessment of pipeline with complex corrosion defects are not available in industry to fill this gap a semi analytical approach named homotopy analysis method initially proposed by liao 2003 2012 is introduced in this paper to investigate the buckling failure of corroded pipeline which has been proven to be capable of giving accurate and efficient solutions for lots of linear and nonlinear problems in practice fadugba 2020 naik et al 2020 rana and liao 2019 rana et al 2019 zhang and wu 2019 zhang and li 2019 since it is not the purpose of this paper to interpret intricacies of this technique the intent of this paper is to provide an alternative solution based on ham for integrity assessment of subsea pipeline with complex corrosion 2 governing equation for buckling analysis of corroded pipeline in engineering practice the corrosion geometries varying in circumferential direction are usually idealized as well defined idealized corrosion shapes i e constant depth elliptical and parabolic shapes the corresponding three corrosion shapes are illustrated in fig 2 a c which can be defined using specific corrosion depth function d θ the corrosion depth function d θ for a constant depth corrosion can be given as 1 d θ d 0 the corrosion depth function d θ for an elliptical corrosion is given by 2 d θ d 0 1 θ β 2 the corrosion depth function d θ for a parabolic corrosion can be written as 3 d θ d 0 1 θ β 2 where d 0 is the maximum corrosion depth at centerline β represents half angle of the corrosion width in circumferential direction since the buckling analysis of pipeline is essentially an eigenvalue problem it is worth mentioning that the initial imperfection will affect pipelines buckling behavior to a certain extent as presented in ref kyriakides and corona 2007 furthermore coupled defects such as ovality

detection and accurate evaluation of those anomalies are essential to guarantee the integrity of subsea oil and gas pipeline systems amaya gómez et al 2019 chen et al 2015 asme b31g 2012 recommend practice 2017 since the early 2000s a number of researchers concentrated on the buckling failure mechanism of subsea pipeline under external pressure such as kyriakides et al kyriakides and corona 2007 yu et al 2019 gong et al 2018 2019 silva et al 2020 karampour et al karampour 2018 yang et al 2020a 2020b liu and wang 2019 li et al 2019 in term of subsea pipeline with corrosion defects bai and hauch 1998 proposed an analytical solution for predicting buckling pressure of pipeline with constant depth corrosion xue 2008 xue and hoo fatt xue and fatt 2005 investigated the buckling failure of corroded pipeline using wkb method and finite element method in a separate study the buckling failure of pipeline with constant depth corrosion was investigated via small scale experimental test by sakakibara sakakibara et al 2008 and meaningful suggestions for integrity assessment of pipeline with groove corrosion were provided another contribution was made by netto netto et al 2007 netto 2009 2010 who investigated buckling pressure of subsea pipelines numerically and proposed solutions for buckling pressure prediction of pipelines with constant depth corrosion considering material anisotropy he et al 2014 used finite element method to investigate the buckling failure of thick wall pipeline with constant depth corrosion recently yan et al 2015 2016 conducted elastic plastic analysis of corroded subsea pipelines with plasticity effect being involved more recently the buckling failure of subsea pipelines with random corrosion defects was investigated by yu et al 2017 and wang et al 2018a 2018b experimentally and numerically in practice corrosive deterioration in pipeline will exhibit various geometries in the circumferential direction nevertheless rare attention has been paid to the influence of those complex corrosion geometries on pipelines buckling failure under external pressure meanwhile methods for integrity assessment of pipeline with complex corrosion defects are not available in industry to fill this gap a semi analytical approach named homotopy analysis method initially proposed by liao 2003 2012 is introduced in this paper to investigate the buckling failure of corroded pipeline which has been proven to be capable of giving accurate and efficient solutions for lots of linear and nonlinear problems in practice fadugba 2020 naik et al 2020 rana and liao 2019 rana et al 2019 zhang and wu 2019 zhang and li 2019 since it is not the purpose of this paper to interpret intricacies of this technique the intent of this paper is to provide an alternative solution based on ham for integrity assessment of subsea pipeline with complex corrosion 2 governing equation for buckling analysis of corroded pipeline in engineering practice the corrosion geometries varying in circumferential direction are usually idealized as well defined idealized corrosion shapes i e constant depth elliptical and parabolic shapes the corresponding three corrosion shapes are illustrated in fig 2 a c which can be defined using specific corrosion depth function d θ the corrosion depth function d θ for a constant depth corrosion can be given as 1 d θ d 0 the corrosion depth function d θ for an elliptical corrosion is given by 2 d θ d 0 1 θ β 2 the corrosion depth function d θ for a parabolic corrosion can be written as 3 d θ d 0 1 θ β 2 where d 0 is the maximum corrosion depth at centerline β represents half angle of the corrosion width in circumferential direction since the buckling analysis of pipeline is essentially an eigenvalue problem it is worth mentioning that the initial imperfection will affect pipelines buckling behavior to a certain extent as presented in ref kyriakides and corona 2007 furthermore coupled defects such as ovality
