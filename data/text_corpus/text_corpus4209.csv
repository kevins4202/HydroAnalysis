number is chosen in order to replicate available experimental data laser doppler anemometry measurements at the volvo test rig the openfoam cfd toolbox is used for the present numerical simulations several algebraic subgrid scale sgs closures including the conventional smagorinsky model c s 0 1 and c s 0 053 the model by vreman c s 0 1 and the dynamic version of the k equation model are investigated the spectral analysis of the vortex shedding and the convective instabilities as well as the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate is presented some aspects of the blockage effects

parameters and spectral characteristics with dispersion about 10 showing a reasonable consistency with the experimental data graphical abstract image 1 keywords triangular cylinder large eddy simulation algebraic subgrid scale models turbulent separated flows openfoam cfd 1 introduction turbulent separated bluff body flows are implicated in a wide range of engineering applications however in spite of the fact that the flow physics has been investigated intensively by both numerical and experimental methods during the last century the first viscous flow past a circular cylinder probably was obtained by thom 1933 in 1933 accurate simulations are of great practical importance still the aim of the present work is to develop a large eddy simulation model les of the turbulent separated bluff body flows at high reynolds numbers interesting for many practical applications the present les is based on the core numerical method implemented in the openfoam toolbox weller et al 1998 which became very popular in industrial engineering and academic research during the last decade previously several systematic studies have been performed to validate and verify the openfoam capabilities for several turbulent bluff body flows at the moderate reynolds numbers re 3900 50000 lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 here the reynolds number is defined as re ρ u h μ where u and ρ are the free stream velocity and mass density respectively h is the diameter of the obstacle and μ represents the dynamic viscosity these works presented results both the conventional approach for solution of the unsteady compressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans lysenko et al 2013 and an advanced les technique lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 lately both inert and reactive flows over a triangular cylinder at re 50000 using unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans les and scale adaptive simulations sas have been investigated lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the global descriptions of les sas and rans urans indicated a clear interrelation between these three approaches to simulation of the turbulent combustion flows lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 in general reasonable consistency was found for these different approaches as well as satisfactory agreement between numerical simulations and measurements however the most accurate results were reached using the large eddy simulations scientific and engineering background to investigate triangular cylinders is commonly driven by aerospace industry in particular propulsion and industrial combustion systems where bluff body wakes are used for the flame stabilization also the simplicity of configuration is quite attractive to provide fundamental research of turbulent combustion as well as computational test cases shanbhogue et al 2009 another common applications are flow metering where triangular cylinders are commonly used as a vortex shedder in the vortex type flow meters yagmur et al 2017 the triangular cylinder was extensively investigated experimentally and numerically in the literature calvert 1967 okamoto et al 1977 fujii et al 1978 tatsuno et al 1990 sjunnesson et al 1991 sanquer et al 1998 obara and matsudaira 1998 zheng et al 2016 yagmur et al 2017 among them two experimental works can be highlighted which provided the local flow characteristics suitable for the detail validation of large eddy simulations calvert 1967 presented hot wire anemometry hwa measurements of the bluff body wake at the blockage ratio br 1 10 sjunnesson et al 1991 provided laser doppler anemometry ldv measurements of the wake at br 1 3 however both studies missed the key flow parameters like forces coefficients yagmur et al 2017 investigated the triangular cylinder both by means of particle image velocimetry piv and les for the highest reynolds number re 11600 dynamics of the wake in terms of strouhal number was investigated extensively as well by many researchers however experimental results for the local dynamics of the separated shear layers are not available yet it is worth to notice that important information related to the key integral flow features like the lift drag and pressure forces is limited okamoto et al 1977 and tatsuno et al 1990 presented the drag coefficient for the reynolds number re 22000 and re 90000 respectively yagmur et al 2017 reported the drag using les for yagmur et al 2017 the alternative measured data of the drag force can be found in naca tn3038 the present study we investigated the turbulent flow over triangular cylinder at different configurations br 1 3 and br 1 9 1 20 to replicate the experimental data by calvert 1967 and sjunnesson et al 1991 and investigate the blockage effects the lift drag and pressure coefficients are reported and compared with the available data as well an assessment of the several subgrid scale sgs models for the turbulent flow over an equilateral triangular cylinder is provided the conventional smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 with two constants c s 0 1 and c s 0 053 the vreman model c s 0 1 vreman 2004 and the dynamic version of the k equation eddy viscosity model yoshizawa 1986 are investigated some numerical aspects like the spectral analysis of the convective instability of the separated shear layers and the turbulence energy dissipation missed in our previous study lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 are reported the volvo test rig has been chosen due to the available ldv measurements of the velocity sjunnesson et al 1991 in the present work we utilized the standard numerical platform the second order finite volume method implemented in the openfoam code this numerical approach has been validated in details for the bluff body flows during the last decade e g lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 cao and tamura 2015 robertson et al 2015 cao and tamura 2016 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 zahiri and roohi 2019 and can be recommended to simulate the turbulent separated flows the paper is divided into five main sections the first section of the paper describes the mathematical modeling and numerical aspects then a general description of the test case is given finally computational results are presented results are analyzed and discussed and on the top of that conclusions are drawn 2 brief description of mathematical modeling numerical aspects in order to be consistent with authors previous results lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the compressible flow and related numerical setup were considered despite of the fact that the actual mach number was close to the incompressible limit 2 1 mathematical modeling the favre filtered balance equations of mass momentum and energy were solved in the present work the mach number was set to a quite small value m u c 0 05 assuming the subgrid scales incompressibility hypothesis here c is the speed of sound in the free stream the subgrid scale models are important for any large eddy simulation in research of the turbulent separated flows the algebraic type of eddy viscosity sgs models are quite popular in the state of the art codes due to their robustness and principal property to posses the dissipative nature of turbulence vreman 2004 in the present study we have investigated several of them 2 1 1 the k equation model as it was mentioned by chaouat 2017 the modeling of the subgrid energy equation has been worked out by several authors such as schumann 1975 horiuti 1985 and yoshizawa 1986 inspired by analogy from its corresponding reynolds averaged navier stokes modeling the k equation eddy viscosity subgrid scale model yoshizawa 1986 hereafter dtke is based on the sgs kinetic energy k 1 2 u u u u where u is the density weighted filtered velocity the following assumptions for the sgs density weighted stress tensor b and the filtered deviatoric part of the rate of strain tensor d d were used 1 b 2 3 ρ k i 2 μ b d d 2 d d d 1 3 tr d i 3 d 1 2 grad u grad u t 4 μ b c k ρ k δ here i is the unit tensor ρ the filtered density μ b the sgs viscosity and δ the top hat filter with a length estimated as the cubic root of the control volume the subgrid kinetic energy k was estimated by solving a separately modeled transport equation of the form 5 ρ k t ρ k u j x j f p f d f ε 6 f p b d 7 f d x j μ b μ k x j 8 f ε c ε ρ k 3 2 δ where f p is production f d diffusion and f ε dissipation terms respectively and c k 0 07 c ε 1 048 are model coefficients sagaut 2006 the dynamic model for the k equation can be derived using the germano identity l with another filter kernel of width δ 2 δ the theoretical background and implementation details are provided by fureby 1996 2 1 2 the smagorinsky model the conventional smagorinsky sgs model hereafter smag can be recovered from eq 5 by assuming local equilibrium i e f p f ε thus the sgs kinetic energy can be computed from the relation 9 b d c ε ρ k 3 2 δ 0 using eq 1 and introducing the following coefficients 10 a c ε δ b 2 3 tr d c 2 c k δ d d d the relation of eq 9 can be reformulated to a quadratic equation for k the final relation for k can be formulated as 11 k b b 2 4 a c 2 a 2 the models constants are c k 0 02 and c ε 1 048 sagaut 2006 the dissipation rate ε s g s from the smag model was expressed according to eq 8 2 1 3 the vreman model vreman 2004 proposed to express the eddy viscosity as 12 μ b c v ρ b β α i j α i j where 13 α i j u j x i β i j δ m 2 α m i α m j b β β 11 β 22 β 12 2 β 11 β 33 β 13 2 β 22 β 33 β 23 2 the model constant c v is related to the smagorinsky constant c s by the relation c v 2 5 c s 2 hereafter this model will be defined vr 2 1 4 the subgrid fluxes the subgrid fluxes sgsf were modeled according to a simple gradient diffusion gd approximation 14 b h μ b pr t h x j where pr t is the turbulence prandtl number here additional case is considered in conjunction with the sgsf closure based on the classical gradient hypothesis closure and clark s tensor diffusivity model within the diffusion term in eq 5 was replaced in the spirit of clark s model clark et al 1979 as 15 f d δ 2 12 x j u j x j k x j and the sub grid scalar flux as 16 b h δ 2 12 u j x j h x j 2 2 numerical method the present simulations were carried out using the openfoam v6 x weller et al 1998 code the governing equations were solved using the standard pressure velocity coupling methodology and the finite volume method based on the pimple algorithm robertson et al 2015 which is a variation of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators method vandoormaal and raithby 1984 a smooth solver with a symmetrical gauss seidel smoother was used to compute the system of linear algebraic equations with a local accuracy of 10 7 for all dependent variables except pressure the last one was calculated using the geometric agglomerated algebraic multigrid solver gamg with the gauss seidel smoother and a local accuracy of 10 7 overall the numerical method has second order accuracy in space and time the convective terms were approximated by a so called limited linear scheme which belongs to the family of total variation diminishing tvd schemes harten 1983 bounded with a variation of the sweby limiter jasak et al 1999 have provided the details of implementation which were described consistency recently by robertson et al 2015 and cao and tamura 2016 the time integration was performed using the implicit euler method bdf 2 geurts 2004 the later was accompanied by the dynamic adjustable time stepping technique to guarantee a local courant number less than 0 4 with a typical corresponding step size δ t 5 10 7 s aspects of high performance computing have been highlighted in authors previous works e s lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the vilje high performance computing hpc facility https www sigma2 no content vilje was used for the present les most calculations were performed using 128 256 cores in parallel where typical calculation time for one time step varied between 1 2 s and the total effective simulation time per run took around ten days 3 test case description 3 1 experimental set up the description of the volvo test rig and relevant experimental data was provided in sjunnesson et al 1991 fig 1 shows a schematic drawing of the test section the set up consisted of a straight channel with a rectangular cross section divided into an inlet section length 0 5 m and a channel passage section length l 1 m and 0 12 m 0 24 m cross section the inlet section was used for flow straightening and turbulence control the air entering the inlet section was distributed over the cross section by a plate that at the same time isolated the channel acoustically from the air supply system the channel passage section ended in a circular duct with a large diameter the triangular cylinder with side length h 0 04 m was mounted with its reference position 0 681 m upstream of the channel exit the principal flow parameters and experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 where re is the reynolds number based on the triangle edge st is the strouhal number u is velocity t is temperature p is the static pressure and l r h represents the recirculation zone length the symbol denotes that a parameter is applied at the rig inlet the strouhal number st is defined as st f v s h u where f v s is the vortex shedding frequency 3 2 computational domain and grids the computational domain and the mesh strategy was inherited from the authors previous work lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 here we strongly follow lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 and provide some principal moments only fig 2 shows the computational domain and the unstructured mesh hereafter this grid has label m1 the computational domain consisted of three blocks the inlet block without bluff body was resolved by 135 70 45 nodes in the stream wise transverse and span wise directions respectively with exponential grading of cells towards the bluff body the central block included the obstacle and had a size of 0 2 m 0 12 m fig 2 the bluff body edges were discretized by 75 grid points while the stream wise transverse and span wise sides of the domain were resolved by 80 70 45 nodes respectively to obtain smooth mesh transition towards the flame holder the remaining downstream block had a resolution of 135 70 45 nodes with exponential decreasing of nodes towards the outlet the viscous boundary layers bl attached to the obstacle and the channel walls were designed based on the first element length and the growth factor which were set to 10 4 m and 1 15 both to the obstacle and wind tunnel walls the total number of bl rows were set to 13 and 7 for the obstacle and channel walls respectively finally such combination of parameters provided the estimated minimum and averaged non dimensional distance to the wall y were 0 1 4 6 and 0 1 5 4 for the obstacle and the channel walls respectively the second grid m2 was used to check the grid sensitivity of the present les results this grid was generated by simple adaption of the baseline mesh m1 by a factor of 1 5 in all three cartesian directions the span wise resolution for m1 and m2 grids was estimated as d z h 0 134 and d z h 0 08 respectively on the one hand the span wise wavelength of stream wise vortices in the shear layer l z s l and in the wake l z k could be estimated as l z s l h 0 1 25 re and l z k h 1 respectively at re o 10 4 williamson et al 1995 based on these relationships the present mesh resolutions can be considered to be sufficient to resolve the span wise wavelengths of the stream wise vortices in the wake and in the shear layers for re 50000 on the other hand cao et al 2020 presented the more stringent criterion d z h 0 02 to predict accurately the shear layer behaviors and the laminar turbulent transitional process also cao et al 2020 suggested that d z h may play some effects on development of the recirculation zone length this tendency can be interested and important to be analyzed in the future works however was not investigated in the present study due to resource limitations the mean drag coefficient c d h and mean recirculation zone length l r h were chosen as the most important integral parameters to assess the grid convergence study presented in fig 3 here the recirculation length l r is defined as the distance between the base of the triangular cylinder y 0 and the sign change of the centerline mean stream wise velocity the investigation was provided for the tke sgs model the initial mesh was derived from m1 by reducing the grid resolution in all directions by factor 1 5 not discussed here one can see clearly that a deviation for both parameters as a function of a cells number was bounded by 5 also the results obtained by the vreman sgs model using m1 and m2 grids were plotted in fig 3 it is interesting that the vreman sub grid scale model occurred to be more sensitive to the grid resolution this fact can be explained by dependency of the turbulent viscosity from the squared filter width δ eq 12 and 13 3 3 boundary conditions the inlet and outlet boundary conditions were set up to replicate the experiment the mean inlet velocity and temperature profiles were extracted and interpolated from urans at the location x h 2 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the inflow perturbations were not added due to the applied grid strategy where they will be highly damped due to expansion of the grid from the bluff body towards the inlet a non slipping condition for velocity was applied to the wind tunnel and the obstacle walls the lateral boundaries were treated as the symmetry planes the static pressure was maintained as 101 kpa the wave transmissive boundary condition was applied at the outlet to avoid propagating of any numerical oscillations from the outlet of the computational domain 3 4 overview of the numerical cases all simulated cases are listed in table 2 where the following abbreviations are used id case label mesh grid label br blockage ratio sgs subgrid scale model dynamic k equation eddy viscosity sub grid scale model dtke smagorinsky smag vreman vr sgsf the subgrid scalar flux approximation conventional gradient diffusion gd or clark cl the reynolds number was re 45000 for all cases the solution is considered to be statistically converged after two and half flow through times the flow through time was defined as the ratio between the axial length of the computational domain to the bulk velocity for a quantitative validation of the present les the averages have been obtained from the computational results by sampling over 35 vortex shedding periods n v s after the flow field was converged 4 results this section presents the obtained results in terms of the first order statistics and one dimensional spectral data the hat the tilde and the bar marks denoting favre averaging and filtering favre averaging were omitted for simplicity 4 1 first order statistics fig 4 shows the measured and calculated mean stream wise velocity fluctuations of the mean stream wise velocity and the normalized subgrid turbulence kinetic energy along the center line behind the obstacle for the sake of completeness besides the experimental results by sjunnesson et al 1991 the ldv data by sanquer et al 1998 and obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 were added overall there was a good agreement between numerical and experimental data one can observe the same trends between all numerical runs for the axial distribution of the mean stream wise velocity except the vc04 case which provided some discrepancies the normalized turbulence kinetic energy k n k u where the turbulence kinetic energy k 3 4 u 2 v 2 following the experiments of sjunneson et al sjunnesson et al 1991 is shown in fig 4 c it was a fairly good agreement between all numerical runs and experimental data comparison of first order statistics against experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 for the near wake at three different downstream locations x h 0 95 1 525 3 75 is provided in fig 5 fig 5 a c shows profiles for the mean stream wise velocity u u one can see that the present calculations agreed with the ldv measurements of sjunnesson et al 1991 quite satisfactory for all three axial states the experimental data by obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 was added as well for x h 0 95 and x h 1 525 it worth noting that the ldv data by obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 was obtained for re 75000 based on the non equilateral triangular cylinder moreover the blockage ratio was different between these two experiments which may explain several discrepancies observed in fig 5a and b in fig 5 d f the rms values of the stream wise velocity u u are shown the transitional nature of the shear layers resulted in the primary vortex formation parnaudeau et al 2008 and can be observed in the u profile with two strong peaks at x h 0 95 the same type of the u profile can be observed at x h 1 525 finally at x h 3 75 the u profile was more or less flat outside of the mean recirculation zone it was observed that all sgs models collapsed well to reproduce the experiment by sjunnesson et al 1991 some small deviations were observed between the present les and the ldv data but in general satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results was achieved significant deviations between the recirculation zone length l r obtained in numerical simulations and measurements are often observed for many turbulent bluff body flows typical flow patterns are displayed in fig 6 the present results converged to l r h 1 28 9 which was reasonably close to the experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 who measured l r h 1 35 the minimum l r was obtained by the smag model l r h 1 21 the calculated values by dtke and vr models were in the range l r h 1 24 1 46 however the available experimental works provided a large scattering of data l r h 1 35 1 8 the large variation in measurements can be explained by transitional effects in the separating shear layers reproduced by different setup of the wind tunnels and flow conditions 4 2 one dimensional energy spectra based on the moderate reynolds number re 45000 this flow can be attributed to the sub critical regime where the separated boundary layer stays laminar for re 200000 fig 7 illustrates the formation of the vortex street and coherent flow structures downstream of the bluff body showing the q criterion q s 2 ω 2 10 6 where s is the strain rate and ω is the vorticity the visualization displays the capability of the present les to resolve wide range of energetic flow structures developed in the turbulent wake the vortex shedding instability can be expressed by a characteristic frequency f v s st u h based on the strouhal number st to compute both characteristic frequencies of the vortex shedding and kelvin helmholtz kh instability the velocity signals were sampled in probes located at the vicinity of the bluff body at x h 1 75 and y h 0 in addition probes were located in places where the share layer instabilities develops from both sides of the cylinder about 1 5 10 5 samples of the cross flow velocities were collected over a dimensionless time interval t t u h 100 or n v p t f f s 35 the spectra calculated from these time series were then averaged in the span wise direction nine probe locations uniformly distributed were used to increase the statistical meaning to obtain the one dimensional spectra both fast fourier transform fft and the welch periodogram technique welch 1967 were used the computed value of the strouhal number of the vortex shedding frequency was st 0 27 1 3 which was found to be slightly over estimated by 7 4 compared to the experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 who predicted st 0 25 alternative experimental data provided in table 3 showed a variation of the strouhal between 0 21 0 26 over estimation of the vortex shedding frequency by the present les may be explained by the numerical effects related to the vortices quenching and their interaction with the channel walls fig 8 a compares one dimensional nondimensionalized frequency spectra at the downstream location x h 1 75 on the centerline of the wake the experimental results of ong and wallace 1996 sanquer et al 1998 and parnaudeau et al 2008 were plotted as well as a 5 3 slope all present numerical results yielded very similar power spectra where the inertial subrange was reproduced for a quite large spectral range one critical remark should be made here based on the spectra displayed in fig 8 a it can be observed that the tvd scheme produced some unnatural energy spectra as was originally discussed by cao and tamura 2016 they observed that the tvd scheme seems to exhibit different influences on the spectral curves tending to reduce the energy in the inertial subrange and increase energy in the dissipation range the separated shear layer behaves in a similar manner to a mixing layer when the recirculation zone length is sufficiently long the shear layer instability is based on the kelvin helmholtz mechanism and the characteristic frequency f k h for re 1200 leading to shear layer roll up into tightly concentrated vorticity shanbhogue et al 2009 from the experimental point of view several studies investigating the separated shear layer from the circular cylinder are available in the literature bloor 1964 maekawa and mizuno 1967 kourta et al 1987 norberg 1987 mihailovic and corke 1987 prasad and williamson 1997 rajagopalan and antonia 2005 bloor 1964 seems to be the first who studied the frequency of the shear layer instability waves she demonstrated that the shear layer instability frequency scaled approximately with re by considering the thickness and velocity of the separating laminar boundary layer lately prasad and williamson 1997 provided re evaluation of all data and reported that the exponent p in the expression f k h f v s a re p 0 0235 re 0 67 was significantly greater than 0 5 in every case dynamics of the shear layer transition of a square cylinder at the reynolds number range 15000 re 75000 have been investigated by lander et al 2018 they derived the relation f k h f v s 0 18 re 0 6 which was based on the hot wire measurements piv and dns studies the numerical data of brun et al 2008 and trias et al 2015 were analyzed as well these data were obtained at re 20000 les re 22000 direct numerical simulation and re 27000 laser doppler velocimetry ldv recently moore et al 2019 carried out a detailed experimental study of the separated shear layers stemming from rectangular sections with aspect ratios of 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 in the range 13400 re 118000 the reynolds number was based on the body thickness it was interesting that experimental results for f k h f v s obtained by moore et al 2019 for the 5 1 rectangular section was somewhere between the square prism and circular cylinder some limited compiled data are plotted in fig 9 moore et al 2019 reported that all geometries fit well with a power law however both the exponent and the coefficient are different for each bluff body geometry the authors previous les results calculated for the circular cylinder flow revealed f k h f v s 7 6 and f k h f v s 16 2 for re 3900 lysenko et al 2012 and re 20000 lysenko et al 2014 respectively these results were in good agreement with the available experimental data and numerical data dong et al 2006 in addition the dns study by trias et al 2015 provided for the square prism at re 22000 a relatively broadband frequency peak at f k h f v s 60 cao and tamura 2015 calculated the peaks of shear layer frequencies as f k h f v s 15 17 which were much smaller than the ldv measurement by minguez et al 2011 f k h f v s 45 the present les results obtained for the equilateral triangular cylinder predicted f k h f v s 13 74 16 01 fig 8 b presents the welch spectra computed for vc02 and vc04 these results were close to the experimental trend obtained for the circular cylinder 4 3 note on turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate the time history of the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate normalized by the mean ε ε is displayed in fig 8 c it is interesting that the numerical signals qualitatively reproduced the experimental signals of ε obtained respectively in a laboratory boundary layer and in the atmospheric surface layer by meneveau and sreenivasan meneveau et al 1991 in the present study the term f ε eq 8 has been sampled for each run at the location x h 1 75 y h 0 in the same spirit as for the velocity signals fft and the welch periodogram technique were applied to plot the one dimensional energy spectra provided in fig 8 d results of the high resolution dns by ishihara et al 2005 and the dissipation spectra measured by tsuji 1999 are added to compare the present les the model for the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate eq 8 relies on the assumption that for a fixed δ ε scales as k 3 2 in general the power law scaling ε k γ has been observed in several experimental studies assuming that γ is constant based on dns of forced isotropic turbulence chumakov 2007 found that the scaling assumption ε k γ holds reasonably well for sgs reynolds numbers of up to 5000 however the value of γ was not found to be a constant but to dependent on the proximity of the filter size δ to the forcing length scale chumakov 2007 reported that none of the observed scalings were close to ε k 3 2 which is widely used in the literature he found that γ 1 2 for δ close to forcing scale and γ 1 for δ in the near viscous range in accordance with meneveau and o neal meneveau et al 1991 in the inertial subrange γ varied between 0 6 0 9 monotonically with δ it is worth noting that the present les results revealed the spread of γ between 0 76 0 89 in spite of the fact that eq 8 was used to sample the dissipation rate this fact is demonstrated in fig 10 moreover the coefficient c ε from eq 8 was computed dynamically for each les run fig 11 displays variation of the mean c ε depending on the sgs model it is interesting to see that c ε can deviate significantly from its widely used value c ε 1 048 the present results showed that c ε maximum may reaches c ε 30 in some regions of the computation domain 5 discussion 5 1 overview high fidelity les on relatively coarse grids is important for practical engineering applications several modeling aspects may be considered on one hand when coarse grids are used in les the effect of the numerical modeling on the flow resolution is increased lloyd and james 2016 on the other hand effects of the subgrid modeling become more pronounced as well the unstructured grid strategy which is attractive for any practical applications due to ability to focus the refinement more effectively is better designed for isotropic eddy viscosity turbulence models lloyd and james 2016 however the sudden change in cell size across refinement region boundaries may be an issue and special considerations for the grid design should be taken into account e g by placed these interfaces away from key flow features table 3 incorporates integral flow parameters collected from available experimental and numerical les results in general flow physics which characterize the turbulent separated flow past a bluff body at the moderate reynolds number was captured well in the present numerical simulation the present numerical results obtained by the different algebraic sgs models were quite consistent with the dispersion of about 10 for the main integral quantities reasonable deviations were found for the first order statistics overall the present study matched reasonably well the corresponding experimental data sjunnesson et al 1991 however some important flow parameters like the drag and pressure coefficients were missed in the experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 also this particular experiment was performed in the wind tunnel channel with blockage ratio br 1 3 it is well known that blockage and interference effects need to be considered these effects may be relatively low but certainly affect the measured drag and pressure coefficients and other related parameters trias et al 2015 5 1 1 blockage effects most blockage theories make the assumption that the principal effect is an increase in free stream velocity and consequently fall in static pressure calvert 1967 for the sake of completeness we performed the additional les runs vc08 and vc09 to investigate the blockage effects for this case the baseline grid m1 was extended by top and bottom buffer domains to decrease the blockage to br 1 9 and br 1 20 keeping the free stream re and m numbers the same furthermore the alternative hwa measurements by calvert 1967 were used to assess sensitivity results to the br effects fig 12 provides the instantaneous flow visualization based on the q criterion and some aspects of the grid for br 1 9 one can clearly see the difference in the flow fields obtained for br 1 3 and br 1 9 displayed in figs 7 and 12 respectively the calculated strouhal numbers st 0 20 0 21 were indicating that the vortex shedding formation was significantly less intensive for the unconfined cases also this value agreed reasonably with the data reported by okamoto et al 1977 st 0 21 zheng et al 2016 st 0 21 and yagmur et al 2017 st 0 219 0 225 it is worth noting that the experimental studies demonstrated the clear tendency on decreasing of st with decreasing of br thus fujii et al 1978 provided st 0 4 for br 1 2 sjunnesson et al 1991 and sanquer et al 1998 measured st 0 25 0 26 for br 1 3 other researchers presented st 0 171 0 225 for br 1 3 calvert 1967 okamoto et al 1977 zheng et al 2016 yagmur et al 2017 the time averaged pressure coefficient c p 2 p p ρ u 2 where p and ρ are the free stream pressure and density respectively at the surface of a triangular cylinder is displayed in fig 13 a the results of vc01 br 1 3 vc08 br 1 9 and vc09 br 1 20 are compared against the experimental data by tatsuno et al 1990 and okamoto et al 1977 the calculated integral values of the base suction coefficient for br 1 9 and br 1 20 were c p b 1 25 and 1 09 which correlated reasonably with the experimental value obtained by tatsuno et al 1990 and okamoto et al 1977 who measured c p b 1 38 and c p b 1 09 respectively also calvert 1967 presented a significantly different value c p b 0 375 the calculated base suction coefficient for br 1 3 was c p b 2 19 4 5 the base suction coefficient is strongly related to the drag coefficient c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force in the stream wise direction and a is the projection area of the front view the calculated drag coefficients for br 1 9 and br 1 20 were c d 1 51 and 1 42 which matched reasonably the experimental and numerical results available in the literature okamoto et al 1977 presented c d 1 26 for the reynolds number re 22000 tatsuno et al 1990 reported c d 1 4 for re 90000 recently yagmur et al 2017 reported c d 1 43 using les for re 11600 all these values were quite close to the data provided by naca tn3038 fig 13 c summarizes these findings the calculated drag coefficients for br 1 3 were significantly higher c d 2 57 with a dispersion of 8 yeung and parkinson 2000 developed and reported an analytical dependence of the drag versus the base suction coefficient this dependence has a linear distribution for the triangular cylinders and wedges and is displayed in fig 13 b the present les results are plotted in the same figure and were tending to the similar distribution the experimental data by fujii et al 1978 who reported c p b 2 67 for br 1 2 satisfied this tendency as well the first order statistics obtained for br 1 20 1 9 1 3 are displayed in fig 14 together with the available experimental data by calvert 1967 and sjunnesson et al 1991 for the sake of completeness we added the piv measurements by yagmur et al 2017 and ldv data by sanquer et al 1998 and obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 in general the discrepancies observed between numerical results by vc08 vc09 and vc01 were tending only to a small permanent bias which may be explained by the similarity of the numerical method used for both les calculations however more pronounced differences can be found between the hwa data by calvert 1967 and the ldv measurements by sjunnesson et al 1991 meaning that setup of the physical experiment and properties of the wind tunnel test section affected the results it worth notice that numerical results obtained for vc08 and vc09 matched reasonably indicating only small influence of the blockage effects on the downstream wake for br 1 9 6 conclusions a large eddy simulation of the turbulent flow over an equilateral triangular cylinder at reynolds number re 45000 based on the triangle edge has been performed to replicate the well known experimental of the volvo test rig a fully conservative finite volume method of the second order accuracy in space and time based on the openfoam technology was used the family of the algebraic eddy viscosity sgs models including the conventional smagorinsky vreman and dynamic version of k equation has been assessed in the present study time averaged results have been presented and compared against experimental data the agreement with the ldv measurements in the wake region for the mean stream wise velocity and its fluctuation was rather good the axial distribution of the turbulence kinetic energy matches experimental data reasonably well suggesting that the present les resolved a significant part of the turbulent scales integral flow characteristics like the mean drag and surface pressure coefficients have been compared against alternative measurements available in the literature the agreement was quite satisfactory in spite the slightly different flow setup and conditions finally the spectral analysis of the velocity samples has been carried out to compute both the kh and von kármán instabilities the numerical predicted strouhal numbers were in a fairly good agreement with the measured indicating that the weak dynamics were well captured however comparison of the energy spectra showed that the numerical method was slightly over dissipative which may be explained by application of the tvd scheme and unstructured grids artificially tending to reduce the energy at the low frequencies and increase energy at the higher frequencies these finding supports the observations of cao and tamura 2016 furthermore it was found that the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate scaled according to the power law with γ 0 77 0 89 unlikely to the widely used value γ 3 2 overall the above mentioned good agreement of the integral flow features and turbulence statistics that the bluff body flow physics is well reproduced all sgs models are agreed reasonably well

21045,the turbulent separated flow over an equilateral triangular cylinder at a reynolds number 45000 based on the triangle edge is studied by means of large eddy simulation les the moderate reynolds number is chosen in order to replicate available experimental data laser doppler anemometry measurements at the volvo test rig the openfoam cfd toolbox is used for the present numerical simulations several algebraic subgrid scale sgs closures including the conventional smagorinsky model c s 0 1 and c s 0 053 the model by vreman c s 0 1 and the dynamic version of the k equation model are investigated the spectral analysis of the vortex shedding and the convective instabilities as well as the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate is presented some aspects of the blockage effects are investigated and compared to experimental data available in the literature it was shown that blockage affects significantly the mean drag and pressure coefficients of the triangular cylinder at the same time the mean velocity field is tending to similarity overall all sgs models reproduced most important aspects of the flow physics of the separated bluff body flow including integral flow parameters and spectral characteristics with dispersion about 10 showing a reasonable consistency with the experimental data graphical abstract image 1 keywords triangular cylinder large eddy simulation algebraic subgrid scale models turbulent separated flows openfoam cfd 1 introduction turbulent separated bluff body flows are implicated in a wide range of engineering applications however in spite of the fact that the flow physics has been investigated intensively by both numerical and experimental methods during the last century the first viscous flow past a circular cylinder probably was obtained by thom 1933 in 1933 accurate simulations are of great practical importance still the aim of the present work is to develop a large eddy simulation model les of the turbulent separated bluff body flows at high reynolds numbers interesting for many practical applications the present les is based on the core numerical method implemented in the openfoam toolbox weller et al 1998 which became very popular in industrial engineering and academic research during the last decade previously several systematic studies have been performed to validate and verify the openfoam capabilities for several turbulent bluff body flows at the moderate reynolds numbers re 3900 50000 lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 here the reynolds number is defined as re ρ u h μ where u and ρ are the free stream velocity and mass density respectively h is the diameter of the obstacle and μ represents the dynamic viscosity these works presented results both the conventional approach for solution of the unsteady compressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans lysenko et al 2013 and an advanced les technique lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 lately both inert and reactive flows over a triangular cylinder at re 50000 using unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans les and scale adaptive simulations sas have been investigated lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the global descriptions of les sas and rans urans indicated a clear interrelation between these three approaches to simulation of the turbulent combustion flows lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 in general reasonable consistency was found for these different approaches as well as satisfactory agreement between numerical simulations and measurements however the most accurate results were reached using the large eddy simulations scientific and engineering background to investigate triangular cylinders is commonly driven by aerospace industry in particular propulsion and industrial combustion systems where bluff body wakes are used for the flame stabilization also the simplicity of configuration is quite attractive to provide fundamental research of turbulent combustion as well as computational test cases shanbhogue et al 2009 another common applications are flow metering where triangular cylinders are commonly used as a vortex shedder in the vortex type flow meters yagmur et al 2017 the triangular cylinder was extensively investigated experimentally and numerically in the literature calvert 1967 okamoto et al 1977 fujii et al 1978 tatsuno et al 1990 sjunnesson et al 1991 sanquer et al 1998 obara and matsudaira 1998 zheng et al 2016 yagmur et al 2017 among them two experimental works can be highlighted which provided the local flow characteristics suitable for the detail validation of large eddy simulations calvert 1967 presented hot wire anemometry hwa measurements of the bluff body wake at the blockage ratio br 1 10 sjunnesson et al 1991 provided laser doppler anemometry ldv measurements of the wake at br 1 3 however both studies missed the key flow parameters like forces coefficients yagmur et al 2017 investigated the triangular cylinder both by means of particle image velocimetry piv and les for the highest reynolds number re 11600 dynamics of the wake in terms of strouhal number was investigated extensively as well by many researchers however experimental results for the local dynamics of the separated shear layers are not available yet it is worth to notice that important information related to the key integral flow features like the lift drag and pressure forces is limited okamoto et al 1977 and tatsuno et al 1990 presented the drag coefficient for the reynolds number re 22000 and re 90000 respectively yagmur et al 2017 reported the drag using les for yagmur et al 2017 the alternative measured data of the drag force can be found in naca tn3038 the present study we investigated the turbulent flow over triangular cylinder at different configurations br 1 3 and br 1 9 1 20 to replicate the experimental data by calvert 1967 and sjunnesson et al 1991 and investigate the blockage effects the lift drag and pressure coefficients are reported and compared with the available data as well an assessment of the several subgrid scale sgs models for the turbulent flow over an equilateral triangular cylinder is provided the conventional smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 with two constants c s 0 1 and c s 0 053 the vreman model c s 0 1 vreman 2004 and the dynamic version of the k equation eddy viscosity model yoshizawa 1986 are investigated some numerical aspects like the spectral analysis of the convective instability of the separated shear layers and the turbulence energy dissipation missed in our previous study lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 are reported the volvo test rig has been chosen due to the available ldv measurements of the velocity sjunnesson et al 1991 in the present work we utilized the standard numerical platform the second order finite volume method implemented in the openfoam code this numerical approach has been validated in details for the bluff body flows during the last decade e g lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 cao and tamura 2015 robertson et al 2015 cao and tamura 2016 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 zahiri and roohi 2019 and can be recommended to simulate the turbulent separated flows the paper is divided into five main sections the first section of the paper describes the mathematical modeling and numerical aspects then a general description of the test case is given finally computational results are presented results are analyzed and discussed and on the top of that conclusions are drawn 2 brief description of mathematical modeling numerical aspects in order to be consistent with authors previous results lysenko et al 2012 lysenko et al 2014 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the compressible flow and related numerical setup were considered despite of the fact that the actual mach number was close to the incompressible limit 2 1 mathematical modeling the favre filtered balance equations of mass momentum and energy were solved in the present work the mach number was set to a quite small value m u c 0 05 assuming the subgrid scales incompressibility hypothesis here c is the speed of sound in the free stream the subgrid scale models are important for any large eddy simulation in research of the turbulent separated flows the algebraic type of eddy viscosity sgs models are quite popular in the state of the art codes due to their robustness and principal property to posses the dissipative nature of turbulence vreman 2004 in the present study we have investigated several of them 2 1 1 the k equation model as it was mentioned by chaouat 2017 the modeling of the subgrid energy equation has been worked out by several authors such as schumann 1975 horiuti 1985 and yoshizawa 1986 inspired by analogy from its corresponding reynolds averaged navier stokes modeling the k equation eddy viscosity subgrid scale model yoshizawa 1986 hereafter dtke is based on the sgs kinetic energy k 1 2 u u u u where u is the density weighted filtered velocity the following assumptions for the sgs density weighted stress tensor b and the filtered deviatoric part of the rate of strain tensor d d were used 1 b 2 3 ρ k i 2 μ b d d 2 d d d 1 3 tr d i 3 d 1 2 grad u grad u t 4 μ b c k ρ k δ here i is the unit tensor ρ the filtered density μ b the sgs viscosity and δ the top hat filter with a length estimated as the cubic root of the control volume the subgrid kinetic energy k was estimated by solving a separately modeled transport equation of the form 5 ρ k t ρ k u j x j f p f d f ε 6 f p b d 7 f d x j μ b μ k x j 8 f ε c ε ρ k 3 2 δ where f p is production f d diffusion and f ε dissipation terms respectively and c k 0 07 c ε 1 048 are model coefficients sagaut 2006 the dynamic model for the k equation can be derived using the germano identity l with another filter kernel of width δ 2 δ the theoretical background and implementation details are provided by fureby 1996 2 1 2 the smagorinsky model the conventional smagorinsky sgs model hereafter smag can be recovered from eq 5 by assuming local equilibrium i e f p f ε thus the sgs kinetic energy can be computed from the relation 9 b d c ε ρ k 3 2 δ 0 using eq 1 and introducing the following coefficients 10 a c ε δ b 2 3 tr d c 2 c k δ d d d the relation of eq 9 can be reformulated to a quadratic equation for k the final relation for k can be formulated as 11 k b b 2 4 a c 2 a 2 the models constants are c k 0 02 and c ε 1 048 sagaut 2006 the dissipation rate ε s g s from the smag model was expressed according to eq 8 2 1 3 the vreman model vreman 2004 proposed to express the eddy viscosity as 12 μ b c v ρ b β α i j α i j where 13 α i j u j x i β i j δ m 2 α m i α m j b β β 11 β 22 β 12 2 β 11 β 33 β 13 2 β 22 β 33 β 23 2 the model constant c v is related to the smagorinsky constant c s by the relation c v 2 5 c s 2 hereafter this model will be defined vr 2 1 4 the subgrid fluxes the subgrid fluxes sgsf were modeled according to a simple gradient diffusion gd approximation 14 b h μ b pr t h x j where pr t is the turbulence prandtl number here additional case is considered in conjunction with the sgsf closure based on the classical gradient hypothesis closure and clark s tensor diffusivity model within the diffusion term in eq 5 was replaced in the spirit of clark s model clark et al 1979 as 15 f d δ 2 12 x j u j x j k x j and the sub grid scalar flux as 16 b h δ 2 12 u j x j h x j 2 2 numerical method the present simulations were carried out using the openfoam v6 x weller et al 1998 code the governing equations were solved using the standard pressure velocity coupling methodology and the finite volume method based on the pimple algorithm robertson et al 2015 which is a variation of the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators method vandoormaal and raithby 1984 a smooth solver with a symmetrical gauss seidel smoother was used to compute the system of linear algebraic equations with a local accuracy of 10 7 for all dependent variables except pressure the last one was calculated using the geometric agglomerated algebraic multigrid solver gamg with the gauss seidel smoother and a local accuracy of 10 7 overall the numerical method has second order accuracy in space and time the convective terms were approximated by a so called limited linear scheme which belongs to the family of total variation diminishing tvd schemes harten 1983 bounded with a variation of the sweby limiter jasak et al 1999 have provided the details of implementation which were described consistency recently by robertson et al 2015 and cao and tamura 2016 the time integration was performed using the implicit euler method bdf 2 geurts 2004 the later was accompanied by the dynamic adjustable time stepping technique to guarantee a local courant number less than 0 4 with a typical corresponding step size δ t 5 10 7 s aspects of high performance computing have been highlighted in authors previous works e s lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the vilje high performance computing hpc facility https www sigma2 no content vilje was used for the present les most calculations were performed using 128 256 cores in parallel where typical calculation time for one time step varied between 1 2 s and the total effective simulation time per run took around ten days 3 test case description 3 1 experimental set up the description of the volvo test rig and relevant experimental data was provided in sjunnesson et al 1991 fig 1 shows a schematic drawing of the test section the set up consisted of a straight channel with a rectangular cross section divided into an inlet section length 0 5 m and a channel passage section length l 1 m and 0 12 m 0 24 m cross section the inlet section was used for flow straightening and turbulence control the air entering the inlet section was distributed over the cross section by a plate that at the same time isolated the channel acoustically from the air supply system the channel passage section ended in a circular duct with a large diameter the triangular cylinder with side length h 0 04 m was mounted with its reference position 0 681 m upstream of the channel exit the principal flow parameters and experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 where re is the reynolds number based on the triangle edge st is the strouhal number u is velocity t is temperature p is the static pressure and l r h represents the recirculation zone length the symbol denotes that a parameter is applied at the rig inlet the strouhal number st is defined as st f v s h u where f v s is the vortex shedding frequency 3 2 computational domain and grids the computational domain and the mesh strategy was inherited from the authors previous work lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 here we strongly follow lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 and provide some principal moments only fig 2 shows the computational domain and the unstructured mesh hereafter this grid has label m1 the computational domain consisted of three blocks the inlet block without bluff body was resolved by 135 70 45 nodes in the stream wise transverse and span wise directions respectively with exponential grading of cells towards the bluff body the central block included the obstacle and had a size of 0 2 m 0 12 m fig 2 the bluff body edges were discretized by 75 grid points while the stream wise transverse and span wise sides of the domain were resolved by 80 70 45 nodes respectively to obtain smooth mesh transition towards the flame holder the remaining downstream block had a resolution of 135 70 45 nodes with exponential decreasing of nodes towards the outlet the viscous boundary layers bl attached to the obstacle and the channel walls were designed based on the first element length and the growth factor which were set to 10 4 m and 1 15 both to the obstacle and wind tunnel walls the total number of bl rows were set to 13 and 7 for the obstacle and channel walls respectively finally such combination of parameters provided the estimated minimum and averaged non dimensional distance to the wall y were 0 1 4 6 and 0 1 5 4 for the obstacle and the channel walls respectively the second grid m2 was used to check the grid sensitivity of the present les results this grid was generated by simple adaption of the baseline mesh m1 by a factor of 1 5 in all three cartesian directions the span wise resolution for m1 and m2 grids was estimated as d z h 0 134 and d z h 0 08 respectively on the one hand the span wise wavelength of stream wise vortices in the shear layer l z s l and in the wake l z k could be estimated as l z s l h 0 1 25 re and l z k h 1 respectively at re o 10 4 williamson et al 1995 based on these relationships the present mesh resolutions can be considered to be sufficient to resolve the span wise wavelengths of the stream wise vortices in the wake and in the shear layers for re 50000 on the other hand cao et al 2020 presented the more stringent criterion d z h 0 02 to predict accurately the shear layer behaviors and the laminar turbulent transitional process also cao et al 2020 suggested that d z h may play some effects on development of the recirculation zone length this tendency can be interested and important to be analyzed in the future works however was not investigated in the present study due to resource limitations the mean drag coefficient c d h and mean recirculation zone length l r h were chosen as the most important integral parameters to assess the grid convergence study presented in fig 3 here the recirculation length l r is defined as the distance between the base of the triangular cylinder y 0 and the sign change of the centerline mean stream wise velocity the investigation was provided for the tke sgs model the initial mesh was derived from m1 by reducing the grid resolution in all directions by factor 1 5 not discussed here one can see clearly that a deviation for both parameters as a function of a cells number was bounded by 5 also the results obtained by the vreman sgs model using m1 and m2 grids were plotted in fig 3 it is interesting that the vreman sub grid scale model occurred to be more sensitive to the grid resolution this fact can be explained by dependency of the turbulent viscosity from the squared filter width δ eq 12 and 13 3 3 boundary conditions the inlet and outlet boundary conditions were set up to replicate the experiment the mean inlet velocity and temperature profiles were extracted and interpolated from urans at the location x h 2 lysenko and ertesvåg 2018 the inflow perturbations were not added due to the applied grid strategy where they will be highly damped due to expansion of the grid from the bluff body towards the inlet a non slipping condition for velocity was applied to the wind tunnel and the obstacle walls the lateral boundaries were treated as the symmetry planes the static pressure was maintained as 101 kpa the wave transmissive boundary condition was applied at the outlet to avoid propagating of any numerical oscillations from the outlet of the computational domain 3 4 overview of the numerical cases all simulated cases are listed in table 2 where the following abbreviations are used id case label mesh grid label br blockage ratio sgs subgrid scale model dynamic k equation eddy viscosity sub grid scale model dtke smagorinsky smag vreman vr sgsf the subgrid scalar flux approximation conventional gradient diffusion gd or clark cl the reynolds number was re 45000 for all cases the solution is considered to be statistically converged after two and half flow through times the flow through time was defined as the ratio between the axial length of the computational domain to the bulk velocity for a quantitative validation of the present les the averages have been obtained from the computational results by sampling over 35 vortex shedding periods n v s after the flow field was converged 4 results this section presents the obtained results in terms of the first order statistics and one dimensional spectral data the hat the tilde and the bar marks denoting favre averaging and filtering favre averaging were omitted for simplicity 4 1 first order statistics fig 4 shows the measured and calculated mean stream wise velocity fluctuations of the mean stream wise velocity and the normalized subgrid turbulence kinetic energy along the center line behind the obstacle for the sake of completeness besides the experimental results by sjunnesson et al 1991 the ldv data by sanquer et al 1998 and obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 were added overall there was a good agreement between numerical and experimental data one can observe the same trends between all numerical runs for the axial distribution of the mean stream wise velocity except the vc04 case which provided some discrepancies the normalized turbulence kinetic energy k n k u where the turbulence kinetic energy k 3 4 u 2 v 2 following the experiments of sjunneson et al sjunnesson et al 1991 is shown in fig 4 c it was a fairly good agreement between all numerical runs and experimental data comparison of first order statistics against experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 for the near wake at three different downstream locations x h 0 95 1 525 3 75 is provided in fig 5 fig 5 a c shows profiles for the mean stream wise velocity u u one can see that the present calculations agreed with the ldv measurements of sjunnesson et al 1991 quite satisfactory for all three axial states the experimental data by obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 was added as well for x h 0 95 and x h 1 525 it worth noting that the ldv data by obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 was obtained for re 75000 based on the non equilateral triangular cylinder moreover the blockage ratio was different between these two experiments which may explain several discrepancies observed in fig 5a and b in fig 5 d f the rms values of the stream wise velocity u u are shown the transitional nature of the shear layers resulted in the primary vortex formation parnaudeau et al 2008 and can be observed in the u profile with two strong peaks at x h 0 95 the same type of the u profile can be observed at x h 1 525 finally at x h 3 75 the u profile was more or less flat outside of the mean recirculation zone it was observed that all sgs models collapsed well to reproduce the experiment by sjunnesson et al 1991 some small deviations were observed between the present les and the ldv data but in general satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results was achieved significant deviations between the recirculation zone length l r obtained in numerical simulations and measurements are often observed for many turbulent bluff body flows typical flow patterns are displayed in fig 6 the present results converged to l r h 1 28 9 which was reasonably close to the experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 who measured l r h 1 35 the minimum l r was obtained by the smag model l r h 1 21 the calculated values by dtke and vr models were in the range l r h 1 24 1 46 however the available experimental works provided a large scattering of data l r h 1 35 1 8 the large variation in measurements can be explained by transitional effects in the separating shear layers reproduced by different setup of the wind tunnels and flow conditions 4 2 one dimensional energy spectra based on the moderate reynolds number re 45000 this flow can be attributed to the sub critical regime where the separated boundary layer stays laminar for re 200000 fig 7 illustrates the formation of the vortex street and coherent flow structures downstream of the bluff body showing the q criterion q s 2 ω 2 10 6 where s is the strain rate and ω is the vorticity the visualization displays the capability of the present les to resolve wide range of energetic flow structures developed in the turbulent wake the vortex shedding instability can be expressed by a characteristic frequency f v s st u h based on the strouhal number st to compute both characteristic frequencies of the vortex shedding and kelvin helmholtz kh instability the velocity signals were sampled in probes located at the vicinity of the bluff body at x h 1 75 and y h 0 in addition probes were located in places where the share layer instabilities develops from both sides of the cylinder about 1 5 10 5 samples of the cross flow velocities were collected over a dimensionless time interval t t u h 100 or n v p t f f s 35 the spectra calculated from these time series were then averaged in the span wise direction nine probe locations uniformly distributed were used to increase the statistical meaning to obtain the one dimensional spectra both fast fourier transform fft and the welch periodogram technique welch 1967 were used the computed value of the strouhal number of the vortex shedding frequency was st 0 27 1 3 which was found to be slightly over estimated by 7 4 compared to the experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 who predicted st 0 25 alternative experimental data provided in table 3 showed a variation of the strouhal between 0 21 0 26 over estimation of the vortex shedding frequency by the present les may be explained by the numerical effects related to the vortices quenching and their interaction with the channel walls fig 8 a compares one dimensional nondimensionalized frequency spectra at the downstream location x h 1 75 on the centerline of the wake the experimental results of ong and wallace 1996 sanquer et al 1998 and parnaudeau et al 2008 were plotted as well as a 5 3 slope all present numerical results yielded very similar power spectra where the inertial subrange was reproduced for a quite large spectral range one critical remark should be made here based on the spectra displayed in fig 8 a it can be observed that the tvd scheme produced some unnatural energy spectra as was originally discussed by cao and tamura 2016 they observed that the tvd scheme seems to exhibit different influences on the spectral curves tending to reduce the energy in the inertial subrange and increase energy in the dissipation range the separated shear layer behaves in a similar manner to a mixing layer when the recirculation zone length is sufficiently long the shear layer instability is based on the kelvin helmholtz mechanism and the characteristic frequency f k h for re 1200 leading to shear layer roll up into tightly concentrated vorticity shanbhogue et al 2009 from the experimental point of view several studies investigating the separated shear layer from the circular cylinder are available in the literature bloor 1964 maekawa and mizuno 1967 kourta et al 1987 norberg 1987 mihailovic and corke 1987 prasad and williamson 1997 rajagopalan and antonia 2005 bloor 1964 seems to be the first who studied the frequency of the shear layer instability waves she demonstrated that the shear layer instability frequency scaled approximately with re by considering the thickness and velocity of the separating laminar boundary layer lately prasad and williamson 1997 provided re evaluation of all data and reported that the exponent p in the expression f k h f v s a re p 0 0235 re 0 67 was significantly greater than 0 5 in every case dynamics of the shear layer transition of a square cylinder at the reynolds number range 15000 re 75000 have been investigated by lander et al 2018 they derived the relation f k h f v s 0 18 re 0 6 which was based on the hot wire measurements piv and dns studies the numerical data of brun et al 2008 and trias et al 2015 were analyzed as well these data were obtained at re 20000 les re 22000 direct numerical simulation and re 27000 laser doppler velocimetry ldv recently moore et al 2019 carried out a detailed experimental study of the separated shear layers stemming from rectangular sections with aspect ratios of 5 1 3 1 and 1 1 in the range 13400 re 118000 the reynolds number was based on the body thickness it was interesting that experimental results for f k h f v s obtained by moore et al 2019 for the 5 1 rectangular section was somewhere between the square prism and circular cylinder some limited compiled data are plotted in fig 9 moore et al 2019 reported that all geometries fit well with a power law however both the exponent and the coefficient are different for each bluff body geometry the authors previous les results calculated for the circular cylinder flow revealed f k h f v s 7 6 and f k h f v s 16 2 for re 3900 lysenko et al 2012 and re 20000 lysenko et al 2014 respectively these results were in good agreement with the available experimental data and numerical data dong et al 2006 in addition the dns study by trias et al 2015 provided for the square prism at re 22000 a relatively broadband frequency peak at f k h f v s 60 cao and tamura 2015 calculated the peaks of shear layer frequencies as f k h f v s 15 17 which were much smaller than the ldv measurement by minguez et al 2011 f k h f v s 45 the present les results obtained for the equilateral triangular cylinder predicted f k h f v s 13 74 16 01 fig 8 b presents the welch spectra computed for vc02 and vc04 these results were close to the experimental trend obtained for the circular cylinder 4 3 note on turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate the time history of the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate normalized by the mean ε ε is displayed in fig 8 c it is interesting that the numerical signals qualitatively reproduced the experimental signals of ε obtained respectively in a laboratory boundary layer and in the atmospheric surface layer by meneveau and sreenivasan meneveau et al 1991 in the present study the term f ε eq 8 has been sampled for each run at the location x h 1 75 y h 0 in the same spirit as for the velocity signals fft and the welch periodogram technique were applied to plot the one dimensional energy spectra provided in fig 8 d results of the high resolution dns by ishihara et al 2005 and the dissipation spectra measured by tsuji 1999 are added to compare the present les the model for the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate eq 8 relies on the assumption that for a fixed δ ε scales as k 3 2 in general the power law scaling ε k γ has been observed in several experimental studies assuming that γ is constant based on dns of forced isotropic turbulence chumakov 2007 found that the scaling assumption ε k γ holds reasonably well for sgs reynolds numbers of up to 5000 however the value of γ was not found to be a constant but to dependent on the proximity of the filter size δ to the forcing length scale chumakov 2007 reported that none of the observed scalings were close to ε k 3 2 which is widely used in the literature he found that γ 1 2 for δ close to forcing scale and γ 1 for δ in the near viscous range in accordance with meneveau and o neal meneveau et al 1991 in the inertial subrange γ varied between 0 6 0 9 monotonically with δ it is worth noting that the present les results revealed the spread of γ between 0 76 0 89 in spite of the fact that eq 8 was used to sample the dissipation rate this fact is demonstrated in fig 10 moreover the coefficient c ε from eq 8 was computed dynamically for each les run fig 11 displays variation of the mean c ε depending on the sgs model it is interesting to see that c ε can deviate significantly from its widely used value c ε 1 048 the present results showed that c ε maximum may reaches c ε 30 in some regions of the computation domain 5 discussion 5 1 overview high fidelity les on relatively coarse grids is important for practical engineering applications several modeling aspects may be considered on one hand when coarse grids are used in les the effect of the numerical modeling on the flow resolution is increased lloyd and james 2016 on the other hand effects of the subgrid modeling become more pronounced as well the unstructured grid strategy which is attractive for any practical applications due to ability to focus the refinement more effectively is better designed for isotropic eddy viscosity turbulence models lloyd and james 2016 however the sudden change in cell size across refinement region boundaries may be an issue and special considerations for the grid design should be taken into account e g by placed these interfaces away from key flow features table 3 incorporates integral flow parameters collected from available experimental and numerical les results in general flow physics which characterize the turbulent separated flow past a bluff body at the moderate reynolds number was captured well in the present numerical simulation the present numerical results obtained by the different algebraic sgs models were quite consistent with the dispersion of about 10 for the main integral quantities reasonable deviations were found for the first order statistics overall the present study matched reasonably well the corresponding experimental data sjunnesson et al 1991 however some important flow parameters like the drag and pressure coefficients were missed in the experimental data by sjunnesson et al 1991 also this particular experiment was performed in the wind tunnel channel with blockage ratio br 1 3 it is well known that blockage and interference effects need to be considered these effects may be relatively low but certainly affect the measured drag and pressure coefficients and other related parameters trias et al 2015 5 1 1 blockage effects most blockage theories make the assumption that the principal effect is an increase in free stream velocity and consequently fall in static pressure calvert 1967 for the sake of completeness we performed the additional les runs vc08 and vc09 to investigate the blockage effects for this case the baseline grid m1 was extended by top and bottom buffer domains to decrease the blockage to br 1 9 and br 1 20 keeping the free stream re and m numbers the same furthermore the alternative hwa measurements by calvert 1967 were used to assess sensitivity results to the br effects fig 12 provides the instantaneous flow visualization based on the q criterion and some aspects of the grid for br 1 9 one can clearly see the difference in the flow fields obtained for br 1 3 and br 1 9 displayed in figs 7 and 12 respectively the calculated strouhal numbers st 0 20 0 21 were indicating that the vortex shedding formation was significantly less intensive for the unconfined cases also this value agreed reasonably with the data reported by okamoto et al 1977 st 0 21 zheng et al 2016 st 0 21 and yagmur et al 2017 st 0 219 0 225 it is worth noting that the experimental studies demonstrated the clear tendency on decreasing of st with decreasing of br thus fujii et al 1978 provided st 0 4 for br 1 2 sjunnesson et al 1991 and sanquer et al 1998 measured st 0 25 0 26 for br 1 3 other researchers presented st 0 171 0 225 for br 1 3 calvert 1967 okamoto et al 1977 zheng et al 2016 yagmur et al 2017 the time averaged pressure coefficient c p 2 p p ρ u 2 where p and ρ are the free stream pressure and density respectively at the surface of a triangular cylinder is displayed in fig 13 a the results of vc01 br 1 3 vc08 br 1 9 and vc09 br 1 20 are compared against the experimental data by tatsuno et al 1990 and okamoto et al 1977 the calculated integral values of the base suction coefficient for br 1 9 and br 1 20 were c p b 1 25 and 1 09 which correlated reasonably with the experimental value obtained by tatsuno et al 1990 and okamoto et al 1977 who measured c p b 1 38 and c p b 1 09 respectively also calvert 1967 presented a significantly different value c p b 0 375 the calculated base suction coefficient for br 1 3 was c p b 2 19 4 5 the base suction coefficient is strongly related to the drag coefficient c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force in the stream wise direction and a is the projection area of the front view the calculated drag coefficients for br 1 9 and br 1 20 were c d 1 51 and 1 42 which matched reasonably the experimental and numerical results available in the literature okamoto et al 1977 presented c d 1 26 for the reynolds number re 22000 tatsuno et al 1990 reported c d 1 4 for re 90000 recently yagmur et al 2017 reported c d 1 43 using les for re 11600 all these values were quite close to the data provided by naca tn3038 fig 13 c summarizes these findings the calculated drag coefficients for br 1 3 were significantly higher c d 2 57 with a dispersion of 8 yeung and parkinson 2000 developed and reported an analytical dependence of the drag versus the base suction coefficient this dependence has a linear distribution for the triangular cylinders and wedges and is displayed in fig 13 b the present les results are plotted in the same figure and were tending to the similar distribution the experimental data by fujii et al 1978 who reported c p b 2 67 for br 1 2 satisfied this tendency as well the first order statistics obtained for br 1 20 1 9 1 3 are displayed in fig 14 together with the available experimental data by calvert 1967 and sjunnesson et al 1991 for the sake of completeness we added the piv measurements by yagmur et al 2017 and ldv data by sanquer et al 1998 and obara et al obara and matsudaira 1998 in general the discrepancies observed between numerical results by vc08 vc09 and vc01 were tending only to a small permanent bias which may be explained by the similarity of the numerical method used for both les calculations however more pronounced differences can be found between the hwa data by calvert 1967 and the ldv measurements by sjunnesson et al 1991 meaning that setup of the physical experiment and properties of the wind tunnel test section affected the results it worth notice that numerical results obtained for vc08 and vc09 matched reasonably indicating only small influence of the blockage effects on the downstream wake for br 1 9 6 conclusions a large eddy simulation of the turbulent flow over an equilateral triangular cylinder at reynolds number re 45000 based on the triangle edge has been performed to replicate the well known experimental of the volvo test rig a fully conservative finite volume method of the second order accuracy in space and time based on the openfoam technology was used the family of the algebraic eddy viscosity sgs models including the conventional smagorinsky vreman and dynamic version of k equation has been assessed in the present study time averaged results have been presented and compared against experimental data the agreement with the ldv measurements in the wake region for the mean stream wise velocity and its fluctuation was rather good the axial distribution of the turbulence kinetic energy matches experimental data reasonably well suggesting that the present les resolved a significant part of the turbulent scales integral flow characteristics like the mean drag and surface pressure coefficients have been compared against alternative measurements available in the literature the agreement was quite satisfactory in spite the slightly different flow setup and conditions finally the spectral analysis of the velocity samples has been carried out to compute both the kh and von kármán instabilities the numerical predicted strouhal numbers were in a fairly good agreement with the measured indicating that the weak dynamics were well captured however comparison of the energy spectra showed that the numerical method was slightly over dissipative which may be explained by application of the tvd scheme and unstructured grids artificially tending to reduce the energy at the low frequencies and increase energy at the higher frequencies these finding supports the observations of cao and tamura 2016 furthermore it was found that the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate scaled according to the power law with γ 0 77 0 89 unlikely to the widely used value γ 3 2 overall the above mentioned good agreement of the integral flow features and turbulence statistics that the bluff body flow physics is well reproduced all sgs models are agreed reasonably well

researchers grew fast throughout the world as proved by the deployment of the first marine energy prototypes in the real environment and the increasing number of funding opportunities in this respect in march 2018 the european commission endorsed the ocean energy implementation plan eu 2018 developed by the temporary working group for ocean energy where a set of technical financial and environmental actions devoted to support the deployment of marine energy converters are provided besides the document furnishes a strategic roadmap with several key action plans in order to ensure the clean energy transition of the european countries and develop well established and mature technologies capable of covering a significant amount of the eu power demand over the next 35 years among the various marine renewable sources wave energy probably represents the most promising one with a theoretical annual potential in europe of about 2800 twh magagna 2019 anyway the levelised cost of energy l c o e is still high if compared with other renewable technologies such as the solar or the onshore wind ones with a reference value equal to 0 720 and 0 560 kwh in 2015 and 2018 respectively so proving that the marine energy sector is not mature enough for the international market in this respect the european commission has set ambitious targets for wec devices which are expected to reach a l c o e of 0 200 kwh by 2025 0 150 kwh by 2030 and 0 100 kwh by 2035 this roadmap towards the commercial phase reveals to be ambitious as wec devices still need to achieve a significant amount of operational hours in real environment combined with a reasonable level of power production in order to gain the trust of investors and manufactures indeed the pathway towards the cost reduction needs to combine economies of scale based on large industrial production and optimised maintenance operations and learning by research through the improvement of currently embodied technologies among the variety of wec devices point absorbers represent one of the most promising technologies due to the relatively simple working principle since the pioneering work by budal and falnes 1975 considerable improvements have been gained from both theoretical and experimental point of views the hydrodynamic modelling of this wec device coupled with electric or hydraulic power take off pto units has been widely investigated by several researchers thorough the world pastor and liu 2014 piscopo et al 2016 do et al 2018 kolios et al 2018 among others recently attention has been also paid to improve the hydrodynamic performances by increasing the freedom degrees al shami et al 2019 applying a tuned inertial mass haraguchi and asai 2020 or developing novel layouts to enhance the survivability in extreme sea state conditions zheng et al 2020 in current analysis the floating buoy layout recently developed by piscopo and scamardella 2019 and consisting of a hemispherical buoy connected by means of a deep draught vertical cylinder to a fully submerged toroidal shape is assumed as reference design to maximize the power production and decrease the cost of energy the new point absorber allows increasing the power production as regards a similarly sized single body wec device consisting of a hemispherical floating buoy by properly tuning the heave natural period with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect based on the main outcomes by piscopo and scamardella 2019 the new layout allows i obtaining an appreciable increase of the annualised energy production up to 60 for low and medium energy power production site as regards conventional single body point absorbers and ii properly tuning the main dimensions of the toroidal shape depending on the wave climate at the deployment site the point absorber is connected by means of a tensioned wire rope to a permanent magnet linear generator pmlg equipped with a gravity based foundation such as that one developed at the uppsala university sjökvist and göteman 2017 particularly a parametric analysis is performed by systematically varying the height of the fully submerged volume in order to properly tune the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect the main aims of current research can be summarized as follows i the annualised energy production a e p of the new wec device is systematically assessed based on the met ocean conditions at the candidate deployment site located in the western mediterranean sea in order to carry out a comparative analysis with a reference wec device consisting of a hemispherical buoy with the same waterplane area besides the hydrodynamic behaviour of the wec device in extreme sea state conditions is investigated and the scantling of the tensioned wire rope connecting the floating buoy to the pmlg translator mass is performed based on both ultimate uls and fatigue fls limit state design conditions ii a comparative analysis in terms of l c o e is performed between the new and the reference wec device in order to further investigate the effectiveness of the new layout iii a sensitivity analysis is performed to explore a possible reduction pathway of the l c o e by combining both economical operational and technological aspects with the main aim of gaining the eu target that should be reached by 2025 the hydrodynamic analysis is carried out by a non linear time domain model solved by a dedicated code developed in matlab mathworks 2018 including the heave surge and pitch motions of the floating buoy and the vertical motion of the pmlg translator mass 2 hydrodynamic modelling 2 1 the wec layout the point absorber recently designed by piscopo and scamardella 2019 and depicted in fig 1 is assumed as reference wec device it has a spar type configuration consisting of a floating hemisphere and a deep draught vertical cylinder connected to a fully submerged toroidal shape by means of 8 equally spaced bracings the floating buoy is entirely built in normal strength steel nss apart from the toroidal shape which is made of marine concrete filled with polyurethane foam additional concrete ballast is located in the floating hemisphere in order to properly tune the vertical coordinate of the wec device centre of mass and achieve a 1 0 m metacentric height the device is connected to a gravity based permanent magnet linear generator pmlg lying on the seabed thanks to a heavy marine concrete foundation by means of a tensioned line that exerts the heave motion of the pmlg translator mass thanks to this layout no holes need to be carried out into the seabed with a substantial decrease of the capital expenditure costs requires to install the pto unit of the wec device 2 2 the hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model of the wec device shall account for i inertial damping and restoring forces ii non linear drag forces iii tensioned line forces including possible slack conditions iv reaction forces exerted by the pto upper lower end stop springs and v electromechanical forces due to full partial overlapping between the pmlg stator and translator mass the time domain model consisting of four equations for the heave ς 3 surge ς 1 and pitch ς 5 motions of the floating buoy and the vertical motion ς t of the pmlg translator mass can be written as follows 1 m b a 33 ζ 3 t k 33 t τ ς 3 τ d τ ϱ g a w p ς 3 f e 3 f d 3 f l cos ϑ m b g ρ g m b a 11 ζ 1 t k 11 t τ ς 1 τ d τ a 15 ζ 5 t k 15 t τ ς 5 τ d τ f e 1 f d 1 f l sin ϑ i a 55 ζ 1 t

moment of inertia about the axis passing through the buoy centre of gravity while a i j and k i j are the added mass at infinite frequency and the radiation impulse response function associated with a force in the i th direction due to an oscillatory motion in the j th mode reference is made to the list of symbols and acronyms for the meaning of all physical quantities besides ϑ asin ς 1 s z g ς 5 ℓ ς 1 ℓ is the angle of the tensioned line about the vertical depending on the coupled surge and pitch motions of the floating buoy the impulse response function is determined by the inverse fourier transform of the frequency dependent radiation coefficients b i j according to eq 2 cummins 1962 2 k i j t 2 π 0 b i j ω cos ω t d ω in eq 1 the convolution integrals involving the past motion history and representing the memory effect due to radiated waves are resembled by an approximate state space realization yu and falnes 1995 via the hankel singular value decomposition algorithm kung 1978 and subsequently reduced to a 5th order model safonov and chiang 1989 in order to speed up the calculations the random wave force f e i exerting the i th motion mode is determined by the following convolution product according to eq 3 3 f e i k e i t τ η τ d τ where η is the random wave elevation and k e i is the i th excitation kernel function that in turn depends on the frequency dependent exciting force per unit wave amplitude f e i by eq 4 4 k e i t 1 π r 0 f e i ω exp i ω t d t as concerns the drag forces they are determined according to the relative velocity formulation dnv 2010 so considering both current and wave particle velocity as further detailed in appendix a besides the tensioned line force includes i the pretension due to the suspended pmlg translator mass ii the line stretching due to the relative motion between the floating buoy and the translator mass and iii possible slack conditions during the downward motion of the pmlg translator mass in this respect the line stretching due to combined heave surge and pitch motions is determined by eq 5 5 δ l ℓ ς 3 ς t 2 ς 1 s z g ς 5 2 ℓ hence after performing a first order taylor series expansion the line force is determined by eq 6 6 f l max m t g e a ℓ ς 3 ς t ς 1 s z g ς 5 2 2 ℓ 0 as concerns the pto unit the forces exerted by the upper and lower end stop springs arise when the vertical motion of the translator mass exceeds the upper ℓ p t o u or the lower ℓ p t o l pto free stroke length according to the following equations depending on the spring stiffness k s and the maximum compressibility δ s according to eqs 7 and 8 7 f s u 0 i f ς t ℓ p t o u k s ς t ℓ p t o u i f ℓ p t o u ς t ℓ p t o u δ s k s δ s e a ℓ ς 3 ς t ς 1 s z g ς 5 2 2 ℓ ς t ℓ p t o u δ s 8 f s l 0 f ς t ℓ p t o l k s ς t ℓ p t o l i f ς t ℓ p t o l finally the full partial overlapping between the stator and translator mass is accomplished by the active area ratio parameter a a c t that is determined by eq 9 ulvgård et al 2016 9 a a c t 0 i f ς t 1 2 l t l s 1 i f ς t 1 2 l t l s 1 min l t l s 1 2 l t l s ς t else after assessing the vertical motion of the translator mass the mean electrical power in the time interval t is established by the following equation depending on the efficiency η e of the pmlg falcão 2010 10 p e γ η e t 0 t a a c t ζ t 2 d t the formula provided by eq 10 for the power production assessment of the wec device is based on a slightly simplified representation of the pto unit depending on two main parameters namely the damping γ and the active area ratio a a c t really a more refined model including electro magnetic induction based calculations should be addressed nevertheless the effectiveness of the currently embodied approach has been widely proved by eriksson et al 2007 who validated the numerical model against a set of open sea experimental data collected between march and may 2006 on a reference wec device deployed 2 km off the swedish coastline on 25 m depth particularly they carried out a comparative analysis between simulations and open sea experimental data based on 2386 time series of measured voltages and wave elevations each one having a duration between 20 and 30 min and an incident wave power flux up to 20 kw m they concluded that the numerical model for the hydrodynamic analysis of the wec device based on the same modelling assumptions concerning the pto unit embodied in current calculations was well suited for the design of point absorber devices hence denoting by p i the probability of occurrence of the i th sea state and by p e i the mean electrical power the annualised energy production a e p in kwh is determined by the following equation falcão 2010 11 a e p 8760 i 1 n s p i p e i having denoted by n s the number of sea state conditions depending on the wave statistics at the deployment site besides the wave power transmitted to the floating buoy is determined by eq 12 12 p w ϱ g d 0 c g ω s ς ω d ω having denoted by c g the frequency dependent wave group velocity and by s ς the wave spectrum hence the available annual energy amount is determined by eq 11 after replacing the mean electrical power p e i in a given sea state by the mean wave power p w i further details about all quantities embodied in the previous equations are provided in the list of symbols and acronyms the hydrodynamic model provided by eq 1 can be simplified neglecting the surge and pitch motions by adding the conditions ς 1 ς 5 0 that imply ϑ 0 in this respect the simplified heave motion is sufficient to assess the power production of the wec device as the surge effect is negligible miquel et al 2017 piscopo et al 2020 while the full hydrodynamic model is required when the motion of the floating buoy in extreme sea state conditions needs to be investigated 2 3 strength check of the connection line the connection line provides the station keeping of the floating buoy apart from exerting the vertical motion of the pmlg translator mass so as it needs to be checked against uls and fls criteria the uls strength check is provided by the following equation dnv gl 2015 which is similar to that one commonly embodied for mooring systems of offshore structures benassai et al 2014 campanile et al 2018 among others 13 s c γ p r e t t p r e t γ e n v t e n v 0 where s c is the characteristic line capacity corresponding to its minimum breaking strength t p r e t m t g is the line pretension and t e n v t m p m t p r e t is the characteristic environmental tension depending on the most probable maximum line tension t m p m in eq 13 γ p r e t γ e n v is the partial safety factor on line pretension environmental tension for single point permanent mooring systems with consequence class 1 dnv gl 2015 as any failure of the tensioned line is unlikely to lead to unacceptable consequences such as loss of life uncontrolled oil or gas outflow capsize or sinking as concerns the most probable maximum line tension it is determined based on 20 independent simulations each one having a 3 hour duration particularly the extreme sample of each simulation is established as the maximum of the line force realization subsequently the maxima are fitted by the gumbel distribution and the most probable maximum is determined by eq 14 dnv gl 2015 14 t m p m μ 0 45 σ having denoted by μ and σ the mean and standard deviation of the maxima observed from each simulation besides in absence of specific requirements for wec devices it is assumed that the environmental loads have a characteristic value corresponding to a 50 year return period which is the value commonly embodied in the structural assessment of floating wind turbines dnv gl 2018 as concerns the fatigue strength check the tensioned line shall have a minimum life of 25 years based on eq 15 dnv gl 2015 15 1 d c γ f 0 where d c is the characteristic fatigue damage accumulated as a result of cycling loading during the entire lifetime of the wec device and γ f is the safety factor for fls design finally the cumulative fatigue damage is determined on the basis of the narrow banded spectrum approach according to eq 16 16 d c t d a d γ m 2 1 i 1 n s ν i p i 2 2 σ i m where t d is the fatigue life of the tensioned line γ is the gamma function ν i σ i is the mean up crossing rate standard deviation of the stress process and a d m is the intercept slope parameter of the s n curve depending on the material embodied for the tensioned line 3 main data for the hydrodynamic analysis 3 1 environmental loads the parametric design performed in section 4 is carried out assuming that the wave farm is deployed at alghero about 3 km off the sardinia coastline provided that this is one of the most energetic sites in the western mediterranean sea the wave statistics are provided by the italian sea wave measurement network apat 2006 currently managed by the governmental institution ispra namely istituto superiore per la protezione e la ricerca ambientale in this respect table 1 provides the wave statistics at the deployment site based on 0 5 m significant wave height and 0 5 s mean wave period classes for a total of 31725 measurements in the reference period from 1st july 1989 to 14th june 2002 table 2 reports the annual wave energy distribution in mwh that is available for a wec device having a 5 0 m wide waterplane area in all cases the jonswap wave spectrum dnv 2010 is embodied combined with a peak enhancement factor equal to 1 86 apat 2016 besides fig 2 a and b report the h s and t 1 marginal distributions from which it is gathered that the prevailing sea state conditions correspond to a mean wave period between 4 and 5 s furthermore fig 3 a and b provide the wave energy marginal distributions from which it is gathered that the most energetic sea states correspond to significant wave height and mean wave period classes ranging from 2 5 up to 3 5 m and from 7 0 up to 8 0 s respectively in absence of complete statistics at the deployment site the one hour wind speed at 10 m above the sea water level u 1 h 10 is determined by the implicit limit equation 17 proposed by michell 1999 17 g h s u 1 h 10 2 0 243 tanh 0 011 g f u 1 h 10 2 1 2 where h s is the significant wave height and f is the fetch length equal to 100 km which is a typical value for the mediterranean sea hence the ten minute wind speed at 10 m above the sea water level u 10 10 is related to the previous value by eq 18 dnv 2010 18 u 10 10 u 1 h 10 1 0 047 ln 6 after assessing the reference wind speed the wind generated current velocity at still water level is determined by eq 19 dnv 2010 19 v c 0 03 u 1 h 10 the slab profile is embodied to model the variation of the current velocity with the water depth as concerns the extreme sea state conditions the 50 year significant wave height required to perform the uls strength check of the connection line is equal to 9 8 m sartini et al 2015 with 10 s wave period apat 2006 3 2 point absorber main data the main dimensions of the wec device depicted in fig 1 are listed in table 3 the point absorber consists of a 5 0 m floating buoy connected to the fully submerged toroidal shape by means of a tapered cylinder having a diameter equal to 1 0 and 1 5 m at the connection with the buoy and the fully submerged volume respectively the inner and outer diameters of the toroidal shape are equal to 7 0 and 9 0 m while its height ranges from 1 0 up to 2 0 m with 0 5 m step the submergence of the toroidal shape is set equal to 15 m so reducing possible hydrodynamic interferences between the floating buoy and the fully submerged volume that would have led to a high drop off of power production besides a reference point absorber consisting of a similarly sized floating buoy without the fully submerged toroidal shape h 0 is also investigated to make possible a comparative analysis between the new and the reference wec device in terms of annualised energy production and levelized cost of energy further details about the materials required for the floating buoy the toroidal shape and the additional concrete ballast are provided in appendix b before performing the hydrodynamic analysis of the wec devices it must be pointed out that some of the main dimensions of the new point absorber were selected based on the main outcomes of the previous work by piscopo and scamardella 2019 where the floating buoy diameter was set equal to 5 0 m to make possible the coupling with the 20 kw pmlg embodied in current analysis similarly the inner and outer diameters of the fully submerged toroidal shape were selected to minimize the heave damping of the wec device with a positive impact on power production finally the submergence of the toroidal shape was selected with the main aim of reducing the hydrodynamic interferences between the submerged volume and the floating buoy without significantly increasing the inertial loads on the wec device that in turn would have led to a negative impact on the scantlings of the deep draught vertical cylinder piscopo and scamardella 2019 the frequency dependent added mass radiation damping and exciting forces per unit wave amplitude are assessed by the free source boundary element code nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 the heave response amplitude operators r a o 3 of the wec devices are reported in fig 4 from which it is gathered that the fully submerged toroidal shape allows significantly varying the hydrodynamic behaviour of the wec device from overdamped to underdamped so producing a consistent increase of power production secondly it causes an appreciable shifting of the heave natural period that in turn can be properly tuned in order to maximize the power production depending on the prevailing sea states at the deployment site as concerns the tensioned line the wec device is equipped with a six strand steel wire rope with fibre core dnv 2009 the main data are reported in table 4 while the minimum diameter is selected in order to fulfil the uls and fls strength check criteria dnv gl 2015 outlined in sub section 2 3 3 3 pmlg main data the gravity based pmlg designed by ulvgård et al 2016 and further investigated by sjökvist and göteman 2017 is assumed as reference pto unit the only change as regards the reference layout concerns the upper free stroke length which is increased in order to i accomplish the large vertical motions of the floating buoy in extreme sea state conditions ii reduce the maximum line tension iii limit the wave overtopping events of the floating buoy and iv significantly decrease the minimum required mass of the pto marine concrete foundation the pmlg main data are reported in table 5 4 parametric design 4 1 aep assessment the a e p assessment of the wec devices is carried out by the simplified heave model as surge and pitch motions have an almost negligible impact on power production miquel et al 2017 piscopo et al 2020 based on the results outlined in table 6 the new layout allows gaining an appreciable increase of the a e p ranging from 53 up to 70 as regards the reference wec device this outcome is due to the improved hydrodynamic behaviour of the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape in this respect fig 5 a d provide the power production of the selected wec devices versus the significant wave height and the mean wave period from which it is gathered that the new layout allows shifting the mean wave period corresponding to maximum power production from 3 5 up to 5 0 s so matching the prevailing sea states at the deployment site with a consequent increase of the a e p as regards the reference configuration this outcome is also confirmed by the efficiency histograms reported in fig 6 a d as a function of the mean wave period in fact the maximum efficiency of the reference wec device occurs at 3 0 s while it ranges from 4 0 up to 4 5 s for the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape 4 2 strength check of the connection line the strength check of the tensioned line is performed by the full hydrodynamic model in order to account for possible interactions between the heave surge and pitch motions of the floating buoy in extreme sea state conditions hence table 7 provides the minimum diameter of the tensioned line satisfying both the uls and the fls strength check criteria as predictable the wire rope diameter increases with the dimensions of the fully submerged toroidal shape due to the higher inertial loads exerted by the floating buoy on the pmlg translator mass 4 3 lcoe assessment the levelized cost of energy is determined by eq 20 iea and nea 2015 20 l c o e 1 a v a a e p c a p e x r 1 r n 1 r n 1 o p e x where c a p e x o p e x is the capital annual operational cost r is the discount rate n and a v a are the lifetime and the availability of the wec device in current analysis the operational lifetime is set equal to 20 years which is the reference value for the marine renewable energy sector de andres et al 2016 combined with a 12 discount rate magagna 2019 and 98 availability assuming that power production is stopped one week a year for the scheduled maintenance operations as concerns the o p e x expenditure it is quite challenging to provide a reliable estimate of the yearly maintenance costs as this type of technology is not mature enough and no much experience has been collected till now on long term power production in real environment piscopo et al 2017 2018 hence in current analysis the o p e x is assumed equal to 5 of c a p e x which is the reference value for the ocean energy sector magagna 2019 as concerns the assessment of capital expenditure it can be split into four main cost items the pto unit that includes i the ferrite magnets on the pmlg translator mass ii the electric cable on the pmlg stator iii the 1 kv electric cable connecting the pmlg to the marine substation iv the steel casing v the marine concrete foundation vi other parts and vi the assembly expenses the floating buoy that includes i the floating buoy structure made of normal strength steel nss with all cost centres experienced during the shipbuilding process ii the marine concrete toroidal shape filled with polyurethane foam iii the additional concrete ballast in the floating buoy required to properly tune the vertical position of the wec device centre of mass and achieve a 1 0 m metacentric height iv the wire rope connecting the floating buoy to the pto unit v the painting of the external surfaces of the floating buoy and vi other parts the electric connection of the marine substation to the ashore grid that includes pro quota i the ashore power cable and ii the marine substation bearing in mind that up to 24 wec devices can be generally connected to the same unit ericsson and gregorson 2018 the deployment costs that include i the harbour crane for the handling of the wec device from the shipyard to the barge crane unit and ii the barge crane itself including the cost of consumables crew and divers all unit cost items are reported in table 8 while the c a p e x breakdown is further detailed in appendix c most of the cost items related to the pto unit and the marine substation are provided by ericsson and gregorson 2018 while the installation costs are suggested by chatzigiannakou et al 2019 besides the unit cost of the nss floating buoy and the pmlg steel casing is assessed by the procedure outlined by gordo and leal 2018 that provides the typical cost breakdown experienced in the shipbuilding process and consisting of material cutting transport forming assembly and welding expenditures furthermore the labour cost is assumed equal to 20 hour which is the mean value for specialized workers in italy together with a 20 revenue of the shipbuilder only some cost items have been selected by market analysis finally table 9 provides the c a p e x and the l c o e of the selected wec devices particularly the capital cost increases with the dimensions of the fully submerged volume due to the additional materials required to build the deep draught vertical cylinder the connection bracings and the marine concrete toroidal shape nevertheless the l c o e of the new wec device significantly decreases as regards the reference layout since the additional capital costs are widely counterbalanced by the corresponding a e p increase 5 discussion by the hydrodynamic analysis carried out in section 4 the wec device with the fully submerged toroidal shape is effective to increase the power production and decrease the cost of energy in this respect by fig 7 a it is gathered that the layout with a 2 0 m high toroidal shape maximises the a e p with a 70 increase as regards the reference configuration besides by fig 7 b the new point absorber allows gaining a 16 reduction of the l c o e as regards the reference layout almost independently of the toroidal shape dimensions according to the previous analysis the l c o e of the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape is always lower than the reference value for wec devices that is equal to 0 560 kwh in 2018 magagna 2019 so proving that the new layout is effective to reduce the cost of energy and make the marine energy sector more competitive on the international market indeed this outcome is particularly meaningful as the deployment site located in the mediterranean sea has a moderate annual wave energy flux if compared with the more energetic sites located in the atlantic ocean off the spanish coastline or in the north sea area where the cost of energy is expected to reduce further anyway the l c o e is still high and quite far from the european set plan declaration of intent for ocean energy eu 2018 that has set ambitious targets for the wave energy sector equal to 0 200 kwh by 2025 and 0 150 kwh by 2030 the reasons of this gap depend on a variety of factors among which i the discount rate ii the wec device lifetime iii the steel cost and iv the deployment expenditure in this respect fig 8 a d provide the sensitivity analysis of the l c o e for the point absorber with a 1 0 m high toroidal shape focusing on the above mentioned cost items combined with three values of the annual operational expenditure namely 5 4 and 3 of capital costs particularly fig 8 a investigates the incidence of the discount rate on the l c o e this variable is mainly related to the risk perception of the marine renewable energy sector on the international market and plays a fundamental role to decrease the cost of energy hence if the discount rate diminishes from 12 up to 4 which is the value for well established renewable technologies such as the solar and onshore wind ones a consistent decrease of the l c o e up to about 45 if combined with a 3 o p e x can be attained fig 8 b focuses on the design lifetime of the wec device which is systematically increased from 20 up to 25 years that is the reference value for ships and offshore structures based on current results a maximum 14 decrease of the l c o e is attained in conjunction with a 3 o p e x as concerns the steel and deployment costs they are plotted in fig 8 c and d respectively as concerns the steel unit cost it was assumed equal to 3 0 kg in the parametric design nevertheless this value is conservative and significant savings up to 30 of the above mentioned value can be gained in view of mass production by automating the assembly processes and lowering the shipyard revenue that was set equal to 20 hence a further 20 reduction of the l c o e can be gained if the steel unit cost is lowered by 30 similarly appreciable savings up to 30 of the reference value for the deployment costs can be gained if a consistent number of wec is deployed and the tugboat deployment method is embodied in place of the more expensive barge crane one chatzigiannakou et al 2019 based on previous remarks several reduction strategies involving economical operational and technological issues need to be contemporarily embodied in order to drop off the l c o e in this respect table 10 provides a comparative analysis between the actual and the next future values of the l c o e based on the main outcomes of the sensitivity analysis further details about the c a p e x assessment of the wec devices based on 30 reduction of steel and deployment costs are reported in appendix d current results are summarized in fig 9 from which it is gathered that the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape achieves the eu target of 0 200 kwh that should be reached by 2025 almost independently of the submerged volume size 6 conclusions the parametric design of a resonant point absorber with a fully submerged toroidal shape has been performed with the main aim of comparing the hydrodynamic performances of the new wec device with a reference layout consisting of a floating hemisphere the point absorber is connected by means of a tensioned line to a pto unit with gravity based foundation and an increased upper free stroke length in order to accomplish the large vertical motions of the translator mass in extreme sea state conditions a non linear time domain model for surge heave and pitch motions of the floating buoy has been developed and combined with the vertical motion of the pmlg translator mass subsequently a design procedure for the tensioned wire rope connecting the floating buoy to the pto unit and exerting the vertical motion of the translator mass has been provided based on both uls and fls strength check criteria hence a candidate site located in the western mediterranean sea has been selected for the possible deployment of the wave farm the assessment of the annualised energy production as well as the design of the tensioned wire rope have been performed based on the met ocean conditions at the deployment site focusing on four wec devices the former is the reference layout consisting of a floating hemisphere while the remaining ones are equipped with the fully submerged toroidal shape with height ranging from 1 0 up to 2 0 m in order to properly tune the heave natural period of the wec device depending on the prevailing sea states at the deployment site the parametric design aimed to assess and compare the hydrodynamic performances of the above mentioned layouts in terms of a e p and l c o e based on current results the following main outcomes have been achieved i the new wec device allows gaining an appreciable increase of the a e p as regards the reference layout ranging from 50 up to 70 depending on the height of the fully submerged toroidal shape this result is mainly attributable to the improved hydrodynamic behaviour of the new point absorber and the shifting of the heave natural period that matches the prevailing sea states at the deployment site with a consequent increase of power production furthermore the new layout reveals to be effective also in extreme sea state conditions as proved by the fulfilment of both the uls and fls strength check criteria for the tensioned wire rope ii the new point absorber allows achieving an appreciable decrease of the l c o e as regards the reference wec device that is equal to about 16 independently of the height of the fully submerged toroidal shape this outcome is achieved as the c a p e x increase of the new layout is widely counterbalanced by the higher power production as regards the reference layout furthermore the l c o e of the new point absorber is equal to about 0 480 kwh so below the reference value for the marine energy sector that is equal to 0 560 kwh in 2018 iii the sensitivity analysis clearly highlights that there is wide space to consistently reduce the l c o e by combining both economical operational and technological issues in this respect the l c o e of the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape can be lowered up to 0 200 kwh so matching the eu target to be reached by 2025 this result can be achieved by properly varying the discount rate the design lifetime of the wec device the steel and deployment costs and the operational expenditures as proved by the sensitivity analysis based on current results the resonant point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape seems to be a promising layout to i more efficiently harness the wave energy resources with a positive impact in terms of marine spatial planning and ii make the marine renewable energy sector more competitive on the international market in fact the new layout allows increasing by 70 the a e p and decreasing by 16 the l c o e as regards the reference wec device these outcomes can be achieved by designing a new generation of pmlgs with increased upper free stroke length and by properly tuning the heave natural period of the wec device depending on the met ocean conditions at the deployment site further improvements can be gained by increasing the nominal power of the pto unit and the main dimensions of the floating buoy in order to match the eu target of 0 150 kwh that should be reached by 2030 and move the marine energy sector towards the marketing phase in real environment these topics will be the subject of future works notes the wec device with the fully submerged toroidal shape is covered by the italian patent demand

have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a the drag forces provided by eq 1 are assessed by the relative velocity formulation accounting for current and wave particle velocity the heave drag force f d 3 is the sum of several terms due to the floating hemisphere the vertical cylinder the bracings and the fully submerged toroidal shape as reported in eq a 1 where reference is made to the list of symbols and acronyms for the meaning of all physical quantities a 1 f d 3 1 2 ρ c b 3 a b 3

depending on the vertical position of each structural element besides the last three terms are null for the reference wec device without the fully submerged toroidal shape as concerns the surge drag force f d 1 it is determined in a similar way after replacing the vertical wave particle velocity by the horizontal one and adding the current velocity based on eq a 2 a 2 f d 1 1 2 ρ c b 1 a b 1 ς 1

surge drag force as regards the wec device centre of mass reference is made to the recommended practice dvn rp c205 dnv 2010 for the evaluation of the drag coefficients for heave and surge motions appendix b the weight distribution of the wec devices is provided in table b 1 together with the vertical position of each element as regards the waterline upward positive as previously said the reference wec device without the toroidal shape consists of a floating buoy entirely made of normal strength steel nss with additional concrete permanent ballast in order to properly tune the centre of mass vertical position and achieve a 1 0 metacentric height the three point absorbers with the fully submerged toroidal shape instead are also equipped with a deep draught vertical cylinder and 8 bracings in nss while the toroidal shape is made of marine concrete 2400 kg m3 filled by polyurethane foam 80 kg m3 as concerns the structural elements in nss the equivalent thickness of the upper deck is assumed equal to 8 mm as no static loads are applied the equivalent thickness of the upper cylinder and the hemisphere is taken equal to 10 mm while the lower cylinder one is increased up to 14 mm to accomplish for the high still water pressure loads finally the structural weight of the bracings mainly depends on the height of the toroidal shape as the inertial loads exerted in harsh weather conditions are proportional to the volume of the fully submerged mass in this respect the bracing cross section is assumed to double when the height of the toroidal shape increases from 1 0 up to 2 0 m table b 1 mass distribution of the selected wec devices table b 1 item mass kg vertical coordinate as regards the wl m h 0 0 m h 1 0 m h 1 5 m h 2 0 m upper deck nss 1233 1233 1233 1233 2 00

researchers grew fast throughout the world as proved by the deployment of the first marine energy prototypes in the real environment and the increasing number of funding opportunities in this respect in march 2018 the european commission endorsed the ocean energy implementation plan eu 2018 developed by the temporary working group for ocean energy where a set of technical financial and environmental actions devoted to support the deployment of marine energy converters are provided besides the document furnishes a strategic roadmap with several key action plans in order to ensure the clean energy transition of the european countries and develop well established and mature technologies capable of covering a significant amount of the eu power demand over the next 35 years among the various marine renewable sources wave energy probably represents the most promising one with a theoretical annual potential in europe of about 2800 twh magagna 2019 anyway the levelised cost of energy l c o e is still high if compared with other renewable technologies such as the solar or the onshore wind ones with a reference value equal to 0 720 and 0 560 kwh in 2015 and 2018 respectively so proving that the marine energy sector is not mature enough for the international market in this respect the european commission has set ambitious targets for wec devices which are expected to reach a l c o e of 0 200 kwh by 2025 0 150 kwh by 2030 and 0 100 kwh by 2035 this roadmap towards the commercial phase reveals to be ambitious as wec devices still need to achieve a significant amount of operational hours in real environment combined with a reasonable level of power production in order to gain the trust of investors and manufactures indeed the pathway towards the cost reduction needs to combine economies of scale based on large industrial production and optimised maintenance operations and learning by research through the improvement of currently embodied technologies among the variety of wec devices point absorbers represent one of the most promising technologies due to the relatively simple working principle since the pioneering work by budal and falnes 1975 considerable improvements have been gained from both theoretical and experimental point of views the hydrodynamic modelling of this wec device coupled with electric or hydraulic power take off pto units has been widely investigated by several researchers thorough the world pastor and liu 2014 piscopo et al 2016 do et al 2018 kolios et al 2018 among others recently attention has been also paid to improve the hydrodynamic performances by increasing the freedom degrees al shami et al 2019 applying a tuned inertial mass haraguchi and asai 2020 or developing novel layouts to enhance the survivability in extreme sea state conditions zheng et al 2020 in current analysis the floating buoy layout recently developed by piscopo and scamardella 2019 and consisting of a hemispherical buoy connected by means of a deep draught vertical cylinder to a fully submerged toroidal shape is assumed as reference design to maximize the power production and decrease the cost of energy the new point absorber allows increasing the power production as regards a similarly sized single body wec device consisting of a hemispherical floating buoy by properly tuning the heave natural period with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect based on the main outcomes by piscopo and scamardella 2019 the new layout allows i obtaining an appreciable increase of the annualised energy production up to 60 for low and medium energy power production site as regards conventional single body point absorbers and ii properly tuning the main dimensions of the toroidal shape depending on the wave climate at the deployment site the point absorber is connected by means of a tensioned wire rope to a permanent magnet linear generator pmlg equipped with a gravity based foundation such as that one developed at the uppsala university sjökvist and göteman 2017 particularly a parametric analysis is performed by systematically varying the height of the fully submerged volume in order to properly tune the heave natural period of the wec device with the prevailing sea states at the deployment site in this respect the main aims of current research can be summarized as follows i the annualised energy production a e p of the new wec device is systematically assessed based on the met ocean conditions at the candidate deployment site located in the western mediterranean sea in order to carry out a comparative analysis with a reference wec device consisting of a hemispherical buoy with the same waterplane area besides the hydrodynamic behaviour of the wec device in extreme sea state conditions is investigated and the scantling of the tensioned wire rope connecting the floating buoy to the pmlg translator mass is performed based on both ultimate uls and fatigue fls limit state design conditions ii a comparative analysis in terms of l c o e is performed between the new and the reference wec device in order to further investigate the effectiveness of the new layout iii a sensitivity analysis is performed to explore a possible reduction pathway of the l c o e by combining both economical operational and technological aspects with the main aim of gaining the eu target that should be reached by 2025 the hydrodynamic analysis is carried out by a non linear time domain model solved by a dedicated code developed in matlab mathworks 2018 including the heave surge and pitch motions of the floating buoy and the vertical motion of the pmlg translator mass 2 hydrodynamic modelling 2 1 the wec layout the point absorber recently designed by piscopo and scamardella 2019 and depicted in fig 1 is assumed as reference wec device it has a spar type configuration consisting of a floating hemisphere and a deep draught vertical cylinder connected to a fully submerged toroidal shape by means of 8 equally spaced bracings the floating buoy is entirely built in normal strength steel nss apart from the toroidal shape which is made of marine concrete filled with polyurethane foam additional concrete ballast is located in the floating hemisphere in order to properly tune the vertical coordinate of the wec device centre of mass and achieve a 1 0 m metacentric height the device is connected to a gravity based permanent magnet linear generator pmlg lying on the seabed thanks to a heavy marine concrete foundation by means of a tensioned line that exerts the heave motion of the pmlg translator mass thanks to this layout no holes need to be carried out into the seabed with a substantial decrease of the capital expenditure costs requires to install the pto unit of the wec device 2 2 the hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model of the wec device shall account for i inertial damping and restoring forces ii non linear drag forces iii tensioned line forces including possible slack conditions iv reaction forces exerted by the pto upper lower end stop springs and v electromechanical forces due to full partial overlapping between the pmlg stator and translator mass the time domain model consisting of four equations for the heave ς 3 surge ς 1 and pitch ς 5 motions of the floating buoy and the vertical motion ς t of the pmlg translator mass can be written as follows 1 m b a 33 ζ 3 t k 33 t τ ς 3 τ d τ ϱ g a w p ς 3 f e 3 f d 3 f l cos ϑ m b g ρ g m b a 11 ζ 1 t k 11 t τ ς 1 τ d τ a 15 ζ 5 t k 15 t τ ς 5 τ d τ f e 1 f d 1 f l sin ϑ i a 55 ζ 1 t

moment of inertia about the axis passing through the buoy centre of gravity while a i j and k i j are the added mass at infinite frequency and the radiation impulse response function associated with a force in the i th direction due to an oscillatory motion in the j th mode reference is made to the list of symbols and acronyms for the meaning of all physical quantities besides ϑ asin ς 1 s z g ς 5 ℓ ς 1 ℓ is the angle of the tensioned line about the vertical depending on the coupled surge and pitch motions of the floating buoy the impulse response function is determined by the inverse fourier transform of the frequency dependent radiation coefficients b i j according to eq 2 cummins 1962 2 k i j t 2 π 0 b i j ω cos ω t d ω in eq 1 the convolution integrals involving the past motion history and representing the memory effect due to radiated waves are resembled by an approximate state space realization yu and falnes 1995 via the hankel singular value decomposition algorithm kung 1978 and subsequently reduced to a 5th order model safonov and chiang 1989 in order to speed up the calculations the random wave force f e i exerting the i th motion mode is determined by the following convolution product according to eq 3 3 f e i k e i t τ η τ d τ where η is the random wave elevation and k e i is the i th excitation kernel function that in turn depends on the frequency dependent exciting force per unit wave amplitude f e i by eq 4 4 k e i t 1 π r 0 f e i ω exp i ω t d t as concerns the drag forces they are determined according to the relative velocity formulation dnv 2010 so considering both current and wave particle velocity as further detailed in appendix a besides the tensioned line force includes i the pretension due to the suspended pmlg translator mass ii the line stretching due to the relative motion between the floating buoy and the translator mass and iii possible slack conditions during the downward motion of the pmlg translator mass in this respect the line stretching due to combined heave surge and pitch motions is determined by eq 5 5 δ l ℓ ς 3 ς t 2 ς 1 s z g ς 5 2 ℓ hence after performing a first order taylor series expansion the line force is determined by eq 6 6 f l max m t g e a ℓ ς 3 ς t ς 1 s z g ς 5 2 2 ℓ 0 as concerns the pto unit the forces exerted by the upper and lower end stop springs arise when the vertical motion of the translator mass exceeds the upper ℓ p t o u or the lower ℓ p t o l pto free stroke length according to the following equations depending on the spring stiffness k s and the maximum compressibility δ s according to eqs 7 and 8 7 f s u 0 i f ς t ℓ p t o u k s ς t ℓ p t o u i f ℓ p t o u ς t ℓ p t o u δ s k s δ s e a ℓ ς 3 ς t ς 1 s z g ς 5 2 2 ℓ ς t ℓ p t o u δ s 8 f s l 0 f ς t ℓ p t o l k s ς t ℓ p t o l i f ς t ℓ p t o l finally the full partial overlapping between the stator and translator mass is accomplished by the active area ratio parameter a a c t that is determined by eq 9 ulvgård et al 2016 9 a a c t 0 i f ς t 1 2 l t l s 1 i f ς t 1 2 l t l s 1 min l t l s 1 2 l t l s ς t else after assessing the vertical motion of the translator mass the mean electrical power in the time interval t is established by the following equation depending on the efficiency η e of the pmlg falcão 2010 10 p e γ η e t 0 t a a c t ζ t 2 d t the formula provided by eq 10 for the power production assessment of the wec device is based on a slightly simplified representation of the pto unit depending on two main parameters namely the damping γ and the active area ratio a a c t really a more refined model including electro magnetic induction based calculations should be addressed nevertheless the effectiveness of the currently embodied approach has been widely proved by eriksson et al 2007 who validated the numerical model against a set of open sea experimental data collected between march and may 2006 on a reference wec device deployed 2 km off the swedish coastline on 25 m depth particularly they carried out a comparative analysis between simulations and open sea experimental data based on 2386 time series of measured voltages and wave elevations each one having a duration between 20 and 30 min and an incident wave power flux up to 20 kw m they concluded that the numerical model for the hydrodynamic analysis of the wec device based on the same modelling assumptions concerning the pto unit embodied in current calculations was well suited for the design of point absorber devices hence denoting by p i the probability of occurrence of the i th sea state and by p e i the mean electrical power the annualised energy production a e p in kwh is determined by the following equation falcão 2010 11 a e p 8760 i 1 n s p i p e i having denoted by n s the number of sea state conditions depending on the wave statistics at the deployment site besides the wave power transmitted to the floating buoy is determined by eq 12 12 p w ϱ g d 0 c g ω s ς ω d ω having denoted by c g the frequency dependent wave group velocity and by s ς the wave spectrum hence the available annual energy amount is determined by eq 11 after replacing the mean electrical power p e i in a given sea state by the mean wave power p w i further details about all quantities embodied in the previous equations are provided in the list of symbols and acronyms the hydrodynamic model provided by eq 1 can be simplified neglecting the surge and pitch motions by adding the conditions ς 1 ς 5 0 that imply ϑ 0 in this respect the simplified heave motion is sufficient to assess the power production of the wec device as the surge effect is negligible miquel et al 2017 piscopo et al 2020 while the full hydrodynamic model is required when the motion of the floating buoy in extreme sea state conditions needs to be investigated 2 3 strength check of the connection line the connection line provides the station keeping of the floating buoy apart from exerting the vertical motion of the pmlg translator mass so as it needs to be checked against uls and fls criteria the uls strength check is provided by the following equation dnv gl 2015 which is similar to that one commonly embodied for mooring systems of offshore structures benassai et al 2014 campanile et al 2018 among others 13 s c γ p r e t t p r e t γ e n v t e n v 0 where s c is the characteristic line capacity corresponding to its minimum breaking strength t p r e t m t g is the line pretension and t e n v t m p m t p r e t is the characteristic environmental tension depending on the most probable maximum line tension t m p m in eq 13 γ p r e t γ e n v is the partial safety factor on line pretension environmental tension for single point permanent mooring systems with consequence class 1 dnv gl 2015 as any failure of the tensioned line is unlikely to lead to unacceptable consequences such as loss of life uncontrolled oil or gas outflow capsize or sinking as concerns the most probable maximum line tension it is determined based on 20 independent simulations each one having a 3 hour duration particularly the extreme sample of each simulation is established as the maximum of the line force realization subsequently the maxima are fitted by the gumbel distribution and the most probable maximum is determined by eq 14 dnv gl 2015 14 t m p m μ 0 45 σ having denoted by μ and σ the mean and standard deviation of the maxima observed from each simulation besides in absence of specific requirements for wec devices it is assumed that the environmental loads have a characteristic value corresponding to a 50 year return period which is the value commonly embodied in the structural assessment of floating wind turbines dnv gl 2018 as concerns the fatigue strength check the tensioned line shall have a minimum life of 25 years based on eq 15 dnv gl 2015 15 1 d c γ f 0 where d c is the characteristic fatigue damage accumulated as a result of cycling loading during the entire lifetime of the wec device and γ f is the safety factor for fls design finally the cumulative fatigue damage is determined on the basis of the narrow banded spectrum approach according to eq 16 16 d c t d a d γ m 2 1 i 1 n s ν i p i 2 2 σ i m where t d is the fatigue life of the tensioned line γ is the gamma function ν i σ i is the mean up crossing rate standard deviation of the stress process and a d m is the intercept slope parameter of the s n curve depending on the material embodied for the tensioned line 3 main data for the hydrodynamic analysis 3 1 environmental loads the parametric design performed in section 4 is carried out assuming that the wave farm is deployed at alghero about 3 km off the sardinia coastline provided that this is one of the most energetic sites in the western mediterranean sea the wave statistics are provided by the italian sea wave measurement network apat 2006 currently managed by the governmental institution ispra namely istituto superiore per la protezione e la ricerca ambientale in this respect table 1 provides the wave statistics at the deployment site based on 0 5 m significant wave height and 0 5 s mean wave period classes for a total of 31725 measurements in the reference period from 1st july 1989 to 14th june 2002 table 2 reports the annual wave energy distribution in mwh that is available for a wec device having a 5 0 m wide waterplane area in all cases the jonswap wave spectrum dnv 2010 is embodied combined with a peak enhancement factor equal to 1 86 apat 2016 besides fig 2 a and b report the h s and t 1 marginal distributions from which it is gathered that the prevailing sea state conditions correspond to a mean wave period between 4 and 5 s furthermore fig 3 a and b provide the wave energy marginal distributions from which it is gathered that the most energetic sea states correspond to significant wave height and mean wave period classes ranging from 2 5 up to 3 5 m and from 7 0 up to 8 0 s respectively in absence of complete statistics at the deployment site the one hour wind speed at 10 m above the sea water level u 1 h 10 is determined by the implicit limit equation 17 proposed by michell 1999 17 g h s u 1 h 10 2 0 243 tanh 0 011 g f u 1 h 10 2 1 2 where h s is the significant wave height and f is the fetch length equal to 100 km which is a typical value for the mediterranean sea hence the ten minute wind speed at 10 m above the sea water level u 10 10 is related to the previous value by eq 18 dnv 2010 18 u 10 10 u 1 h 10 1 0 047 ln 6 after assessing the reference wind speed the wind generated current velocity at still water level is determined by eq 19 dnv 2010 19 v c 0 03 u 1 h 10 the slab profile is embodied to model the variation of the current velocity with the water depth as concerns the extreme sea state conditions the 50 year significant wave height required to perform the uls strength check of the connection line is equal to 9 8 m sartini et al 2015 with 10 s wave period apat 2006 3 2 point absorber main data the main dimensions of the wec device depicted in fig 1 are listed in table 3 the point absorber consists of a 5 0 m floating buoy connected to the fully submerged toroidal shape by means of a tapered cylinder having a diameter equal to 1 0 and 1 5 m at the connection with the buoy and the fully submerged volume respectively the inner and outer diameters of the toroidal shape are equal to 7 0 and 9 0 m while its height ranges from 1 0 up to 2 0 m with 0 5 m step the submergence of the toroidal shape is set equal to 15 m so reducing possible hydrodynamic interferences between the floating buoy and the fully submerged volume that would have led to a high drop off of power production besides a reference point absorber consisting of a similarly sized floating buoy without the fully submerged toroidal shape h 0 is also investigated to make possible a comparative analysis between the new and the reference wec device in terms of annualised energy production and levelized cost of energy further details about the materials required for the floating buoy the toroidal shape and the additional concrete ballast are provided in appendix b before performing the hydrodynamic analysis of the wec devices it must be pointed out that some of the main dimensions of the new point absorber were selected based on the main outcomes of the previous work by piscopo and scamardella 2019 where the floating buoy diameter was set equal to 5 0 m to make possible the coupling with the 20 kw pmlg embodied in current analysis similarly the inner and outer diameters of the fully submerged toroidal shape were selected to minimize the heave damping of the wec device with a positive impact on power production finally the submergence of the toroidal shape was selected with the main aim of reducing the hydrodynamic interferences between the submerged volume and the floating buoy without significantly increasing the inertial loads on the wec device that in turn would have led to a negative impact on the scantlings of the deep draught vertical cylinder piscopo and scamardella 2019 the frequency dependent added mass radiation damping and exciting forces per unit wave amplitude are assessed by the free source boundary element code nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 the heave response amplitude operators r a o 3 of the wec devices are reported in fig 4 from which it is gathered that the fully submerged toroidal shape allows significantly varying the hydrodynamic behaviour of the wec device from overdamped to underdamped so producing a consistent increase of power production secondly it causes an appreciable shifting of the heave natural period that in turn can be properly tuned in order to maximize the power production depending on the prevailing sea states at the deployment site as concerns the tensioned line the wec device is equipped with a six strand steel wire rope with fibre core dnv 2009 the main data are reported in table 4 while the minimum diameter is selected in order to fulfil the uls and fls strength check criteria dnv gl 2015 outlined in sub section 2 3 3 3 pmlg main data the gravity based pmlg designed by ulvgård et al 2016 and further investigated by sjökvist and göteman 2017 is assumed as reference pto unit the only change as regards the reference layout concerns the upper free stroke length which is increased in order to i accomplish the large vertical motions of the floating buoy in extreme sea state conditions ii reduce the maximum line tension iii limit the wave overtopping events of the floating buoy and iv significantly decrease the minimum required mass of the pto marine concrete foundation the pmlg main data are reported in table 5 4 parametric design 4 1 aep assessment the a e p assessment of the wec devices is carried out by the simplified heave model as surge and pitch motions have an almost negligible impact on power production miquel et al 2017 piscopo et al 2020 based on the results outlined in table 6 the new layout allows gaining an appreciable increase of the a e p ranging from 53 up to 70 as regards the reference wec device this outcome is due to the improved hydrodynamic behaviour of the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape in this respect fig 5 a d provide the power production of the selected wec devices versus the significant wave height and the mean wave period from which it is gathered that the new layout allows shifting the mean wave period corresponding to maximum power production from 3 5 up to 5 0 s so matching the prevailing sea states at the deployment site with a consequent increase of the a e p as regards the reference configuration this outcome is also confirmed by the efficiency histograms reported in fig 6 a d as a function of the mean wave period in fact the maximum efficiency of the reference wec device occurs at 3 0 s while it ranges from 4 0 up to 4 5 s for the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape 4 2 strength check of the connection line the strength check of the tensioned line is performed by the full hydrodynamic model in order to account for possible interactions between the heave surge and pitch motions of the floating buoy in extreme sea state conditions hence table 7 provides the minimum diameter of the tensioned line satisfying both the uls and the fls strength check criteria as predictable the wire rope diameter increases with the dimensions of the fully submerged toroidal shape due to the higher inertial loads exerted by the floating buoy on the pmlg translator mass 4 3 lcoe assessment the levelized cost of energy is determined by eq 20 iea and nea 2015 20 l c o e 1 a v a a e p c a p e x r 1 r n 1 r n 1 o p e x where c a p e x o p e x is the capital annual operational cost r is the discount rate n and a v a are the lifetime and the availability of the wec device in current analysis the operational lifetime is set equal to 20 years which is the reference value for the marine renewable energy sector de andres et al 2016 combined with a 12 discount rate magagna 2019 and 98 availability assuming that power production is stopped one week a year for the scheduled maintenance operations as concerns the o p e x expenditure it is quite challenging to provide a reliable estimate of the yearly maintenance costs as this type of technology is not mature enough and no much experience has been collected till now on long term power production in real environment piscopo et al 2017 2018 hence in current analysis the o p e x is assumed equal to 5 of c a p e x which is the reference value for the ocean energy sector magagna 2019 as concerns the assessment of capital expenditure it can be split into four main cost items the pto unit that includes i the ferrite magnets on the pmlg translator mass ii the electric cable on the pmlg stator iii the 1 kv electric cable connecting the pmlg to the marine substation iv the steel casing v the marine concrete foundation vi other parts and vi the assembly expenses the floating buoy that includes i the floating buoy structure made of normal strength steel nss with all cost centres experienced during the shipbuilding process ii the marine concrete toroidal shape filled with polyurethane foam iii the additional concrete ballast in the floating buoy required to properly tune the vertical position of the wec device centre of mass and achieve a 1 0 m metacentric height iv the wire rope connecting the floating buoy to the pto unit v the painting of the external surfaces of the floating buoy and vi other parts the electric connection of the marine substation to the ashore grid that includes pro quota i the ashore power cable and ii the marine substation bearing in mind that up to 24 wec devices can be generally connected to the same unit ericsson and gregorson 2018 the deployment costs that include i the harbour crane for the handling of the wec device from the shipyard to the barge crane unit and ii the barge crane itself including the cost of consumables crew and divers all unit cost items are reported in table 8 while the c a p e x breakdown is further detailed in appendix c most of the cost items related to the pto unit and the marine substation are provided by ericsson and gregorson 2018 while the installation costs are suggested by chatzigiannakou et al 2019 besides the unit cost of the nss floating buoy and the pmlg steel casing is assessed by the procedure outlined by gordo and leal 2018 that provides the typical cost breakdown experienced in the shipbuilding process and consisting of material cutting transport forming assembly and welding expenditures furthermore the labour cost is assumed equal to 20 hour which is the mean value for specialized workers in italy together with a 20 revenue of the shipbuilder only some cost items have been selected by market analysis finally table 9 provides the c a p e x and the l c o e of the selected wec devices particularly the capital cost increases with the dimensions of the fully submerged volume due to the additional materials required to build the deep draught vertical cylinder the connection bracings and the marine concrete toroidal shape nevertheless the l c o e of the new wec device significantly decreases as regards the reference layout since the additional capital costs are widely counterbalanced by the corresponding a e p increase 5 discussion by the hydrodynamic analysis carried out in section 4 the wec device with the fully submerged toroidal shape is effective to increase the power production and decrease the cost of energy in this respect by fig 7 a it is gathered that the layout with a 2 0 m high toroidal shape maximises the a e p with a 70 increase as regards the reference configuration besides by fig 7 b the new point absorber allows gaining a 16 reduction of the l c o e as regards the reference layout almost independently of the toroidal shape dimensions according to the previous analysis the l c o e of the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape is always lower than the reference value for wec devices that is equal to 0 560 kwh in 2018 magagna 2019 so proving that the new layout is effective to reduce the cost of energy and make the marine energy sector more competitive on the international market indeed this outcome is particularly meaningful as the deployment site located in the mediterranean sea has a moderate annual wave energy flux if compared with the more energetic sites located in the atlantic ocean off the spanish coastline or in the north sea area where the cost of energy is expected to reduce further anyway the l c o e is still high and quite far from the european set plan declaration of intent for ocean energy eu 2018 that has set ambitious targets for the wave energy sector equal to 0 200 kwh by 2025 and 0 150 kwh by 2030 the reasons of this gap depend on a variety of factors among which i the discount rate ii the wec device lifetime iii the steel cost and iv the deployment expenditure in this respect fig 8 a d provide the sensitivity analysis of the l c o e for the point absorber with a 1 0 m high toroidal shape focusing on the above mentioned cost items combined with three values of the annual operational expenditure namely 5 4 and 3 of capital costs particularly fig 8 a investigates the incidence of the discount rate on the l c o e this variable is mainly related to the risk perception of the marine renewable energy sector on the international market and plays a fundamental role to decrease the cost of energy hence if the discount rate diminishes from 12 up to 4 which is the value for well established renewable technologies such as the solar and onshore wind ones a consistent decrease of the l c o e up to about 45 if combined with a 3 o p e x can be attained fig 8 b focuses on the design lifetime of the wec device which is systematically increased from 20 up to 25 years that is the reference value for ships and offshore structures based on current results a maximum 14 decrease of the l c o e is attained in conjunction with a 3 o p e x as concerns the steel and deployment costs they are plotted in fig 8 c and d respectively as concerns the steel unit cost it was assumed equal to 3 0 kg in the parametric design nevertheless this value is conservative and significant savings up to 30 of the above mentioned value can be gained in view of mass production by automating the assembly processes and lowering the shipyard revenue that was set equal to 20 hence a further 20 reduction of the l c o e can be gained if the steel unit cost is lowered by 30 similarly appreciable savings up to 30 of the reference value for the deployment costs can be gained if a consistent number of wec is deployed and the tugboat deployment method is embodied in place of the more expensive barge crane one chatzigiannakou et al 2019 based on previous remarks several reduction strategies involving economical operational and technological issues need to be contemporarily embodied in order to drop off the l c o e in this respect table 10 provides a comparative analysis between the actual and the next future values of the l c o e based on the main outcomes of the sensitivity analysis further details about the c a p e x assessment of the wec devices based on 30 reduction of steel and deployment costs are reported in appendix d current results are summarized in fig 9 from which it is gathered that the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape achieves the eu target of 0 200 kwh that should be reached by 2025 almost independently of the submerged volume size 6 conclusions the parametric design of a resonant point absorber with a fully submerged toroidal shape has been performed with the main aim of comparing the hydrodynamic performances of the new wec device with a reference layout consisting of a floating hemisphere the point absorber is connected by means of a tensioned line to a pto unit with gravity based foundation and an increased upper free stroke length in order to accomplish the large vertical motions of the translator mass in extreme sea state conditions a non linear time domain model for surge heave and pitch motions of the floating buoy has been developed and combined with the vertical motion of the pmlg translator mass subsequently a design procedure for the tensioned wire rope connecting the floating buoy to the pto unit and exerting the vertical motion of the translator mass has been provided based on both uls and fls strength check criteria hence a candidate site located in the western mediterranean sea has been selected for the possible deployment of the wave farm the assessment of the annualised energy production as well as the design of the tensioned wire rope have been performed based on the met ocean conditions at the deployment site focusing on four wec devices the former is the reference layout consisting of a floating hemisphere while the remaining ones are equipped with the fully submerged toroidal shape with height ranging from 1 0 up to 2 0 m in order to properly tune the heave natural period of the wec device depending on the prevailing sea states at the deployment site the parametric design aimed to assess and compare the hydrodynamic performances of the above mentioned layouts in terms of a e p and l c o e based on current results the following main outcomes have been achieved i the new wec device allows gaining an appreciable increase of the a e p as regards the reference layout ranging from 50 up to 70 depending on the height of the fully submerged toroidal shape this result is mainly attributable to the improved hydrodynamic behaviour of the new point absorber and the shifting of the heave natural period that matches the prevailing sea states at the deployment site with a consequent increase of power production furthermore the new layout reveals to be effective also in extreme sea state conditions as proved by the fulfilment of both the uls and fls strength check criteria for the tensioned wire rope ii the new point absorber allows achieving an appreciable decrease of the l c o e as regards the reference wec device that is equal to about 16 independently of the height of the fully submerged toroidal shape this outcome is achieved as the c a p e x increase of the new layout is widely counterbalanced by the higher power production as regards the reference layout furthermore the l c o e of the new point absorber is equal to about 0 480 kwh so below the reference value for the marine energy sector that is equal to 0 560 kwh in 2018 iii the sensitivity analysis clearly highlights that there is wide space to consistently reduce the l c o e by combining both economical operational and technological issues in this respect the l c o e of the point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape can be lowered up to 0 200 kwh so matching the eu target to be reached by 2025 this result can be achieved by properly varying the discount rate the design lifetime of the wec device the steel and deployment costs and the operational expenditures as proved by the sensitivity analysis based on current results the resonant point absorber with the fully submerged toroidal shape seems to be a promising layout to i more efficiently harness the wave energy resources with a positive impact in terms of marine spatial planning and ii make the marine renewable energy sector more competitive on the international market in fact the new layout allows increasing by 70 the a e p and decreasing by 16 the l c o e as regards the reference wec device these outcomes can be achieved by designing a new generation of pmlgs with increased upper free stroke length and by properly tuning the heave natural period of the wec device depending on the met ocean conditions at the deployment site further improvements can be gained by increasing the nominal power of the pto unit and the main dimensions of the floating buoy in order to match the eu target of 0 150 kwh that should be reached by 2030 and move the marine energy sector towards the marketing phase in real environment these topics will be the subject of future works notes the wec device with the fully submerged toroidal shape is covered by the italian patent demand

have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a the drag forces provided by eq 1 are assessed by the relative velocity formulation accounting for current and wave particle velocity the heave drag force f d 3 is the sum of several terms due to the floating hemisphere the vertical cylinder the

depending on the vertical position of each structural element besides the last three terms are null for the reference wec device without the fully submerged toroidal shape as concerns the surge drag

appendix b the weight distribution of the wec devices is provided in table b 1 together with the vertical position of each element as regards the waterline upward positive as previously said the reference wec device without the toroidal shape consists of a floating buoy entirely made of normal strength steel nss with additional concrete permanent ballast in order to properly tune the centre of mass vertical position and achieve a 1 0 metacentric height the three point absorbers with the fully submerged toroidal shape instead are also equipped with a deep draught vertical cylinder and 8 bracings in nss while the toroidal shape is made of marine concrete 2400 kg m3 filled by polyurethane foam 80 kg m3 as concerns the structural elements in nss the equivalent thickness of the upper deck is assumed equal to 8 mm as no static loads are applied the equivalent thickness of the upper cylinder and the hemisphere is taken equal to 10 mm while the lower cylinder one is increased up to 14 mm to accomplish for the high still water pressure loads finally the structural weight of the bracings mainly depends on the height of the toroidal shape as the inertial loads exerted in harsh weather conditions are proportional to the volume of the fully submerged mass in this respect the bracing cross section is assumed to double when the height of the toroidal shape increases from 1 0 up

21047,a design method for pre swirl stators energy saving devices using a combined bem ranse approach is proposed ranse calculations using actuator disks are employed to provide the required thrust and the effective wake to an unsteady boundary element method through which the rate of revolution of the propeller and its averaged performance in self propulsion are evaluated an automatic variation of the pre swirl geometry driven by an optimization algorithm that operates on the parameters defining the device realizes an automatic try and error process which is used as a design tool for the maximization of the energy saving effect results obtained for different numbers of stator fins show outstanding improvements up to a reduction of the required shaft power of about 8 keywords pre swirl stators bem ranse coupling energy saving devices esd optimization sbdo 1 introduction reducing the environmental footprint of ships is of utmost importance in the last years attention was focused on radiated noise aspects as a consequence of increasing awareness of this type of pollution and its consequences on marine wildlife noise pollution in any case did not relax the concerns on traditional atmospheric pollutants like nox sox and other gaseous emissions the recent implementation and the mandatory nature of dedicated energy efficiency related indexes like the eedi and the eeoi from imo international maritime organization 2009a 2009b 2014 definitely encouraged the research activity on more energy efficient ships and on ways of improving the hydrodynamic efficiency both for new buildings and for retrofits besides the direct relationship between the reduction of atmospheric pollutants and the reduction of the ship operative costs i e fuel easily persuaded ship owners to invest resources in these developments the concept of energy saving devices esd has its origins in this need realize a simple and cost effective device capable of improving the overall propulsive efficiency of the ship as a whole by reducing its hydrodynamic losses currently there are many esds types in service that are classified by their working principle and mechanism used to modify the flow in proximity of the propeller through which realize the energy recovery wake equalizing ducts lammeren 1949 schneekluth 1989 affect the hull by reducing the flow separation at the stern pre and post swirl stators van terwisga 2013 streckwall h and xing kaeding 2017 dang et al 2012 propeller boss cap fins ouchi and ogura 1988 as well as high efficiency unconventional propellers andersen et al 2000 gaggero et al 2016 operate on axial and rotational losses of the propeller these are the solutions that demonstrated over a large range of vessels abs 2020 mewis 2009 2014 the highest performances their combination like in the case of the mewis becker system guiard and leonard 2013 leads to even higher savings thank to better exploitation of the hull propeller rudder interactions pre swirl stators which are the object of this study consist of a certain number 3 5 usually of fins mounted upstream the propeller they are a device developed to reduce the rotational losses of the propeller namely those related to the rotational component of the flow in the propeller slipstream differently from post swirl stators which try to straighten the rotational flow directly aft the propeller pre swirl stators are designed to generate a swirling flow opposite to the sense of rotation the combination of this swirling flow with the rotation induced by the propeller itself results in less rotation in the final slipstream which explains the energy saving provided by this device the blades of the propeller experience the swirling flow from the stator fins which can be interpreted as a fictitious increment of the rotative speed of the blades as an additional blade loading increasing the delivered thrust obviously a positive net gain it is possible only if the additional thrust provided by the propeller operating aft the pre swirl stator is higher than the resistance added to the ship by the presence of the fins themselves since the first application of kim et al 2004 literature results show very promising saving effects of this type of device a 6 saving is mentioned for the systems developed in the framework of the eu project grip streckwall and xing kaeding 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 prins et al 2016 zondervan et al 2011 indicated similar savings of 4 for a twin screw passenger vessel even if pss have their optimal applications like many others esd in the case of fully blocked ships where the flow at the stern of the vessel is strongly non uniform and the action of the device in homogenizing and redirecting it is in some way facilitated nielsen and jin 2019 proposed the controllable pre swirl fins concept to cope with non constant operative conditions slow steaming fouling weather change of draft and to ensure always the highest possible saving which in the case of the bulk carrier under analysis reached a 4 in terms of delivered shaft power a similar idea was exploited by using flapped pre swirl fins koushan et al 2020 developed pre swirl stators for a chemical tanker and their numerical results claiming a power savings of 2 5 were confirmed by a saving up to 3 2 during a dedicated model scale experimental campaign pre swirl stators were used also in combination with other devices typically a duct or a shroud it is the case of the mewis duct mewis 2009 2014 or the becker system guiard and leonard 2013 as well as of the l j shape duct of stiermann 1987 the presence of the duct has a dual function it provides additional structural integrity reducing at the same time the tip losses of the fins voermas 2017 and counteracts the effect of flow retardation to the propeller due to the fins themselves then providing an additional saving thanks to the flow equalization effect in addition to the well known mewis duct the wafon and the wafon d studied by kim et al 2015 or the fan shaped ducts proposed by chang et al 2019 exploit this combination of effects all these studies in any case pointed out some unavoidable need in the analysis and the design process of the esd which is not yet completely established and may heavily depend on the working principle of the device definitely full scale analyses become obvious since the flow characteristics may be substantially different from model scale in the specific case of pre swirl stators even if the improvements observed at model scale were confirmed for the real ship koushan et al 2020 nielsen and jin 2019 full scale analyses and measurements pointed out that the functioning conditions of the fins were substantially different reasonably allowing for additional savings in case of a design directly in full scale self propulsion calculations in the same way are needed since the esd propeller hull interactions to be exploited are those of the ship travelling under the action of its propeller strictly from the design point of view literature examples raised the need for custom configurations to maximize the positive pre swirl to the propeller and minimize side effects like flow separation on the fins vortex shedding and tip vortexes since they represent unrecoverable sources of energy loss that can nullify the positive action of the swirling fins in the specific case of pre swirl stators due to the stationary nature of the system each blade should be mutually different to comply with the local characteristics of the flow in turn influenced by the induced velocities of the propeller this means different pitches blade per blade potentially variable along the span from root to tip different choices of the sectional profile and the camber in addition to variations of the relative positioning axial and angular between the stator and the propeller the design of the pre swirl stator then has to consider these contrasting needs one fin could be added on the opposite side of the prevailing flow in the direction of the propeller starboard for a right handed propeller where its contribution to the swirling is negligible only if its action in reducing the influence of hull bilge vortexes on propeller performance for instance is higher than its additional resistance the pitch angle of the fins can be selected to maximize the influence on the propeller or eventually to produce thrust in both cases attention has to be paid respectively to the risk of flow separation and on the increase of the thrust deduction force on the hull the choice of opportune design criteria capable of embracing these conflicting objectives is then mandatory the reduction of the total resistance of the ship was a suitable criterion for the design of wake equalizing ducts furcas et al 2020 since their working principle relies on the reduction of the separated flow at the stern of the hull the reduction of the shaft delivered power obviously under self propulsion conditions instead seems more adequate for the design of the pre swirl stator because it considers the hull esd propeller system essentially as a whole this system approach requires a dedicated design methodology capable of dealing with the complexity of the problem if from the analysis point of view the literature is quite abundant from the design perspective there are only a few examples streckwall and xing kaeding 2017 proposed an analysis model employing propeller derived concepts like circulation which resulted adequate also to support the design process of pre swirl stators zondervan et al 2011 similarly employed a two stage design approach using a customized lifting line method applied to the pre swirl fins to derive the main characteristics diameter number of fins pitch of the device potential flow computations as well as ranse analyses were carried out to confirm the results of the design more recently nielsen and jin 2019 and koushan et al 2020 proposed systematic analyses of different pps configurations in terms of number of fins pitch and chord distributions among which identify the most suitable arrangement for the problem under investigation their approach can be classified as a design space exploration which turns into a manual semi automatic optimization process each time additional configurations with characteristics derived from the most promising geometries already analysed are added to the set of candidates results confirmed the reliability and in particular the flexibility of this approach which being entirely based on high fidelity ranse calculations naturally overcomes the limitations in terms of allowed geometries and functioning conditions of potential flow based methodologies widening the design space and potentially allowing for higher savings in case of unusual and unexplored configurations to fully exploit the potentialities of such a methodology however it is necessary to transform this design space exploration into a true simulation bases design optimization approach in which the identification of the optimal or the pareto optimal solutions is automatically driven to convergence by an optimization algorithm this would allow for a more systematic characterization of the design space and a true convergence to the global optimum the ingredients of this try and error methodology applied to pre swirl stators are not different from those needed for similar design strategies developed for propellers gaggero 2020 gaggero et al 2017a b 2020 or other esd gaggero 2018 furcas et al 2020 mizzi et al 2017 a parametric description of the geometry automatic pre and post processing from mesh to performance characterization of results and a computationally efficient solver are always needed this last point in the specific case of pre swirl stators is the most critical and limited the design to only a design space exploration in the work of nielsen and jin 2019 and koushan et al 2020 for instance in light of these issues the current paper aims to develop a true simulation based design optimization approach for pre swirl stators since the computational efficiency is the bottleneck of any sbdo for this design activity a customized bem ranse coupling method already exploited for self propulsion predictions gaggero et al 2017 2018 villa et al 2019 is employed none of the simplified self propulsion algorithms proposed in the literature indeed are completely suitable omitting fully ranse analyses for instance gaggero et al 2015 which doubtless would represent the most accurate approach both for the pre swirl stator its wake and the propeller its unsteady performance unsteady body forces coupled with ranse could be the optimal choice but their computational efficiency is still not adequate for a design process unsteady body forces were developed for an iterative coupling with ranse then requiring several runs of both the boundary element method to update forces and momentum sources of the ranse based on the current effective wake and the ranse to account for the propeller hull interactions each time the input to the bem in terms of effective wake is updated on the other side approaches based only on actuator disks whether translational or roto translational iteratively updated with the current value of ship resistance are too crude approximations while a decent estimation of the thrust deduction factor is possible through these methods they completely ignore the current unsteady functioning of the propeller if in a certain measure an estimation of the propeller rate of revolution is possible by using the propeller open water curves and some auxiliary variables like k t j 2 more consistent evaluations of the propeller performances including severe tangential velocity components like those due to the action of pre swirl fins are required for the design of efficient pre swirl stators since the recovery effect of these devices relies on axial and rotational losses for their characterization it is necessary to employ tools capable of reliably account for the influence of their modifications of the inflow to the propeller on the propeller performances themselves rather simplified estimations of the wake fraction only consequently are not sufficient the wake fraction commonly employed in self propulsion estimations accounts only for the axial component of the velocity field while pre swirl stator fins act mostly to modify the tangential component of the hull wake for the same reasons using only the propeller open water curves is not appropriate since with the pre swirl fins the role of the tangential components of the velocity field is not anymore balanced between the port and starboard side the usually accepted equivalence of propeller performance at the current advance coefficient i e corrected by the wake fraction does not hold anymore from the propeller side moreover it is necessary to have a local description of the wake field which collects the influence of the stator up to the propeller and to rely on efficient unsteady calculations to account carefully for the actual functioning of the propulsor the proposed process detailed in section 3 mixes some of the outcomes of simplified calculations using the actuator disk with unsteady bem calculations taking advantage of the procedure of gaggero et al 2018 and villa et al 2019 for efficient estimations of the effective wake that is still the link between bem and ranse it consists on the characterization of the flow field around the ship and the esd device using ranse analyses with an actuator disk to mimic the influence of the propeller action on the velocity and pressure field at the stern of the ship an unsteady bem instead is in charge of the calculations of the propeller functioning iterations ensure the convergence to the self propulsion point for any choice of the stator fins during the optimization process section 4 which is carried out by employing a genetic algorithm and a custom parametrization of the fins suitable for a flexible and generic representation of the geometry three designs changing the number of fins namely one fin portside pss1 two fins portside pss2 and two fins portside one fin starboard pss2 1 are proposed for the japan bulk carried section 2 results of the design process which ensures savings up to 8 are finally verified using fully ranse calculations including off design conditions i e variation of the ship speed to verify the sensitivity of the optimized configurations to slightly different inflows and the opportunity of a multi functioning points optimization 2 test case the japan bulk carrier the japan bulk carrier jbc is the reference ship chosen for demonstrating the potentiality of the proposed design approach this test case was specifically developed for the 7th workshop on cfd in ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2018 nmri 2015 to verify the reliability of cfd calculations also in presence of energy saving devices which in that case were of pre duct stern duct type this ship is a capesize bulk carrier designed by the national maritime research institute nmri yokohama university the shipbuilding research centre of japan src and classnk its main characteristics in full scale are summarized in table 1 the block coefficient qualifies the vessel as a full blocked ship measurements and calculations of the nominal wake in model scale shown three dimensional separation vortexes from the bilge part at the bottom of the stern and a significant component of the velocity oriented in the vertical direction despite the modification of the wake when full scale is considered these features make the jbc an excellent test case for the application of pre swirl energy saving devices since they are designed precisely for axial flow loss reduction the design speed corresponds to a froude number of 0 142 full scale speed of 14 5 kn 3 coupled bem ranse approach for pre swirl stator performance evaluation a reliable evaluation of the pre swirl effect on propeller performance and then on the entire propulsive system is possible only through the analysis of the self propulsion condition of the ship from the propeller point of view at first it is necessary to account for the effective wake in the determination of its rate of revolution at equilibrium the modification to the flow field due to the presence of the pre swirl fins in turn is influenced by the action of the propeller itself since from the computational point of view fully resolved ranse analyses of the ship in self propulsion conditions are prohibitive in the framework of a design process based on the systematic analysis of hundreds thousands of different configurations a simplified but reliable process is needed current calculations consequently have been carried out by exploiting the potentialities of the coupled bem ranse method developed for self propulsion predictions gaggero et al 2017 2018 villa et al 2019 using radially variable load actuator disk models and supported by the simplified method for self induced velocities estimation which uses calculations in equivalent uniform flow only the process is described in gaggero et al 2018 and villa et al 2019 and it is briefly summarized in section 3 3 the coupling between bem and ranse described in section 3 3 is realized using ranse for the estimation of the ship resistance the wake field nominal and total to the propeller and the self propulsion coefficients wake fraction and thrust deduction factor with the help of the actuator disk in full scale bem for the characterization of the unsteady propeller performance in the effective wake obtained from ranse analyses through which determine the functioning conditions delivered thrust absorbed torque and required power at shaft in correspondence of the self propulsion point 3 1 boundary element method for propeller performance estimation the boundary element method used in current calculations is the bem developed at the university of genoa gaggero et al 2010 2014 it is formulated based on the perturbation potential concept of morino et al 1975 and it uses a distribution of piecewise constant dipoles and sources over a surface mesh consisting of hyperboloidal panels to solve the integral equation resulting from the underlying laplace problem the code is a non cavitating solver that can work in steady and unsteady mode respectively for the characterization of the open water propeller performances and the prediction of the functioning in behind conditions calculations have been carried out with a surface mesh of 1682 panels on the key blade 1250 panels and its portion of the hub following kinnas and hsin 1992 an example of the mesh arrangement is given in fig 1 in both steady and unsteady modes results take advantage of an iterative alignment of the trailing vortical wake similar to that of pyo and kinnas 1997 in unsteady functioning the procedure is limited to a wake alignment carried out as the propeller was working in the circumferentially averaged axial inflow using then the mean axial inflow at each radial position as the undisturbed flow in the alignment process overall the open water propeller performances fig 2 are predicted reasonably well by the bem across the entire range of advance coefficients considered in the analysis differences are quite limited in correspondence with the loaded conditions j 0 3 0 4 the delivered thrust is underestimated by less than 2 and the torque of about 3 5 in correspondence of the design point approximatively between j 0 4 and j 0 6 the differences are less than 2 for both thrust and torque and only at very unloaded functioning the predicted thrust is sensibly overestimated 10 at j equal to 0 7 these performances as well as those by ranse which for the sake of completeness are summarized in the same figure are used to guess the initial rate of revolution of the propeller in the iterative assessment of the self propulsion point using the unsteady boundary element method in steady mode the bem was useful also to determine the current distributions of the axial and tangential load used in the self propulsion calculations using the actuator disk gaggero et al 2018 steady bem calculations indeed were used to compute the axial and tangential forces at several radial positions of the blade using as inflow the circumferentially averaged velocity distribution of the wake alignment process and in correspondence of the advance coefficient preliminary computed for the self propulsion condition of the ship without any esd these distributions were assigned in the self propulsion calculations to the actuator disk to include in the ranse analyses a more accurate description compared to the usual constant momentum sources of the propeller action accounting at least for its radial non uniformity their magnitude was scaled based on the current thrust required by the ship in this case also the distribution of tangential forces was necessary to include the rotational effect of the propeller on the surrounding flow field a pre swirl stator acts on both the axial and the tangential components of the hull and propeller wake and consequently a more reliable estimation of the effective wake accounting also for the tangential components of self induced velocities is required 3 2 ranse solver for ship and hull wake performance estimation ranse calculations were carried out using starccm siemens plm 2017 which is a finite volume structured unstructured cell centered ranse code with the mesh motions and the volume of fluid capabilities necessary in principle to fully address the issues rotating propeller and fluid fluid interactions for free surface prediction related to the simulation of a ship in self propulsion conditions throughout the process ranse analyses were employed to characterize the ship performance in the coupled bem ranse approach and to validate the outcomes of the design process using analyses with the fully resolved propeller since however the computational effort of solving the free surface is prohibitive in an optimization based design process additional simplifications to those already introduced in the discussion i e the use of an actuator disk were adopted in particular only double model calculations without the free surface have been considered the assumption is that the wave pattern generated by the hull has only a small influence on the pre swirl stator and the propeller performance hence negligible at least in the preliminary design phase and for the relatively low froude number considered equal to fr 0 142 this allows for the calculation of the total ship resistance following the simplified approach proposed in gaggero et al 2017 gaggero et al 2018 and gaggero et al 2019 and successfully applied in similar optimization processes involving the estimation of the ship drag in self propulsion condition furcas et al 2020 koushan et al 2020 a constant wave resistance contribution i e independent of the propeller working condition and the presence of the pre swirl can be computed by subtracting the double model drag to the total hull resistance predicted in towing conditions with the free surface d r a g f r e e s u r f w i t h o u t p r o p d r a g d o u b l e m o d e l w i t h o u t p r o p the value obtained includes the pure wave resistance and all the double model approximations such as the variation of the hull wetted surface by adding it to the current drag of the double model a reasonable estimation of the total hull drag is possible allowing for cost effective self propulsion predictions 1 d r a g f r e e s u r f w i t h p r o p d r a g d o u b l e m o d e l w i t h p r o p d r a g f r e e s u r f w i t h o u t p r o p d r a g d o u b l e m o d e l w i t h o u t p r o p a negligible stern wave due to the low froude number as in the present case only slightly influences the velocity field on the stern of the ship see for instance the comparison of nominal wakes with and without free surface effect in gaggero et al 2017 and koushan et al 2020 neglecting it then should not significantly influence the pre swirl design and its influence on propeller functioning computational meshes were realized consistently and to analyse the ship performance in full scale for this purpose the sst k omega turbulence model was adopted calculations used a 1 of turbulence intensity at inlet and an eddy viscosity ratio of 10 the non dimensional wall distance was kept with an appropriate choice of prims layers number and growth factor mostly in the range 200 300 over the hull surface the reference configuration is that of the double model calculation since most of the analyses in the coupled bem ranse method rely on results from this arrangement an overview of the computational meshes depending on the application is given in fig 4 the reference mesh of the double model for the hull without any appendage fig 4a consists of about 2 million elements realized with hexa dominant cells and ten prism layers at the walls spaced with a 1 5 ratio geometric progression local refinements visible at the stern of the ship surround the location of the propeller both in the case of the simple actuator disk of fig 4a and in the case of the fully resolved propeller of fig 4d f as well as that of the pre swirl stators fig 4e this is the reference mesh used for instance to obtain the double model drag of eq 1 in the case of calculations using the actuator disk the possibility to exploit the ship symmetry is prevented by both the usual unsymmetrical nature of the pre swirl stator and by the need to account also in the case of the simplest actuator disk calculations for the rotational effect of the propeller thanks to the tangential momentum sources included in the model this is moreover the reference mesh used for the sensitivity analysis proposed for the validation of the method section 3 4 the inclusion of the fully resolved propeller for the final analyses aimed at validating the simplified bem ranse coupling and then the outcomes of the design process required to set up a rotating domain using sliding interfaces it is the case of fig 4d where the inner cylindrical domain encompassing the propeller is visible the resulting mesh consists of about 4 million cells two of which are used in the rotating region in particular since the flow around the propeller has not a prevalent orientation the inner region was discretized with polyhedral elements and a custom prism layer tailored to the specific functioning of the propeller the presence of the pre swirl stator requires additional local refinements around the fins and in their wakes fig 4e f to account reliably for the modification of the inflow to the propeller their inclusion in the computational domain leads regardless of the propeller model used for calculations to a growth in the cell count of about 400 thousand elements per fin fig 4b finally shows the arrangement for the free surface calculations needed in eq 1 to extract the wave resistance for the self propulsion assessment in this case since the calculation was carried out without propeller and appendages following the accepted simplifications it was possible to exploit the symmetry of the problem in this case the grid for half of the ship counts about 1 4 million cells organized as usual with the local anisotropic refinements across the free surface at the design ship speed the wave resistance of eq 1 is equal to 360 kn at the lower and higher ship speed considered for off design analyses fr 0 114 and 0 171 this contribution is respectively equal to 166 kn and 554 kn 3 3 actuator disk for bem ranse coupling the two way link between the ranse and the bem body forces for the ranse effective wake for the bem is realized in a weak form avoiding any iterations by exploiting only the results of actuator disk calculations for computationally efficient analyses momentum sources replace inside the ranse the action of the propeller behind the ship the coupling between the bem and the ranse is weak since the bem differently to other approaches gaggero et al 2017 provides only the radial distributions fig 3 of circumferentially constant loads to be used inside the actuator disk to distribute the sources which strength is scaled to satisfy the force equilibrium differently from similar approaches the actuator disk is steady since the strength of sources does not vary with the blade revolution only a variation along the blade radius is used corresponding to a circumferentially averaged blade load computed radial position per radial position by the bem subjected to the circumferentially averaged inflow of the nominal wake with this model similarly to more usual constant actuator disks it is not possible to account for local variations of the load due to local features of the incoming flow since the load distribution is based on circumferentially averaged blade performance similarly it is not possible to account neither for local variations of the induced velocities which are treated themselves in a circumferential averaged way this is however coherent with the simplified approach adopted to compute the effective wake for unsteady bem calculations when any actuator disk model is employed indeed only the equilibrium thrust and the consequently thrust deduction factor can be directly determined by the simulation unfortunately these data are not sufficient for the assessment of the unsteady propeller performances the determination of the effective wake fraction and more in general of the spatial distribution of the effective wake to be provided to the bem needs a dedicated analysis following the usual procedure adopted for the analysis of self propulsion tests is not possible since the propeller rate of revolution is not know it is not possible to make use of the open water propeller diagrams to obtain the wake fraction which in any case using this procedure would be a scaling constant and not the required spatial distribution of the non uniform inflow the non uniform distribution of the effective velocity over the propeller plane and the usual wake fraction by the integral of this field can be calculated in several ways by employing iterative approaches they take care of the self induced velocities of the propeller computed using the bem and the total velocity obtained by the ranse with the presence of propeller equivalent momentum sources to derive iteratively the effective wake which in turn determines the magnitude of body forces that realize the self propulsion point all these approaches however require some iterations of the solvers that unaffordably increase the computational effort of the entire process the procedure developed in gaggero et al 2018 allows approximating the self induced velocities field only through a dedicated open water simulation this approximation consists of the same actuator disk used for self propulsion i e same radial distribution of load providing the same thrust of the self propulsion condition that operates in a uniform flow having a velocity equal to the value of the averaged nominal wake measured during towing tests in such a way an approximated self induced velocity field on the propeller plane and consequently the effective wake for bem calculations can be directly evaluated without any bem ranse iteration in particular 2 v e f f e c t i v e s h i p v t o t a l s h i p v t o t a l d i s k v s h i p 1 w n o m i n a l where v t o t a l s h i p is the total velocity field carlton 2007 computed by ranse in self propulsion condition on the propeller plane with the influence of the actuator disk v t o t a l d i s k is the total velocity field on the propeller plane of an open water analysis where the actuator disk loaded with the same distribution used in behind ship condition and delivering the same thrust of self propulsion condition is subjected to a uniform inflow equivalent to the averaged nominal wake of the ship i e v s h i p 1 w n o m i n a l v s h i p is the ship velocity 1 w n o m i n a l is the nominal wake fraction in towing condition by using only actuator disk calculations this approach in the end approximates the propeller self induced velocities under the effective wake as those produced by the propeller under the nominal wake however since the propellers that is the actuator disks under both wakes are delivering the same thrust using a spatial distribution of load that represents the circumferential averaged functioning of the blade this approximation seems plausible in the context of this type of calculations the resulting self induced velocities that are radially varying and circumferentially averaged exactly as a consequence of the actuator disk producing this field can be consequently used to successfully estimate an effective wake since they are combined with a total velocity field based on the same actuator disk action gaggero et al 2018 3 4 the coupling algorithm the coupling algorithm for the efficient evaluation of the self propulsion condition of the ship is outlined in the flow chart of fig 5 the process is described in the most general case that includes the pre swirl stator but obviously applies also for the bare hull it consists of seven main blocks that make use of both the bem and the ranse calculations described above to realize a computationally efficient process exploitable in an optimization environment the key point of the process is the estimation of the unsteady propeller performances necessary to determine in self propulsion conditions the delivered power of the propeller which is the design objective to be minimized since it represents the most comprehensive merit parameter for the design to this aim the evaluation of the ship resistance i e the required propeller thrust is required at first using the approximation of eq 1 both the double model resistance with and without the action of the propeller are required block 1 considers the double model resistance in towing condition block 2 instead is in charge of the analyses that account for the action of the propeller this is done using entirely actuator disk calculations since the evaluation of the influence of the propeller on the pressure field on the stern of the ship the thrust deduction factor using this approach always resulted satisfactory gaggero et al 2017 fu et al 2015 kim et al 2006 the primary output of these analyses in addition to the thrust deduction and the ship resistance block 3 are the nominal and the total wakes on the propeller plane which in turn are one of the inputs needed to assess the propeller self induced velocities block 4 is devoted to this calculation that realizes the weak bem ranse coupling described in section 3 2 by subtracting these approximated self induced velocities from the total velocity field obtained in block 2 the effective wake field can be determined in block 5 once the effective wake fraction of the resulting non uniform field and the thrust deduction factor from block 3 are known also the propeller revolution rate can be estimated utilizing the numerical open water propeller curves these are the first guessed propeller performances of block 6 block 7 finally is in charge of the unsteady characterization of the propeller using bem calculations it accepts as input the effective wake evaluated in block 5 the preliminary estimation of the propeller rate of revolution using open water curves and the target thrust determined by the self propulsion analysis using the actuator disk in this case the effective wake does not change iteration per iteration as in the case of the computations using iterative and spatially varying body forces approaches since it is assumed that the simplified actuator disk is equivalent to the unsteady propeller in terms of both averaged self induced velocities and delivered forces iterations instead are used to tune the propeller rate of revolution accounting for the spatial non uniformity of the wake and the modification of the tangential components of the inflow and not only of the averaged axial variation taken into account by the wake fraction caused by the stator fins once the propeller rate of revolution necessary to provide an averaged unsteady thrust equal to the ship resistance in self propulsion that of block 3 has been determined the time averaged delivered power can be determined to assess the performance of the propulsive configuration under investigation 3 5 validation of the method first the simplified approach of fig 5 has been validated in the case of the jbc in self propulsion without any installed esd in the absence of measurements validation is made with fully resolved rans analyses the design speed as well as two additional ship speeds 20 are considered to assess if and to what extent the improvements achieved at the design speed allows for savings also in off design section 4 4 they represent the baseline for comparisons with the optimal geometries identified by the optimization process the first analysis concerns the sensitivity to the mesh density which is necessary to assess the numerical uncertainties of the calculations and discuss the reliability of the savings observed with the presence of the pre swirl stators to this aim five variations of the reference mesh have been prepared by scaling except for the finest configuration the reference size by a factor of 2 this leads to six grids having from about 0 5 to 17 million cells which were used in the computational process of fig 5 to obtain the self propulsion point and then the delivered propeller power the results of the analysis using the estimation of the numerical uncertainties proposed by eça l and hoekstra 2014 is given in fig 6 the convergence trend is satisfactory also considering that the results of the calculations are a combination of very different approaches the reference mesh which underestimates the extrapolated value of delivered power by 0 5 grants an uncertainty equal to 2 which can be considered a satisfactory result for the application of this computationally efficient arrangement in an optimization process the same level of uncertainty is observed in presence of a pre swirl stator incidentally in this figure the optimal pss2 of section 4 3 using grids from 0 75 to 32 million cells confirming the reliability of the setup fig 7 collects the wakes at the design speed obtained at the various step of the coupling approach the nominal wake 1 w is 0 645 and the effective one 0 665 self propulsion coefficients are summarized in table 2 for the design speed off design points are described in tables 3 and 4 there are some differences between the predictions fully resolved ranse vs coupled bem ranse that in any case and especially in the light of the simplifications of the procedure are deemed more than acceptable at the design point the difference in terms of predicted rate of revolution is negligible but it results from the balance of opposite trends thrust deduction using the actuator disk is slightly underestimated as well as the wake fraction which is calculated by integrating the effective wake on the propeller plane in the case of the coupled procedure in the case of fully ranse analyses this is done instead by using the open water diagrams of the propeller fig 2 the averaged thrust and torque coefficients from unsteady bem due to functionings at a slightly lower advance coefficient are consequently slightly higher than those calculated by the fully resolved ranse for instance by looking at the unsteady blade loads of fig 8 it is possible to appreciate where these differences originate bem calculations overestimate both delivered thrust and absorbed torque in the first half of the propeller rotation 45 180 while in correspondence of the unloaded angular positions 180 360 bem results are more close to ranse reasons for this behaviour can be ascribed to the type of actuator disk which employs radial distributions of axial and tangential forces that are circumferentially constant then there are no differences in the local momentum source intensities depending on the local load of the blade induced velocities as those of fig 7d changes radially but not circumferentially and their combination with the total wake itself affected by this approximation could lead to the differences in axial and vertical components of the effective velocity field which explain the different wake fraction and the different loads predicted by the unsteady bem in addition reasons for these differences can be recognized in the well documented discrepancies between bem and ranse calculations in very decelerated and non uniform wakes discussed in gaggero et al 2014 and gaggero et al 2019 despite these differences the rate of revolution is almost the same since the ship resistance with the coupled approach is about 2 6 higher thrust deduction of 0 784 with respect to 0 804 than that computed with the resolved propeller at the end of the propulsion chain delivered powers differ less than 4 which can be considered a good result for the type of applications these simplified self propulsion calculations have been developed for off design conditions mainly confirm the results obtained at the design speed also in this case the very positive results in terms of predicted delivered power by the coupled bem ranse which is always within 3 of fully resolved ranse results are a consequence of a balancing of opposite tendencies calculations with the unsteady bem always overestimate propeller performances on the other hand bem ranse operates with a slightly higher thrust deduction and the combination leads to predicted propeller rates of revolutions that are very close to calculations with the fully resolved propeller in the end these results accounting for the severe approximations needed for an efficient evaluation of the self propulsion point seem more than acceptable legitimizing the embedding of this procedure into the optimization loop 4 design cases 4 1 the pre swirl stator parametric description a parametric description of the geometry is mandatory in a design by optimization process it defines the design space that in accordance with the fidelity of the solver should be widened as much as possible to encompass unfamiliar solutions and maximize the chance of success of the optimization procedure at the same time it should be achieved with the smallest possible number of parameters to ease the convergence and it should account for geometric constraints discarding unfeasible geometries avoiding the wasting of computational time in the case of the pre swirl stators the description is quite simple since their geometry fundamentally fins at a certain angle of attack and position in space can be handled by few parameters that directly control the features of the system i e its capability of redirect the flow to the propeller responsible of its successfully functioning an example of the design parameters adopted in the current design is given in fig 9 they could be organized into global and local parameters global parameters are those affecting the size and position of the fins the diameter which defines the span of the fins the longitudinal distance from the propeller assuming that all the fins lie on the same plane and the angular position of each fin local parameters are those pertinent to the single fin which depending on its position need to be adjusted to comply with the local flow features in particular each fin is treated as a twisted wing by defining the angle of attack at the root αroot and the angle of attack at the tip αtip chord equal for all the fins of the system is defined at the root a taper ratio sets the value at the tip for both these quantities angle of attack and chord a linear variation is assumed along the span in addition each fin has its sectional profile defined by the maximum sectional curvature and thickness ratio selected among the naca 4 digit series having the chordwise position of the maximum camber at 40 of the chord from the leading edge the range of variations of the design parameters case pss2 1 is summarized in table 5 the only annotation is that the angular position of the second fin portside if any is given as a percentage of the remaining angle π θ1 minus a tolerance that is used to avoid self intersecting fins at the root in case of only one fin portside case pss1 and two fins portside case pps2 its angular position can span from 10 to 170 or 10 90 deg respectively whit this choice of parameters the design activities proposed in this paper turn respectively into a 9 pss1 a 13 pss2 and a 17 pss2 1 free variables optimization problems which are solved using the optimization strategies of section 4 2 4 2 the optimization framework the design process conceived as an optimization problem in principle is not different from similar activities successfully adopted to propellers gaggero 2020 or energy saving devices furcas et al 2020 mizzi et al 2017 essentially the optimization works like an automatic try and error procedure fig 10 thanks to the combination of a parametric description of the device to be designed robust and efficient tools to estimate its quantities of interests objectives and or constraints and a framework where to organize and automatize this process in the current case the setup of the optimization environment is relatively easy being the design process a single objective non constrained optimization problem which has been coded into modefrontier esteco 2017 despite the single objective minimization of the delivered power nature of the problem a genetic algorithm has been preferred in place of more efficient single objective searching algorithms to avoid local minima and provide more reliable trends for all the design cases the initial population for the genetic evolution consists of 10 times the number of free parameters table 6 distributed on the design space the design of experiments using uniform latin hypercube sampling this provides a sufficiently accurate exploration of the design space minimizing the correlations between candidates identifying areas of interest and avoiding as much as possible initial concentrations on local minima maxima that could condition the entire evolution of optimal candidates the optimized geometries have been selected after 10 evolutions of the initial sample the total number of analysed geometries is then relatively small if compared with the thousands tens of thousands configurations usually considered when using low fidelity approaches like bem the relatively simple nature of the current problem and the need for a balance of design times justify the limitations of the proposed analyses based on which anyhow significant results can be extracted 4 3 test cases one fin portside pss1 two fins portside pss2 and two fins portside one fin starboard pss2 1 the results of the three design activities based on the flowchart of fig 5 are summarized in the plot of fig 11 the performance i e the predicted delivered power of all the configurations tested in the optimization processes are categorized based on the genetic generations of the process and compared to the performance of the reference hull without any esd tested in self propulsion conditions using the same approach in the same plot also the optimal configurations identified for each of the design runs are highlighted for the pss1 case the optimal geometry is the last geometry tested by the process id 900 for the pss2 case the optimal configuration is id 1292 while for the pss2 1 case the best geometry is id 1481 fig 13 and table 7 these are also the geometries for which detailed fully resolved ranse self propulsion analyses similar to those employed in the validation of the coupling method of section 3 have been carried out both to confirm the results of the design process and to provide additional validation of the method the convergence trend is well visible for all the design runs since already from the third generation the predicted delivered power is permanently below the reference value of the ship without any pre swirl predicted improvements are notable even one fin alone provides a saving higher than 5 that easily increases up to 8 when the three fins configuration is considered these savings especially those of the pss2 1 case are decisively better than those collected in the literature see for instance the 4 of koushan et al 2020 the 6 of schuiling and van terwisga 2017 or the 2 8 of nielsen and jin 2019 they prove also by using the results of the fully resolved ranse analyses proposed in the next the effectiveness of the design method based on the paradigm of optimization the evolution of the design parameters during the optimizations denotes the same convergence observable for some of them in fig 12 for the pss1 design case the achievement of convergence is undeniable the highest saving is obtained by using the widest possible fin maximum fin diameter combined with the largest chord placed as close as possible to the sternpost θ1 10 since for this design the range of variation of this design parameter is set from 10 to 170 this explains the disturbance in the effective wake field computed by the coupled bem ranse method close to the 12 o clock position of fig 14 which is caused by the wake of the fin itself the presence of the second fin on the portside slightly alters the geometrical characteristics of the first one also in this case relatively wide fins are preferred since the diameter of the fins converges to the upper bound of its range and larger chords are selected regardless of the possibility of very low values of the angle of installation θ1 the optimal configuration of id 1292 sets this value equal to 25 deg then slightly higher than the lower bound adopted when only one fin was considered the second fin has an intermediate position 50 of the remaining angular space resulting in the additional disturbance observable in the effective wake of fig 14 this optimal positioning in particular the preference of a sternpost placing is coherent with that observed in koushan et al 2020 for what concerns the first fin pss1 and pss2 are very similar designs as also observed from the detailed characteristics of the optimal configurations of table 7 their performances are almost the same having id 1292 only a marginal improvement 5 9 versus 5 7 with respect to id 900 as if the second fin was irrelevant for an additional power saving the inclusion of the third fin on the starboard side instead consistently improves the saving provided by the esd introducing moreover a certain influence in the positioning of the second fin on the port side while indeed highest diameters and chords are still preferred as well as the positioning of the first portside fin close to the sternpost in this case the lower bound is set to 22 deg the position of the second fin converge during the optimization to the lower portion of the disk the third fin moves itself to the sternpost from starboard reaching a converged position of 335 deg that is very close to the upper bound set for the range of variation of this parameter these tendencies are clear even if trends observed for the design objective and parameters denote a non completely satisfied convergence supported by the comparison with pss1 and pss2 these results indicate for this specific ship the relevance of fins placed at sternpost one at port one at starboard side which seems to be those more influential for the energy saving effect of the device compared to the effective wake of the bare hull fig 7d the presence of one fin at sternpost portside id 900 and id 1292 indeed reduces the radial vertical component of the flow and makes it more tangential in a direction opposite to the propeller rotation the increase of the positive pre swirl to the blade in the angular range 330 deg 30 deg provided by this fin is higher than that provided by the fin when placed in the more common 240 270 deg angular position as it can be seen in fig 14b in the latter case the presence of the second fin portside is not able to counteract the prevailing direction of the flow which almost remains concordant with the propeller rotation and then less effective for the energy saving a second fin close to sternpost on the starboard side as for id 1481 furthermore guides the flow towards a pure tangential direction which is beneficial for the efficient functioning of the propeller the other characteristics of the fins camber and pitch mainly strictly depend on their positioning and then to the mutual interactions occurring between the hull wake the fins themselves and the action of the propeller a comprehensive analysis of their role for the reduction of the delivered power is provided in fig 15 where the results of a student test are provided in terms of strength of the relationship between the input design parameters and the output results of the student test cannot be considered conclusive samples are limited and not properly distributed over the design space being the result of an optimization but they can result helpful in highlighting trends and general design guidelines the sign besides provides an indication circa the kind of the relationship direct or inverse among inputs and outputs positive negative values of the bar diagram of fig 15 stand for a direct inverse relationship an increase in the value of that parameter determines an increase decrease of the output the role of the diameter of the angular positioning of the fins and the chord discussed earlier is confirmed by this test a reduction of the delivered power is achieved by increasing the diameter the chord and the angular position of the second and third fin inverse effect while for the same aim it is necessary to reduce the angular position of the first fin also the pitch angle of each fin has a certain importance which instead seems limited in the case of the hydrofoil cambers being their influence strength generally lower than that of other design parameters as expected the design process selects twisted geometries to comply with the differences of the incoming flow and the propeller induced velocities from root to tip i e from the decelerated flow in the boundary layer close to the hull to the almost undisturbed flow in the outer part of the propeller disk the average angle of attack and the camber of the fins in any case is towards an increase of the local velocities opposite to the rotation of the propeller negative angle in the fin local reference system of fig 9 a detailed comparison of the self propulsion coefficients of the optimal pre swirl stators identified by the optimization process and analysed using fully ranse calculations tables 8 and 9 confirms most of the outcomes of the design process and the reliability for comparative purposes of the coupled bem ranse method the agreement in terms of predicted propeller rate of revolution and reduction of the required delivered power is reasonable compared to the reference case without any pre swirl stator the inclusion of one fin determines a reduction between 5 fully resolved and 6 coupled bem ranse of the propeller rate of revolution at self propulsion in the most complex case of pss2 1 the reduction is 8 3 for the coupled bem ranse and 6 7 for the fully resolved propeller while for pss2 id 1292 both methods highlight a slight increase in the propeller rate of revolution compared to pss1 id 900 between the two methods the relative difference in the predicted rps at equilibrium is never greater than 2 and the trends even if limited to only three geometries are well in agreement this is a significantly higher reduction of the propeller rate of revolution compared to koushan et al 2020 or nielsen and jin 2019 heavily contributing to the observed reduction of the delivered power similar conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of the predicted delivered power both the approaches estimate a reduction of the delivered power greater than 5 for id 900 5 7 and 5 4 respectively by the coupled method and the fully resolved ranse and a saving up to 8 8 4 by the coupled method 8 by the fully resolved rans for id 1481 from the pss2 1 case the optimal two fin configuration id 1292 as already observed by comparing the optimization histories using only the coupled bem ranse or the propeller rate of revolution appears very similar to id 900 with the same delivered power reduction of 5 4 fully ranse analysis also in the case of the delivered power the trend observed using the coupled method is confirmed by the fully ranse analyses relative differences between the two methodologies are not greater than 3 5 and in any case they remain very similar to those seen for the reference hull the comparison of other propulsive coefficients as well as of the propeller performance is only decent in terms of tendencies since the differences initially observed for the reference hull configuration and mainly ascribable to the limitations of the boundary element method are exacerbated by the presence of the fins and their wakes to the propeller calculations using the coupled bem ranse method predict slightly higher values of ship resistance in self propulsion conditions and then slightly higher values for the thrust deduction factor t even if a clear tendency towards an increase of resistance due to the presence of the fins cannot be asserted with any of the two computational approaches the presence of the stator fins considered part of the hull generally contributes bem ranse calculations to a very small increase less than 4 of the deduction factor t which is in agreement with the full ranse analyses and the towing tank experiments of koushan et al 2020 and dang et al 2012 increase of t of about 5 on the contrary the proposed fully resolved ranse analyses provide a thrust deduction factor t that decreases with the inclusion of the stator fins also in this case the magnitude of the variation is negligible and comparable to the uncertainty of this kind of calculations the overestimation of the ship resistance contributes to the higher values observed for the thrust coefficient of the propeller when predicted using bem combined with the overprediction of the propeller performance by the bem in severe non uniform wakes those exactly stimulated by the presence of the stator fins this can explain the underestimation of the propeller rate of revolution from bem compared to the results obtained using the fully resolved ranse propeller lower propeller rps at equilibrium only partially compensates the overestimation of the propeller averaged absorbed torque itself due to the inherent limitations of the approach in very off design conditions this results in the slightly higher values of delivered power predicted by the coupled method compared to the values calculated using the fully ranse method both the analyses in any case point out an increase of thrust and torque coefficients of the propeller when it operates with the stator fins this increment is higher when using the bem for the calculations of the propeller performance usual limitations of the method in strongly non uniform wakes and approximated calculation of the effective wake using circumferentially averaged values of self induced velocities the increase of propeller thrust and torque coefficients for the cases with the pre swirl stator is due to the combined effect of the pre swirled flow and of the heavier axial wake produced by the esd observable through the values of the wake fractions in tables 8 and 9 resulting in operative points of the propeller moved toward heavier loadings using the bem the increase with respect to the reference case is foreseen to be of the order of 15 pps1 and pss2 to 20 pss2 1 ranse calculations predict a more conservative increment average of 10 and a maximum of 15 for pss2 1 which is comparable to the 10 13 increment observed in similar studies see for instance zondervan et al 2011 the differences between the coupled bem ranse and the fully ranse analyses as well as the influence of the pre swirl stator fins on local blade loads can be appreciated in details by comparing the blade unsteady loads when operating behind the stators fig 16 with those predicted for the reference hull fig 8 the presence of the stator fins and the modification of the functioning point of the propeller significantly changes the effective wake to the propeller as it can be appreciated from the computations of fig 14 using the coupled method the presence of one stator fin stimulates a disturbance in the lower portion of the propeller disk that is responsible for the local peak in the blade performance around 180 deg position fig 16a the agreement between bem and fully resolved propeller using ranse is qualitatively acceptable since blade loads by ranse calculations underline the same disturbances angular position and relative magnitude in the effective wake similarly to what observed for the reference hull configuration bem results are rather overestimated for the reasons discussed above especially in the first half of the propeller rotation 0 180 deg where the combination of decelerated wake and tangential velocities push the boundary element method to its limits the second fin of case pss2 introduces a second performance peak itself easily identifiable in the predicted effective wake respectively figs 16b and 14b which also in this case is confirmed in position and relative strength by the fully ranse analyses the overestimation of both thrust and torque when using bem calculations is clear particularly in the angular range 0 180 deg the inclusion of the third fin starboard and the different positioning of the fins portside instead consistently change the unsteady behaviour of the propeller blades the presence of two fins close to the sternpost uniforms the flow disturbance in the upper portion of the propeller disk resulting in the highest local values of delivered thrust and absorbed torque among the analysed cases the positioning of the second fin portside in the lower part of the disk mitigates the flow disturbance observed for pss1 and pss2 blade loads consequently are more uniform without any of the peaks observed for the one and the two fin cases the occurrence of cavitation specifically the increased risk of cavitation when the propeller operates in the wake disturbed by the pre swirl stator has been simply monitored by comparing the cavitation index computed for the reference ship at the design draft of the propeller shaft without free surface deformation with the pressure coefficient over the propeller blades of fig 17 since the pre swirl stator determines a reduction of the propeller rate of revolution the cavitation index at the design point for the reference ship about 3 45 is a precautionary choice the analyses both using the bem or the fully resolved ranse show very similar distributions of the pressure coefficients over the propeller blades regardless of the functioning condition a certain risk of leading edge tip vortex cavitation can be appreciated in the case of the reference ship without any pre swirl stator at the propeller tip when the blade is between 0 and 90 deg angular position the influence of the esd notwithstanding the overall increase of propeller loading seems not detrimental for cavitation inception which is always limited to the tip of the blade in presence of the fins in addition the strength of the hub vortex seems lower than in the case of the reference ship fig 18 as well as lower is the pressure reduction caused on the hub cap by the vortex itself even though the propeller loading is heavier wake fraction and propeller efficiency experience more than other quantities the influence of stator fins fully ranse analyses show a significant average deceleration of the flow with a reduction of the wake fraction 1 w of the order of 20 compared to the values predicted without any pre swirl stator calculations using the coupled bem ranse method instead predict variations deceleration of the flow not greater than 6 these differences can be due to the different way the effective wake fraction is computed using the coupled bem ranse method the estimation of the wake fraction is carried out directly by averaging over the propeller disk the effective wake calculated by the coupling algorithm fully ranse analyses instead make use of the open water propeller diagram and of the information from the self propulsion calculations propeller delivered thrust and rate of revolution to assess the wake fraction needed to meet the thrust identity between the thrust coefficient delivered in open water conditions and that delivered behind the hull a certain difference between these two ways of calculating the wake fraction and in particular the tendency of body force based approaches to underestimate the flow deceleration has been already observed in similar self propulsion calculations in this case however the port starboard non symmetrical tangential components of the flow to the propeller caused by the pre swirl fins may have a significant influence on these differences tangential flow contributes to the increase of the blade delivered thrust by changing the local angle of attack without any change in the axial flow that instead is the only parameter responsible for the thrust identity when the usual definition of wake fraction based on equivalent open water propeller performance is adopted this turns into an overestimation of the wake fraction flow deceleration when its calculation is based on the thrust identity assumption since the effect of the tangential flow in increasing the propeller delivered thrust is not considered and it is balanced by a false deceleration of the axial wake on the contrary the wake fraction computed by averaging the effective wake accounts only for the current local axial velocity and not also of the influence on the thrust of the tangential flow resulting in a significantly faster average inflow an increase of flow deceleration 1 w of the order of 15 20 like that seen in these calculations using fully ranse analyses is however comparable to those measured exactly with the same thrust identity approximation at the towing tank koushan et al 2020 or computed using ranse nielsen and jin 2019 dang et al 2012 kim et al 2015 the calculation of the propeller efficiency which is strictly correlated to the wake fraction suffers from these differences since the operative point of the propeller significantly moves towards high loading the propeller efficiency predicted using fully resolved ranse analyses reduces calculations predict a 6 8 lower propeller efficiency when using the swirling fins which is largely compensated by an increase of the hull efficiency the trend observed using the bem ranse method is opposite the propeller efficiency computed using bem and the averaged effective wake remains almost unchanged if computed using the thrust identity assumption and the open water propeller performance computed by bem in fig 2 the trend is confirmed also using the bem ranse method 4 4 off design operation while the design is normally carried out for the reference operative point at least the need of verifying the functioning of the esd in off design conditions different ship speed or draft when an optimization under uncertainties is not carried out is mandatory optimization intended as a design approach indeed works exactly to emphasize the peculiarities of a device in a specific operational regime exploiting for instance very local features of the flow once these conditions are not met the risk of abrupt degradations of the performance is real to this aim self propulsion points of the bare hull and the ship equipped with the three designed esds using the fully resolved ranse method have been computed at two additional ship speeds 11 6 and 17 4 kn froude number of 0 114 and 0 171 corresponding to 20 of the design value reference values with respect to which the relative improvements of figs 19 and 20 are calculated are 7 43 mw at 1 088 rps lower speed 15 61 mw at 1 389 rps design speed and 27 07 mw at 1 669 rps higher speed the tendencies discussed for the design speed are generally met also in off design looking at the self propulsion coefficients of fig 22 or at the propeller performance of figs 20 and 21 it is possible to appreciate the influence of the esd at any functioning condition they are responsible for a loading of the propeller as well as of a significant increase of the wake fraction compared to the reference hull case the performance of pss2 moreover are always in between those of pss1 and pss2 1 while the thrust deduction factor similarly to what observed at the design point is less influenced by the presence of the fins in terms of power savings the solution with three fins turns to be the most effective in the entire operation range since it provides a 2 5 additional saving compared to the solutions with one or two fins which instead guarantee very similar performance improvements it is worth to note anyhow that despite the fins work efficiently also in off design conditions it is at the design point that they offer the highest performance in light of the previous discussion this result in a certain measure proves the effectiveness of the optimization process 5 conclusions in the present work the design of an energy saving device based on the pre swirl stator concepts is illustrated using an optimization process a myriad of different configurations is analysed and automatically modified based on the feedback of previous calculations to comply with the design objectives and constraints which in this case are only of geometrical type for the estimation of the quantities of interest namely the delivered power which is considered as the most comprehensive merit parameter for the design a dedicated coupled bem ranse method has been developed to comply with the need of accurate predictions in a computationally efficient way the use of the bem ranse method coupled with a fully parametric fully automatic representation of the pre swirl stator fins allowed exploring widely and accurately the design space more widely than any proposed approach at least for now depending on the number of free parameters the three proposed designs analysed from 900 to 1700 geometries combined with the possibility of full customization of the fins shape depending on the local flow features this exploration of the design space allowed identifying geometries capable of remarkable improvements one and two fins configurations were capable of significant savings in the order of 6 which reach an outstanding 8 when the three fins configuration was considered fully ranse analyses confirmed the results of the optimizations for what regards the relative improvements in terms of delivered power and propeller rate of revolution compared to the reference case the high fidelity solver calculated for pss1 and pss2 test cases a saving of 5 which reaches a 7 9 reduction of the delivered power in the case of the optimal pre swirl geometry of case pss2 1 these analyses anyhow pointed out some differences especially from the propeller point of view which are ascribable to the already observed limitations of the bem when used in a very non uniform hull wakes in any case the overall trends associated with the influence of the pre swirl stator fins were confirmed the presence of the swirling fins determines higher loadings of the propeller since the functioning point moves toward lower advance coefficients due to the decelerated wake caused by the fins this results in a degradation of the propeller efficiency largely compensated by higher hull efficiency and the substantial reduction of the propeller rate of revolution which positively contributes to the reduction of the delivered power the thrust deduction factor is only slightly influenced by the presence of the fins even if the tendencies observed for the coupled method and the fully resolved propeller are discordant it can be stated that the optimization process worked to realize neutral fins avoiding any separation of the flow and the resulting additional resistance the different interactions between the flow by the actuator disk and the flow by the fully resolved propeller the pre swirl fins and the pressure distribution on the aft portion of the hull may explain these almost negligible differences the comparative analysis of the optimal designs demonstrated that each fin contributed unevenly to the total saving for this specific hull and propeller the presence of a second fin portside seems irrelevant regardless its angular positioning while the positioning of two fins port and starboard in their closest possible position to sternpost proved to be the most effective way of improving the overall propulsive efficiency of the ship compared to the results of similar analyses available in the literature these results show the importance of custom designs based on very detailed local flow quantities possible only using accurate computational tools employed in an integrated framework like that provided by optimization these conclusions are sustained indirectly by the results obtained in off design condition even if the designed systems still provide a substantial energy saving both at higher and lower velocities it is at the design speed that the improvements with respect to the reference case are better confirming the specificity of the design for a given functioning condition credit authorship contribution statement francesco

21047,a design method for pre swirl stators energy saving devices using a combined bem ranse approach is proposed ranse calculations using actuator disks are employed to provide the required thrust and the effective wake to an unsteady boundary element method through which the rate of revolution of the propeller and its averaged performance in self propulsion are evaluated an automatic variation of the pre swirl geometry driven by an optimization algorithm that operates on the parameters defining the device realizes an automatic try and error process which is used as a design tool for the maximization of the energy saving effect results obtained for different numbers of stator fins show outstanding improvements up to a reduction of the required shaft power of about 8 keywords pre swirl stators bem ranse coupling energy saving devices esd optimization sbdo 1 introduction reducing the environmental footprint of ships is of utmost importance in the last years attention was focused on radiated noise aspects as a consequence of increasing awareness of this type of pollution and its consequences on marine wildlife noise pollution in any case did not relax the concerns on traditional atmospheric pollutants like nox sox and other gaseous emissions the recent implementation and the mandatory nature of dedicated energy efficiency related indexes like the eedi and the eeoi from imo international maritime organization 2009a 2009b 2014 definitely encouraged the research activity on more energy efficient ships and on ways of improving the hydrodynamic efficiency both for new buildings and for retrofits besides the direct relationship between the reduction of atmospheric pollutants and the reduction of the ship operative costs i e fuel easily persuaded ship owners to invest resources in these developments the concept of energy saving devices esd has its origins in this need realize a simple and cost effective device capable of improving the overall propulsive efficiency of the ship as a whole by reducing its hydrodynamic losses currently there are many esds types in service that are classified by their working principle and mechanism used to modify the flow in proximity of the propeller through which realize the energy recovery wake equalizing ducts lammeren 1949 schneekluth 1989 affect the hull by reducing the flow separation at the stern pre and post swirl stators van terwisga 2013 streckwall h and xing kaeding 2017 dang et al 2012 propeller boss cap fins ouchi and ogura 1988 as well as high efficiency unconventional propellers andersen et al 2000 gaggero et al 2016 operate on axial and rotational losses of the propeller these are the solutions that demonstrated over a large range of vessels abs 2020 mewis 2009 2014 the highest performances their combination like in the case of the mewis becker system guiard and leonard 2013 leads to even higher savings thank to better exploitation of the hull propeller rudder interactions pre swirl stators which are the object of this study consist of a certain number 3 5 usually of fins mounted upstream the propeller they are a device developed to reduce the rotational losses of the propeller namely those related to the rotational component of the flow in the propeller slipstream differently from post swirl stators which try to straighten the rotational flow directly aft the propeller pre swirl stators are designed to generate a swirling flow opposite to the sense of rotation the combination of this swirling flow with the rotation induced by the propeller itself results in less rotation in the final slipstream which explains the energy saving provided by this device the blades of the propeller experience the swirling flow from the stator fins which can be interpreted as a fictitious increment of the rotative speed of the blades as an additional blade loading increasing the delivered thrust obviously a positive net gain it is possible only if the additional thrust provided by the propeller operating aft the pre swirl stator is higher than the resistance added to the ship by the presence of the fins themselves since the first application of kim et al 2004 literature results show very promising saving effects of this type of device a 6 saving is mentioned for the systems developed in the framework of the eu project grip streckwall and xing kaeding 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 prins et al 2016 zondervan et al 2011 indicated similar savings of 4 for a twin screw passenger vessel even if pss have their optimal applications like many others esd in the case of fully blocked ships where the flow at the stern of the vessel is strongly non uniform and the action of the device in homogenizing and redirecting it is in some way facilitated nielsen and jin 2019 proposed the controllable pre swirl fins concept to cope with non constant operative conditions slow steaming fouling weather change of draft and to ensure always the highest possible saving which in the case of the bulk carrier under analysis reached a 4 in terms of delivered shaft power a similar idea was exploited by using flapped pre swirl fins koushan et al 2020 developed pre swirl stators for a chemical tanker and their numerical results claiming a power savings of 2 5 were confirmed by a saving up to 3 2 during a dedicated model scale experimental campaign pre swirl stators were used also in combination with other devices typically a duct or a shroud it is the case of the mewis duct mewis 2009 2014 or the becker system guiard and leonard 2013 as well as of the l j shape duct of stiermann 1987 the presence of the duct has a dual function it provides additional structural integrity reducing at the same time the tip losses of the fins voermas 2017 and counteracts the effect of flow retardation to the propeller due to the fins themselves then providing an additional saving thanks to the flow equalization effect in addition to the well known mewis duct the wafon and the wafon d studied by kim et al 2015 or the fan shaped ducts proposed by chang et al 2019 exploit this combination of effects all these studies in any case pointed out some unavoidable need in the analysis and the design process of the esd which is not yet completely established and may heavily depend on the working principle of the device definitely full scale analyses become obvious since the flow characteristics may be substantially different from model scale in the specific case of pre swirl stators even if the improvements observed at model scale were confirmed for the real ship koushan et al 2020 nielsen and jin 2019 full scale analyses and measurements pointed out that the functioning conditions of the fins were substantially different reasonably allowing for additional savings in case of a design directly in full scale self propulsion calculations in the same way are needed since the esd propeller hull interactions to be exploited are those of the ship travelling under the action of its propeller strictly from the design point of view literature examples raised the need for custom configurations to maximize the positive pre swirl to the propeller and minimize side effects like flow separation on the fins vortex shedding and tip vortexes since they represent unrecoverable sources of energy loss that can nullify the positive action of the swirling fins in the specific case of pre swirl stators due to the stationary nature of the system each blade should be mutually different to comply with the local characteristics of the flow in turn influenced by the induced velocities of the propeller this means different pitches blade per blade potentially variable along the span from root to tip different choices of the sectional profile and the camber in addition to variations of the relative positioning axial and angular between the stator and the propeller the design of the pre swirl stator then has to consider these contrasting needs one fin could be added on the opposite side of the prevailing flow in the direction of the propeller starboard for a right handed propeller where its contribution to the swirling is negligible only if its action in reducing the influence of hull bilge vortexes on propeller performance for instance is higher than its additional resistance the pitch angle of the fins can be selected to maximize the influence on the propeller or eventually to produce thrust in both cases attention has to be paid respectively to the risk of flow separation and on the increase of the thrust deduction force on the hull the choice of opportune design criteria capable of embracing these conflicting objectives is then mandatory the reduction of the total resistance of the ship was a suitable criterion for the design of wake equalizing ducts furcas et al 2020 since their working principle relies on the reduction of the separated flow at the stern of the hull the reduction of the shaft delivered power obviously under self propulsion conditions instead seems more adequate for the design of the pre swirl stator because it considers the hull esd propeller system essentially as a whole this system approach requires a dedicated design methodology capable of dealing with the complexity of the problem if from the analysis point of view the literature is quite abundant from the design perspective there are only a few examples streckwall and xing kaeding 2017 proposed an analysis model employing propeller derived concepts like circulation which resulted adequate also to support the design process of pre swirl stators zondervan et al 2011 similarly employed a two stage design approach using a customized lifting line method applied to the pre swirl fins to derive the main characteristics diameter number of fins pitch of the device potential flow computations as well as ranse analyses were carried out to confirm the results of the design more recently nielsen and jin 2019 and koushan et al 2020 proposed systematic analyses of different pps configurations in terms of number of fins pitch and chord distributions among which identify the most suitable arrangement for the problem under investigation their approach can be classified as a design space exploration which turns into a manual semi automatic optimization process each time additional configurations with characteristics derived from the most promising geometries already analysed are added to the set of candidates results confirmed the reliability and in particular the flexibility of this approach which being entirely based on high fidelity ranse calculations naturally overcomes the limitations in terms of allowed geometries and functioning conditions of potential flow based methodologies widening the design space and potentially allowing for higher savings in case of unusual and unexplored configurations to fully exploit the potentialities of such a methodology however it is necessary to transform this design space exploration into a true simulation bases design optimization approach in which the identification of the optimal or the pareto optimal solutions is automatically driven to convergence by an optimization algorithm this would allow for a more systematic characterization of the design space and a true convergence to the global optimum the ingredients of this try and error methodology applied to pre swirl stators are not different from those needed for similar design strategies developed for propellers gaggero 2020 gaggero et al 2017a b 2020 or other esd gaggero 2018 furcas et al 2020 mizzi et al 2017 a parametric description of the geometry automatic pre and post processing from mesh to performance characterization of results and a computationally efficient solver are always needed this last point in the specific case of pre swirl stators is the most critical and limited the design to only a design space exploration in the work of nielsen and jin 2019 and koushan et al 2020 for instance in light of these issues the current paper aims to develop a true simulation based design optimization approach for pre swirl stators since the computational efficiency is the bottleneck of any sbdo for this design activity a customized bem ranse coupling method already exploited for self propulsion predictions gaggero et al 2017 2018 villa et al 2019 is employed none of the simplified self propulsion algorithms proposed in the literature indeed are completely suitable omitting fully ranse analyses for instance gaggero et al 2015 which doubtless would represent the most accurate approach both for the pre swirl stator its wake and the propeller its unsteady performance unsteady body forces coupled with ranse could be the optimal choice but their computational efficiency is still not adequate for a design process unsteady body forces were developed for an iterative coupling with ranse then requiring several runs of both the boundary element method to update forces and momentum sources of the ranse based on the current effective wake and the ranse to account for the propeller hull interactions each time the input to the bem in terms of effective wake is updated on the other side approaches based only on actuator disks whether translational or roto translational iteratively updated with the current value of ship resistance are too crude approximations while a decent estimation of the thrust deduction factor is possible through these methods they completely ignore the current unsteady functioning of the propeller if in a certain measure an estimation of the propeller rate of revolution is possible by using the propeller open water curves and some auxiliary variables like k t j 2 more consistent evaluations of the propeller performances including severe tangential velocity components like those due to the action of pre swirl fins are required for the design of efficient pre swirl stators since the recovery effect of these devices relies on axial and rotational losses for their characterization it is necessary to employ tools capable of reliably account for the influence of their modifications of the inflow to the propeller on the propeller performances themselves rather simplified estimations of the wake fraction only consequently are not sufficient the wake fraction commonly employed in self propulsion estimations accounts only for the axial component of the velocity field while pre swirl stator fins act mostly to modify the tangential component of the hull wake for the same reasons using only the propeller open water curves is not appropriate since with the pre swirl fins the role of the tangential components of the velocity field is not anymore balanced between the port and starboard side the usually accepted equivalence of propeller performance at the current advance coefficient i e corrected by the wake fraction does not hold anymore from the propeller side moreover it is necessary to have a local description of the wake field which collects the influence of the stator up to the propeller and to rely on efficient unsteady calculations to account carefully for the actual functioning of the propulsor the proposed process detailed in section 3 mixes some of the outcomes of simplified calculations using the actuator disk with unsteady bem calculations taking advantage of the procedure of gaggero et al 2018 and villa et al 2019 for efficient estimations of the effective wake that is still the link between bem and ranse it consists on the characterization of the flow field around the ship and the esd device using ranse analyses with an actuator disk to mimic the influence of the propeller action on the velocity and pressure field at the stern of the ship an unsteady bem instead is in charge of the calculations of the propeller functioning iterations ensure the convergence to the self propulsion point for any choice of the stator fins during the optimization process section 4 which is carried out by employing a genetic algorithm and a custom parametrization of the fins suitable for a flexible and generic representation of the geometry three designs changing the number of fins namely one fin portside pss1 two fins portside pss2 and two fins portside one fin starboard pss2 1 are proposed for the japan bulk carried section 2 results of the design process which ensures savings up to 8 are finally verified using fully ranse calculations including off design conditions i e variation of the ship speed to verify the sensitivity of the optimized configurations to slightly different inflows and the opportunity of a multi functioning points optimization 2 test case the japan bulk carrier the japan bulk carrier jbc is the reference ship chosen for demonstrating the potentiality of the proposed design approach this test case was specifically developed for the 7th workshop on cfd in ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2018 nmri 2015 to verify the reliability of cfd calculations also in presence of energy saving devices which in that case were of pre duct stern duct type this ship is a capesize bulk carrier designed by the national maritime research institute nmri yokohama university the shipbuilding research centre of japan src and classnk its main characteristics in full scale are summarized in table 1 the block coefficient qualifies the vessel as a full blocked ship measurements and calculations of the nominal wake in model scale shown three dimensional separation vortexes from the bilge part at the bottom of the stern and a significant component of the velocity oriented in the vertical direction despite the modification of the wake when full scale is considered these features make the jbc an excellent test case for the application of pre swirl energy saving devices since they are designed precisely for axial flow loss reduction the design speed corresponds to a froude number of 0 142 full scale speed of 14 5 kn 3 coupled bem ranse approach for pre swirl stator performance evaluation a reliable evaluation of the pre swirl effect on propeller performance and then on the entire propulsive system is possible only through the analysis of the self propulsion condition of the ship from the propeller point of view at first it is necessary to account for the effective wake in the determination of its rate of revolution at equilibrium the modification to the flow field due to the presence of the pre swirl fins in turn is influenced by the action of the propeller itself since from the computational point of view fully resolved ranse analyses of the ship in self propulsion conditions are prohibitive in the framework of a design process based on the systematic analysis of hundreds thousands of different configurations a simplified but reliable process is needed current calculations consequently have been carried out by exploiting the potentialities of the coupled bem ranse method developed for self propulsion predictions gaggero et al 2017 2018 villa et al 2019 using radially variable load actuator disk models and supported by the simplified method for self induced velocities estimation which uses calculations in equivalent uniform flow only the process is described in gaggero et al 2018 and villa et al 2019 and it is briefly summarized in section 3 3 the coupling between bem and ranse described in section 3 3 is realized using ranse for the estimation of the ship resistance the wake field nominal and total to the propeller and the self propulsion coefficients wake fraction and thrust deduction factor with the help of the actuator disk in full scale bem for the characterization of the unsteady propeller performance in the effective wake obtained from ranse analyses through which determine the functioning conditions delivered thrust absorbed torque and required power at shaft in correspondence of the self propulsion point 3 1 boundary element method for propeller performance estimation the boundary element method used in current calculations is the bem developed at the university of genoa gaggero et al 2010 2014 it is formulated based on the perturbation potential concept of morino et al 1975 and it uses a distribution of piecewise constant dipoles and sources over a surface mesh consisting of hyperboloidal panels to solve the integral equation resulting from the underlying laplace problem the code is a non cavitating solver that can work in steady and unsteady mode respectively for the characterization of the open water propeller performances and the prediction of the functioning in behind conditions calculations have been carried out with a surface mesh of 1682 panels on the key blade 1250 panels and its portion of the hub following kinnas and hsin 1992 an example of the mesh arrangement is given in fig 1 in both steady and unsteady modes results take advantage of an iterative alignment of the trailing vortical wake similar to that of pyo and kinnas 1997 in unsteady functioning the procedure is limited to a wake alignment carried out as the propeller was working in the circumferentially averaged axial inflow using then the mean axial inflow at each radial position as the undisturbed flow in the alignment process overall the open water propeller performances fig 2 are predicted reasonably well by the bem across the entire range of advance coefficients considered in the analysis differences are quite limited in correspondence with the loaded conditions j 0 3 0 4 the delivered thrust is underestimated by less than 2 and the torque of about 3 5 in correspondence of the design point approximatively between j 0 4 and j 0 6 the differences are less than 2 for both thrust and torque and only at very unloaded functioning the predicted thrust is sensibly overestimated 10 at j equal to 0 7 these performances as well as those by ranse which for the sake of completeness are summarized in the same figure are used to guess the initial rate of revolution of the propeller in the iterative assessment of the self propulsion point using the unsteady boundary element method in steady mode the bem was useful also to determine the current distributions of the axial and tangential load used in the self propulsion calculations using the actuator disk gaggero et al 2018 steady bem calculations indeed were used to compute the axial and tangential forces at several radial positions of the blade using as inflow the circumferentially averaged velocity distribution of the wake alignment process and in correspondence of the advance coefficient preliminary computed for the self propulsion condition of the ship without any esd these distributions were assigned in the self propulsion calculations to the actuator disk to include in the ranse analyses a more accurate description compared to the usual constant momentum sources of the propeller action accounting at least for its radial non uniformity their magnitude was scaled based on the current thrust required by the ship in this case also the distribution of tangential forces was necessary to include the rotational effect of the propeller on the surrounding flow field a pre swirl stator acts on both the axial and the tangential components of the hull and propeller wake and consequently a more reliable estimation of the effective wake accounting also for the tangential components of self induced velocities is required 3 2 ranse solver for ship and hull wake performance estimation ranse calculations were carried out using starccm siemens plm 2017 which is a finite volume structured unstructured cell centered ranse code with the mesh motions and the volume of fluid capabilities necessary in principle to fully address the issues rotating propeller and fluid fluid interactions for free surface prediction related to the simulation of a ship in self propulsion conditions throughout the process ranse analyses were employed to characterize the ship performance in the coupled bem ranse approach and to validate the outcomes of the design process using analyses with the fully resolved propeller since however the computational effort of solving the free surface is prohibitive in an optimization based design process additional simplifications to those already introduced in the discussion i e the use of an actuator disk were adopted in particular only double model calculations without the free surface have been considered the assumption is that the wave pattern generated by the hull has only a small influence on the pre swirl stator and the propeller performance hence negligible at least in the preliminary design phase and for the relatively low froude number considered equal to fr 0 142 this allows for the calculation of the total ship resistance following the simplified approach proposed in gaggero et al 2017 gaggero et al 2018 and gaggero et al 2019 and successfully applied in similar optimization processes involving the estimation of the ship drag in self propulsion condition furcas et al 2020 koushan et al 2020 a constant wave resistance contribution i e independent of the propeller working condition and the presence of the pre swirl can be computed by subtracting the double model drag to the total hull resistance predicted in towing conditions with the free surface d r a g f r e e s u r f w i t h o u t p r o p d r a g d o u b l e m o d e l w i t h o u t p r o p the value obtained includes the pure wave resistance and all the double model approximations such as the variation of the hull wetted surface by adding it to the current drag of the double model a reasonable estimation of the total hull drag is possible allowing for cost effective self propulsion predictions 1 d r a g f r e e s u r f w i t h p r o p d r a g d o u b l e m o d e l w i t h p r o p d r a g f r e e s u r f w i t h o u t p r o p d r a g d o u b l e m o d e l w i t h o u t p r o p a negligible stern wave due to the low froude number as in the present case only slightly influences the velocity field on the stern of the ship see for instance the comparison of nominal wakes with and without free surface effect in gaggero et al 2017 and koushan et al 2020 neglecting it then should not significantly influence the pre swirl design and its influence on propeller functioning computational meshes were realized consistently and to analyse the ship performance in full scale for this purpose the sst k omega turbulence model was adopted calculations used a 1 of turbulence intensity at inlet and an eddy viscosity ratio of 10 the non dimensional wall distance was kept with an appropriate choice of prims layers number and growth factor mostly in the range 200 300 over the hull surface the reference configuration is that of the double model calculation since most of the analyses in the coupled bem ranse method rely on results from this arrangement an overview of the computational meshes depending on the application is given in fig 4 the reference mesh of the double model for the hull without any appendage fig 4a consists of about 2 million elements realized with hexa dominant cells and ten prism layers at the walls spaced with a 1 5 ratio geometric progression local refinements visible at the stern of the ship surround the location of the propeller both in the case of the simple actuator disk of fig 4a and in the case of the fully resolved propeller of fig 4d f as well as that of the pre swirl stators fig 4e this is the reference mesh used for instance to obtain the double model drag of eq 1 in the case of calculations using the actuator disk the possibility to exploit the ship symmetry is prevented by both the usual unsymmetrical nature of the pre swirl stator and by the need to account also in the case of the simplest actuator disk calculations for the rotational effect of the propeller thanks to the tangential momentum sources included in the model this is moreover the reference mesh used for the sensitivity analysis proposed for the validation of the method section 3 4 the inclusion of the fully resolved propeller for the final analyses aimed at validating the simplified bem ranse coupling and then the outcomes of the design process required to set up a rotating domain using sliding interfaces it is the case of fig 4d where the inner cylindrical domain encompassing the propeller is visible the resulting mesh consists of about 4 million cells two of which are used in the rotating region in particular since the flow around the propeller has not a prevalent orientation the inner region was discretized with polyhedral elements and a custom prism layer tailored to the specific functioning of the propeller the presence of the pre swirl stator requires additional local refinements around the fins and in their wakes fig 4e f to account reliably for the modification of the inflow to the propeller their inclusion in the computational domain leads regardless of the propeller model used for calculations to a growth in the cell count of about 400 thousand elements per fin fig 4b finally shows the arrangement for the free surface calculations needed in eq 1 to extract the wave resistance for the self propulsion assessment in this case since the calculation was carried out without propeller and appendages following the accepted simplifications it was possible to exploit the symmetry of the problem in this case the grid for half of the ship counts about 1 4 million cells organized as usual with the local anisotropic refinements across the free surface at the design ship speed the wave resistance of eq 1 is equal to 360 kn at the lower and higher ship speed considered for off design analyses fr 0 114 and 0 171 this contribution is respectively equal to 166 kn and 554 kn 3 3 actuator disk for bem ranse coupling the two way link between the ranse and the bem body forces for the ranse effective wake for the bem is realized in a weak form avoiding any iterations by exploiting only the results of actuator disk calculations for computationally efficient analyses momentum sources replace inside the ranse the action of the propeller behind the ship the coupling between the bem and the ranse is weak since the bem differently to other approaches gaggero et al 2017 provides only the radial distributions fig 3 of circumferentially constant loads to be used inside the actuator disk to distribute the sources which strength is scaled to satisfy the force equilibrium differently from similar approaches the actuator disk is steady since the strength of sources does not vary with the blade revolution only a variation along the blade radius is used corresponding to a circumferentially averaged blade load computed radial position per radial position by the bem subjected to the circumferentially averaged inflow of the nominal wake with this model similarly to more usual constant actuator disks it is not possible to account for local variations of the load due to local features of the incoming flow since the load distribution is based on circumferentially averaged blade performance similarly it is not possible to account neither for local variations of the induced velocities which are treated themselves in a circumferential averaged way this is however coherent with the simplified approach adopted to compute the effective wake for unsteady bem calculations when any actuator disk model is employed indeed only the equilibrium thrust and the consequently thrust deduction factor can be directly determined by the simulation unfortunately these data are not sufficient for the assessment of the unsteady propeller performances the determination of the effective wake fraction and more in general of the spatial distribution of the effective wake to be provided to the bem needs a dedicated analysis following the usual procedure adopted for the analysis of self propulsion tests is not possible since the propeller rate of revolution is not know it is not possible to make use of the open water propeller diagrams to obtain the wake fraction which in any case using this procedure would be a scaling constant and not the required spatial distribution of the non uniform inflow the non uniform distribution of the effective velocity over the propeller plane and the usual wake fraction by the integral of this field can be calculated in several ways by employing iterative approaches they take care of the self induced velocities of the propeller computed using the bem and the total velocity obtained by the ranse with the presence of propeller equivalent momentum sources to derive iteratively the effective wake which in turn determines the magnitude of body forces that realize the self propulsion point all these approaches however require some iterations of the solvers that unaffordably increase the computational effort of the entire process the procedure developed in gaggero et al 2018 allows approximating the self induced velocities field only through a dedicated open water simulation this approximation consists of the same actuator disk used for self propulsion i e same radial distribution of load providing the same thrust of the self propulsion condition that operates in a uniform flow having a velocity equal to the value of the averaged nominal wake measured during towing tests in such a way an approximated self induced velocity field on the propeller plane and consequently the effective wake for bem calculations can be directly evaluated without any bem ranse iteration in particular 2 v e f f e c t i v e s h i p v t o t a l s h i p v t o t a l d i s k v s h i p 1 w n o m i n a l where v t o t a l s h i p is the total velocity field carlton 2007 computed by ranse in self propulsion condition on the propeller plane with the influence of the actuator disk v t o t a l d i s k is the total velocity field on the propeller plane of an open water analysis where the actuator disk loaded with the same distribution used in behind ship condition and delivering the same thrust of self propulsion condition is subjected to a uniform inflow equivalent to the averaged nominal wake of the ship i e v s h i p 1 w n o m i n a l v s h i p is the ship velocity 1 w n o m i n a l is the nominal wake fraction in towing condition by using only actuator disk calculations this approach in the end approximates the propeller self induced velocities under the effective wake as those produced by the propeller under the nominal wake however since the propellers that is the actuator disks under both wakes are delivering the same thrust using a spatial distribution of load that represents the circumferential averaged functioning of the blade this approximation seems plausible in the context of this type of calculations the resulting self induced velocities that are radially varying and circumferentially averaged exactly as a consequence of the actuator disk producing this field can be consequently used to successfully estimate an effective wake since they are combined with a total velocity field based on the same actuator disk action gaggero et al 2018 3 4 the coupling algorithm the coupling algorithm for the efficient evaluation of the self propulsion condition of the ship is outlined in the flow chart of fig 5 the process is described in the most general case that includes the pre swirl stator but obviously applies also for the bare hull it consists of seven main blocks that make use of both the bem and the ranse calculations described above to realize a computationally efficient process exploitable in an optimization environment the key point of the process is the estimation of the unsteady propeller performances necessary to determine in self propulsion conditions the delivered power of the propeller which is the design objective to be minimized since it represents the most comprehensive merit parameter for the design to this aim the evaluation of the ship resistance i e the required propeller thrust is required at first using the approximation of eq 1 both the double model resistance with and without the action of the propeller are required block 1 considers the double model resistance in towing condition block 2 instead is in charge of the analyses that account for the action of the propeller this is done using entirely actuator disk calculations since the evaluation of the influence of the propeller on the pressure field on the stern of the ship the thrust deduction factor using this approach always resulted satisfactory gaggero et al 2017 fu et al 2015 kim et al 2006 the primary output of these analyses in addition to the thrust deduction and the ship resistance block 3 are the nominal and the total wakes on the propeller plane which in turn are one of the inputs needed to assess the propeller self induced velocities block 4 is devoted to this calculation that realizes the weak bem ranse coupling described in section 3 2 by subtracting these approximated self induced velocities from the total velocity field obtained in block 2 the effective wake field can be determined in block 5 once the effective wake fraction of the resulting non uniform field and the thrust deduction factor from block 3 are known also the propeller revolution rate can be estimated utilizing the numerical open water propeller curves these are the first guessed propeller performances of block 6 block 7 finally is in charge of the unsteady characterization of the propeller using bem calculations it accepts as input the effective wake evaluated in block 5 the preliminary estimation of the propeller rate of revolution using open water curves and the target thrust determined by the self propulsion analysis using the actuator disk in this case the effective wake does not change iteration per iteration as in the case of the computations using iterative and spatially varying body forces approaches since it is assumed that the simplified actuator disk is equivalent to the unsteady propeller in terms of both averaged self induced velocities and delivered forces iterations instead are used to tune the propeller rate of revolution accounting for the spatial non uniformity of the wake and the modification of the tangential components of the inflow and not only of the averaged axial variation taken into account by the wake fraction caused by the stator fins once the propeller rate of revolution necessary to provide an averaged unsteady thrust equal to the ship resistance in self propulsion that of block 3 has been determined the time averaged delivered power can be determined to assess the performance of the propulsive configuration under investigation 3 5 validation of the method first the simplified approach of fig 5 has been validated in the case of the jbc in self propulsion without any installed esd in the absence of measurements validation is made with fully resolved rans analyses the design speed as well as two additional ship speeds 20 are considered to assess if and to what extent the improvements achieved at the design speed allows for savings also in off design section 4 4 they represent the baseline for comparisons with the optimal geometries identified by the optimization process the first analysis concerns the sensitivity to the mesh density which is necessary to assess the numerical uncertainties of the calculations and discuss the reliability of the savings observed with the presence of the pre swirl stators to this aim five variations of the reference mesh have been prepared by scaling except for the finest configuration the reference size by a factor of 2 this leads to six grids having from about 0 5 to 17 million cells which were used in the computational process of fig 5 to obtain the self propulsion point and then the delivered propeller power the results of the analysis using the estimation of the numerical uncertainties proposed by eça l and hoekstra 2014 is given in fig 6 the convergence trend is satisfactory also considering that the results of the calculations are a combination of very different approaches the reference mesh which underestimates the extrapolated value of delivered power by 0 5 grants an uncertainty equal to 2 which can be considered a satisfactory result for the application of this computationally efficient arrangement in an optimization process the same level of uncertainty is observed in presence of a pre swirl stator incidentally in this figure the optimal pss2 of section 4 3 using grids from 0 75 to 32 million cells confirming the reliability of the setup fig 7 collects the wakes at the design speed obtained at the various step of the coupling approach the nominal wake 1 w is 0 645 and the effective one 0 665 self propulsion coefficients are summarized in table 2 for the design speed off design points are described in tables 3 and 4 there are some differences between the predictions fully resolved ranse vs coupled bem ranse that in any case and especially in the light of the simplifications of the procedure are deemed more than acceptable at the design point the difference in terms of predicted rate of revolution is negligible but it results from the balance of opposite trends thrust deduction using the actuator disk is slightly underestimated as well as the wake fraction which is calculated by integrating the effective wake on the propeller plane in the case of the coupled procedure in the case of fully ranse analyses this is done instead by using the open water diagrams of the propeller fig 2 the averaged thrust and torque coefficients from unsteady bem due to functionings at a slightly lower advance coefficient are consequently slightly higher than those calculated by the fully resolved ranse for instance by looking at the unsteady blade loads of fig 8 it is possible to appreciate where these differences originate bem calculations overestimate both delivered thrust and absorbed torque in the first half of the propeller rotation 45 180 while in correspondence of the unloaded angular positions 180 360 bem results are more close to ranse reasons for this behaviour can be ascribed to the type of actuator disk which employs radial distributions of axial and tangential forces that are circumferentially constant then there are no differences in the local momentum source intensities depending on the local load of the blade induced velocities as those of fig 7d changes radially but not circumferentially and their combination with the total wake itself affected by this approximation could lead to the differences in axial and vertical components of the effective velocity field which explain the different wake fraction and the different loads predicted by the unsteady bem in addition reasons for these differences can be recognized in the well documented discrepancies between bem and ranse calculations in very decelerated and non uniform wakes discussed in gaggero et al 2014 and gaggero et al 2019 despite these differences the rate of revolution is almost the same since the ship resistance with the coupled approach is about 2 6 higher thrust deduction of 0 784 with respect to 0 804 than that computed with the resolved propeller at the end of the propulsion chain delivered powers differ less than 4 which can be considered a good result for the type of applications these simplified self propulsion calculations have been developed for off design conditions mainly confirm the results obtained at the design speed also in this case the very positive results in terms of predicted delivered power by the coupled bem ranse which is always within 3 of fully resolved ranse results are a consequence of a balancing of opposite tendencies calculations with the unsteady bem always overestimate propeller performances on the other hand bem ranse operates with a slightly higher thrust deduction and the combination leads to predicted propeller rates of revolutions that are very close to calculations with the fully resolved propeller in the end these results accounting for the severe approximations needed for an efficient evaluation of the self propulsion point seem more than acceptable legitimizing the embedding of this procedure into the optimization loop 4 design cases 4 1 the pre swirl stator parametric description a parametric description of the geometry is mandatory in a design by optimization process it defines the design space that in accordance with the fidelity of the solver should be widened as much as possible to encompass unfamiliar solutions and maximize the chance of success of the optimization procedure at the same time it should be achieved with the smallest possible number of parameters to ease the convergence and it should account for geometric constraints discarding unfeasible geometries avoiding the wasting of computational time in the case of the pre swirl stators the description is quite simple since their geometry fundamentally fins at a certain angle of attack and position in space can be handled by few parameters that directly control the features of the system i e its capability of redirect the flow to the propeller responsible of its successfully functioning an example of the design parameters adopted in the current design is given in fig 9 they could be organized into global and local parameters global parameters are those affecting the size and position of the fins the diameter which defines the span of the fins the longitudinal distance from the propeller assuming that all the fins lie on the same plane and the angular position of each fin local parameters are those pertinent to the single fin which depending on its position need to be adjusted to comply with the local flow features in particular each fin is treated as a twisted wing by defining the angle of attack at the root αroot and the angle of attack at the tip αtip chord equal for all the fins of the system is defined at the root a taper ratio sets the value at the tip for both these quantities angle of attack and chord a linear variation is assumed along the span in addition each fin has its sectional profile defined by the maximum sectional curvature and thickness ratio selected among the naca 4 digit series having the chordwise position of the maximum camber at 40 of the chord from the leading edge the range of variations of the design parameters case pss2 1 is summarized in table 5 the only annotation is that the angular position of the second fin portside if any is given as a percentage of the remaining angle π θ1 minus a tolerance that is used to avoid self intersecting fins at the root in case of only one fin portside case pss1 and two fins portside case pps2 its angular position can span from 10 to 170 or 10 90 deg respectively whit this choice of parameters the design activities proposed in this paper turn respectively into a 9 pss1 a 13 pss2 and a 17 pss2 1 free variables optimization problems which are solved using the optimization strategies of section 4 2 4 2 the optimization framework the design process conceived as an optimization problem in principle is not different from similar activities successfully adopted to propellers gaggero 2020 or energy saving devices furcas et al 2020 mizzi et al 2017 essentially the optimization works like an automatic try and error procedure fig 10 thanks to the combination of a parametric description of the device to be designed robust and efficient tools to estimate its quantities of interests objectives and or constraints and a framework where to organize and automatize this process in the current case the setup of the optimization environment is relatively easy being the design process a single objective non constrained optimization problem which has been coded into modefrontier esteco 2017 despite the single objective minimization of the delivered power nature of the problem a genetic algorithm has been preferred in place of more efficient single objective searching algorithms to avoid local minima and provide more reliable trends for all the design cases the initial population for the genetic evolution consists of 10 times the number of free parameters table 6 distributed on the design space the design of experiments using uniform latin hypercube sampling this provides a sufficiently accurate exploration of the design space minimizing the correlations between candidates identifying areas of interest and avoiding as much as possible initial concentrations on local minima maxima that could condition the entire evolution of optimal candidates the optimized geometries have been selected after 10 evolutions of the initial sample the total number of analysed geometries is then relatively small if compared with the thousands tens of thousands configurations usually considered when using low fidelity approaches like bem the relatively simple nature of the current problem and the need for a balance of design times justify the limitations of the proposed analyses based on which anyhow significant results can be extracted 4 3 test cases one fin portside pss1 two fins portside pss2 and two fins portside one fin starboard pss2 1 the results of the three design activities based on the flowchart of fig 5 are summarized in the plot of fig 11 the performance i e the predicted delivered power of all the configurations tested in the optimization processes are categorized based on the genetic generations of the process and compared to the performance of the reference hull without any esd tested in self propulsion conditions using the same approach in the same plot also the optimal configurations identified for each of the design runs are highlighted for the pss1 case the optimal geometry is the last geometry tested by the process id 900 for the pss2 case the optimal configuration is id 1292 while for the pss2 1 case the best geometry is id 1481 fig 13 and table 7 these are also the geometries for which detailed fully resolved ranse self propulsion analyses similar to those employed in the validation of the coupling method of section 3 have been carried out both to confirm the results of the design process and to provide additional validation of the method the convergence trend is well visible for all the design runs since already from the third generation the predicted delivered power is permanently below the reference value of the ship without any pre swirl predicted improvements are notable even one fin alone provides a saving higher than 5 that easily increases up to 8 when the three fins configuration is considered these savings especially those of the pss2 1 case are decisively better than those collected in the literature see for instance the 4 of koushan et al 2020 the 6 of schuiling and van terwisga 2017 or the 2 8 of nielsen and jin 2019 they prove also by using the results of the fully resolved ranse analyses proposed in the next the effectiveness of the design method based on the paradigm of optimization the evolution of the design parameters during the optimizations denotes the same convergence observable for some of them in fig 12 for the pss1 design case the achievement of convergence is undeniable the highest saving is obtained by using the widest possible fin maximum fin diameter combined with the largest chord placed as close as possible to the sternpost θ1 10 since for this design the range of variation of this design parameter is set from 10 to 170 this explains the disturbance in the effective wake field computed by the coupled bem ranse method close to the 12 o clock position of fig 14 which is caused by the wake of the fin itself the presence of the second fin on the portside slightly alters the geometrical characteristics of the first one also in this case relatively wide fins are preferred since the diameter of the fins converges to the upper bound of its range and larger chords are selected regardless of the possibility of very low values of the angle of installation θ1 the optimal configuration of id 1292 sets this value equal to 25 deg then slightly higher than the lower bound adopted when only one fin was considered the second fin has an intermediate position 50 of the remaining angular space resulting in the additional disturbance observable in the effective wake of fig 14 this optimal positioning in particular the preference of a sternpost placing is coherent with that observed in koushan et al 2020 for what concerns the first fin pss1 and pss2 are very similar designs as also observed from the detailed characteristics of the optimal configurations of table 7 their performances are almost the same having id 1292 only a marginal improvement 5 9 versus 5 7 with respect to id 900 as if the second fin was irrelevant for an additional power saving the inclusion of the third fin on the starboard side instead consistently improves the saving provided by the esd introducing moreover a certain influence in the positioning of the second fin on the port side while indeed highest diameters and chords are still preferred as well as the positioning of the first portside fin close to the sternpost in this case the lower bound is set to 22 deg the position of the second fin converge during the optimization to the lower portion of the disk the third fin moves itself to the sternpost from starboard reaching a converged position of 335 deg that is very close to the upper bound set for the range of variation of this parameter these tendencies are clear even if trends observed for the design objective and parameters denote a non completely satisfied convergence supported by the comparison with pss1 and pss2 these results indicate for this specific ship the relevance of fins placed at sternpost one at port one at starboard side which seems to be those more influential for the energy saving effect of the device compared to the effective wake of the bare hull fig 7d the presence of one fin at sternpost portside id 900 and id 1292 indeed reduces the radial vertical component of the flow and makes it more tangential in a direction opposite to the propeller rotation the increase of the positive pre swirl to the blade in the angular range 330 deg 30 deg provided by this fin is higher than that provided by the fin when placed in the more common 240 270 deg angular position as it can be seen in fig 14b in the latter case the presence of the second fin portside is not able to counteract the prevailing direction of the flow which almost remains concordant with the propeller rotation and then less effective for the energy saving a second fin close to sternpost on the starboard side as for id 1481 furthermore guides the flow towards a pure tangential direction which is beneficial for the efficient functioning of the propeller the other characteristics of the fins camber and pitch mainly strictly depend on their positioning and then to the mutual interactions occurring between the hull wake the fins themselves and the action of the propeller a comprehensive analysis of their role for the reduction of the delivered power is provided in fig 15 where the results of a student test are provided in terms of strength of the relationship between the input design parameters and the output results of the student test cannot be considered conclusive samples are limited and not properly distributed over the design space being the result of an optimization but they can result helpful in highlighting trends and general design guidelines the sign besides provides an indication circa the kind of the relationship direct or inverse among inputs and outputs positive negative values of the bar diagram of fig 15 stand for a direct inverse relationship an increase in the value of that parameter determines an increase decrease of the output the role of the diameter of the angular positioning of the fins and the chord discussed earlier is confirmed by this test a reduction of the delivered power is achieved by increasing the diameter the chord and the angular position of the second and third fin inverse effect while for the same aim it is necessary to reduce the angular position of the first fin also the pitch angle of each fin has a certain importance which instead seems limited in the case of the hydrofoil cambers being their influence strength generally lower than that of other design parameters as expected the design process selects twisted geometries to comply with the differences of the incoming flow and the propeller induced velocities from root to tip i e from the decelerated flow in the boundary layer close to the hull to the almost undisturbed flow in the outer part of the propeller disk the average angle of attack and the camber of the fins in any case is towards an increase of the local velocities opposite to the rotation of the propeller negative angle in the fin local reference system of fig 9 a detailed comparison of the self propulsion coefficients of the optimal pre swirl stators identified by the optimization process and analysed using fully ranse calculations tables 8 and 9 confirms most of the outcomes of the design process and the reliability for comparative purposes of the coupled bem ranse method the agreement in terms of predicted propeller rate of revolution and reduction of the required delivered power is reasonable compared to the reference case without any pre swirl stator the inclusion of one fin determines a reduction between 5 fully resolved and 6 coupled bem ranse of the propeller rate of revolution at self propulsion in the most complex case of pss2 1 the reduction is 8 3 for the coupled bem ranse and 6 7 for the fully resolved propeller while for pss2 id 1292 both methods highlight a slight increase in the propeller rate of revolution compared to pss1 id 900 between the two methods the relative difference in the predicted rps at equilibrium is never greater than 2 and the trends even if limited to only three geometries are well in agreement this is a significantly higher reduction of the propeller rate of revolution compared to koushan et al 2020 or nielsen and jin 2019 heavily contributing to the observed reduction of the delivered power similar conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of the predicted delivered power both the approaches estimate a reduction of the delivered power greater than 5 for id 900 5 7 and 5 4 respectively by the coupled method and the fully resolved ranse and a saving up to 8 8 4 by the coupled method 8 by the fully resolved rans for id 1481 from the pss2 1 case the optimal two fin configuration id 1292 as already observed by comparing the optimization histories using only the coupled bem ranse or the propeller rate of revolution appears very similar to id 900 with the same delivered power reduction of 5 4 fully ranse analysis also in the case of the delivered power the trend observed using the coupled method is confirmed by the fully ranse analyses relative differences between the two methodologies are not greater than 3 5 and in any case they remain very similar to those seen for the reference hull the comparison of other propulsive coefficients as well as of the propeller performance is only decent in terms of tendencies since the differences initially observed for the reference hull configuration and mainly ascribable to the limitations of the boundary element method are exacerbated by the presence of the fins and their wakes to the propeller calculations using the coupled bem ranse method predict slightly higher values of ship resistance in self propulsion conditions and then slightly higher values for the thrust deduction factor t even if a clear tendency towards an increase of resistance due to the presence of the fins cannot be asserted with any of the two computational approaches the presence of the stator fins considered part of the hull generally contributes bem ranse calculations to a very small increase less than 4 of the deduction factor t which is in agreement with the full ranse analyses and the towing tank experiments of koushan et al 2020 and dang et al 2012 increase of t of about 5 on the contrary the proposed fully resolved ranse analyses provide a thrust deduction factor t that decreases with the inclusion of the stator fins also in this case the magnitude of the variation is negligible and comparable to the uncertainty of this kind of calculations the overestimation of the ship resistance contributes to the higher values observed for the thrust coefficient of the propeller when predicted using bem combined with the overprediction of the propeller performance by the bem in severe non uniform wakes those exactly stimulated by the presence of the stator fins this can explain the underestimation of the propeller rate of revolution from bem compared to the results obtained using the fully resolved ranse propeller lower propeller rps at equilibrium only partially compensates the overestimation of the propeller averaged absorbed torque itself due to the inherent limitations of the approach in very off design conditions this results in the slightly higher values of delivered power predicted by the coupled method compared to the values calculated using the fully ranse method both the analyses in any case point out an increase of thrust and torque coefficients of the propeller when it operates with the stator fins this increment is higher when using the bem for the calculations of the propeller performance usual limitations of the method in strongly non uniform wakes and approximated calculation of the effective wake using circumferentially averaged values of self induced velocities the increase of propeller thrust and torque coefficients for the cases with the pre swirl stator is due to the combined effect of the pre swirled flow and of the heavier axial wake produced by the esd observable through the values of the wake fractions in tables 8 and 9 resulting in operative points of the propeller moved toward heavier loadings using the bem the increase with respect to the reference case is foreseen to be of the order of 15 pps1 and pss2 to 20 pss2 1 ranse calculations predict a more conservative increment average of 10 and a maximum of 15 for pss2 1 which is comparable to the 10 13 increment observed in similar studies see for instance zondervan et al 2011 the differences between the coupled bem ranse and the fully ranse analyses as well as the influence of the pre swirl stator fins on local blade loads can be appreciated in details by comparing the blade unsteady loads when operating behind the stators fig 16 with those predicted for the reference hull fig 8 the presence of the stator fins and the modification of the functioning point of the propeller significantly changes the effective wake to the propeller as it can be appreciated from the computations of fig 14 using the coupled method the presence of one stator fin stimulates a disturbance in the lower portion of the propeller disk that is responsible for the local peak in the blade performance around 180 deg position fig 16a the agreement between bem and fully resolved propeller using ranse is qualitatively acceptable since blade loads by ranse calculations underline the same disturbances angular position and relative magnitude in the effective wake similarly to what observed for the reference hull configuration bem results are rather overestimated for the reasons discussed above especially in the first half of the propeller rotation 0 180 deg where the combination of decelerated wake and tangential velocities push the boundary element method to its limits the second fin of case pss2 introduces a second performance peak itself easily identifiable in the predicted effective wake respectively figs 16b and 14b which also in this case is confirmed in position and relative strength by the fully ranse analyses the overestimation of both thrust and torque when using bem calculations is clear particularly in the angular range 0 180 deg the inclusion of the third fin starboard and the different positioning of the fins portside instead consistently change the unsteady behaviour of the propeller blades the presence of two fins close to the sternpost uniforms the flow disturbance in the upper portion of the propeller disk resulting in the highest local values of delivered thrust and absorbed torque among the analysed cases the positioning of the second fin portside in the lower part of the disk mitigates the flow disturbance observed for pss1 and pss2 blade loads consequently are more uniform without any of the peaks observed for the one and the two fin cases the occurrence of cavitation specifically the increased risk of cavitation when the propeller operates in the wake disturbed by the pre swirl stator has been simply monitored by comparing the cavitation index computed for the reference ship at the design draft of the propeller shaft without free surface deformation with the pressure coefficient over the propeller blades of fig 17 since the pre swirl stator determines a reduction of the propeller rate of revolution the cavitation index at the design point for the reference ship about 3 45 is a precautionary choice the analyses both using the bem or the fully resolved ranse show very similar distributions of the pressure coefficients over the propeller blades regardless of the functioning condition a certain risk of leading edge tip vortex cavitation can be appreciated in the case of the reference ship without any pre swirl stator at the propeller tip when the blade is between 0 and 90 deg angular position the influence of the esd notwithstanding the overall increase of propeller loading seems not detrimental for cavitation inception which is always limited to the tip of the blade in presence of the fins in addition the strength of the hub vortex seems lower than in the case of the reference ship fig 18 as well as lower is the pressure reduction caused on the hub cap by the vortex itself even though the propeller loading is heavier wake fraction and propeller efficiency experience more than other quantities the influence of stator fins fully ranse analyses show a significant average deceleration of the flow with a reduction of the wake fraction 1 w of the order of 20 compared to the values predicted without any pre swirl stator calculations using the coupled bem ranse method instead predict variations deceleration of the flow not greater than 6 these differences can be due to the different way the effective wake fraction is computed using the coupled bem ranse method the estimation of the wake fraction is carried out directly by averaging over the propeller disk the effective wake calculated by the coupling algorithm fully ranse analyses instead make use of the open water propeller diagram and of the information from the self propulsion calculations propeller delivered thrust and rate of revolution to assess the wake fraction needed to meet the thrust identity between the thrust coefficient delivered in open water conditions and that delivered behind the hull a certain difference between these two ways of calculating the wake fraction and in particular the tendency of body force based approaches to underestimate the flow deceleration has been already observed in similar self propulsion calculations in this case however the port starboard non symmetrical tangential components of the flow to the propeller caused by the pre swirl fins may have a significant influence on these differences tangential flow contributes to the increase of the blade delivered thrust by changing the local angle of attack without any change in the axial flow that instead is the only parameter responsible for the thrust identity when the usual definition of wake fraction based on equivalent open water propeller performance is adopted this turns into an overestimation of the wake fraction flow deceleration when its calculation is based on the thrust identity assumption since the effect of the tangential flow in increasing the propeller delivered thrust is not considered and it is balanced by a false deceleration of the axial wake on the contrary the wake fraction computed by averaging the effective wake accounts only for the current local axial velocity and not also of the influence on the thrust of the tangential flow resulting in a significantly faster average inflow an increase of flow deceleration 1 w of the order of 15 20 like that seen in these calculations using fully ranse analyses is however comparable to those measured exactly with the same thrust identity approximation at the towing tank koushan et al 2020 or computed using ranse nielsen and jin 2019 dang et al 2012 kim et al 2015 the calculation of the propeller efficiency which is strictly correlated to the wake fraction suffers from these differences since the operative point of the propeller significantly moves towards high loading the propeller efficiency predicted using fully resolved ranse analyses reduces calculations predict a 6 8 lower propeller efficiency when using the swirling fins which is largely compensated by an increase of the hull efficiency the trend observed using the bem ranse method is opposite the propeller efficiency computed using bem and the averaged effective wake remains almost unchanged if computed using the thrust identity assumption and the open water propeller performance computed by bem in fig 2 the trend is confirmed also using the bem ranse method 4 4 off design operation while the design is normally carried out for the reference operative point at least the need of verifying the functioning of the esd in off design conditions different ship speed or draft when an optimization under uncertainties is not carried out is mandatory optimization intended as a design approach indeed works exactly to emphasize the peculiarities of a device in a specific operational regime exploiting for instance very local features of the flow once these conditions are not met the risk of abrupt degradations of the performance is real to this aim self propulsion points of the bare hull and the ship equipped with the three designed esds using the fully resolved ranse method have been computed at two additional ship speeds 11 6 and 17 4 kn froude number of 0 114 and 0 171 corresponding to 20 of the design value reference values with respect to which the relative improvements of figs 19 and 20 are calculated are 7 43 mw at 1 088 rps lower speed 15 61 mw at 1 389 rps design speed and 27 07 mw at 1 669 rps higher speed the tendencies discussed for the design speed are generally met also in off design looking at the self propulsion coefficients of fig 22 or at the propeller performance of figs 20 and 21 it is possible to appreciate the influence of the esd at any functioning condition they are responsible for a loading of the propeller as well as of a significant increase of the wake fraction compared to the reference hull case the performance of pss2 moreover are always in between those of pss1 and pss2 1 while the thrust deduction factor similarly to what observed at the design point is less influenced by the presence of the fins in terms of power savings the solution with three fins turns to be the most effective in the entire operation range since it provides a 2 5 additional saving compared to the solutions with one or two fins which instead guarantee very similar performance improvements it is worth to note anyhow that despite the fins work efficiently also in off design conditions it is at the design point that they offer the highest performance in light of the previous discussion this result in a certain measure proves the effectiveness of the optimization process 5 conclusions in the present work the design of an energy saving device based on the pre swirl stator concepts is illustrated using an optimization process a myriad of different configurations is analysed and automatically modified based on the feedback of previous calculations to comply with the design objectives and constraints which in this case are only of geometrical type for the estimation of the quantities of interest namely the delivered power which is considered as the most comprehensive merit parameter for the design a dedicated coupled bem ranse method has been developed to comply with the need of accurate predictions in a computationally efficient way the use of the bem ranse method coupled with a fully parametric fully automatic representation of the pre swirl stator fins allowed exploring widely and accurately the design space more widely than any proposed approach at least for now depending on the number of free parameters the three proposed designs analysed from 900 to 1700 geometries combined with the possibility of full customization of the fins shape depending on the local flow features this exploration of the design space allowed identifying geometries capable of remarkable improvements one and two fins configurations were capable of significant savings in the order of 6 which reach an outstanding 8 when the three fins configuration was considered fully ranse analyses confirmed the results of the optimizations for what regards the relative improvements in terms of delivered power and propeller rate of revolution compared to the reference case the high fidelity solver calculated for pss1 and pss2 test cases a saving of 5 which reaches a 7 9 reduction of the delivered power in the case of the optimal pre swirl geometry of case pss2 1 these analyses anyhow pointed out some differences especially from the propeller point of view which are ascribable to the already observed limitations of the bem when used in a very non uniform hull wakes in any case the overall trends associated with the influence of the pre swirl stator fins were confirmed the presence of the swirling fins determines higher loadings of the propeller since the functioning point moves toward lower advance coefficients due to the decelerated wake caused by the fins this results in a degradation of the propeller efficiency largely compensated by higher hull efficiency and the substantial reduction of the propeller rate of revolution which positively contributes to the reduction of the delivered power the thrust deduction factor is only slightly influenced by the presence of the fins even if the tendencies observed for the coupled method and the fully resolved propeller are discordant it can be stated that the optimization process worked to realize neutral fins avoiding any separation of the flow and the resulting additional resistance the different interactions between the flow by the actuator disk and the flow by the fully resolved propeller the pre swirl fins and the pressure distribution on the aft portion of the hull may explain these almost negligible differences the comparative analysis of the optimal designs demonstrated that each fin contributed unevenly to the total saving for this specific hull and propeller the presence of a second fin portside seems irrelevant regardless its angular positioning while the positioning of two fins port and starboard in their closest possible position to sternpost proved to be the most effective way of improving the overall propulsive efficiency of the ship compared to the results of similar analyses available in the literature these results show the importance of custom designs based on very detailed local flow quantities possible only using accurate computational tools employed in an integrated framework like that provided by optimization these conclusions are sustained indirectly by the results obtained in off design condition even if the designed systems still provide a substantial energy saving both at higher and lower velocities it is at the design speed that the improvements with respect to the reference case are better confirming the specificity of the design for a given functioning condition credit authorship contribution statement francesco

wedge during water entry coupling algorithms based on boundary element method bem wagner theory and modal superposition method msm are utilized the first solution is a numerical method by coupling bem and msm based on domain decomposition technique the second solution is a semi analytical method by coupling wagner theory and msm non linear pressure composition in the bernoulli equation is used to improve the accuracy for wedge with moderate deadrise angles the implicitly newmark β scheme is employed for time marching of structural dynamic equation effects of hydroelasticity on fluid pressure and structural response are studied by the comparison between coupling and decoupling solutions the results show that the structural response is significantly affected by the presence of fluid added mass and damping structural response is lagged due to the fluid added mass and damping besides the latter one causes the decrease of amplitudes of slamming load and structural response this paper highlights the effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load and structural response during water entry of flexible structure keywords hydroelastic slamming fluid structure interaction boundary element method modal superposition method semi analytical solution 1 introduction hydroelastic slamming is a typical fsi problem in marine engineering impulsive hydrodynamic load during water entry can cause severely damage into marine structures therefore accurate prediction of structural response subjected to the transient slamming load is of great significance in design stage slamming mechanism has been widely studied by analytical or semi analytical solutions dobrovol skaya 1969 faltinsen et al 1997 korobkin 2004 korobkin et al 2006 von karman 1929 wagner 1932 numerical simulation greenhow 1987 liu et al 2012 oger et al 2006 sun et al 2015 wang et al 2015 a zhang et al 2017 zhao and faltinsen 1993 and experiments hassoon et al 2017a 2017b huera huarte et al 2011 panciroli 2013 panciroli et al 2012 panciroli and porfiri 2015 2014 stenius et al 2013 t sun et al 2019 in the past few decades semi analytical solution was mostly based on the flat disc approximation by wagner 1932 the slamming load was expressed as a function of elastic response and incorporated in the solid governing equation two approximations were widely adopted for the hydroelasticity based on msm the first method was asymptotic expansions of normal shapes in the linear pressure faltinsen et al 1997 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 the second approximation was simpler by directly modifying the analytical velocity potential formulas in wagner theory e g using averaged datta and siddiqui 2016 faltinsen 1999 stenius et al 2011 or instantaneous elastic velocity yu et al 2019 besides msm finite element method fem which has advantage of handling complex boundary conditions was also used to couple wagner theory by korobkin et al 2006 furthermore free fall of a flexible wedge impacting free surface was studied by shams and porfiri 2015 where acceleration of whole section is coupled with slamming load and structural response the semi analytical solutions focus on structural response however details of fluid motion i e jet flow and non linear free surface condition were neglected therefore numerical coupling methods which reveal more details of fluid motion are expected pure numerical coupling algorithms based on domain decomposition technique were widely utilized to study hydroelastic slamming the fluid and solid were respectively modeled by different algorithms and their coupling process was based on the transmission of pressure and velocity at fluid solid interface hence combination strategy of fluid and solid solvers was flexible the fluid was mostly governed by navier stokes ns equation vintage coupling strategies denoted by fluid solver solid solver included smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph fem fourey et al 2017 li et al 2015 liu and zhang 2019 moving particle semi implicit method mps msm z sun et al 2019b 2019a lattice boltzmann method lbm fem de rosis et al 2014 finite volume method fvm fem izadi et al 2018 fvm msm piro and maki 2013 and finite difference method fdm fem liao et al 2013 etc however the viscosity and compressibility are not dominate factor in the engineering background of water entry korobkin 1997 muzaferija et al 1998 besides the typical ns solvers also face the challenge of cpu cost hence numerical methods based on potential theory are ideal substitutions of ns solvers bem based on potential theory has a wide application in modeling water entry of rigid body bao et al 2016 battistin and iafrati 2003 greenhow 1987 kihara 2004 lu and y he 1997 sun 2007 wang et al 2019 2015 zhao and faltinsen 1993 greenhow 1987 successfully simulated a process of water entry of wedges with deadrise angle larger than 60 deg however it was limited by the treatment of the jet flow when the deadrise angle was smaller later zhao and faltinsen 1993 proposed a jet cutting technique and successfully solved problems of water entry of wedges with deadrise angles from 4 deg to 81 deg the jet was cut by a vertical element when the thickness of jet was smaller than a threshold value another cutting technique was proposed by kihara 2004 the jet was cut by a slant line and intersection angle between free surface and body was restricted more complex physical issues were also studied with bem flow detachment was considered by zhao et al 1997 where a local analytical solution was utilized to approximate the velocity potential near separation point a pure numerical method to simulate flow separation of wedge was proposed by wang and faltinsen 2010 where an artificial body was introduced to detect element which is completely out of real body sun 2007 investigated flow detachment of a rigid cylinder and the detachment point was detected when its pressure was negative bao et al 2016 simulated jet motions in separation stage the jet flow was controlled by momentum equation assuming that pressure gradient within jet was zero wu 2006 investigated water entry of twin wedges and found that the interaction of double bodies had significant effect on the slamming load wang et al 2015 proposed a two phase bem for modeling fluid and air simultaneously under gravity effect and found that the air after pinch off of the free surface showed significant influence on the water entry however few published papers focused on the structural response of elastic body during water entry by using bem two typical attempts were conducted by lu et al 2000 and sun 2007 respectively lu et al 2000 proposed a bem fem algorithm to study the deformation of wedge during impact stage fluid added damping matrix was derived when considering coupling equation of bem and fem sun 2007 used bem msm to calculate the strain of cylindrical shell the elastic velocity was accounted to consider hydroelastic effect however the profile of cylinder was assumed to be unchanged both lu et al 2000 and sun 2007 focused on the structural response of elastic body while the slamming load associated with hydroelasticity was not discussed in order to further study slamming load and structural response of the wedge with constant vertical impact velocity two algorithms based on potential theory are proposed sec 2 introduces theories of bem msm and the weak coupling process a numerical solution by coupling bem and msm is utilized for the simulation of water entry from impact stage to separation stage then sec 3 presents semi analytical solutions by coupling wagner theory and msm the fluid added mass and damping expression are deduced and added in dynamic equation for solid the non linear pressure term is utilized to improve accuracy of presented algorithm after that sec 4 presents validations of proposed coupling solutions effects of hydroelasticity on slamming load and structural response are discussed and the obtained numerical results are compared with those by a decoupling solution finally conclusions are summarized in sec 5 2 numerical coupling method in this section a weak coupling strategy based on bem and msm is presented the fluid pressure and the structural response are solved by bem and msm respectively the solid and the fluid solvers are coupled by the transmission of velocity and pressure at fluid solid interface the weak coupling strategy implies that the solid and fluid solvers compute alternately in time domain without iterations in each time step in order to improve its stability the added mass matrix is added on both sides of dynamic equations which is derived from the semi analytical solution in sec 3 2 1 model description a two dimensional model of elastic wedge impacting free surface is shown in fig 1 the fluid is truncated by a rectangular box with size 2l x l y the wedge has a deadrise angle β and a constant velocity v pointing to downwards the wedge is simplified as two beams with length l from keel to chine and thickness h the keel touches the initial free surface at t 0 the beams are both sides clamped cc or simply support ss to avoid boundary interference ratios of sizes of box and structure are set as l x l l y l 40 double coordinate systems global coordinate system xy and local coordinate system ηζ are used for modeling fluid and structure the fluid domain ω is enclosed by fluid boundary г which is composed by fluid solid interface гs free surface гf truncated boundary гwv and гwh and symmetric boundary гy 2 2 fluid solver bem 2 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions the fluid is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and flow is irrotational the velocity potential φ is introduced to describe the fluid velocity by φ where x y denotes gradient operator the velocity potential φ satisfies 2d laplace equation expressed as 1 2 φ 0 in ω non penetration boundary condition is satisfied on гy гwv гwh and гs given by 2 φ n 0 on γ y γ wv and γ wh 3 φ n n v s on γ s where φ n φ n is normal velocity n n x n y is unit normal vector pointing outside of ω v s is structure velocity where elastic effect is considered the pressure on the free surface is assumed to be constant and equal to atmosphere pressure hence kinetic and dynamic conditions on the free surface can be expressed as 4 d φ d t 1 2 φ 2 on γ f 5 d r d t φ on γ f where r x y is position vector and d d t denotes substantial derivative following a fluid particle defined as d d t t φ the velocity potential on гf can be solved by integration of eq 4 with initial condition φ r t 0 the profile of the free surface can be solved by integration of eq 5 with initial condition r x 0 governing eq 1 and boundary conditions eqs 2 5 form a boundary value problem bvp to solve this problem the green s third identity is first utilized to transfer eq 1 into a boundary integral equation as 6 2 π φ r p γ φ r q n q ln r p r q φ n r q ln r p r q d γ q where p and q denote field point and source point respectively then the linear bem where boundary element processes linear distributions of φ and φ n is used to form a numerical matrix equation written as 7 h int 1 h int 2 h γ fe h ot φ int 1 φ

are coefficient matrices and the expressions can be found in lu et al 2000 φ φ n 1 and φ n 2 are vectors of velocity potentials left and right normal velocities respectively the subscript int1 indicate intersection point between гf and гs int2 denote intersection point between гf and гwv гfe represents free surface node eliminating int1 and int2 and ot stands for other nodes the matrix can be rearranged by moving the known variables to the right side based on boundary conditions in eqs 2 5 and φ n γ fe 1 φ n γ fe 2 φ n γ fe lu et al 2000 bao et al 2016 wu et al 2017 as 8 g int 1 1 g int

handing in impact stage during impact stage a thin and long jet flow is formed between structure and free surface the thin jet has little contribution to slamming load however serious mesh distortion may be caused when keeping it therefore a reasonable jet cutting technology is necessary in this paper a slant cutting technology kihara 2004 is used as shown in fig 2 a after updating positions of free surface and structure in each time step the intersection angle between the undeformed structure line and the free surface is calculated when the intersection angle is larger than 10 deg a slant cutting line is introduced to cut the free surface the intersection angle between the unreformed structure and the free surface is ensured to be 10 deg at the beginning of impact stage the jet flow is found to enter the structure section occasionally which also leads to grid distortion in this circumstance the free surface is directly cut by the structure and the intersection point becomes new start point of the free surface as presented in fig 2 b 2 2 3 modeling of free surface in separation stage when the jet reaches chine of the wedge the impact stage is terminated and the separation stage starts the jet leaves the section tangentially in separation stage complied with kutta condition time of flow detachment should be detected to switch the modeling solver as shown in fig 3 a an extended structural section is introduced during impact stage when the free surface contracts the extended section the flow detachment is supposed to begin the free surface and portion of the extended section become the new free surface as shown in fig 3 b the shape corner needs to be smoothed to improve the mesh quality the boundary conditions of each node are the same as that in impact stage except for intersection point between wedge and free surface during impact stage the normal velocity of intersection point φ n 1 is unknown however in the separation stage the normal velocity of intersection point i e chine is considered as continuous hence φ n 1 are known variables by setting φ n 1 φ n 2 as shown in fig 3 c the velocity potential φ at chine is treated as unknown to ensure the same numbers of equations and the unknowns after that motion of free surface is governed similar to that in impact stage the artificial extended section is no longer used different from previous treatment sun 2007 wang and faltinsen 2010 as shown in fig 4 at time t the starting point r f1 of free surface гf1 denoted by solid red line and structure end point r c1 are coincided at chine in next time t fluid node r f1 moves to r f2 with the free surface гf2 denoted by solid blue line and structure node r c1 migrates to r c2 a gap expressed by dashed green line is formed between r f2 and r c2 the velocity potential within the gap is missing and needs to be reconstructed before remeshing of the free surface the velocity potential at r c2 should be estimated to avoid using extrapolation based on the nodes within гf2 this is done by setting pressure of chine as zero in the bernoulli equation given by 9 p r c ρ f d φ r c d t v s r c t φ r c t 1 2 φ r c t 2 0 where d d t t v s denotes substantial derivative following a solid node and r c is coordinate of chine at time t based on eq 9 the velocity potential of r c2 in next time t can be numerically predicted with euler scheme expressed as 10 φ r c 2 t φ r c 1 t v s r c 1 t φ r c 1 t 1 2 φ r c 1 t 2 t t before using bem to solve the bvp the free surface should be remeshed to remove saw tooth and create grids of fine quality assuming that the free surface is constructed by nodes x f 1 y f 1 s f 1 φ f 1 x f 2 y f 2 s f 2 φ f 2 where x f y f and φ f are x coordinate y coordinate and velocity of free surface nodes respectively and s f is cumulative chord length from the first free surface node sun 2007 wang and faltinsen 2010 the included angle between two adjacent elements is used to detect node as saw tooth the critical principle is that the included angle should not be smaller than 170 deg next the saw tooth is deleted and don t participate in interpolating new grids after that a new cumulative chord length s f is established as interpolation parameter of the original free surface the position and velocity potential of new mesh will be obtained based on interpolation between s f and s f with respect to x f y f and φ f the saw tooth will also be examined on the revised grids the above process may be repeated several times until no saw tooth exists in the final mesh 2 2 4 pressure estimation pressure distribution p f is obtained by 11 p f ρ f φ t 1 2 φ 2 where φ t φ t ρ f is the density of the fluid and the atmosphere pressure is set to be zero the term φ t is still unknown after solving eq 6 finite difference method may be used to approximate φ t by φ in different steps but such technique is less accurate due to jet cutting and mesh adjustment in order to improve the pressure estimation φ t is solved implicitly in each time step the idea is similar to the work of wang and faltinsen 2013 however their research is limited to rigid wedge it can be easily proved that φ t also satisfies 2d laplace equation i e 12 2 φ t 0 in ω the free surface condition of φ t can be obtained by setting p f 0 in eq 11 wang and faltinsen 2013 expressed as 13 φ t 1 2 φ 2 on γ f the neumann boundary condition of φ t on гs can be obtained by koo and kim 2004 wang and faltinsen 2013 a m zhang et al 2017 14 φ t n d d t v n s v τ s τ v n s v n s 2 φ τ 2 on γ s where the term d d t v n s v τ s and v n s are solved by msm in solid solver and τ v n s and 2 φ τ 2 can be obtained by a finite difference method boundary conditions on гy гwv and гwh are written as 15 φ t n 0 on γ y γ wv and γ wh eqs 12 15 form a bvp for φ t the solution procedure of the bvp is similar with that of φ the matrix g 1 g 2 and h for solving φ can be directly adopted for solving φ t to save computational effort the impact force in vertical direction on the wedge can be obtained by integrating pressure on the wetted surface given by 16 f impact 2 γ s p f n y d γ 2 3 solid solver msm the structure is simplified as a homogeneous euler bernoulli beam and its model is established in the local coordinate system ηζ in fig 5 at time t the external pressure acting on the beam is p η t p f r s t where r s denotes fluid solid interface in coordinate system xy the deformation of the structure is denoted as w η t with w η 0 0 and w t η 0 0 where w t w t two boundary conditions are studied in this paper as cc i e w 0 t w l t 0 and w η 0 t w η l t 0 and ss i e w 0 t w l t 0 and w ηη 0 t w ηη l t 0 where w η w η and w ηη 2 w η 2 based on euler bernoulli beam theory the governing equation of w η t is given by 17 e s h 3 12 4 w η 4 ρ s h 2 w t 2 p η t where e s is the structural elasticity modulus and ρ s is the density of structure by adopting msm the deformation w is approximated as superposition of model functions from 1 to n mod given by 18 w η t i 1 n mod w i η χ i t where χ i is called normal coordinate w i is eigenfunction of i mode which can be found by solving an eigenvalue problem in eq 17 setting right hand as zero adopting modal transformation and the orthogonality of the eigenfunction w i with respect to the mass i e ρ s h 0 l w i w j d η δ i j eq 17 is converted as 19 χ i ω i 2 χ i 0 l p η t w i d η where χ i d2 χ i dt 2 is the acceleration of normal coordinates and ω i is natural frequency finally v τ s v n s and d d t v n s in eq 14 are given as 20 v τ s v sin β v cos β w t 1 w η 1 w η 2 v sin β v w η cos β w η w t 1 w η 2 21 v n s v sin β v cos β w t w η 1 1 w η 2 v w η sin β v cos β w t 1 w η 2 22 d d t v n s v sin β w η t w t t 1 w η 2 v sin β w η v cos β w t w η w η t 1 w η 2 1 5 where w ηt 2 w η t and w tt 2 w t 2 based on eq 18 the derivatives of w with respect to t and η can be solved in analytical manner and finite difference method is avoided 2 4 weak coupling process next the weak coupling strategy between bem and msm based on domain decomposition technique is introduced as shown in fig 6 the msm and the bem are used as solid and fluid solvers respectively the weak coupling has advantages of avoiding iterations in each time step and cpu efforts are abundantly saved as a result these two solvers share a same time step and compute interactively in time domain t n where n 1 2 3 is the iteration index because the estimation of pressure has fully considered the elastic deformation and velocity on the fluid solid interface the proposed weak coupling algorithm is competent in considering hydroelasticity during water entry however divergent results were easily caused by using this original coupling process a similar phenomenon was observed by sun 2007 the results were found to be diverged when the solid mass was much smaller than the fluid added mass sun explained that the unexpected phenomenon was caused by the accumulated numerical errors in order to increase the iteration stability the analytical added mass was added on both sides of the solid equation the idea is borrowed here to increase the iteration stability as we are dealing with the vibration equation of the structure the fluid inertial force related to the normal coordinates is added on both sides of eq 19 given by 23 e m add χ k χ f n m add χ 24 f i n 0 l p η t w i d η where eq 23 are written in matrix form based on eq 19 χ and χ are vectors of normal coordinates and accelerations respectively f n is vector of normal forces k is dialog

wagner theory wagner 1932 and msm is presented in this section which also provides formulas of calculating m add in sec 2 the velocity potential is analytically expressed based on the wagner theory wagner 1932 and the hydroelastic effect is accounted by asymptotic expression faltinsen et al 1997 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 added fluid mass and damping matrixes are derived and incorporated in the structural dynamic equation non linear term in the bernoulli equation is treated as an external force the wetted area is solved by wagner condition korobkin 1996 the separation stage is not included in the proposed semi analytical solution as shown in fig 8 the tip of wedge penetrates the initial free surface with depth vt at time t the free surface and the deformed structure intersect at point p wet the x coordinate of p wet in global coordinate is defined as half horizontal wetted length c t the velocity potential φ and msm are used for solutions of fluid and solid respectively linear boundary conditions on both fluid solid interface and free surface are utilized as 28 φ 0 on γ f 29 φ n v w t v j 1 n mod w j χ j on γ s to obtain fluid added mass and damping matrix corresponding to normal coordinates the auxiliary functions φ i complying with following boundary conditions are introduced by 30 2 φ j 0 in ω 31 φ j 0 on γ f 32 φ n j w j on γ s where φ n j φ j n hence velocity potential on the wetted body can be expressed as 33 φ φ 0 j 1 n mod φ j χ j where φ 0 v c 2 x 2 based on wagner theory wagner 1932 is utilized inserting eq 33 into eq 11 the pressure distribution can be written as 34 p ρ f φ t 0 ρ f j 1 n mod φ t j χ j ρ f j 1 n mod φ j χ j 1 2 ρ f φ 2 where φ t 0 φ 0 t v c c c 2 x 2 and φ t j φ j t inserting eq 34 into eq 19 results in 35 χ i ω i

supported at both ends khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 for more complex occasion a numerical technique is introduced to solve matrix m add t c add t and f a t in each time step φ and φ j are solved as bvps eq 28 32 the fluid solid interface γ s is updated by structural elastic deformation in each time step the free surface γ f is simplified as a horizontal straight line through p wet a truncated boundary is introduced to form an enclosed boundary the bvps can be solved by bem similar with those in sec 2 after solving φ and φ j a finite difference method is used to approximate φ t j and φ on the wetted body finally trapezoidal integration technique is utilized to obtain m add t c add t and f a t the horizontal wetted length c and its derivate c can be solved by using wagner condition korobkin 1996 i e 40 0 π 2 f b c t sin θ t d θ 0 where y f b x t describes curve of body section accounting the vertical motion and elastic deformation of the wedge here f b is described as parametric functions of η written as 41 x η η cos β w η t sin β y η η sin β w η t cos β v t take the derivate with respect to time at both ends of eq 40 we have 42 c 0 π 2 f b x sin θ d θ 0 π 2 f b t d θ 0 based on eq 41 f b x and f b t can be expressed as 43 f b x tan β w η 1 w η tan β 44 f b t w t cos β 1 1 w η tan β v inserting eqs 43 and 44 into eq 42 yields 45 c π 2 v 1 cos β 0 π 2 w t 1 w η tan β d θ 0 π 2 tan β w η 1 w η tan β sin θ d θ based on eq 45 c can be obtained explicitly by given structure dynamic in each time step as a result c can be solved as an initial value problem with initial condition c 0 0 when m add t is calculated as the input of eq 23 the half horizontal wetted length c t is obtained by the grids on гs in separation stage c is constant as the section is fully wetted the fluid added matrix m add t in separation stage is set as m add t sep where t sep denotes the time when flow detachment occurs 3 numerical test after the introductions of two coupling solutions in secs 2 3 the proposed algorithms are used for practical analysis of hydroelastic slamming in this section first convergence properties and validations of two solutions are presented next effectiveness of proposed numerical techniques are revealed including adoption of m add in numerical coupling solutions and non linear pressure term in semi analytical solution finally the effects of hydroelasticity on fluid and solid are discussed 3 1 general statement first we summarize the abbreviations of available approaches and wedge models as well as definitions of normalized parameter the solution designations of available approaches are introduced as below 1 nca the nca solution is standard n umerical c oupling solution described in sec 2 2 nc the nc solution is a revised version based on nca the difference is that the added fluid mass is not used in the solid dynamic equation comparison between nc and nca will prove the necessity of utilizing fluid added mass for iteration stability 3 ndc the ndc solution is a revised version based on nca the ndc solution is a decoupling solution where elastic deformation and velocity is ignored when solving fluid pressure the added fluid mass is also set to be zero in this approach the model can be regarded as rigid for solving slamming load comparison between ndc and nca is dedicated for revealing hydroelasticity 4 sac the sac solution is standard s emi a nalytical c oupling solution described in sec 3 5 sacl the sacl solution is a revised version of sac where the non linear pressure term is ignored comparison between sac and sacl will present the effect of non linear pressure on the structure response the elastic models adopted in this paper are summarized in table 1 the model w4 is a group of wedges consist deadrise angles from 10 deg to 30 deg and other physical parameters are unchanged r hs in table 1 is a normalized parameter quantitatively described the hydroelasticity of a wedge model stenius et al 2007 46 r hs 4 λ r π 2 tan β v 1 π ρ f l 3 e s h 3 12 where λ r 4 73 for cc and π for ss decreasing of r hs results in improvement of the hydroelastic effect hydroelasticity is suggested to be considered when r hs 5 stenius et al 2007 normalized deformation is defined as stenius et al 2007 47 w nd w 4 tan β 384 π 2 λ w l 4 ρ f v 2 e s h 3 12 where λ w 1 for cc and 5 for ss 3 2 convergence test of grid density and modal number convergence tests of nca and sac are presented first the convergence tests are conducted based on model w1 and the obtained results for the maximum deflection of the structure in impact stage are shown in fig 9 for the convergence analysis of n mesh the first 10 modals are adopted the mesh densities are set as 100 200 500 1000 2000 and 5000 respectively as shown in fig 9 a the maximum deformation gradually increases by the increase of the grids number and tends to converge when n mesh 1000 as for the convergence analysis of n mod mesh density is set as 1000 the modal numbers are selected from 1 to 20 as shown in fig 9 b the maximum deformation gradually increases by the increase of the modal numbers and stays steady when n mod 5 therefore n mesh and n mod are respectively chosen as 1000 and 5 in the following cases 3 3 validation of nca and sac in order to validate the proposed algorithm the midpoint deformation and monitoring pressure of w1 3 are reproduced by nca and sac cases w1 3 and the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 in sec 4 1 3 3 1 midpoint deformation comparisons of midpoint deformation based on models w1 3 are illustrated in fig 10 the separation stage is included in models w2 w3 and omitted in w1 result of w1 is compared with that obtained by mps mps khayyer et al 2018 and sph sph oger et al 2010 result of w2 is compared with that obtained by fvm fem piro and maki 2013 result of w3 is compared with that obtained by bem fem lu et al 2000 fvm wet modal maki et al 2011 and fdm fem liao et al 2013 it s found in fig 10 that the reproduced results have a good agreement with the cited data amplitude of deformation after flow detachment is attenuated as shown in fig 10 b c it indicates that the structural kinetic is affected by fluid damping force when considering fsi between fluid and solid 3 3 2 monitoring pressure pressure at monitoring point 0 25l and 0 75l of w1 are compared with that obtained by mps mps khayyer et al 2018 and sph sph oger et al 2010 as shown in fig 11 the obtained numerical results agreed well with the cited data the pressure at the test point firstly increased to the peak when they reach the free surface and then rapidly diminished after that the pressure at 0 25l increased slightly from 1 25 ms because the deformation reshapes the wedge section into a flare profile 3 4 contribution of m add to stability of nca as mentioned in sec 2 4 when the structure mass is smaller than the added fluid mass m add should be added on both sides of the dynamic equation to increase iteration stability in order to prove the effectiveness of proposed numerical technique the model w1 is calculated by both nca and nc solutions total vertical impact force f impact t and midpoint deformation w 0 5l t are presented in fig 12 the calculation by nc solution begins to diverge at 1 55 ms as shown in fig 12 a on the contrary the performance of nca solution is very stable divergence of pressure will affect the structure response in the following process as shown in fig 12 b the results of nc start to deviate with the nca solution significantly at 1 75 ms hence the proposed numerical technique can effectively avoid divergence caused by the accumulated errors 3 5 influence of non linear term in the semi analytical solution to study the influence of non linear term in the semi analytical solution on the structural response the model groups w4 is simulated with sac and sacl solutions the normalized midpoint deformation by nca sac and sacl are presented in fig 13 the nca solution offers reference data to test the accuracy of sac and sacl as shown in fig 13 a d the results for structural response solved by sacl are larger than those of sac because the pressure is overestimated when neglecting the non linear pressure term compared with nca solution in a wide range of deadrise angles the sac solution provides reasonable structural response the disparity between sac and sacl solutions is relatively small when the deadrise angle is 10 deg as shown in fig 13 a with an error of maximum deformation of about 13 the distinction becomes more significant with the increase of deadrise angle fig 13 b d the error of maximum deformation is over 41 at β 30 deg it indicates that the effect of non linear pressure term should be considered when deadrise angle is large a detail in fig 13 should be mentioned that the duration of impact stage modeled by nca is smaller than those by sac and sacl this phenomenon is caused by the jet flow formed in the fluid solver bem the jet reaches the chine earlier and the impact stage is terminated in advance the jet is thicker for a wedge with larger deadrise angles as shown in fig 14 however jet flow doesn t exist in the semi analytical solution based on wagner theory consequently the duration of impact stage of numerical solution nca is shorter than those of semi analytical solution sac and sacl especially in occasion of wedge with large deadrise angles 3 6 hydroelastic effect finally effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load and structural response are investigated the results of nca and ndc solutions are compared to study the hydroelastic effect model w2 with r hs 2 84 is used in this section because the hydroelasticity is proved significant when the hydroelastic factor r hs is smaller than 5 stenius et al 2007 3 6 1 effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load is discussed first pressure distribution is illustrated in fig 15 and impact force is presented in fig 16 respectively the water entry process can be divided into impact and separation stages which is separated by the vertical black line in fig 15 for pressure estimation model w2 can be regarded as rigid wedge when it s solved by ndc distinctions of slamming load between ndc and nca solution can be summarized as below 1 in impact stage distribution of the slamming load of ndc is self similar within wetted area as a result the impact force displays linear relationship with time in fig 15 the pressure of nca solution is the same as that of ndc at the beginning next the deformation becomes significant and the wedge is reshaped into a flare profile the local deadrise angles are decreased near keel and increased near the chine as a consequence the pressure declines first and then increased the impact force of nca is changed accordingly as shown in fig 16 from 0 5 ms the impact force of nca is almost the same as that of ndc during 5 10 ms the impact force of nca is lower than that of ndc with the decrease of pressure after 10 ms growth rate of impact force of nca is larger than that of ndc the impact force of nca is larger than that of ndc at the end of impact stage 2 in separation stage the pressure evolutions of ndc and nca show great distinction as shown in fig 15 the pressure of ndc first decreases rapidly and then diminishes slowly and eventually stays steady however the pressure of nca solution displays a periodic oscillation this is caused by the solid boundary condition which is periodically changed due to the vibration of the structure as a result the vertical force is periodically changed and sometimes acts as a suction force as shown in fig 16 amplitude of pressure by nca solution decreases it indicates that fluid added damping effect should be considered in solving this fsi problem even though the fluid viscosity and solid damping are neglected in the governing equations 3 6 2 effect of hydroelasticity on structural response next effect of hydroelasticity on structural response is presented deformation in time and space domain is given in fig 17 the maximum deformation in each time step are recorded and presented in fig 18 distinctions of structure response between ndc and nca solutions can be summarized as below 1 the response frequency of nca is smaller than that of ndc the external force is established on the rigid body and structural frequency is determined by the dry modal the nca solution is a coupling solution and fully considers the elastic effect the fluid not only provides external force but also acts as added mass when considering the momentum transfer on the fluid solid interface hence the response of nca solution is lagged due to added mass effect and a time lag phenomenon is found between ndc and nca solutions as shown in fig 17 2 amplitude of deformation of nca solution significantly decreases in time domain which is not found in ndc solution as shown in fig 18 this phenomenon is similar with the tendency of pressure as shown in fig 15 b in the proposed semi analytical solution for solving structural response within impact stage the damping composition is explicitly revealed it further indicates that the damping force also exists during the separation stage 4 conclusion in this paper the structural response of flexible wedge during water entry with constant vertical velocity is studied two coupling algorithms based on potential theory are presented the first coupling solution is on the basis of bem and msm fully non linear free surface conditions are considered the second coupling solution is a semi analytical method by coupling wagner theory and msm non linear pressure composition is used to improve accuracy some conclusions based on current works are summarized as below 1 the proposed numerical technique for enhancing the stability of bem msm is effective and necessary the accumulated error in the iterations is successfully dispelled by using current technique 2 semi analytical solution with non linear pressure composition presents better estimation of structural response than that of linear pressure especially in case of large deadrise angles 3 hydroelasticity dramatically affects slamming load and structural response during impact stage the grow rate of impact force decreases first and subsequently increases owing to the change of section profile during separation stage the pressure periodically changes and the impact force may turn out to be negative as suction force fluid added mass and damping should be considered both in impact and separation stage under the effect of fluid added mass response period of solid is enlarged compared to the dry modal due to fluid damping effect amplitude of pressure and deformation decreases during separation stage even though fluid viscosity and solid damping are neglected author statement guiyong zhang conceptualization methodology writing reviewing and editing song feng programming

21048,prediction of structural response during water entry is of great significance for the design of naval architecture and aircraft in order to study fluid structural interaction fsi of flexible wedge during water entry coupling algorithms based on boundary element method bem wagner theory and modal superposition method msm are utilized the first solution is a numerical method by coupling bem

improve the accuracy for wedge with moderate deadrise angles the implicitly newmark β scheme is employed for time marching of structural dynamic equation effects of hydroelasticity on fluid pressure and structural response are studied by the comparison between coupling and decoupling solutions the results show that the structural response is significantly affected by the presence of fluid added mass and damping structural response is lagged due to the fluid added mass and damping besides the latter one causes the decrease of amplitudes of slamming load and structural response this paper highlights the effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load and structural response during water entry of flexible structure keywords hydroelastic slamming fluid structure interaction boundary element method modal superposition method semi analytical solution 1 introduction hydroelastic slamming is a typical fsi problem in marine engineering impulsive hydrodynamic load during water entry can cause severely damage into marine structures therefore accurate prediction of structural response subjected to the transient slamming load is of great significance in design stage slamming mechanism has been widely studied by analytical or semi analytical solutions dobrovol skaya 1969 faltinsen et al 1997 korobkin 2004 korobkin et al 2006 von karman 1929 wagner 1932 numerical simulation greenhow 1987

al 2012 panciroli and porfiri 2015 2014 stenius et al 2013 t sun et al 2019 in the past few decades semi analytical solution was mostly based on the flat disc approximation by wagner 1932 the slamming load was expressed as a function of elastic response and incorporated in the solid governing equation two approximations were widely adopted for the hydroelasticity based on msm the first method was asymptotic expansions of normal shapes in the linear pressure faltinsen et al 1997 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 the second approximation was simpler by directly modifying the analytical velocity potential formulas in wagner theory e g using averaged datta and siddiqui 2016 faltinsen 1999 stenius et al 2011 or instantaneous elastic velocity yu et al 2019 besides msm finite element method fem which has advantage of handling complex boundary conditions was also used to couple wagner theory by korobkin et al 2006 furthermore free fall of a flexible wedge impacting free surface was studied by shams and porfiri 2015 where acceleration of whole section is coupled with slamming load and structural response the semi analytical solutions focus on structural response however details of fluid motion i e jet flow and non linear free surface condition were neglected therefore numerical coupling methods which reveal more details of fluid motion are expected pure numerical coupling algorithms based on domain decomposition technique were widely utilized to study hydroelastic slamming the fluid and solid were respectively modeled by different algorithms and their coupling process was based on the transmission of pressure and velocity at fluid solid interface hence combination strategy of fluid and solid solvers was flexible the fluid was mostly governed by navier stokes ns equation vintage coupling strategies denoted by fluid solver solid solver included smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph fem fourey et al 2017 li et al 2015 liu and zhang 2019 moving particle semi implicit

fem liao et al 2013 etc however the viscosity and compressibility are not dominate factor in the engineering background of water entry korobkin 1997 muzaferija et al 1998 besides the typical ns solvers also face the challenge of cpu cost hence numerical methods based on potential theory are ideal substitutions of ns solvers bem based on potential theory has a wide application in modeling water entry of rigid body bao et al 2016 battistin and iafrati 2003 greenhow 1987 kihara 2004 lu and y he 1997 sun 2007 wang et al 2019 2015 zhao and faltinsen 1993 greenhow 1987 successfully simulated a process of water entry of wedges with deadrise angle larger than 60 deg however it was limited by the treatment of the jet flow when the deadrise angle was smaller later zhao and faltinsen 1993 proposed a jet cutting technique and successfully solved problems of water entry of wedges with deadrise angles from 4 deg to 81 deg the jet was cut by a vertical element when the thickness of jet was smaller than a threshold value another cutting technique was proposed by kihara 2004 the jet was cut by a slant line and intersection angle between free surface and body was restricted more complex physical issues were also studied with bem flow detachment was considered by zhao et al 1997 where a local analytical solution was utilized to approximate the velocity potential near separation point a pure numerical method to simulate flow separation of wedge was proposed by wang and faltinsen 2010 where an artificial body was introduced to detect element which is completely out of real body sun 2007 investigated flow detachment of a rigid cylinder and the detachment point was detected when its pressure was negative bao et al 2016 simulated jet motions in separation stage the jet flow was controlled by momentum equation assuming that pressure gradient within jet was zero wu 2006 investigated water entry of twin wedges and found that the interaction of double bodies had significant effect on the slamming load wang et al 2015 proposed a two phase bem for modeling fluid and air simultaneously under gravity effect and found that the air after pinch off of the free surface showed significant influence on the water entry however few published papers focused on the structural response of elastic body during water entry by using bem two typical attempts were conducted by lu et al 2000 and sun 2007 respectively lu et al 2000 proposed a bem fem algorithm to study the deformation of wedge during impact stage fluid added damping matrix was derived when considering coupling equation of bem and fem sun 2007 used bem msm to calculate the strain of cylindrical shell the elastic velocity was accounted to consider hydroelastic effect however the profile of cylinder was assumed to be unchanged both lu et al 2000 and sun 2007 focused on the structural response of elastic body while the slamming load associated with hydroelasticity was not discussed in order to further study slamming load and structural response of the wedge with constant vertical impact velocity two algorithms based on potential theory are proposed sec 2 introduces theories of bem msm and the weak coupling process a numerical solution by coupling bem and msm is utilized for the simulation of water entry from impact stage to separation stage then sec 3 presents semi analytical solutions by coupling wagner theory and msm the fluid added mass and damping expression are deduced and added in dynamic equation for solid the non linear pressure term is utilized to improve accuracy of presented algorithm after that sec 4 presents validations of proposed coupling solutions effects of hydroelasticity on slamming load and structural response are discussed and the obtained numerical results are compared with those by a decoupling solution finally conclusions are summarized in sec 5 2 numerical coupling method in this section a weak coupling strategy based on bem and msm is presented the fluid pressure and the structural response are solved by bem and msm respectively the solid and the fluid solvers are coupled by the transmission of velocity and pressure at fluid solid interface the weak coupling strategy implies that the solid and fluid solvers compute alternately in time domain without iterations in each time step in order to improve its stability the added mass matrix is added on both sides of dynamic equations which is derived from the semi analytical solution in sec 3 2 1 model description a two dimensional model of elastic wedge impacting free surface is

handing in impact stage during impact stage a thin and long jet flow is formed between structure and free surface the thin jet has little contribution to slamming load however serious mesh distortion may be caused when keeping it therefore a reasonable jet cutting technology is necessary in this paper a slant cutting technology kihara 2004 is used as shown in fig 2 a after updating positions of free surface and structure in each time step the intersection angle between the undeformed structure line and the free surface is calculated when the intersection angle is larger than 10 deg a slant cutting line is introduced to cut the free surface the intersection angle between the unreformed structure and the free surface is ensured to be 10 deg at the beginning of impact stage the jet flow is found to enter the structure section occasionally which also leads to grid distortion in this circumstance the free surface is directly cut by the structure and the intersection point becomes new start point of the free surface as presented in fig 2 b 2 2 3 modeling of free surface in separation stage when the jet reaches chine of the wedge the impact stage is terminated and the separation stage starts the jet leaves the section tangentially in separation stage complied with kutta condition time of flow detachment should be detected to switch the modeling solver as shown in fig 3 a an extended structural section is introduced during impact stage when the free surface contracts the extended section the flow detachment is supposed to begin the free surface and portion of the extended section become the new free surface as shown in fig 3 b the shape corner needs to be smoothed to improve the mesh quality the boundary conditions of each node are the same as that in impact stage except for intersection point between wedge and free surface during impact stage the normal velocity of intersection point φ n 1 is unknown however in the separation stage the normal velocity of intersection point i e chine is considered as continuous hence φ n 1 are known variables by setting φ n 1 φ n 2 as shown in fig 3 c the velocity potential φ at chine is treated as unknown to ensure the same numbers of equations and the unknowns after that motion of free surface is governed similar to that in impact stage the artificial extended section is no longer used different from previous treatment sun 2007 wang and faltinsen 2010 as shown in fig 4 at time t the starting point r f1 of free surface гf1 denoted by solid red line and structure end point r c1 are coincided at chine in next time t fluid node r f1 moves to r f2 with the free surface гf2 denoted by solid blue line and structure node r c1 migrates to r c2 a gap expressed by dashed green line is formed between r f2 and r c2 the velocity potential within the gap is missing and needs to be reconstructed before remeshing of the free surface the velocity potential at r c2 should be estimated to avoid using extrapolation based on the nodes within гf2 this is done by setting pressure of chine as zero in the bernoulli equation given by 9 p r c ρ f d φ r c d t v s r c t φ r c t 1 2 φ r c t 2 0 where d d t t v s denotes substantial derivative following a solid node and r c is coordinate of chine at time t based on eq 9 the velocity potential of r c2 in next time t can be numerically predicted with euler scheme expressed as 10 φ r c 2 t φ r c 1 t v s r c 1 t φ r c 1 t 1 2 φ r c 1 t 2 t t before using bem to solve the bvp the free surface should be remeshed to remove saw tooth and create grids of fine quality assuming that the free surface is constructed by nodes x f 1 y f 1 s f 1 φ f 1 x f 2 y f 2 s f 2 φ f 2 where x f y f and φ f are x coordinate y coordinate and velocity of free surface nodes respectively and s f is cumulative chord length from the first free surface node sun 2007 wang and faltinsen 2010 the included angle between two adjacent elements is used to detect node as saw tooth the critical principle is that the included angle should not be smaller than 170 deg next the saw tooth is deleted and don t participate in interpolating new grids after that a new cumulative chord length s f is established as interpolation parameter of the original free surface the position and velocity potential of new mesh will be obtained based on interpolation between s f and s f with respect to x f y f and φ f the saw tooth will also be examined on the revised grids the above process may be repeated several times until no saw tooth exists in the final mesh 2 2 4 pressure estimation pressure distribution p f is obtained by 11 p f ρ f φ t 1 2 φ 2 where φ t φ t ρ f is the density of the fluid and the atmosphere pressure is set to be zero the term φ t is still unknown after solving eq 6 finite difference method may be used to approximate φ t by φ in different steps but such technique is less accurate due to jet cutting and mesh adjustment in order to improve the pressure estimation φ t is solved implicitly in each time step the idea is similar to the work of wang and faltinsen 2013 however their research is limited to rigid wedge it can be easily proved that φ t also satisfies 2d laplace equation i e 12 2 φ t 0 in ω the free surface condition of φ t can be obtained by setting p f 0 in eq 11 wang and faltinsen 2013 expressed as 13 φ t 1 2 φ 2 on γ f the neumann boundary condition of φ t on гs can be obtained by koo and kim 2004 wang and faltinsen 2013 a m zhang et al 2017 14 φ t n d d t v n s v τ s τ v n s v n s 2 φ τ 2 on γ s where the term d d t v n s v τ s and v n s are solved by msm in solid solver and τ v n s and 2 φ τ 2 can be obtained by a finite difference method boundary conditions on гy гwv and гwh are written as 15 φ t n 0 on γ y γ wv and γ wh eqs 12 15 form a bvp for φ t the solution procedure of the bvp is similar with that of φ the matrix g 1 g 2 and h for solving φ can be directly adopted for solving φ t to save computational effort the impact force in vertical direction on the wedge can be obtained by integrating pressure on the wetted surface given by 16 f impact 2 γ s p f n y d γ 2 3 solid solver msm the structure is simplified as a homogeneous euler bernoulli beam and its model is established in the local coordinate system ηζ in fig 5 at time t the external pressure acting on the beam is p η t p f r s t where r s denotes fluid solid interface in coordinate system xy the deformation of the structure is denoted as w η t with w η 0 0 and w t η 0 0 where w t w t two boundary conditions are studied in this paper as cc i e w 0 t w l t 0 and w η 0 t w η l t 0 and ss i e w 0 t w l t 0 and w ηη 0 t w ηη l t 0 where w η w η and w ηη 2 w η 2 based on euler bernoulli beam theory the governing equation of w η t is given by 17 e s h 3 12 4 w η 4 ρ s h 2 w t 2 p η t where e s is the structural elasticity modulus and ρ s is the density of structure by adopting msm the deformation w is approximated as superposition of model functions from 1 to n mod given by 18 w η t i 1 n mod w i η χ i t where χ i is called normal coordinate w i is eigenfunction of i mode which can be found by solving an eigenvalue problem in eq 17 setting right hand as zero adopting modal transformation and the orthogonality of the eigenfunction w i with respect to the mass i e ρ s h 0 l w i w j d η δ i j eq 17 is converted as 19 χ i ω i 2 χ i 0 l p η t w i d η where χ i d2 χ i dt 2 is the acceleration of normal coordinates and ω i is natural frequency finally v τ s v n s and d d t v n s in eq 14 are given as 20 v τ s v sin β v cos β w t 1 w η 1 w η 2 v sin β v w η cos β w η w t 1 w η 2 21 v n s v sin β v cos β w t w η 1 1 w η 2 v w η sin β v cos β w t 1 w η 2 22 d d t v n s v sin β w η t w t t 1 w η 2 v sin β w η v cos β w t w η w η t 1 w η 2 1 5 where w ηt 2 w η t and w tt 2 w t 2 based on eq 18 the derivatives of w with respect to t and η can be solved in analytical manner and finite difference method is avoided 2 4 weak coupling process next the weak coupling strategy between bem and msm based on domain decomposition technique is introduced as shown in fig 6 the msm and the bem are used as solid and fluid solvers respectively the weak coupling has advantages of avoiding iterations in each time step and cpu efforts are abundantly saved as a result these two solvers share a same time step and compute interactively in time domain t n where n 1 2 3 is the iteration index because the estimation of pressure has fully considered the elastic deformation and velocity on the fluid solid interface the proposed weak coupling algorithm is competent in considering hydroelasticity during water entry however divergent results were easily caused by using this original coupling process a similar phenomenon was observed by sun 2007 the results were found to be diverged when the solid mass was much smaller than the fluid added mass sun explained that the unexpected phenomenon was caused by the accumulated numerical errors in order to increase the iteration stability the analytical added mass was added on both sides of the solid equation the idea is borrowed here to increase the iteration stability as we are dealing with the vibration equation of the structure the fluid inertial force related to the normal coordinates is added on both sides of eq 19 given by 23 e m add χ k χ f n m add χ 24 f i n 0 l p η t w i d η where eq 23 are written in matrix form based on eq 19 χ and χ are vectors of normal coordinates and accelerations respectively f n is vector of normal forces k is dialog matrix composed by ω i 2 m add t is analytical fluid added mass matrix formula for solving m add will be given by eq 37 in sec 3 χ on the right hand of eq 23 is supposed to be known and obtained in current time step χ on the left hand of eq 23 in the next time step is supposed to be unknown which can be obtained through time marching process the coupling process between bem and msm is briefly

maximum iteration cycles 2 5 semi analytical solution and calculation of fluid added mass madd after introducing the numerical coupling method a simplified semi analytical solution based on coupling wagner theory wagner 1932 and msm is presented in this section which also provides formulas of calculating m add in sec 2 the velocity potential is analytically expressed based on the wagner theory wagner 1932 and the hydroelastic effect is accounted by asymptotic expression faltinsen et al 1997 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 added fluid mass and damping matrixes are derived and incorporated in the structural dynamic equation non linear term in the bernoulli equation is treated as an external force the wetted area is solved by wagner condition korobkin 1996 the separation stage is not included in the proposed semi analytical solution as shown in fig 8 the tip of wedge penetrates the initial free surface with depth vt at time t the free surface and the deformed structure intersect at point p wet the x coordinate of p wet in global coordinate is defined as half horizontal wetted length c t the velocity potential φ and msm are used for solutions of fluid and solid respectively linear boundary conditions on both fluid solid interface and free surface are utilized as 28 φ 0 on γ f 29 φ n v w t v j 1 n mod w j χ j on γ s to obtain fluid added mass and damping matrix corresponding to normal coordinates the auxiliary functions φ i complying with following boundary conditions are introduced by 30 2 φ j 0 in ω 31 φ j 0 on γ f 32 φ n j w j on γ s where φ n j φ j n hence velocity potential on the wetted body can be expressed as 33 φ φ 0 j 1 n mod φ j χ j where φ 0 v c 2 x 2 based on wagner theory wagner 1932 is utilized inserting eq 33 into eq 11 the pressure distribution can be written as 34 p ρ f φ t 0 ρ f j 1 n mod φ t j χ j ρ f j 1 n mod φ j χ j 1 2 ρ f φ 2 where φ t 0 φ 0 t v c c c 2 x 2 and φ t j φ j t inserting eq 34 into eq 19 results in 35 χ i ω i 2 χ i 0 l ρ f j 1 n mod φ t j χ j w i d η 0 l ρ f j 1 n mod φ j χ j w i d η 0 l ρ f v c c c 2 x 2 w i d η 0 l 1 2 ρ f φ 2 w i d η eq 35 can be written in matrix form expressed as 36 e m add t χ c add t χ k χ f a t where m add t c add t and f a t are fluid added mass matrix fluid added damping matrix and external force respectively the elements of m add t c add t and f a t can be written as 37 m i j add 0 l ρ f φ j w i d η 38 c i j add 0 l ρ f φ t j w i d η 39 f i a 0 l ρ f v c c c 2 x 2 w i d η 0 l 1 2 ρ f φ 2 w i d η the matrix can be analytically obtained when the structure is simply supported at both ends khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 for more complex occasion a numerical technique is introduced to solve matrix m add t c add t and f a t in each time step φ and φ j are solved as bvps eq 28 32 the fluid solid interface γ s is updated by structural elastic deformation in each time step the free surface γ f is simplified as a horizontal straight line through p wet a truncated boundary is introduced to form an enclosed boundary the bvps can be solved by bem similar with those in sec 2 after solving φ and φ j a finite difference method is used to approximate φ t j and φ on the wetted body finally trapezoidal integration technique is utilized to obtain m add t c add t and f a t the horizontal wetted length c and its derivate c can be solved by using wagner condition korobkin 1996 i e 40 0 π 2 f b c t sin θ t d θ 0 where y f b x t describes curve of body section accounting the vertical motion and elastic deformation of the wedge here f b is described as parametric functions of η written as 41 x η η cos β w η t sin β y η η sin β w η t cos β v t take the derivate with respect to time at both ends of eq 40 we have 42 c 0 π 2 f b x sin θ d θ 0 π 2 f b t d θ 0 based on eq 41 f b x and f b t can be expressed as 43 f b x tan β w η 1 w η tan β 44 f b t w t cos β 1 1 w η tan β v inserting eqs 43 and 44 into eq 42 yields 45 c π 2 v 1 cos β 0 π 2 w t 1 w η tan β d θ 0 π 2 tan β w η 1 w η tan β sin θ d θ based on eq 45 c can be obtained explicitly by given structure dynamic in each time step as a result c can be solved as an initial value problem with initial condition c 0 0 when m add t is calculated as the input of eq 23 the half horizontal wetted length c t is obtained by the grids on гs in separation stage c is constant as the section is fully wetted the fluid added matrix m add t in separation stage is set as m add t sep where t sep denotes the time when flow detachment occurs 3 numerical test after the introductions of two coupling solutions in secs 2 3 the proposed algorithms are used for practical analysis of hydroelastic slamming in this section first convergence properties and validations of two solutions are presented next effectiveness of proposed numerical techniques are revealed including adoption of m add in numerical coupling solutions and non linear pressure term in semi analytical solution finally the effects of hydroelasticity on fluid and solid are discussed 3 1 general statement first we summarize the abbreviations of available approaches and wedge models as well as definitions of normalized parameter the solution designations of available approaches are introduced as below 1 nca the nca solution is standard n umerical c oupling solution described in sec 2 2 nc the nc solution is a revised version based on nca the difference is that the added fluid mass is not used in the solid dynamic equation comparison between nc and nca will prove the necessity of utilizing fluid added mass for iteration stability 3 ndc the ndc solution is a revised version based on nca the ndc solution is a decoupling solution where elastic deformation and velocity is ignored when solving fluid pressure the added fluid mass is also set to be zero in this approach the model can be regarded as rigid for solving slamming load comparison between ndc and nca is dedicated for revealing hydroelasticity 4 sac the sac solution is standard s emi a nalytical c oupling solution described in sec 3 5 sacl the sacl solution is a revised version of sac where the non linear pressure term is ignored comparison between sac and sacl will present the effect of non linear pressure on the structure response the elastic models adopted in this paper are summarized in table 1 the model w4 is a group of wedges consist deadrise angles from 10 deg to 30 deg and other physical parameters are unchanged r hs in table 1 is a normalized parameter quantitatively described the hydroelasticity of a wedge model stenius et al 2007 46 r hs 4 λ r π 2 tan β v 1 π ρ f l 3 e s h 3 12 where λ r 4 73 for cc and π for ss decreasing of r hs results in improvement of the hydroelastic effect hydroelasticity is suggested to be considered when r hs 5 stenius et al 2007 normalized deformation is defined as stenius et al 2007 47 w nd w 4 tan β 384 π 2 λ w l 4 ρ f v 2 e s h 3 12 where λ w 1 for cc and 5 for ss 3 2 convergence test of grid density and modal number convergence tests of nca and sac are presented first the convergence tests are conducted based on model w1 and the obtained results for the maximum deflection of the structure in impact stage are shown in fig 9 for the convergence analysis of n mesh the first 10 modals are adopted the mesh densities are set as 100 200 500 1000 2000 and 5000 respectively as shown in fig 9 a the maximum deformation gradually increases by the increase of the grids number and tends to converge when n mesh 1000 as for the convergence analysis of n mod mesh density is set as 1000 the modal numbers are selected from 1 to 20 as shown in fig 9 b the maximum deformation gradually increases by the increase of the modal numbers and stays steady when n mod 5 therefore n mesh and n mod are respectively chosen as 1000 and 5 in the following cases 3 3 validation of nca and sac in order to validate the proposed algorithm the midpoint deformation and monitoring pressure of w1 3 are reproduced by nca and sac cases w1 3 and the relevant parameters are listed in table 1 in sec 4 1 3 3 1 midpoint deformation comparisons of midpoint deformation based on models w1 3 are illustrated in fig 10 the separation stage is included in models w2 w3 and omitted in w1 result of w1 is compared with that obtained by mps mps khayyer et al 2018 and sph sph oger et al 2010 result of w2 is compared with that obtained by fvm fem piro and maki 2013 result of w3 is compared with that obtained by bem fem lu et al 2000 fvm wet modal maki et al 2011 and fdm fem liao et al 2013 it s found in fig 10 that the reproduced results have a good agreement with the cited data amplitude of deformation after flow detachment is attenuated as shown in fig 10 b c it indicates that the structural kinetic is affected by fluid damping force when considering fsi between fluid and solid 3 3 2 monitoring pressure pressure at monitoring point 0 25l and 0 75l of w1 are compared with that obtained by mps mps khayyer et al 2018 and sph sph oger et al 2010 as shown in fig 11 the obtained numerical results agreed well with the cited data the pressure at the test point firstly increased to the peak when they reach the free surface and then rapidly diminished after that the pressure at 0 25l increased slightly from 1 25 ms because the deformation reshapes the wedge section into a flare profile 3 4 contribution of m add to stability of nca as mentioned in sec 2 4 when the structure mass is smaller than the added fluid mass m add should be added on both sides of the dynamic equation to increase iteration stability in order to prove the effectiveness of proposed numerical technique the model w1 is calculated by both nca and nc solutions total vertical impact force f impact t and midpoint deformation w 0 5l t are presented in fig 12 the calculation by nc solution begins to diverge at 1 55 ms as shown in fig 12 a on the contrary the performance of nca solution is very stable divergence of pressure will affect the structure response in the following process as shown in fig 12 b the results of nc start to deviate with the nca solution significantly at 1 75 ms hence the proposed numerical technique can effectively avoid divergence caused by the accumulated errors 3 5 influence of non linear term in the semi analytical solution to study the influence of non linear term in the semi analytical solution on the structural response the model groups w4 is simulated with sac and sacl solutions the normalized midpoint deformation by nca sac and sacl are presented in fig 13 the nca solution offers reference data to test the accuracy of sac and sacl as shown in fig 13 a d the results for structural response solved by sacl are larger than those of sac because the pressure is overestimated when neglecting the non linear pressure term compared with nca solution in a wide range of deadrise angles the sac solution provides reasonable structural response the disparity between sac and sacl solutions is relatively small when the deadrise angle is 10 deg as shown in fig 13 a with an error of maximum deformation of about 13 the distinction becomes more significant with the increase of deadrise angle fig 13 b d the error of maximum deformation is over 41 at β 30 deg it indicates that the effect of non linear pressure term should be considered when deadrise angle is large a detail in fig 13 should be mentioned that the duration of impact stage modeled by nca is smaller than those by sac and sacl this phenomenon is caused by the jet flow formed in the fluid solver bem the jet reaches the chine earlier and the impact stage is terminated in advance the jet is thicker for a wedge with larger deadrise angles as shown in fig 14 however jet flow doesn t exist in the semi analytical solution based on wagner theory consequently the duration of impact stage of numerical solution nca is shorter than those of semi analytical solution sac and sacl especially in occasion of wedge with large deadrise angles 3 6 hydroelastic effect finally effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load and structural response are investigated the results of nca and ndc solutions are compared to study the hydroelastic effect model w2 with r hs 2 84 is used in this section because the hydroelasticity is proved significant when the hydroelastic factor r hs is smaller than 5 stenius et al 2007 3 6 1 effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load effect of hydroelasticity on slamming load is discussed first pressure distribution is illustrated in fig 15 and impact force is presented in fig 16 respectively the water entry process can be divided into impact and separation stages which is separated by the vertical black line in fig 15 for pressure estimation model w2 can be regarded as rigid wedge when it s solved by ndc distinctions of slamming load between ndc and nca solution can be summarized as below 1 in impact stage distribution of the slamming load of ndc is self similar within wetted area as a result the impact force displays linear relationship with time in fig 15 the pressure of nca solution is the same as that of ndc at the beginning next the deformation becomes significant and the wedge is reshaped into a flare profile the local deadrise angles are decreased near keel and increased near the chine as a consequence the pressure declines first and then increased the impact force of nca is changed accordingly as shown in fig 16 from 0 5 ms the impact force of nca is almost the same as that of ndc during 5 10 ms the impact force of nca is lower than that of ndc with the decrease of pressure after 10 ms growth rate of impact force of nca is larger than that of ndc the impact force of nca is larger than that of ndc at the end of impact stage 2 in separation stage the pressure evolutions of ndc and nca show great distinction as shown in fig 15 the pressure of ndc first decreases rapidly and then diminishes slowly and eventually stays steady however the pressure of nca solution displays a periodic oscillation this is caused by the solid boundary condition which is periodically changed due to the vibration of the structure as a result the vertical force is periodically changed and sometimes acts as a suction force as shown in fig 16 amplitude of pressure by nca solution decreases it indicates that fluid added damping effect should be considered in solving this fsi problem even though the fluid viscosity and solid damping are neglected in the governing equations 3 6 2 effect of hydroelasticity on structural response next effect of hydroelasticity on structural response is presented deformation in time and space domain is given in fig 17 the maximum deformation in each time step are recorded and presented in fig 18 distinctions of structure response between ndc and nca solutions can be summarized as below 1 the response frequency of nca is smaller than that of ndc the external force is established on the rigid body and structural frequency is determined by the dry modal the nca solution is a coupling solution and fully considers the elastic effect the fluid not only provides external force but also acts as added mass when considering the momentum transfer on the fluid solid interface hence the response of nca solution is lagged due to added mass effect and a time lag phenomenon is found between ndc and nca solutions as shown in fig 17 2 amplitude of deformation of nca solution significantly decreases in time domain which is not found in ndc solution as shown in fig 18 this phenomenon is similar with the tendency of pressure as shown in fig 15 b in the proposed semi analytical solution for solving structural response within impact stage the damping composition is explicitly revealed it further indicates that the damping force also exists during the separation stage 4 conclusion in this paper the structural response of flexible wedge during water entry with constant vertical velocity is studied two coupling algorithms based on potential theory are presented the first coupling solution is on the basis of bem and msm fully non linear free surface conditions are considered the second coupling solution is a semi analytical method by coupling wagner theory and msm non linear pressure composition is used to improve accuracy some conclusions based on current works are summarized as below 1 the proposed numerical technique for enhancing the stability of bem msm is effective and necessary the accumulated error in the iterations is successfully dispelled by using current technique 2 semi analytical solution with non linear pressure composition presents better estimation of structural response than that of linear pressure especially in case of large deadrise angles 3 hydroelasticity dramatically affects slamming load and structural response during impact stage the grow rate of impact force decreases first and subsequently increases owing to the change of section profile during separation stage the pressure periodically changes and the impact force may turn out to be negative as suction force fluid added mass and damping should be considered both in impact and separation stage under the effect of fluid added mass response period of solid is enlarged compared to the dry modal due to fluid damping effect amplitude of pressure and deformation decreases during separation stage even though fluid viscosity and solid damping are neglected author statement guiyong zhang conceptualization methodology writing reviewing and editing song feng programming

interactions and the highline cable system models are established for the two ships second a leader follower approach is used to maintain the expected longitudinal and transverse distances between the two ships third an extended state observer is designed according to the position heading propeller speed and rudder angle of the approach ship two time varying parameters in the observer are estimated in the controller design process therefore the linear speeds yaw rate and total system uncertainties can be observed fourth the propeller speed and rudder angle other than the surge force and steering moment are considered as the control inputs which are constructed by the command filter backstepping method the stability of the proposed control system is verified finally a simulation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords underway replenishment extended state observer trajectory tracking backstepping method command filter 1 introduction underway replenishment unrep has become a necessary process for global fleet operations during replenishment one of two ships will assume the role of guide ship and maintain a steady course and speed while an approach ship will move alongside the guide ship to transfer cargoes such as food fuel and fresh water the motion control of the approach ship is typically achieved manually with the aid of gps and radar and requires a helmsman with good steering skills kyrkjebø 2007 liu et al 2007 however external disturbances can hinder maintaining the expected longitudinal and transverse distances between the two ships by manual control skejic et al 2009 hence it is necessary to develop a synchronization motion control system that can significantly improve maneuvering precision increase supply efficiency and ensure the safety of both crews and cargoes in general a leader follower approach is used to realize the synchronized control of two ships engaged in underway replenishment liu et al 2018 gierusz et al 2016 the basic concept involves the guide ship following a predefined straight path at a specified speed while the approach ship tracks a virtual trajectory that is constructed by the motion states of the guider and predefined replenishment distances wang 1991 in recent decades numerous methods for the trajectory tracking control of underactuated ships have been studied considering the nonlinear characteristics of ship dynamics and the uncertainty of external disturbances backstepping based control strategies have been widely used in this field due to their excellent capability to control uncertain nonlinear systems zhao et al 2019a 2019b 2020 godhavn 1998 applied an adaptive backstepping technique to obtain a control law for trajectory tracking although the position tracking demand was satisfied the heading of the ship was controlled indirectly which caused a large heading error when it was required to turn to overcome this problem a high gain based local exponential stabilization algorithm was developed to control the heading of the ship directly pettersen et al 2001 based on the assumption that the yaw rate was not zero jiang 2002 proposed a global asymptotic tracking control law in which the desired trajectory is generated by a virtual ship for curvilinear path following tasks do et al 2002 removed this assumption by constructing a new desired trajectory and the desired surge speed and yaw rate were not required to be generated by the virtual ship it should be noted that the above three approaches were all based on accurate mathematical models which are usually unavailable in practice by using adaptive laws with projection a nonlinear adaptive control strategy was developed to control ships with unknown parameters do et al 2004 in relevant studies a neural network nn was combined with a backstepping method to address model uncertainties and time varying disturbances zhang et al 2014 however all the abovementioned control methods did not fully consider external disturbances during an unrep in addition to wind waves and currents hydrodynamic interactions and highline cable tension also exist all these disturbances should be considered in the controller to improve the tracking accuracy the aforementioned control methods suffer from three major problems the first is the explosion of terms which is caused by the redifferentiation of the virtual control inputs in the standard backstepping design process the second is that the control inputs of these control systems are the surge force and yaw moment which is puzzling for designers because for an underactuated ship the actual control inputs are the propeller speed and rudder angle the third problem is that all states of the ship are used as feedbacks for the controller but the sway speed and yaw rate are usually unmeasurable to address the second problem li et al 2009a 2009b considered the rudder angle as a control input but the propeller speed was not mentioned zhang et al 2017 considered both actual control inputs but it also need to measure the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate for the last problem extended state observers esos have been widely used to estimate unmeasured states and lumped uncertainties guo et al 2012 liu et al 2019 fu et al 2015 peng et al 2018 similar to the second drawback of the controllers introduced in the last section in addition to the ship s position and heading the abovementioned eso also requires information on surge forces and yaw moments which are difficult to obtain in practice inspired by this problem a simplified dynamics model is proposed the surge force is rewritten as a product of the propeller speed and an unknown time varying parameter the steering moment is constructed as the product of an unknown time varying parameter and the rudder angle a novel eso is designed by replacing the force and moment with the propeller speed and rudder angle respectively two direct adaptive laws are proposed in the controller design process to estimate these two parameters in this way we not only give full play to the advantages of the eso based backstepping design technique but also solve the problem where the control inputs cannot be used directly in engineering in this paper all the aforementioned disturbances are considered the command filtered backstepping approach wu et al 2018 is combined with a novel eso to design the motion controller of an approach ship by regarding the propeller speed and rudder angle as the control inputs the main contributions of this paper are as follows a the explosion of terms problem is avoided by the command filter b an eso is designed based on the position heading angle propeller speed and rudder angle to observe the surge speed sway speed yaw rate and total uncertainties which include the model uncertainties and external disturbances two time varying parameters in the proposed eso are estimated in the controller design process by two adaptive laws c the actual propeller speed and rudder angle are considered the control inputs for the approach ship which benefits implementation the rest of this paper is organized as follows mathematical models of the two ships and external disturbances are presented in the next section in section 3 the guidance law of the approach ship is derived the eso is designed in section 4 section 5 illustrates the controller design process and simulation results are shown in section 6 section 7 concludes this paper 2 mathematical models of the two ships during replenishment unrep is a process that can be divided into three phases as shown in fig 1 approaching parallel motion and departure the second phase is the key phase during which replenishment operations are conducted both ships must move with the same surge speed and heading angle considering the motions in surge sway and yaw the 3 dof kinematic model of ship can be expressed as 1 η i j ψ i υ i with j ψ i cos ψ i sin ψ i 0 sin ψ i cos ψ i 0 0 0 1 i a b where index i represents guide ship a and approach ship b η i x i y i ψ i t and υ i u i v i r i t are the position vector and velocity vector of ship i respectively the coordinate system for ships a and b is shown in fig 2 where f x i f y i and n i denote the forces and moments acting on ship i s 1 and s 2 are the transverse distance and longitudinal distance between them respectively the maneuvering modeling group mmg model is adopted as the dynamic model for both ships zhang et al 2013 2 m i λ 11 i u i m i λ 22 i v i r i x h i x p i d x i m i λ 22 i v i m i λ 11 i u i r i y h i d

expressed as follows 6 x w i ρ w g l i h w 2 c x w y w i ρ w g l i h w 2 c y w n w i ρ w g l i 2 h w 2 c n w 7 x c i 0 5 ρ w a f w v c 2 c x c y c i 0 5 ρ w a s w v c 2 c y c n c i 0 5 ρ w a s w l i v c 2 c n c where ρ w denotes the density of seawater g is the gravity acceleration h w represents the wave amplitude and v c is the current velocity a f w and a s w are the transverse and lateral projected areas below the waterline respectively fossen 1994 wang et al 2020 based on fluid mechanics theory the hydrodynamic interactions between the two ships in parallel motion are caused by an irregular pressure distribution around the hull according to the bernoulli principle these two ships will approach each other the suction forces and moments loaded on both ships are strongly dependent on their speed and relative position the suction forces and moments can be expressed as 8 y h i ρ w u i 2 l i t i c y h i 2 n h i ρ w u i 2 l i 2 t i c n h i 2 where c n h i and c y h i denote the parameters related to the ship dynamics and relative positions respectively t i is the draft of ship i zhu 2010 during unrep the cargo is transferred with the help of a highline cable system as shown in fig 3 the cable tension is usually fourfold the weight of the cargo li 2009 such a large force will influence the movement of the two ships and can directly harm the security of the unrep process the following assumption is considered fu et al 2017 assumption 1 the cable is uniformly elastic with the same tension along itself which can only bear the tension the self weight of the cable is evenly distributed along the straight segment shown in fig 4 and the axial deformation created by the tension is ignored a mechanical analysis of this system is presented in fig 4 where q and q denote the cargo weight and the uniform load determined by the self weight of cable respectively h is the height difference between replenishment gantries and the horizontal distance from the cargo to the supply ship is l 0 h i and v i denote the components of the cable tensions f i in the horizontal and vertical directions where i a b under assumption 1 the following equations are obtained t a t b 4 q

derived in this section it is assumed that guide ship a can precisely follow the predefined straight path at a constant surge speed according to fig 5 to achieve the coordinated motion control of the guide ship and approach ship a virtual trajectory with a relatively fixed distance from the trajectory of the guide one is obtained by the leader follower approach based on this virtual trajectory the desired heading angle for approach ship b can be deduced as shown in fig 5 the geometric relationship between the virtual trajectory and the trajectory of guide ship a can be expressed as 14 η v η a j ψ a l where l l v cos γ v l v sin γ v 0 t η v x v y v ψ v t denotes the virtual trajectory which should be tracked by the approach ship the relative distance between the two ships is set according to different kinds of ships cargoes and transporting equipment which means that the values of l v and γ v depend on the practical situation it is obvious that s 1 and s 2 shown in fig 2 should be kept within a small range of l v sin γ v and l v cos γ v when performing the replenishment task and the heading angles of the two ships should be kept consistent the following errors are defined 15 e s 1 s

assumption 2 is quite common and reasonable for underactuated ships zhang et al 2019 from eq 20 it is easy to determine that the unknown vector ζ consists of the external disturbances and the hydrodynamic damping effects first the external disturbances and their derivatives can be assumed to be limited peng et al 2018 second the hydrodynamic damping effects are speed related functions which are also determined by the propeller speed and rudder angle because these two control inputs are limited the speed of the ship cannot increase infinitely based on the calculation formula of the hydrodynamic damping effects it is natural to assume that their derivatives are bounded by speed related functions in summary assumption 2 is reasonable to analyze the stability of 25 a block diagonal

r is the bound of r b satisfying r b r p is a positive definite matrix that satisfies 27 based on the work of lindegaard 2003 and boyd et al 1994 it can be concluded that the existence of a positive definite matrix p can be guaranteed if and only if all the eigenvalues of a 0 have negative real part obviously matrix a 0 is hurwitz which means that all the real parts of its eigenvalues are negative consider the following lyapunov functional candidate 28 v e 1 2 e t p e when combined with 26 its time derivative is obtained 29 v e 1 2 e t p a 0 a 0 t p r b s t t p p s t e e t p b g

scale models of mariner and esso osaka are applied in a simulation to verify the feasibility and effect of the control strategy the esso osaka acts as guide ship a and mariner acts as approach ship b which is equipped with a single propeller and only one rudder their dimensions are displayed in table 1 it should be noted that further information on the propulsion and rudder parameters for the scale models of mariner and esso osaka are listed in chislett et al 1965 and dand et al 1983 guide ship a is arranged to follow a straight path with α k 45 the desired replenishment distance l v 2 m γ v 90 which means that the desired values of transverse and longitudinal distances are s 1 0 m and s 2 2 m the speed of guide ship a is u a 0 6 m s f u and f r belong to ω u 0 f u 0 002 and ω r 0 f r 0

into the simulation the simulation results are shown in the following figures the trajectories of guide ship a and approach ship b are shown in fig 7 where the approach ship is directly behind the guide ship with the same heading in the initial stage ψ b 0 ψ a 45 the headings of both ships are presented in fig 8 the estimates and actual values of the speeds yaw rates and total uncertainties are shown in figs 9 and 10 these unmeasurable states can be accurately observed by the proposed eso and the propeller controller can accelerate the approach ship to the desired surge speed even under time varying disturbances the tracking errors 34 are listed in fig 11 and indicate that the approach ship can precisely track the virtual trajectory by using the proposed controller hence the longitudinal and transverse distances shown in fig 12 can be maintained near expectations in fig 11 we can see that the control inputs with the estimated total uncertainties can significantly improve the tracking accuracy which can improve the safety of replenishment operations to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control strategy a comparative study with a controller proposed by zhang et al 2017 is shown in fig 12 since the disturbances estimated by the eso are compensated by the two control inputs the proposed control laws can achieve smaller distance errors than the controller designed by zhang et al especially after applying the interference of cable tension the difference is significant and the proposed control strategy reduces the number of system states that need to be measured which assists practical engineering the estimates of f u and f r are shown in fig 13 which indicate that the values of f ˆ u and f ˆ r are bounded and located within the intervals of f u and f r respectively the boundedness of f ˆ u and f ˆ r guarantees the stability of the proposed control strategy without knowing the values of f u and f r the propeller speed and rudder angle are shown in fig 14 from which we can conclude that the control inputs are not saturated 7 conclusions a leader follower motion control strategy based on a newly designed eso and command filtered adaptive backstepping technique is presented for an approach ship engaged in an underway replenishment operation when only the position and heading of the approach ship are available the propeller speed and rudder angle are regarded as the control inputs for the studied ship based on the proposed eso the unmeasured states as well as the total uncertainties can be accurately estimated simultaneously the estimated total uncertainty terms are used to attenuate the disturbances according to simulation results the proposed motion control strategy can ensure that the approach ship precisely tracks the desired trajectory in the meantime the longitudinal distance and transverse distance between the guide ship and approach ship can also be maintained near expectations which guarantees the safety of the unrep operation future works will focus on identifying the ships dynamic parameters credit authorship contribution statement yuxian huang conceptualization methodology software writing original

21049,to avoid collisions between guide ship and approach ship during the underway replenishment process it is important to maintain a certain distance between them based on trajectory tracking requirements a control strategy suitable for engineering applications is proposed for an approach ship without velocity measurements first considering the effects of wind waves currents hydrodynamic interactions and the highline cable system models are established for the two ships second a leader follower approach is used to maintain the expected longitudinal and transverse distances between the two ships third an extended state observer is designed according to the position heading propeller speed and rudder angle of the approach ship two time varying parameters in the observer are estimated in the controller design process therefore the linear speeds yaw rate and total system uncertainties can be observed fourth the propeller speed and rudder angle other than the surge force and steering moment are considered as the control inputs which are constructed by the command filter backstepping method the stability of the proposed control system is verified finally a simulation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords underway replenishment extended state observer trajectory tracking backstepping method command filter 1 introduction underway replenishment unrep has become a necessary process for global fleet operations during replenishment one of two ships will assume the role of guide ship and maintain a steady course and speed while an approach ship will move alongside the guide ship to transfer cargoes such as food fuel and fresh water the motion control of the approach ship is typically achieved manually with the aid of gps and radar and requires a helmsman with good steering skills kyrkjebø 2007 liu et al 2007 however external disturbances can hinder maintaining the expected longitudinal and transverse distances between the two ships by manual control skejic et al 2009 hence it is necessary to develop a synchronization motion control system that can significantly improve maneuvering precision increase supply efficiency and ensure the safety of both crews and cargoes in general a leader follower approach is used to realize the synchronized control of two ships engaged in underway replenishment liu et al 2018 gierusz et al 2016 the basic concept involves the guide ship following a predefined straight path at a specified speed while the approach ship tracks a virtual trajectory that is constructed by the motion states of the guider and predefined replenishment distances wang 1991 in recent decades numerous methods for the trajectory tracking control of underactuated ships have been studied considering the nonlinear characteristics of ship dynamics and the uncertainty of external disturbances backstepping based control strategies have been widely used in this field due to their excellent capability to control uncertain nonlinear systems zhao et al 2019a 2019b 2020 godhavn 1998 applied an adaptive backstepping technique to obtain a control law for trajectory tracking although the position tracking demand was satisfied the heading of the ship was controlled indirectly which caused a large heading error when it was required to turn to overcome this problem a high gain based local exponential stabilization algorithm was developed to control the heading of the ship directly pettersen et al 2001 based on the assumption that the yaw rate was not zero jiang 2002 proposed a global asymptotic tracking control law in which the desired trajectory is generated by a virtual ship for curvilinear path following tasks do et al 2002 removed this assumption by constructing a new desired trajectory and the desired surge speed and yaw rate were not required to be generated by the virtual ship it should be noted that the above three approaches were all based on accurate mathematical models which are usually unavailable in practice by using adaptive laws with projection a nonlinear adaptive control strategy was developed to control ships with unknown parameters do et al 2004 in relevant studies a neural network nn was combined with a backstepping method to address model uncertainties and time varying disturbances zhang et al 2014 however all the abovementioned control methods did not fully consider external disturbances during an unrep in addition to wind waves and currents hydrodynamic interactions and highline cable tension also exist all these disturbances should be considered in the controller to improve the tracking accuracy the aforementioned control methods suffer from three major problems the first is the explosion of terms which is caused by the redifferentiation of the virtual control inputs in the standard backstepping design process the second is that the control inputs of these control systems are the surge force and yaw moment which is puzzling for designers because for an underactuated ship the actual control inputs are the propeller speed and rudder angle the third problem is that all states of the ship are used as feedbacks for the controller but the sway speed and yaw rate are usually unmeasurable to address the second problem li et al 2009a 2009b considered the rudder angle as a control input but the propeller speed was not mentioned zhang et al 2017 considered both actual control inputs but it also need to measure the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate for the last problem extended state observers esos have been widely used to estimate unmeasured states and lumped uncertainties guo et al 2012 liu et al 2019 fu et al 2015 peng et al 2018 similar to the second drawback of the controllers introduced in the last section in addition to the ship s position and heading the abovementioned eso also requires information on surge forces and yaw moments which are difficult to obtain in practice inspired by this problem a simplified dynamics model is proposed the surge force is rewritten as a product of the propeller speed and an unknown time varying parameter the steering moment is constructed as the product of an unknown time varying parameter and the rudder angle a novel eso is designed by replacing the force and moment with the propeller speed and rudder angle respectively two direct adaptive laws are proposed in the controller design process to estimate these two parameters in this way we not only give full play to the advantages of the eso based backstepping design technique but also solve the problem where the control inputs cannot be used directly in engineering in this paper all the aforementioned disturbances are considered the command filtered backstepping approach wu et al 2018 is combined with a novel eso to design the motion controller of an approach ship by regarding the propeller speed and rudder angle as the control inputs the main contributions of this paper are as follows a the explosion of terms problem is avoided by the command filter b an eso is designed based on the position heading angle propeller speed and rudder angle to observe the surge speed sway speed yaw rate and total uncertainties which include the model uncertainties and external disturbances two time varying parameters in the proposed eso are estimated in the controller design process by two adaptive laws c the actual propeller speed and rudder angle are considered the control inputs for the approach ship which benefits implementation the rest of this paper is organized as follows mathematical models of the two ships and external disturbances are presented in the next section in section 3 the guidance law of the approach ship is derived the eso is designed in section 4 section 5 illustrates the controller design process and simulation results are shown in section 6 section 7 concludes this paper 2 mathematical models of the two ships during replenishment unrep is a process that can be divided into three phases as shown in fig 1 approaching parallel motion and departure the second phase is the key phase during which replenishment operations are conducted both ships must move with the same surge speed and heading angle considering the motions in surge sway and yaw the 3 dof kinematic model of ship can be expressed as 1 η i j ψ i υ i with j ψ i cos ψ i sin ψ i 0 sin ψ i cos ψ i 0 0 0 1 i a b where index i represents guide ship a and approach ship b η i x i y i ψ i t and υ i u i v i r i t are the position vector and velocity vector of ship i respectively the coordinate system for ships a and b is shown in fig 2 where f x i f y i and n i denote the forces and moments acting on ship i s 1 and s 2 are the transverse distance and longitudinal distance between them respectively the maneuvering modeling group mmg model is adopted as the dynamic model for both ships zhang et al 2013 2 m i λ 11 i u i m i λ 22 i v i r i x h i x p i d x i m i λ 22 i v i m i λ 11 i u i r i y h i d

c 2 c n c where ρ w denotes the density of seawater g is the gravity acceleration h w represents the wave amplitude and v c is the current velocity a f w and a s w are the transverse and lateral projected areas below the waterline respectively fossen 1994 wang et al 2020 based on fluid mechanics theory the hydrodynamic interactions between the two ships in parallel motion are caused by an irregular pressure distribution around the hull according to the bernoulli principle these two ships will approach each other the suction forces and moments loaded on both ships are strongly dependent on their speed and relative position the suction forces and moments can be expressed as 8 y h i ρ w u i 2 l i t i c y h i 2 n h i ρ w u i 2 l i 2 t i c n h i 2 where c n h i and c y h i denote the parameters related to the ship dynamics and relative positions respectively t i is the draft of ship i zhu 2010 during unrep the cargo is transferred with the help of a highline cable system as shown in fig 3 the cable tension is usually fourfold the weight of the cargo li 2009 such a large force will influence the movement of the two ships and can directly harm the security of the unrep process the following assumption is considered fu et al 2017 assumption 1 the cable is uniformly elastic with the same tension along itself which can only bear the tension the self weight of the cable is evenly distributed along the straight segment shown in fig 4 and the axial deformation created by the tension is ignored a mechanical analysis of this system is presented in fig 4 where q and q denote the cargo weight and the uniform load determined by the self weight of cable respectively h is the height difference between replenishment gantries and the horizontal distance from the cargo to the supply ship is l 0 h i and v i denote the components of the cable tensions f i in the horizontal and vertical directions where i a b under assumption 1 the following equations are obtained t a t b 4 q

be divided into h x i and h y i which are shown in 4 12 h x i h i cos γ ψ i h y i h i sin γ ψ i i a b with 13 γ arctan y b y a x b x a 3 guidance law design the guidance law for approach ship b is derived in this section it is assumed that guide ship a can precisely follow the predefined straight path at a constant surge speed according to fig 5 to achieve the coordinated motion control of the guide ship and approach ship a virtual trajectory with a relatively fixed distance from the trajectory of the guide one is obtained by the leader follower approach based on this virtual trajectory the desired heading angle for approach ship b can be deduced as shown in fig 5 the geometric relationship between the virtual trajectory and the trajectory of guide ship a can be expressed as 14 η v η a j ψ a l where l l v cos γ v l v sin γ v 0 t η v x v y v ψ v t denotes the virtual trajectory which should be tracked by the approach ship the relative distance between the two ships is set according to different kinds of ships cargoes and transporting equipment which means that the values of l v and γ v depend on the practical situation it is obvious that s 1 and s 2 shown in fig 2 should be kept within a small range of l v sin γ v and l v cos γ v when performing the replenishment task and the heading angles of the two ships should be kept consistent the following errors are defined 15 e s 1 s 1 l v sin γ v e s 2 s 2 l v cos γ v e ψ ψ a ψ b the errors in eq 15 should be kept within a small range of zero in fig 5 the desired heading angle of approach ship is obtained 16 ψ d b 1 2 1 sgn x v x

section to obtain the estimations of unmeasured speed vector υ b u b v b r b t and total uncertainties ζ ζ u ζ v ζ r t because the sideslip angle β b is very small the effective attack angle α r b

bounded define τ b d i a g n p b 2 0 δ b where n p b n p b and δ b δ b where n p b and δ b denote the maximum propeller speed and rudder angle respectively the time derivative satisfies τ b τ b in

assumption 2 is quite common and reasonable for underactuated ships zhang et al 2019 from eq 20 it is easy to determine that the unknown vector ζ consists of the external disturbances and the hydrodynamic damping effects first the external disturbances and their derivatives can be assumed to be limited peng et al 2018 second the hydrodynamic damping effects are speed related functions which are also determined by the propeller speed and rudder angle because these two control inputs are limited the speed of the ship cannot increase infinitely based on the calculation formula of the hydrodynamic damping effects it is natural to assume that their derivatives are bounded by speed related functions in summary assumption 2 is reasonable to analyze the stability of 25 a block diagonal

r is the bound of r b satisfying r b r p is a positive definite matrix that satisfies 27 based on the work of lindegaard 2003 and boyd et al 1994 it can be concluded that the existence of a positive definite matrix p can be guaranteed if and only if all the eigenvalues of a 0 have negative real part obviously matrix a 0 is hurwitz which means that all the real parts of its eigenvalues are negative consider the following lyapunov functional candidate 28 v e 1 2 e t p e when combined with 26 its time derivative is obtained 29 v e 1 2 e t p a 0 a 0 t p r b s t t p p s t e e t p b g

scale models of mariner and esso osaka are applied in a simulation to verify the feasibility and effect of the control strategy the esso osaka acts as guide ship a and mariner acts as approach ship b

scale models of mariner and esso osaka are listed in chislett et al 1965 and dand et al 1983 guide ship a is arranged to follow a straight path with α k 45 the desired replenishment distance l v 2 m γ v 90 which means that the desired values of transverse and longitudinal distances are s 1 0 m and s 2 2 m the speed of guide ship a is u a 0 6 m s f u and f r belong to ω u 0 f u 0 002 and ω r 0 f r 0 06 respectively the design parameters for the controller are k x b 0 025 k y b 0 001 k ψ b 0 05 k u b 0 4 k r b 0 4 ω u b ω ψ e b ω r b 0 1 and l d 6 m the wind speed current speed and amplitude of wave height are v a 0 05 sin 0 01 t 0 5 m s v c 0 05 m s and h w 0 05 m respectively for the highline cable system h 0 5 m q 0 04 kg m and q 0 02 kg and cable tension is applied to ship b at 170 s into the simulation the simulation results are shown in the following figures the trajectories of guide ship a and approach ship b are shown in fig 7 where the approach ship is directly behind the guide ship with the same heading in the initial stage ψ b 0 ψ a 45 the headings of both ships are presented in fig 8 the estimates and actual values of the speeds yaw rates and total uncertainties are shown in figs 9 and 10 these unmeasurable states can be accurately observed by the proposed eso and the propeller controller can accelerate the approach ship to the desired surge speed even under time varying disturbances the tracking errors 34 are listed in fig 11 and indicate that the approach ship can precisely track the virtual trajectory by using the proposed controller hence the longitudinal and transverse distances shown in fig 12 can be maintained near expectations in fig 11 we can see that the control inputs with the estimated total uncertainties can significantly improve the tracking accuracy which can improve the safety of replenishment operations to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control strategy a comparative study with a controller proposed by zhang et al 2017 is shown in fig 12 since the disturbances estimated by the eso are compensated by the two control inputs the proposed control laws can achieve smaller distance errors than the controller designed by zhang et al especially after applying the interference of cable tension the difference is significant and the proposed control strategy reduces the number of system states that need to be measured which assists practical engineering the estimates of f u and f r are shown in fig 13 which indicate that the values of f ˆ u and f ˆ r are bounded and located within the intervals of f u and f r respectively the boundedness of f ˆ u and f ˆ r guarantees the stability of the proposed control strategy without knowing the values of f u and f r the propeller speed and rudder angle are shown in fig 14 from which we can conclude that the control inputs are not saturated 7 conclusions a leader follower motion control strategy based on a newly designed eso and command filtered adaptive backstepping technique is presented for an approach ship engaged in an underway replenishment operation when only the position and heading of the approach ship are available the propeller speed and rudder angle are regarded as the control inputs for the studied ship based on the proposed eso the unmeasured states as well as the total uncertainties can be accurately estimated simultaneously the estimated total uncertainty terms are used to attenuate the disturbances according to simulation results the proposed motion control strategy can ensure that the approach ship precisely tracks the desired trajectory in the meantime the longitudinal distance and transverse distance between the guide ship and approach ship can also be maintained near expectations which guarantees the safety of the unrep operation future works will focus on identifying the ships dynamic parameters credit authorship contribution statement yuxian huang conceptualization methodology software writing original
