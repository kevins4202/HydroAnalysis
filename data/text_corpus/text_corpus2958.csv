14790,electroactivity is an important parameter to assess the ability of the extracellular polymeric substance eps of microorganisms to participate in extracellular respiration many reports have found that the electroactivity of microbial sludge could be enhanced with electrical stimulation but the reason remains unclear the results of this study showed that the current generation of the three microbial electrolysis cells increased by 1 27 1 76 times during 49 days of electrical stimulation but the typical electroactive microorganisms were not enriched meanwhile the capacitance and conductivity of eps of sludge after the electrical stimulation increased by 1 32 1 83 times and 1 27 1 32 times respectively in situ ftir analysis indicated that the electrical stimulation could lead to the polarization of amide groups in the protein likely affecting the protein structure related to the electroactivity accordingly the dipole moment of the α helix peptide of protein of sludge increased from 220 d to 280 d after the electrical stimulation which was conducive to electron transfer in the α helix peptide moreover the vertical ionization potential and elumo ehomo energy gap of the c terminal in the α helix peptide decreased from 4 43 ev to 4 10 ev and 0 41 ev to 0 24 ev respectively which indicated that the α helix was easier to serve as the electron transfer site of electron hopping these results meant that the enhancement of the dipole moment of the α helix peptide unchoked the electron transfer chain of the protein which was the main reason for the increased electroactivity of eps protein graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular respiration extracellular polymeric substance eps electroactivity electrical stimulation α helix

as bio electrochemical systems bess and dissimilatory iron reduction lovley 2012 logan 2009 relies on electron shuttles nanowires outmost membrane c type cytochromes etc to exchange electrons with the extracellularly insoluble electron acceptors hernandez and newman 2001 mcglynn et al 2015 wegener et al 2015 extracellular polymeric substances epss that consist mainly of protein and polysaccharides coat the cell surface to separate the microbial cells from the external environment xiao and zhao 2017a which is a physical barrier for the cell to transport electrons inside to the outside karygianni et al 2020 xiao et al 2017b recently it has been reported that applying electrical stimulation could promote the electroactivity of eps and microbial aggregates it was observed that c o bonds of amide groups were polarized under electrical stimulation jiang et al 2022 wang et al 2022 which might be attributed to the deviation of positive and negative centers of chemical bonds induced by an external electric potential electric polarization considering that amide groups the essential structure of protein complexes can be engaged in the electron transfer of the basic redox reactions in protein complexes morita et al 2010 the polarization of c o bonds of amide groups might change the electron transfer properties of protein complexes in eps to increase the electroactivities of the eps for example the polarization of c o bonds is reported to enhance the electron transfer in eps since the polarization likely improved the dielectric property of amide groups yu and zhang 2019 c o bonds of amide groups can form hydrogen bonds with other groups which provides the backbone for protein complexes secondary structures such as α helix and β sheet pauling and corey 1950 typically the α helix structure is a helical conformation consisting of hydrogen bonds between c o of the x site amino acid and n h of the x 4 site amino acid in the backbone of the peptide this helical conformation enables the α helix peptide to have a higher atomic density amdursky 2015 different from the other secondary structures the direction of the local dipole i e amide group of α helix peptide overlaps basically with the direction of the peptide molecular dipole which makes the total dipole moment from the c terminal to the n terminal larger than other secondary structures β sheet β turn and random coil shin et al 2003 these properties enable the α helix more favorable for electron transfer in proteins shah et al 2015 electron hopping is believed the dominating mechanism of the long distance electron transfer in protein which requires electron transfer sites with appropriate redox potential to serve as the hopping site cordes and giese 2009 compared to common electron hopping sites such as aromatic side chains the amide groups on α helix peptides have higher redox potential which is unable to mediate electron hopping however the α helix peptide with the larger dipole moment may decrease the ionization potential in the c terminal which reduces the redox potential of the c terminal of the α helix peptide and facilitate it to serve electron transfer sites for electron hopping chen et al 2010 therefore we assumed that the polarization of c o bonds with the electrical stimulation likely increased the dipole moment of α helix to further affect the electron transfer behavior of the c terminal of α helix peptide in protein up to now no reports have been found to investigate the effects of electrical stimulation on protein structures that further influence the electroactivity of eps and microbial aggregates in this study the changes in the electroactivity and structures of eps proteins under the bess were analyzed in addition molecular dynamics simulations md and density functional theory dft calculations were performed to reveal the reasons for the enhanced electron transfer of protein complexes with the electrical stimulation using an α helix peptide model 2dx3 2 materials and methods 2 1 initial basic data and experimental setup four microbial electrolysis cells mecs were operated parallelly each with two 250 ml chambers separated by a proton exchange membrane a constant potential 0 4 v 0 6 v and 0 8 v versus sce at the anode of mec was supplied by an electro working station chenghua ch1030c in each mec reactor two carbon cloth length of 4 cm width of 2 cm and height of 2 cm and a saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working counter and reference electrodes respectively ren et al 2019 operated at a hydraulic retention time of 24 h and a temperature of 37 0 c 20 ml of seed sludge collected from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant dalian china was used as inoculum the main characteristics of the seed sludge are as follows tss 53 158 351 mg l vss 24 285 198 mg l ph 8 12 0 20 the anode chambers of the four mecs were fed with artificial wastewater with a cod of 5000 mg l of which the composition per liter was as below 3 04 ml ethanol nh4cl 0 48 g kh2po4 0 11 g nahco3 0 50 g trace element solution 10 ml vitamin solution 10 ml the cathode chamber was 0 1 g l of nacl solution li et al 2022a 2 2 extract and analysis of eps the sludge sample was collected from the anodic electrode after 49 days of the experiment and then the eps was extracted from the sludge by heating method xiao et al 2017b in short eps contained sludge solution was cleaned with 0 9 nacl two times and heated at 60 c for 30 min finally the sample was centrifugated for 10 min and filtered by a 0 45 μm filter membrane to obtain eps solution the electrical conductivity and capacitance of the eps were tested by the electrochemical workstation chenhua chi650b shanghai china the method of the three probe was applied to measure electrical conductivity zhao et al 2016 three probe consists of two gold electrodes by a 0 5 mm non conductive gap and the suspended eps was placed on the non conductive gap apply a voltage ramp of 0 2 0 2 v across split electrodes in steps of 0 025 v recorded the current voltage curve through the electrochemical workstation and calculate the electrical conductivity by the average value of current voltage three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence excitation wavelength ex range 200 to 500 nm step size 5 nm emission wavelength em range 200 to 600 nm step size 5 nm was used for fluorescence scanning and matlab 2014b was used for parafac chen et al 2003 2 3 molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory molecular dynamics md simulations were performed to explore the effect of the electric field on a single protein molecule the starting configuration of 2dx3 from protein database bank pdb we chose the sequence inywlahakag containing only α helix from 2dx3 the initial structures were prepared on the basis of the docked structures and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed in the namd2 6 software package using the all atom charmm 27 force field best et al 2012 and tip3p water model to explore whether the structure of the protein was affected by the direction of the electric field the electric field in three different directions was applied with the strength of 0 v nm and 1 0 v nm respectively dft calculations were performed after md and before md α helix peptide the gaussian 16 suite of programs was used to optimize the configurations the atomic positions of α helix residues formed by amino acids extracted from the x ray model 2dx3 were obtained after rigid body translation rotation to obtain the initial structure the reorganization energy was performed using the b3lyp functional with the def2svp basis set gd3bj results for ionization potential electronegativity and frontier orbital energy homo lumo were obtained using this calculation method all optimized structures were subjected to frequency calculations to ensure there were no imaginary frequencies 2 4 other analysis microbial community analysis of sludge capacitance and in situ electrochemical ftir of eps and secondary structure of eps protein are detailed in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of electrical stimulation on performances of anaerobic digestion to elucidate the influence of electricity on the electroactivity of sludge we have cultured microorganisms in the anode potential with open circuit 0 4 v 0 6 v and 0 8 v respectively the result showed that the current of the three electrical stimulation reactors e 0 4 e 0 6 e 0 8 increased gradually during 49 days fig 1 b particularly the current of e 0 6 on day 49 was 1 76 times that of the initial on day 1 the increase in current was a result of the enhanced electron transport between cell cell of bulk sludge or between biomass and the electrode after the electrical stimulation accordingly the mineralization of organics cod removal increased by 4 7 12 5 fig 1a however the calculation based on the anodic coulombic efficiency table s1 supporting information showed that the anodic oxidation only contributed to 1 65 3 93 of the increased cod removal mahmoud et al 2017 suggesting that the anode oxidation was not the main reason for the accelerated decomposition of substrates and for the increased current it was reported that the electrical stimulation could accelerate the extracellular electron transfer eet among electroactive microorganisms to promote organic decomposition in anaerobic systems which was generally ascribed to the enrichment of electroactive microorganisms and the enhancement of eet li et al 2022a sun et al 2022 however microbial community analysis indicated the microorganisms capable of eet detected in this study were mainly methanothrix and petrimonas fig 2 methanothrix species are capable of directly accepting electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer for the reduction of carbon dioxide to produce methane lovley 2017 however the relative abundance of methanothrix showed no significant difference among the four group reactors which were 65 7 67 4 63 9 and 65 4 in the control e 0 4 e 0 6 and e 0 8 respectively petrimonas species were also reported to perform extracellular electron transfer with fe iii oxides and electrodes lei et al 2018 of which the relative abundance even decreased by 2 4 9 0 points with the electrical stimulation 16 6 for control 14 2 for e 0 4 10 0 for e 0 6 and 7 6 for e 0 8 the results showed these electroactive microorganisms detected in the sludge were not enriched with the electrical stimulation in agreement with the low anodic coulombic efficiency which was not the reason for the improvement of performance it was reported that applying a voltage induced the polarization of amide groups of protein to accelerate electron transfer along the protein complexes yu and zhang 2019 it was reasonably assumed that the enhanced electron transfer in the sludge was likely related to the improved physiochemical properties of protein complexes with the electrical stimulation to promote the anaerobic system 3 2 effect of electrical stimulation on electrochemical characteristics of the eps eps of the anodic sludge was extracted to evaluate the changes in electroactivity as shown in fig 3 the conductivity of eps on the electrodes of the three electrical stimulated reactors were 1 27 1 32 times that of the control 1 71 μs cm for control 2 18 μs cm for e 0 4 2 17 μs cm for e 0 6 and 2 27 μs cm for e 0 8 similarly the result of cyclic voltammetry showed that the capacitance of eps increased by 1 32 1 83 times after the electrical stimulation consistent with the previous study jiang et al 2022 the improvement in conductivity and capacitance of eps showed that the electroactivity was improved which benefited the electron transfer between cells of the sludge to transport more electrons to the electrode eem parafac analysis showed that the secretion of protein complexes ex em 250 nm 350 nm increased after the electrical stimulation peng et al 2015 the total fluorescence intensity of protein like substances after the electrical stimulation was 1 16 1 82 times of the control with no electrical stimulation namely 79 a u for control 90 a u for e 0 4 128 a u for e 0 6 and 144 a u for e 0 8 respectively see fig s1 supporting information notably the protein like substances secreted of e 0 4 was lowest but the electroactivity of e 0 4 was highest seemingly the content of protein like substances was less related to the conductivity and capacitance fig 3 eps was further identified by in situ ftir to investigate the changes in the polarity of functional groups after the electrical stimulation liu et al 2021 with the testing potential shifting from 0 9 v to 0 4 v v s ag agcl the band intensity of eps after the electrical stimulation at 1550 cm 1 stretching vibration of c o in the amide i and 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn in the amide ii increased significantly while the intensity of these band of eps without the electrical stimulation in advance showed fewer changes fig 4 considering that c o and c n are the basic structural units amide group of amino acids of proteins the significant enhancement of infrared absorption band intensities of c o and c n indicated that the protein complexes could be polarized after the electrical stimulation yu et al 2015 generally the degree of polarization of the material is positively related to its permittivity indicating the material s capacitance dubois et al 2004 the amide group was the basic functional group of protein complexes involved in electron transfer and its polarization might increase eps capacitance to store more electrons to participate in extracellular respiration akhoury et al 2013 forster et al 2004 the polarization of c o amide groups also makes more electrons far from the o nuclear and stay in a high energy state which benefited the c o engaged proton coupled electron transfer to increase the conductivity of the eps perkins 1980 furthermore as the bases for protein formation the amide group provides hydrogen bonds to form the fundamental secondary structures of protein such as α helix β sheet β turn and random coil the polarization of c o and c n in amide groups might affect the protein structure to increase the electroactivity of eps proteins 3 3 influence of electricity on the secondary structure of eps proteins ftir spectroscopy fig s2 supporting information together with the data processing by peak fitting of the amide i region 1600 1700 cm 1 fig 5 was used to explore the relative contents of the secondary structure of eps protein summarized in table 1 yin et al 2015 the results indicated that the α helix content of the eps protein increased after the electrical stimulation namely the content was 18 6 for control 20 5 for e 0 4 22 6 for e 0 6 and 23 8 for e 0 8 respectively as the typical secondary structure of protein complexes that most likely transport electrons compared with β sheet β sheet and random coil amdursky 2015 han et al 2012 the increase of α helix peptide meant that more electron transfer sites were likely to be engaged in et pecht et al 2015 it is reported that the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide is highly correlated with the projection in the direction of the helix axis corresponding to c o r 0 99 the sum of the local dipoles of c o was approximately equal to its molecular dipole moment shin et al 2003 due to the consistency of the dipole moment direction the electron transfer rate from the c terminal to the n terminal was 5 27 times higher than the reverse direction from the n terminal to the c terminal of the α helix galoppini and fox 1996 while the electron transfer for both sides showed fewer differences in the rate as the helical structure of the peptide backbone changed to a random coil lauz et al 2012 therefore the polarized c o groups of amide groups with electrical stimulation fig 4 might increase the dipole moment of α helixes and further to facilitate electron transfer mediated by the α helix peptide fig 6 3 4 theoretical simulation and calculation of the changes in structure and properties of α helix peptide under the electric field 3 4 1 molecule dynamics simulation the 2dx3 a typical α helix peptide model consisting of only 15 amino acids was used to stimulate the effects of electrical stimulation on the property of α helix peptide dong et al 2021 araki and tamura 2007 okumura and itoh 2013 molecular dynamics simulation analysis showed that the components of the dipole moment of the 2dx3 peptide fluctuated significantly between 200 d and 200 d in the three directions of the x y and z axis without the electric field fig 7 a and the total dipole moment was around 220 d gray line fig 7c obviously when the electric field was applied along the one direction for example the x axis the components of dipole moment in the x axis direction increased to 280 d while the components of dipole moment in the other two directions the y axis and z axis tended to zero fig 7b these findings indicated that when the direction of the electric field was consistent with or parallel to the direction of the dipole moment x axis the total dipole moment of the α helix peptide increased while the vertical electric field had little effect on the total dipole moment in the microbial aggregations of bio electrochemical systems countless α helix structures of microbial eps seem to be disorderly distributed but there exist innumerable α helix structures that had the same or similar direction of the dipole moment with the electric field it meant that the electric field might increase the total dipole moment of the α helix peptide of eps in the biological systems yeung et al found that the transition energy δe of the electron from the donor to the acceptor decreased sharply to accelerate the electron transportation when the molecular dipole of the peptide composed of α helix increased shin et al 2003 while the strengthening of other secondary structures had no impact on δe moreover the increase in the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide could induce the c terminal and n terminal to be engaged in electron transfer for example with increased the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide the vertical ionization potential of c terminals might decrease chen et al 2010 the vertical ionization potential reflects the energy required for the loosest electrons in a molecule to escape and a low vertical ionization potential was essential for a functional group to serve as the electron transfer sites han et al 2012 therefore an increase in the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide could facilitate the c terminal of the α helix peptide to participate in electron transfer and further increase the electroactivity of eps fig 3 3 4 2 density functional analysis of the c terminals in the α helix peptide as mentioned above the c terminals likely obtained a low vertical ionization potential with the increase in the dipole moment of a helix peptides which made it easy for c terminals to serve as the relay stations for electron transfer to further explore the effects of the dipole moment of a helix on the c terminals of the α helix peptide in mediating et the vertical ionization potential and the energy gap δe elumo ehomo approximates the redox potential were calculated with the four amino acids ile asn tyr trp at the c terminal in the α helix peptide the calculation results showed that the vertical ionization potential of the cluster molecules four amino acids decreased from 4 43 ev to 4 10 ev under the electric field which facilitated the release of electrons from the c terminal to participate in the et of the peptide fig 8 meanwhile the changes in the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energies have been confirmed to affect the electrochemical features of peptides and proteins guo et al 2016 issa et al 2010 the energy gap between homo and lumo of the cluster molecules decreased from 0 41 ev to 0 24 ev under the electric field the smaller energy gap here indicated that less energy was required for the electronic transition in the α helix peptide as the electron transfer sites with the electrical stimulation 4 implications up to date the enrichment of electroactive microorganisms is considered a crucial factor in improving eet between electroactive microorganisms in the bess however many studies reported that the electroactivity of the microbial aggregations increased after the electrical stimulation to benefit the extracellular electron transfer and improve the decomposition of organic matter li et al 2022b sun et al 2022 wang et al found that the eps of sludge conductivity increased by 2 36 fold with the electrical stimulation wang et al 2022 similarly the conductivity and capacitance of sludge in this study were both enhanced 1 27 1 32 times for conductivity and 1 83 2 84 times for capacitance after the electrical stimulation the enhanced electroactivity of the sludge strengthened eet in which the electrically induced polarization of protein complexes might play an important role however until now the reason was rarely investigated the polarization amide group of eps protein under the electric potential was confirmed in this work fig 4 notably the amide group is the basic unit that provides the framework for the secondary structure of protein complexes and the calculation showed that the dipole moment of the α helix peptide increased with the electrical stimulation which decreased the vertical ionization potential and elumo ehomo energy gap of c terminals in α helix peptide as a result the c terminal of α helix peptide served as the more effective electron transfer site for long range electron hopping han et al 2012 this study explained the reasons why the electrical stimulation enhanced the electron transfer of protein contained substances like eps the polarization of c o and c n with electrical stimulation intensified the dipole moment of the α helix peptide which further reduced the vertical ionization potential of the c terminals in α helix peptide the electron transfer sites in the process of electron hopping to promote electron transfer mediated by the α helix peptide in proteins the results revealed that the secondary structure of protein complexes could be changed by electrical stimulation to increase the electron transfer capacity which has been neglected in previous reports 5 conclusions in this study the changes in structural properties of protein complexes with the electrical stimulation were analyzed from the secondary structure level the results of the spectral analysis showed that the amide group of eps was polarized under electrical stimulation leading to the decrease in the dipole moment of α helix peptide 2dx3 from 220d to 280d the decreased vertical ionization potential from 4 43 ev to 4 10 ev and elumo ehomo energy gap from 0 41 ev to 0 24 ev of c terminals in α helix peptide benefited the electron transportation in the protein complexes of the eps and the conductivity and capacitance of the eps increased to accelerate the interspecies electron transfer among microorganisms which improved the cod removal of the anaerobic system these findings suggested that the change in the α helix peptide dipole moment was favorable for et in protein complexes and also provided the possibility of further promoting eet between microorganisms the results of this study also offer a new insight from molecular biology to explain the enhancement of the electroactivity of protein complexes in eps with the potential stimulation

species are capable of directly accepting electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer for the reduction of carbon dioxide to produce methane lovley 2017 however the relative abundance of methanothrix showed no significant difference among the four group reactors which were 65 7 67 4 63 9 and 65 4 in the control e 0 4 e 0 6 and e 0 8 respectively petrimonas species were also reported to perform extracellular electron transfer with fe iii oxides and electrodes lei et al 2018 of which the relative abundance even decreased by 2 4 9 0 points with the electrical stimulation 16 6 for control 14 2 for e 0 4 10 0 for e 0 6 and 7 6 for e 0 8 the results showed these electroactive microorganisms detected in the sludge were not enriched with the electrical stimulation in agreement with the low anodic coulombic efficiency which was not the reason for the improvement of performance it was reported that applying a voltage induced the polarization of amide groups of protein to accelerate electron transfer along the protein complexes yu and zhang 2019 it was reasonably assumed that the enhanced electron transfer in the sludge was likely related to the improved physiochemical properties of protein complexes with the electrical stimulation to promote the anaerobic system 3 2 effect of electrical stimulation on electrochemical characteristics of the eps eps of the anodic sludge was extracted to evaluate the changes in electroactivity as shown in fig 3 the conductivity of eps on the electrodes of the three electrical stimulated reactors were 1 27 1 32 times that of the control 1 71 μs cm for control 2 18 μs cm for e 0 4 2 17 μs cm for e 0 6 and 2 27 μs cm for e 0 8 similarly the result of cyclic voltammetry showed that the capacitance of eps increased by 1 32 1 83 times after the electrical stimulation consistent with the previous study jiang et al 2022 the improvement in conductivity and capacitance of eps showed that the electroactivity was improved which benefited the electron transfer between cells of the sludge to transport more electrons to the electrode eem parafac analysis showed that the secretion of protein complexes ex em 250 nm 350 nm increased after the electrical stimulation peng et al 2015 the total fluorescence intensity of protein like substances after the electrical stimulation was 1 16 1 82 times of the control with no electrical stimulation namely 79 a u for control 90 a u for e 0 4 128 a u for e 0 6 and 144 a u for e 0 8 respectively see fig s1 supporting information notably the protein like substances secreted of e 0 4 was lowest but the electroactivity of e 0 4 was highest seemingly the content of protein like substances was less related to the conductivity and capacitance fig 3 eps was further identified by in situ ftir to investigate the changes in the polarity of functional groups after the electrical stimulation liu et al 2021 with the testing potential shifting from 0 9 v to 0 4 v v s ag agcl the band intensity of eps after the electrical stimulation at 1550 cm 1 stretching vibration of c o in the amide i and 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn in the amide ii increased significantly while the intensity of these band of eps without the electrical stimulation in advance showed fewer changes fig 4 considering that c o and c n are the basic structural units amide group of amino acids of proteins the significant enhancement of infrared absorption band intensities of c o and c n indicated that the protein complexes could be polarized after the electrical stimulation yu et al 2015 generally the degree of polarization of the material is positively related to its permittivity indicating the material s capacitance dubois et al 2004 the amide group was the basic functional group of protein complexes involved in electron transfer and its polarization might increase eps capacitance to store more electrons to participate in extracellular respiration akhoury et al 2013 forster et al 2004 the polarization of c o amide groups also makes more electrons far from the o nuclear and stay in a high energy state which benefited the c o engaged proton coupled electron transfer to increase the conductivity of the eps perkins 1980 furthermore as the bases for protein formation the amide group provides hydrogen bonds to form the fundamental secondary structures of protein such as α helix β sheet β turn and random coil the polarization of c o and c n in amide groups might affect the protein structure to increase the electroactivity of eps proteins 3 3 influence of electricity on the secondary structure of eps proteins ftir spectroscopy fig s2 supporting information together with the data processing by peak fitting of the amide i region 1600 1700 cm 1 fig 5 was used to explore the relative contents of the secondary structure of eps protein summarized in table 1 yin et al 2015 the results indicated that the α helix content of the eps protein increased after the electrical stimulation namely the content was 18 6 for control 20 5 for e 0 4 22 6 for e 0 6 and 23 8 for e 0 8 respectively as the typical secondary structure of protein complexes that most likely transport electrons compared with β sheet β sheet and random coil amdursky 2015 han et al 2012 the increase of α helix peptide meant that more electron transfer sites were likely to be engaged in et pecht et al 2015 it is reported that the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide is highly correlated with the projection in the direction of the helix axis corresponding to c o r 0 99 the sum of the local dipoles of c o was approximately equal to its molecular dipole moment shin et al 2003 due to the consistency of the dipole moment direction the electron transfer rate from the c terminal to the n terminal was 5 27 times higher than the reverse direction from the n terminal to the c terminal of the α helix galoppini and fox 1996 while the electron transfer for both sides showed fewer differences in the rate as the helical structure of the peptide backbone changed to a random coil lauz et al 2012 therefore the polarized c o groups of amide groups with electrical stimulation fig 4 might increase the dipole moment of α helixes and further to facilitate electron transfer mediated by the α helix peptide fig 6 3 4 theoretical simulation and calculation of the changes in structure and properties of α helix peptide under the electric field 3 4 1 molecule dynamics simulation the 2dx3 a typical α helix peptide model consisting of only 15 amino acids was used to stimulate the effects of electrical stimulation on the property of α helix peptide dong et al 2021 araki and tamura 2007 okumura and itoh 2013 molecular dynamics simulation analysis showed that the components of the dipole moment of the 2dx3 peptide fluctuated significantly between 200 d and 200 d in the three directions of the x y and z axis without the electric field fig 7 a and the total dipole moment was around 220 d gray line fig 7c obviously when the electric field was applied along the one direction for example the x axis the components of dipole moment in the x axis direction increased to 280 d while the components of dipole moment in the other two directions the y axis and z axis tended to zero fig 7b these findings indicated that when the direction of the electric field was consistent with or parallel to the direction of the dipole moment x axis the total dipole moment of the α helix peptide increased while the vertical electric field had little effect on the total dipole moment in the microbial aggregations of bio electrochemical systems countless α helix structures of microbial eps seem to be disorderly distributed but there exist innumerable α helix structures that had the same or similar direction of the dipole moment with the electric field it meant that the electric field might increase the total dipole moment of the α helix peptide of eps in the biological systems yeung et al found that the transition energy δe of the electron from the donor to the acceptor decreased sharply to accelerate the electron transportation when the molecular dipole of the peptide composed of α helix increased shin et al 2003 while the strengthening of other secondary structures had no impact on δe moreover the increase in the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide could induce the c terminal and n terminal to be engaged in electron transfer for example with increased the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide the vertical ionization potential of c terminals might decrease chen et al 2010 the vertical ionization potential reflects the energy required for the loosest electrons in a molecule to escape and a low vertical ionization potential was essential for a functional group to serve as the electron transfer sites han et al 2012 therefore an increase in the molecular dipole moment of an α helix peptide could facilitate the c terminal of the α helix peptide to participate in electron transfer and further increase the electroactivity of eps fig 3 3 4 2 density functional analysis of the c terminals in the α helix peptide as mentioned above the c terminals likely obtained a low vertical ionization potential with the increase in the dipole moment of a helix peptides which made it easy for c terminals to serve as the relay stations for electron transfer to further explore the effects of the dipole moment of a helix on the c terminals of the α helix peptide in mediating et the vertical ionization potential and the energy gap δe elumo ehomo approximates the redox potential were calculated with the four amino acids ile asn tyr trp at the c terminal in the α helix peptide the calculation results showed that the vertical ionization potential of the cluster molecules four amino acids decreased from 4 43 ev to 4 10 ev under the electric field which facilitated the release of electrons from the c terminal to participate in the et of the peptide fig 8 meanwhile the changes in the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energies have been confirmed to affect the electrochemical features of peptides and proteins guo et al 2016 issa et al 2010 the energy gap between homo and lumo of the cluster molecules decreased from 0 41 ev to 0 24 ev under the electric field the smaller energy gap here indicated that less energy was required for the electronic transition in the α helix peptide as the electron transfer sites with the electrical stimulation 4 implications up to date the enrichment of electroactive microorganisms is considered a crucial factor in improving eet between electroactive microorganisms in the bess however many studies reported that the electroactivity of the microbial aggregations increased after the electrical stimulation to benefit the extracellular electron transfer and improve the decomposition of organic matter li et al 2022b sun et al 2022 wang et al found that the eps of sludge conductivity increased by 2 36 fold with the electrical stimulation wang et al 2022 similarly the conductivity and capacitance of sludge in this study were both enhanced 1 27 1 32 times for conductivity and 1 83 2 84 times for capacitance after the electrical stimulation the enhanced electroactivity of the sludge strengthened eet in which the electrically induced polarization of protein complexes might play an important role however until now the reason was rarely investigated the polarization amide group of eps protein under the electric potential was confirmed in this work fig 4 notably the amide group is the basic unit that provides the framework for the secondary structure of protein complexes and the calculation showed that the dipole moment of the α helix peptide increased with the electrical stimulation which decreased the vertical ionization potential and elumo ehomo energy gap of c terminals in α helix peptide as a result the c terminal of α helix peptide served as the more effective electron transfer site for long range electron hopping han et al 2012 this study explained the reasons why the electrical stimulation enhanced the electron transfer of protein contained substances like eps the polarization of c o and c n with electrical stimulation intensified the dipole moment of the α helix peptide which further reduced the vertical ionization potential of the c terminals in α helix peptide the electron transfer sites in the process of electron hopping to promote electron transfer mediated by the α helix peptide in proteins the results revealed that the secondary structure of protein complexes could be changed by electrical stimulation to increase the electron transfer capacity which has been neglected in previous reports 5 conclusions in this study the changes in structural properties of protein complexes with the electrical stimulation were analyzed from the secondary structure level the results of the spectral analysis showed that the amide group of eps was polarized under electrical stimulation leading to the decrease in the dipole moment of α helix peptide 2dx3 from 220d to 280d the decreased vertical ionization potential from 4 43 ev to 4 10 ev and elumo ehomo energy gap from 0 41 ev to 0 24 ev of c terminals in α helix peptide benefited the electron transportation in the protein complexes of the eps and the conductivity and capacitance of the eps increased to accelerate the interspecies electron transfer among microorganisms which improved the cod removal of the anaerobic system these findings suggested that the change in the α helix peptide dipole moment was favorable for et in protein complexes and also provided the possibility of further promoting eet between microorganisms the results of this study also offer a new insight from molecular biology to explain the enhancement of the electroactivity of protein complexes in eps with the potential stimulation

14791,free nitrous acid fna has been widely employed for improvement of wastewater management by altering sludge characteristic and function based on its polymer lysing and biocidal capacity sludge characteristic and function are commonly considered as the joint consequence of microbial individual behaviors and quorum sensing qs involved collective behaviours but the role of the latter in fna treatment was still as yet unidentified and addressed in this research the results of sludge morphology and component characterized fna induced zoogloea deformation including inner cell exposure half of extracellular polymeric substances eps reduction and adsorption site depletion during zoogloea deformation four acyl homoserine lactones ahls including c4 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl and c12 hsl transferred inward of microbiota and their total contents reduced by 66 because of depressed signal production augmented decomposer and recognition transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed qs driven by ahl redistribution facilitated microbiota acclimatization including cellular motility and hydrolase synthesis for eps consumption boosted motility may favor escaping from stress spot and moderating intercellular acidity based on cell motility test feasible eps consumption provided nutrition for heterotrophic metabolisms testified by pure culture with eps as sole nutrition our work thus comprehensively revealed qs behaviours responding to fna and deepened the understanding to fna treatment performance in wastewater management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quorum sensing activated sludge extracellular polymeric substances n acyl homoserine lactone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite is incredibly advanced into a mighty substance for improving wastewater system performance in recent years although it used to be recognized as an unfavorable biocide on numerous microorganisms duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2011 the improvement is embodied in terms of establishing shortcut nitrogen removal over the nitrite way controlling sewer corrosion and odor and reducing waste sludge mass via augmented degradation on cells extracellular polymeric substances eps and recalcitrant organics jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 2014 for instance fna pretreatment is capable of disintegrating biofilm and destructing volatile solids in wasted sludge which may be ascribed to the oxidization of reactive nitrogen species rnss chislett et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 based on the selective cytotoxicity that nitrite oxidizing bacteria is more susceptible to fna than ammonia oxidizing bacteria in sludge wang et al 2014 has applied side stream fna treatment to achieve shortcut nitrogen removal it is noteworthy that fna based method is outstanding because fna is a feasible and regenerative substance in wastewater system law et al 2015 progressive studies have proposed that the sludge microbiota phenotype is more likely ascribed to the cluster cooperation rather than the fate of specific individual xavier and foster 2007 hence the collective behaviour is capable of reflecting the essential and comprehensive elucidation on fna induced microbiota variation but few studies pinpointed the explicitly microbial collective behaviour responding to fna treatment quorum sensing qs a gregarious communication pathway depending on the secretion and recognition of diffusible chemical signals known as autoinducers ais is a focal process to coordinate cooperative behaviour contreras ramos and mansell 2021 williams et al 2007 given all uncovered ai species n acyl homoserine lactone ahl has been proved to be a pivotal one for modulating activated sludge performance tang et al 2018 as reported sludge granulation functional bacteria activity and eps secretion were regulated by ahl based qs gao et al 2019 sakuragi and kolter 2007 watnick and kolter 1999 by coincidence they were also impacted by fna treatment for establishing partial nitrification and reducing waste sludge mass zhou et al 2011 hence it is a reasonable assumption that qs function potentially modify fna treatment performance activated sludge becomes one of qs phenotype hot spots like previously confirmed luminous organ of bobtail squid marine snow and sponge cavity because they share a relatively encased niche gram et al 2002 taylor et al 2004 the principle is that a well organized spatial structure facilitates the accumulations of ai molecules and cells for triggering qs cascade gene regulation the hierarchically spatial matrix of sludge flocs was constructed by microbial pellet mp and eps liu et al 2010 2021 eps layer is normally recognized as the cornerstone of sludge matrix structure liu et al 2010 and the layer covering mp is further divided into tightly bound tb loosely bound lb and slime layers in order of outward divergence basuvaraj et al 2015 while fna treated sludge flocs and other biofilm eps decomposition was distinctly observed chislett et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 suggesting the deformation of sludge matrix where qs system worked thus we are inspired to speculate that the dynamically varied qs system over sludge deformation may felicitously elucidate the microbiota acclimatization responding to fna treatment fna induced sludge zoogloea deformation inevitably alters the component and molecular structure of eps layer as the sludge cornerstone that provide the adhesion and adsorption points hu et al 2016 liu et al 2010 then ahl dispersal within sludge may also be affected during fna treatment because eps acts as the diffusion medium and channel of intracellular secretions and exogenous matters in microbiota stacy et al 2014 2016 stewart 2003 xavier and foster 2007 fna induced eps transition potently alters ahls distribution and eventually qs regulation which has not been noticed before furthermore by identifying the metabolisms that are regulated by fluctuated qs owing to ahl redistribution such as biofilm formation protein synthesis and cellular motility laganenka et al 2016 whiteley et al 2017 microbiota acclimatization behaviours responding to fna treatment can be explicated aptly and accurately the aim of this study is to determine the dynamic equilibrium between ahl redistribution and fna induced sludge deformation and further disentangle the influence of qs involved behaviours on fna treatment consequences in order to fulfill the objective the sludge microbiota deformation is endowed with morphology recognition eps component and molecular structure detections during fna treatment meanwhile the dynamic diffusion of ahls through various layer of spatial matrix is characterized along with the sludge deformation which may be firstly conducted to our best knowledge furthermore qs function driven by ahl redistribution is determined by transcriptome analysis then qs involved collective behaviours can be discovered in order to comprehend the microbiota acclimatization responding to fna treatment this work will potently assist the comprehension of qs role in wastewater system 2 material and methods 2 1 fna treating activated sludge the activated sludge was sampled from a long term stable sequencing batch reactor treating artificial domestic sewage in laboratory half liter of sludge at around 4000 mg l of mlvss was repeatedly washed via centrifugation at 10 000 rpm to remove the ions interfering fna concentration the clean precipitate was suspended in 500 ml of fna modified saline solution with 0 95 sodium chloride and 1 26 mg hno2 n l at ph of 6 0 for 20 h as proposed by previous works for establishing partial nitrification and decomposing eps using fna treatment duan et al 2020 lu et al 2021 nan et al 2019 the sludge was sampled at 0 10 and 20 h of fna treatment for further measurement and analysis zoogloea morphology was imaged by scanning electric microscopy sem quattro fei u s 2 2 stepwise ahl extraction and detection the ahl distributions in lb eps tb eps and mp were focused because the pre experiment displayed that few ahls were detected in slime layer and due to the purification of sludge before fna treatment partial soluble eps was also removed in order to precisely measuring ahl concentration in lb and tb eps the release of intracellular ahl from mp during extracting lb and tb eps layers has to be avoided thus we measured the cellular integrity while extracting lb and tb eps layer and gained optimum conditions the cellular integrity was measured via detecting the activity of extracellular β galactosidase using the method stated by tsuji et al 2001 the detailed extraction process was described in supplementary text s1 and fig s1 and the optimal extraction procedure was fixed as the centrifugal purification 10 min of 60 c heat for lb eps 30 min of 70 c heat for tb eps and 60 min of ultrasonic for mp after collecting lb eps tb eps and mp solution ahl molecules were separated from aqueous phase and enriched in organic phase ethyl acetate via liquid phase extraction the organic phase was concentrated to minimum volume with rotary evaporator and the left was dried with nitrogen evaporator the dried ahl extractive was dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile and filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe membrane jinteng china the filtrate was applied to measuring ahl concentration using lc ms ms analysis following the protocol proposed by sun et al 2018 six standard ahls including c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl c12 hsl and 3oc12 hsl were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china and dissolved by acetonitrile for preparing a series of standard solutions the limit of detection which was defined as the concentration that induced a signal to noise ratio of 3 ranged from 1 ng l to 100 ng l detailed results were shown in table s1 the recovery rate was calculated by adding standard substance 100 ng l as depicted by sun et al 2018 and it ranged from 81 2 to 92 5 detailed results were shown in table s1 the average repeatability of six standard ahls which was represented by relative standard deviation was 13 1 ahls were extracted and measured at 0 10 and 20 h of fna treatment respectively 2 3 eps analysis lb and tb eps were extracted according to the procedure established in fig s1 briefly 100 ml of sludge was heat at 60 c for 10 min and after 10 000 rpm of centrifugation the supernatant was tagged as lb eps the precipitate was resuspended again and was heat at 70 c for 30 min after centrifugal separation the supernatant was tagged as tb eps protein pn content was measured by modified bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china polysaccharide ps content was measured by phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard hu et al 2016 liu et al 2010 the fluctuations of organic fluorescence compounds in eps over fna treatment were characterized by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra eps samples were diluted ten times and filtered through a 0 22 µm membrane filter the scanning was conducted using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorophotometer horiba france at excitation wavelengths ex from 200 to 450 nm with 5 nm increments and at emission wavelengths em from 250 to 500 nm with 5 nm increments rayleigh waves were deducted from spectra using rayleigh masking function of fluoressence software the molecular structure information of eps organics was determined using raman spectra eps liquids were scanned using a micro laser confocal raman spectrometer labram hr evolution horiba france with a laser λ 532 nm for excitation 2 4 transcriptome analysis and qs function taxonomy total rnas were extracted from 0 5 g of sludge samples at fna 0 10 and 20 h using the e z n a soil rna midi kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to manufacturer s instructions the purity and quality of total rna was evaluated with nanodrop2000 thermo fisher scientific u s and rna6000 nano chip in an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer respectively qualified rna samples were used to construct cdna library using truseq rna sample prep kit illumina transgenomics sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china raw read quality was controlled by removing low quality reads length 50 bp or with a quality value 20 or having n bases by sickle https github com najoshi sickle the genetic annotation of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg was performed using blastp version 2 2 28 http blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi against kegg database http www genome jp kegg qs involved genes were categorized into nine functions including autoinducer ai regulator decomposer decomposer transportor repressor ai receptor activator effector and unclear 2 5 testify of eps biotic consumption pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 pao1 a heterotrophic bacterium with labile qs function in sludge is selected for testifying the biotic consumption of eps cryopreservation strains were activated and grew in luria bertani lb broth at 30 c for 24 h one milliliter of activated strains was inoculated to 50 ml of extracted and purified eps solution and cultivated under 30 c for 20 h in order to simulating fna induction 50 ml of activated strains was cleaned from lb broth by ultrahigh speed centrifugation then the precipitate was suspended in 50 ml of eps solution with 1 26 mg hno2 n l of fna the change in biodegradability was reflected by the concentration of soluble chemical oxygen demand scod qs quenching qq agent 1 mg l of 2 5h furanone was added at the beginning of cultivation for verifying the role of qs gao et al 2022 the cell density was determined by detecting od600nm value the cultivation without eps addition was regarded as the blank but no obvious growth of pao1 was observed in blank group because of lacking of nutrition 2 6 cellular motility except the secretion of eps the motility can reshape the sludge microbial community the effect of fna perturbation on swimming ability was discussed by analyzing the changes in pao1 motility kim et al 2021 after pao1 activation 50 ml of strain solution was centrifugated and the precipitate was collected and suspended in 50 ml of fna modified saline solution at the 0 5 10 15 and 20 h of fna perturbation 10 µl of solution was sampled and dropped in the center of the motility medium solidified in a petri dish followed by incubation at 35 c for 24 h the cellular motility degree was assessed according to the maximal diameter of bacteria dispersal in plate surface the motility medium containing 1 w v of glucose 0 5 w v of agar 0 5 w v of peptone 0 2 w v of yeast extract and 10 of dmso qq experiment was also conducted to evaluate the role of qs in motility under fna perturbation 2 7 statistical analysis in this study the originpro 2022b was used for plotting and statistical analysis the difference analysis on eps content and ahl distribution was performed by one way anova herein p 0 05 and 0 01 was the evaluation criterion of significant and extremely significant difference respectively raman spectra was modified by baseline correction and curve smoothing 3 results 3 1 fluctuations of sludge morphology and components during fna treatment the continuous fluctuation in sludge spatial matrix was confirmed during fna treatment a typical sludge floc morphology covered by flocculent eps and constrained by filamentous bacteria was observed before fna treatment picture at 0 h of fna as shown in fig 1 a after being subject to fna solution 1 26 mg l fna this structure was destroyed eps layer got thin at the first 10 h and some cells came to appear on the surface undergoing 20 h of treatment partial eps layer disappeared inner mp was unveiled and densely aggregated microbial cells could be imaged clearly eps spatial structure was underpinned by the adhesive and viscoelastic molecules mainly pn and ps which were capable of gluing individual cells together during the matrix building neu et al 2001 in untreated sludge pn and ps contents in tb eps exceeded those in lb eps fig 1b then fna treatment significantly reduced the contents of pn and ps in total eps by 57 4 and 58 3 p 0 05 predominant decrease accounting for 88 3 arose in tb eps layer adjoining pellet rather the lb eps layer that was more accessible to fna solution pn ps ratios in range of 3 to 6 partly indicated the layered structure of sludge microbiota zhang et al 2007 3d eem fluorescence spectra was able to monitor the compositions of fluorescent substance in eps by determining the intensity at specific excitation emission wavelengths guo et al 2014 sun et al 2016 the detected fluorescent substances were normally divided into five types based on the distribution of excitation emission wavelengths in five spectrum regions coble 1996 all five types of fluorescent substances were detected in 3d eem spectra as shown in fig 1d but the intensities of protein like regions i and ii and fa like region iii substances were remarkably high as compared to the soluble microbial by product like compounds region iv and humic like substances region v bhatia et al 2013 dominguez et al 2010 at the beginning of sludge deformation fna 0 h the majority of fluorescent substances was concentrated in tb eps which concurred with the results of pn and ps contents fig 1b an immense reduction of protein like and fa like compounds in tb eps was detected in the first ten hours but the fluorescent compositions of tb eps slightly increased at 20 h on the contrary the fluorescent intensities of regions i ii and iii in lb eps slightly amplified during whole process the information of eps molecular structure was demonstrated in raman spectra fig 1e the assignment of raman peak position was based on reported literatures the band between 464 and 508 cm 1 was attributed to the presence of carbohydrates maquelin et al 2002 the variation ranging from 591 to 619 cm 1 was allocated to s s stretching vibrations of proteins whereas the c o h c c c n stretching were found around 1000 1200 cm 1 chen and lord 1976 wagner et al 2009 the band near 1440 cm 1 was ascribed to c o and coo vibrations in polysaccharide whereas the band near 1582 cm 1 was assigned to the ring stretching of guanine and adenine wagner et al 2009 the peaks around 1250 and 1650 cm 1 were due to the presence of amide iii and i chen and lord 1976 significant differences in raman spectra were marked in fig 1e in pristine sludge more functional groups existed in tb eps compared with lb eps because higher intensity of peaks was found in tb eps during fna treatment obvious reductions of s s c c c o c o and coo intensities were observed over sludge deformation at the end of treatment although the abundances of functional group were similar in lb eps and tb eps tb eps consisted of more carbohydrates and less s s group of proteins in addition the drifted peaks in range of 900 1200 cm 1 during fna treatment may represent the generation of small molecule byproducts from decomposing polymers jiang et al 2022a 3 2 fna induced ahl redistributions ahl molecules in lb eps tb eps and mp were extracted by modified stepwise procedure of ahl extraction six standard ahl types i e c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl c12 hsl and 3oc12 hsl were employed to detect because the existence of these ahls in sludge was reported in previous work feng et al 2019 maddela et al 2019 but c6 hsl and 3oc12 hsl molecules were not obtained in indigenous microbial community the results of endogenous ahl concentrations during deformation were shown in fig 2 a c8 hsl is the dominant ahl with 29 43 of total ahl in untreated sludge fig 2b and the ratios of measurable ahl species in total ahl declined in order of c12 hsl c4 hsl and c10 hsl fna treatment was capable of significantly changing the ahl concentration in sludge total ahl concentrations tremendously decreased from 265 ng g vss of fna 0 h to 193 ng g vss of fna 10 h and further reduced to 89 ng g vss of fna 20 h the reductions in c8 hsl c12 hsl c4 hsl and c10 hsl accounted for 40 3 29 2 23 1 and 7 4 of total reduction after 20 h of fna treatment at the initiation of treatment ahls in lb eps accounted for 36 0 of the total ahls and it was higher than the ahls in tb eps and mp fig 2b ahl contents in tb eps were similar with mp because the secretion and recognition of ahls achieved balance in stable qs system williams 2007 with fna treatment prolonging although the fall of ahl concentrations took place in every layer the highest reduction with 72 ng g vss came from lb eps layer after fna 20 h then ahl contents in tb eps and mp exceeded the lb eps at fna 10 h and 20 h which was opposite with the distribution in untreated microbiota fig 2b at the end of treatment mp ahls accounted for 42 7 of total ahl which exceeded the ratio of 25 8 in lb eps thus according to the ahl redistribution result endogenous ahls tended to transfer inward of sludge microbiota while sludge was subject to fna treatment the endogenous ahl concentrations in indigenous microbiota were extremely low according to our results and other reported data feng et al 2019 sun et al 2018 thus many researches have managed to improve wastewater system by boosting qs function via adding exogenous ahls de clippeleir et al 2011 gao et al 2019 hu et al 2016 in order to grappling with the effect of eps structure on exogenous ahl distribution c6 and 3oc12 hsl were selected for exogenous addition test because they were not detected in indigenous microbiota and could avoid the endogenous interference as much as possible two ahls with 1000 μg l were separately added into three sludge samples fna 0 10 and 20 h according to the fna content equation depending on ph and nitrite content the adjustment of ph into 7 00 could decrease the fna content into 0 126 hno2 n l that barely impacted sludge characteristics and microbiota activity duan et al 2020 lu et al 2021 thus the sludge samples subjected to 10 and 20 h of fna treatment were collected by ceasing fna treatment via adjusting ph to neutral after adequately mixing for 2 h they were extracted and detected following proposed stepwise procedure the concentrations of c6 and 3oc12 hsl in lb eps tb eps and mp of three sludge samples were shown in fig 3 a the recovery rates of c6 and 3oc12 hsl were stably around 84 using the stepwise procedure that we suggested in untreated sludge 653 86 μg l of c6 hsl and 752 64 μg l of 3oc12 hsl were found in lb eps but little and even none 3oc12 hsl ahls arrived mp while eps structure was destructed and eps contents reduce more ahls were able to be detected in tb eps and mp as diagramed in fig 3c in the sludge collected from fna 20 h c6 hsl evenly distributed in lb eps tb eps and mp and 3oc12 hsl in lb eps dropped to 452 63 μg l thus c6 hsl with shorter side chain may approach to the mp more easily with eps content reduction the correlation analysis between ahl concentration and eps content revealed that there was no significant impact of eps content on endogenous ahl redistribution but tb eps was capable of markedly dictating the distribution of exogenous addition ahls fig 3b notably based on the results of correlation fitting as shown in fig 3b the influence of tb eps component on 3oc12 hsl distribution outcompeted the influence on c6 hsl 3 3 fna driven expression differences in qs involved behaviours transcriptome analysis confirmed the expression differences of qs subfunctions during fna induced sludge deformation the expression of qs function was unceasingly upregulated by 38 in the whole duration fig 4 a then qs relevant genes were categorized into nine subfunctions including autoinducer ai production regulator decomposer transportor repressor ai receptor activator effector and unclear functions as shown in fig 4b except unclear subfunction the abundance of autoinducer was the highest but it was depressed by fna treatment the abundances of repressor ai receptor activator and effector were lower than 0 003 the transport through membrane and the recognition of ahl were improved by 23 9 and 46 6 respectively the ahl decomposition was also improved by 36 2 thus the depressed ai production and enhanced decomposer properly explicated the constant decrease in ahls shown in fig 2a correlation analysis fig 4c among differentially expressed kegg functions in level three was conducted for pinpointing the cellular behaviours impacted by qs system qs expression positively correlated with the expressions of sulfur metabolism mainly enzyme synthesis no 7 protein export no 14 platinum drug resistance no 25 bacterial chemotaxis no 35 and apoptosis no 37 in a significant degree otherwise biofilm formation no 34 phosphotransferase system no 27 methane no 5 and nitrogen no 6 metabolisms were depressed by fna treatment and showed the opposite expression consequences comparing with qs above results indicated that the microbiota under fna perturbation allocated the energy to stress resistance and resilience metabolisms instead of the inorganic assimilation metabolisms intriguingly the microbiota preferred to escaping from the stress locus which correlated with qs over forming biofilm against fna perturbation besides upregulated protein metabolism that positively correlated with qs mainly facilitated the enzyme synthesis among the 50 enzymes with the highest abundances 25 kinds were upregulated and all hydrolases for hydrolyzing protein ester and atp were located within the upregulation group as shown in fig 4d these hydrolases were capable of accelerating the degradation of polymers in sludge and energy generation bhatt et al 2021 komoszynski and wojtczak 1996 shetty et al 2017 thus qs potentially regulated eps degradation and cellular survival in sludge microbiota subject to fna treatment we thought this hypothesis was pivotal for explaining the qs involved collective behaviours responding to fna treatment and should be verified and discussed deeply 4 discussion our results demonstrated that fna induced transmutation of sludge microbiota mainly the deformation of eps structure determined the distribution of ahls whether they were excreted by indigenous microorganisms or added exogenously which eventually altered qs and qs involved metabolisms similar sludge microbiota transmutation inevitably happens when the sludge undergoes various perturbations such as feeding pattern abiotic stress and strain invasion feng et al 2019 sun et al 2022 xue et al 2021 ya et al 2023 hence the conclusion that spatial structure constructed by eps and mp directs the qs regulation by confining ai distribution may be ubiquitously prevailing in sludge and even other biofilm forms previous works have also suggested the differentially distribution of ahls in biomass and eps of sludge but they were experimented in plainly static stages feng et al 2019 sun et al 2018 our work further subdivided the ahl distribution in sublayers of eps and essentially refined this theory in a dynamic process with sludge microbiota deformation 4 1 causality among zoogloea deformation ahl distribution and qs expression in untreated sludge with typical layered floc structure eps can store more ahls comparing with mp as shown in fig 2b which was identical with the result from feng et al 2019 the extra ahl in eps may be ascribed to the secretion from planktonic cells subsequently owing to fna treatment sludge microbiota began to change in terms of eps content and molecular structure combining sem image fig 1a and eps content analysis fig 1b the unseen eps did not just drop and relocate to anywhere but was degraded we also noticed that the eps degradation largely took place in tb eps which was in agreement with distinct intensity reduction in raman spectra of tb eps fig 1d the more distinct reduction in tb eps was attributed to the decomposition and utilization of tb eps by aggregated cells which was discussed detailedly in section 4 2 former investigations mainly thought that eps degradation was attributed to the oxidation reaction caused by rnss chislett et al 2022 duan et al 2020 but our results suggested that under fna treatment a biotic process that cellular synthesis of hydrolases was amplified fig 4d may contribute to facilitating eps degradation and structure transformation particularly endopeptidase extracellular elastinolytic metalloproteinase esterase and serine endopeptidases were capable of efficiently decomposing pn ps and fa bhatt et al 2021 shetty et al 2017 this discovery may expand the mechanism of fna treatment on sludge to spontaneous cell behavior except chemical reaction during above depicted process concomitant redistribution of endogenous ahls was monitored in microbiota two distinct characteristics of ahl content changing were summarized firstly ahls transferred inward of the sludge microbiota resulting higher ahl content in mp than that in lb eps and tb eps thus the ahl distribution in microbiota through fna treatment was the opposite of that in untreated one the reservation of ahls in eps layer was assumed to depend on the abundant adsorb sites likely cooh and c oh islam et al 2020 siddharth et al 2021 with the dramatically reduction in eps the adsorb sites were accordingly damaged and then eps bonded ahls were released consequently microbes in mp were able to constantly access and utilize more ahls from eps which may explain the enhanced qs metabolism fig 4a this phenomenon implied that the change in microbiota structure caused the redistribution of endogenous ahl in other words it altered the route from ahl secreting individual to receiving individual this finding provided a definitely positive answer to whether ahl transfer within spatial matrix of microbiota altered qs expression furthermore it suggested the influence between eps and ahl was mutual rather than directed one way that ahls affected eps secretion as reported mukherjee and bossier 2019 papenfort and bassler 2016 it shall be worth noting that qs regulation relying on endogenous ahls may be inefficient for improving sludge activity due to the extremely low concentration of endogenous ahl then recent studies have conducted the exogenous addition of ahls into sludge for improving nitrogen removal performance de clippeleir et al 2011 hu et al 2016 tang et al 2018 correspondingly we testified the influence of microbiota structure on the distribution of exogenously added ahls our results indicated that eps layer can capture ahl molecules because most of exogenous ahls were blocked within lb eps and tb eps fig 3a and with eps reduction more ahls reached mp hence the quantity of exogenous ahl molecules that actually participated in qs system may be much lower than the added quantity the waste of ahl was seemingly inevitable in such application based on the correlation analysis tb eps locating in the middle of lb eps and mp significantly determined the exogenous ahl dispersal in microbiota for example the substantial decrease in tb eps component may lessen the obstruction of exogenous ahls from lb eps to mp however there was no significant correlation between endogenous ahls and eps because the fate of endogenous ahls was also impacted by other potential processes for instance its production transportation recognition and decomposition whiteley et al 2017 williams 2007 the second characteristic was the obvious reduction in ahl contents after fna treatment and this reduction was basically irrelevant with fna solution because the fna solution with same condition barely changed the ahl content in batch experiment that we pretested the reduction was ascribed to two reasons depressed synthesis and enhanced consumption as shown in fig 4b ahl production was depressed because in an oligotrophic environment nutrition has been wash out before fna treatment microbes may not have extra material and energy to producing more ahls the public good mukherjee and bossier 2019 but due to the inward transfer of eps ahls mp microbes can constantly receive ahls and upregulate qs function which was verified by the enhanced expression of transportor receptor and effector of ahls we therefore proposed the theory that fna induced transformation of sludge microbiota impacted qs function via redistributing ahls and this theory may be ubiquitous in various biofilms 4 2 qs behaviours responding to fna treatment upregulated qs function deriving from ahl redistribution potentially regulated other metabolisms with an emphasis on cellular motility and eps degradation as concluded from transcriptome analysis cellular motility the spontaneous movement of a cell translocating by consumption of energy scarinci and sourjik 2022 was elevated after fna induction according to the upregulations of chemotaxis and flagellar assembly fig 4a it potently altered the microbiota structure and was under the control of qs system laganenka et al 2016 papenfort and bassler 2016 transcriptome result also implied the significant positive relationship between chemotaxis and qs during fna treatment in order to empirically verifying the enhancement of fna on cellular motility swarming ability test was conducted using pao1 as model strain with flagella and pili structure kim et al 2021 coincidentally pao1 was also the most abundant qs function strain in our sludge as shown in fig s2 fig 5 a demonstrated that fna induction elongated the swarming distances of pao1 in disk but the elongation was nonlinear with fna time and it peaked at 10 h of fna when the distance extended by 68 3 the enhanced motility of sludge cells was mainly ascribed to the encouraged pili assembly pila and methylation chev chea and mcp fig 5a harvey et al 2018 karatan et al 2001 in the terms of cellular machinery the spiral rotation of flagella also powered the pao1 motility the motor motb a pivotal unit for generating flagella rotating energy by pumping proton out tan et al 2021 was spurred by fna induction because pumping proton out may moderate the intracellular acidity and fna content however the upregulation of negative regulator of flagellin synthesis coded by flgm indicated that sludge microbes no longer preferred to assembling new flagella during fna treatment thus the enhanced motility may mainly happen in the individual who already has complete flagella structure after quenching qs activity by adding qs inhibitor pao1 group failed to implement the strategic motility for adapting fna induction since the swarming distance continuously decreased with fna treating time fig 5a more importantly defective qs system was fatal for the survival of microbes coerced by fna without any colony growing in disk after fna treatment eventually cell translocation movement under the qs regulation can voluntarily break sludge microbiota structure as shown in fig 1a but why did the cells prefer to escape instead of forming biofilm after all it has been widely reported that bacteria within the biofilm possess stronger resistance against multiple abiotic and biotic stresses than the planktonic ones gedefie et al 2021 yao et al 2022 similar phenomenon was also reported in phosphate limited aquatic environment where the motility of v cholerae was activated but the biofilm is depressed with the regulation of phobr belonging to qs system jahid et al 2006 what should be highlighted was that both motility and biofilm were critically controlled by qs system feng et al 2021 proved that exogenous ahl addition speeded up the locomotion of planktonic cells to attachment surface thus shortening biofilm formation process biofilm formation actually an altruistic behaviour for participators xavier and foster 2007 may compromise the energy for maintaining self fitness against fna stress hence we thought the cells may initially adopt the motility strategy for escaping stress locus and foraging and then try to form biofilm in other place with mild stress and adequate nutrition but under the coordinated stress of oligotrophic condition and fna cytotoxicity biofilm was always inhibited future work should further figure out how qs system weighs and chooses which strategy is favorable for microbial survival qs function and abovementioned metabolisms contributing to the resistance against fna stress such as motility apoptosis and efflux pump demanded the energy consumption scarinci and sourjik 2022 the autotrophic capacity was impaired by fna since the severe inactivation of nitrogen and methane metabolisms fig 4a but the heterotrophic capacity was not completely inhibited by fna because several heterotrophic microbes with qs function reproduced during fna treatment as shown in fig s2 the latter was unexpected because sludge microbiota was featured with nutritional deprivation from sludge washing before fna treatment as described in experiment section another occurrence implying the energy production was that theoretically motility should be deteriorated during starvation jiang et al 2022b but the empirical result was the opposite previous works have corroborated that heterotrophic bacteria can urgently utilize eps for cellular activities in oligotrophic environment zhang and bishop 2003 thus vanished eps may be consumed as nutrition and this can plausibly explain the augmented synthesis of hydrolases we managed to ascertain this hypothesis by viably cultivating pao1 in medium with eps which was extracted from untreated sludge as sole nutrition source when there was no fna stress fig 5b pao1 multiplied linearly till 6 h it was worth noting that bacterial flocs were formed with the interference of eps after 12 h when planktonic cell density was high enough at the beginning of fna stress exposure fig 5c pao1 density decreased but owing to the eps decomposition it rose again after 8 h with the generation of scod representing the biodegradable substance in sludge guo et al 2014 this appropriately interpreted that eps reduction mainly took place in tb eps layer adjacent to microbe enriched pellet rather than in lb eps layer fig 1b and d fna enhanced sludge biodegradability has already been reported and rns oxidation capacity was thought to be the predominant explanation on eps degradation chislett et al 2022 wei et al 2018 our work further proved the nonnegligible role of biotic activity in eps degradation while the qs was inhibited pao1 density dramatically declined and less scod was generated combining this test eps variation and transcriptome analysis we concluded that in order to moderate starvation and fna qs system can accelerate hydrolase synthesis and then refractory eps was degraded to biodegradable substances as emergent nutrition during the whole course of pao1 growth in eps under fna stress no biofilm was formed no matter with active qs or not which was concert with our conclusion that fna depressed the biofilm formation in conclusion we have demonstrated how fna induced sludge microbiota structure transition impacts ahl redistribution within microbial consortium triggering the differentially expression of qs and qs involved metabolisms mainly eps consumption and motility as recapped in fig 6 in turn these metabolisms were capable of modifying microbiota structure biotic consumption on eps which can be promoted by hydrolase synthesis impacted the microbiota structure from three aspects providing emergent nutrition to heterotrophic bacteria for energy depended metabolisms motivating ahl redistribution due to adsorption site reduction and lessening the restraint on cellular motility because of thinner eps layer microbiota tended to translocate from stress spot instead of forming biofilm with the interference of qs system by coincidence during translocation flagellar rotation accompanied with proton efflux thus mitigating intracellular acidity and fna content fna treatment in wastewater system was mainly used to establish partial nitrification and improve methane production but both nitrogen and methane metabolisms were depressed and countered with qs function during treatment it implied that fna induced partial nitrification establishment and methane improvement did not happen with fna treatment but with the consequences of fna treatment we believed this result will benefit to mending the procedure of fna treatment in wastewater management 5 conclusions this study successfully disentangled the role of intricate qs regulation in fna treatment on sludge by combining dynamic ahl distribution over zoogloea deformation and variation in qs subfunction expression this conclusion revealed that besides ahl secretion and reception qs regulation was also modified by ahl dispersal within microbial consortium constructed by eps and aggregated cells two qs involved microbiota acclimatization behaviours recognized as eps biotic consumption and cellular motility undertook fna treatment consequences that included sludge mass reduction and flocs disintegration above inspiring conclusions will facilitate the research on qs role in the fluctuated

14791,free nitrous acid fna has been widely employed for improvement of wastewater management by altering sludge characteristic and function based on its polymer lysing and biocidal capacity sludge characteristic and function are commonly considered as the joint consequence of microbial individual behaviors and quorum sensing qs involved collective behaviours but the role of the latter in fna treatment was still as yet unidentified and addressed in this research the results of sludge morphology and component characterized fna induced zoogloea deformation including inner cell exposure half of extracellular polymeric substances eps reduction and adsorption site depletion during zoogloea deformation four acyl homoserine lactones ahls including c4 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl and c12 hsl transferred inward of microbiota and their total contents reduced by 66 because of depressed signal production augmented decomposer and recognition transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed qs driven by ahl redistribution facilitated microbiota acclimatization including cellular motility and hydrolase synthesis for eps consumption boosted motility may favor escaping from stress spot and moderating intercellular acidity based on cell motility test feasible eps consumption provided nutrition for heterotrophic metabolisms testified by pure culture with eps as sole nutrition our work thus comprehensively revealed qs behaviours responding to fna and deepened the understanding to fna treatment performance in wastewater management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quorum sensing activated sludge extracellular polymeric substances n acyl homoserine lactone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite is incredibly advanced into a mighty substance for improving wastewater system performance in recent years although it used to be recognized as an unfavorable biocide on numerous microorganisms duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2011 the improvement is embodied in terms of establishing shortcut nitrogen removal over the nitrite way controlling sewer corrosion and odor and reducing waste sludge mass via augmented degradation on cells extracellular polymeric substances eps and recalcitrant organics jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 2014 for instance fna pretreatment is capable of disintegrating biofilm and destructing volatile solids in wasted sludge which may be ascribed to the oxidization of reactive nitrogen species rnss chislett et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 based on the selective cytotoxicity that nitrite oxidizing bacteria is more susceptible to fna than ammonia oxidizing bacteria in sludge wang et al 2014 has applied side stream fna treatment to achieve shortcut nitrogen removal it is noteworthy that fna based method is outstanding because fna is a feasible and regenerative substance in wastewater system law et al 2015 progressive studies have proposed that the sludge microbiota phenotype is more likely ascribed to the cluster cooperation rather than the fate of specific individual xavier and foster 2007 hence the collective behaviour is capable of reflecting the essential and comprehensive elucidation on fna induced microbiota variation but few studies pinpointed the explicitly microbial collective behaviour responding to fna treatment quorum sensing qs a gregarious communication pathway depending on the secretion and recognition of diffusible chemical signals known as autoinducers ais is a focal process to coordinate cooperative behaviour contreras ramos and mansell 2021 williams et al 2007 given all uncovered ai species n acyl homoserine lactone ahl has been proved to be a pivotal one for modulating activated sludge performance tang et al 2018 as reported sludge granulation functional bacteria activity and eps secretion were regulated by ahl based qs gao et al 2019 sakuragi and kolter 2007 watnick and kolter 1999 by coincidence they were also impacted by fna treatment for establishing partial nitrification and reducing waste sludge mass zhou et al 2011 hence it is a reasonable assumption that qs function potentially modify fna treatment performance activated sludge becomes one of qs phenotype hot spots like previously confirmed luminous organ of bobtail squid marine snow and sponge cavity because they share a relatively encased niche gram et al 2002 taylor et al 2004 the principle is that a well organized spatial structure facilitates the accumulations of ai molecules and cells for triggering qs cascade gene regulation the hierarchically spatial matrix of sludge flocs was constructed by microbial pellet mp and eps liu et al 2010 2021 eps layer is normally recognized as the cornerstone of sludge matrix structure liu et al 2010 and the layer covering mp is further divided into tightly bound tb loosely bound lb and slime layers in order of outward divergence basuvaraj et al 2015 while fna treated sludge flocs and other biofilm eps decomposition was distinctly observed chislett et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 suggesting the deformation of sludge matrix where qs system worked thus we are inspired to speculate that the dynamically varied qs system over sludge deformation may felicitously elucidate the microbiota acclimatization responding to fna treatment fna induced sludge zoogloea deformation inevitably alters the component and molecular structure of eps layer as the sludge cornerstone that provide the adhesion and adsorption points hu et al 2016 liu et al 2010 then ahl dispersal within sludge may also be affected during fna treatment because eps acts as the diffusion medium and channel of intracellular secretions and exogenous matters in microbiota stacy et al 2014 2016 stewart 2003 xavier and foster 2007 fna induced eps transition potently alters ahls distribution and eventually qs regulation which has not been noticed before furthermore by identifying the metabolisms that are regulated by fluctuated qs owing to ahl redistribution such as biofilm formation protein synthesis and cellular motility laganenka et al 2016 whiteley et al 2017 microbiota acclimatization behaviours responding to fna treatment can be explicated aptly and accurately the aim of this study is to determine the dynamic equilibrium between ahl redistribution and fna induced sludge deformation and further disentangle the influence of qs involved behaviours on fna treatment consequences in order to fulfill the objective the sludge microbiota deformation is endowed with morphology recognition eps component and molecular structure detections during fna treatment meanwhile the dynamic diffusion of ahls through various layer of spatial matrix is characterized along with the sludge deformation which may be firstly conducted to our best knowledge furthermore qs function driven by ahl redistribution is determined by transcriptome analysis then qs involved collective behaviours can be discovered in order to comprehend the microbiota acclimatization responding to fna treatment this work will potently assist the comprehension of qs role in wastewater system 2 material and methods 2 1 fna treating activated sludge the activated sludge was sampled from a long term stable sequencing batch reactor treating artificial domestic sewage in laboratory half liter of sludge at around 4000 mg l of mlvss was repeatedly washed via centrifugation at 10 000 rpm to remove the ions interfering fna concentration the clean precipitate was suspended in 500 ml of fna modified saline solution with 0 95 sodium chloride and 1 26 mg hno2 n l at ph of 6 0 for 20 h as proposed by previous works for establishing partial nitrification and decomposing eps using fna treatment duan et al 2020 lu et al 2021 nan et al 2019 the sludge was sampled at 0 10 and 20 h of fna treatment for further measurement and analysis zoogloea morphology was imaged by scanning electric microscopy sem quattro fei u s 2 2 stepwise ahl extraction and detection the ahl distributions in lb eps tb eps and mp were focused because the pre experiment displayed that few ahls were detected in slime layer and due to the purification of sludge before fna treatment partial soluble eps was also removed in order to precisely measuring ahl concentration in lb and tb eps the release of intracellular ahl from mp during extracting lb and tb eps layers has to be avoided thus we measured the cellular integrity while extracting lb and tb eps layer and gained optimum conditions the cellular integrity was measured via detecting the activity of extracellular β galactosidase using the method stated by tsuji et al 2001 the detailed extraction process was described in supplementary text s1 and fig s1 and the optimal extraction procedure was fixed as the centrifugal purification 10 min of 60 c heat for lb eps 30 min of 70 c heat for tb eps and 60 min of ultrasonic for mp after collecting lb eps tb eps and mp solution ahl molecules were separated from aqueous phase and enriched in organic phase ethyl acetate via liquid phase extraction the organic phase was concentrated to minimum volume with rotary evaporator and the left was dried with nitrogen evaporator the dried ahl extractive was dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile and filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe membrane jinteng china the filtrate was applied to measuring ahl concentration using lc ms ms analysis following the protocol proposed by sun et al 2018 six standard ahls including c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl c12 hsl and 3oc12 hsl were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china and dissolved by acetonitrile for preparing a series of standard solutions the limit of detection which was defined as the concentration that induced a signal to noise ratio of 3 ranged from 1 ng l to 100 ng l detailed results were shown in table s1 the recovery rate was calculated by adding standard substance 100 ng l as depicted by sun et al 2018 and it ranged from 81 2 to 92 5 detailed results were shown in table s1 the average repeatability of six standard ahls which was represented by relative standard deviation was 13 1 ahls were extracted and measured at 0 10 and 20 h of fna treatment respectively 2 3 eps analysis lb and tb eps were extracted according to the procedure established in fig s1 briefly 100 ml of sludge was heat at 60 c for 10 min and after 10 000 rpm of centrifugation the supernatant was tagged as lb eps the precipitate was resuspended again and was heat at 70 c for 30 min after centrifugal separation the supernatant was tagged as tb eps protein pn content was measured by modified bca protein assay kit sangon biotech china polysaccharide ps content was measured by phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard hu et al 2016 liu et al 2010 the fluctuations of organic fluorescence compounds in eps over fna treatment were characterized by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra eps samples were diluted ten times and filtered through a 0 22 µm membrane filter the scanning was conducted using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorophotometer horiba france at excitation wavelengths ex from 200 to 450 nm with 5 nm increments and at emission wavelengths em from 250 to 500 nm with 5 nm increments rayleigh waves were deducted from spectra using rayleigh masking function of fluoressence software the molecular structure information of eps organics was determined using raman spectra eps liquids were scanned using a micro laser confocal raman spectrometer labram hr evolution horiba france with a laser λ 532 nm for excitation 2 4 transcriptome analysis and qs function taxonomy total rnas were extracted from 0 5 g of sludge samples at fna 0 10 and 20 h using the e z n a soil rna midi kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to manufacturer s instructions the purity and quality of total rna was evaluated with nanodrop2000 thermo fisher scientific u s and rna6000 nano chip in an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer respectively qualified rna samples were used to construct cdna library using truseq rna sample prep kit illumina transgenomics sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china raw read quality was controlled by removing low quality reads length 50 bp or with a quality value 20 or having n bases by sickle https github com najoshi sickle the genetic annotation of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg was performed using blastp version 2 2 28 http blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi against kegg database http www genome jp kegg qs involved genes were categorized into nine functions including autoinducer ai regulator decomposer decomposer transportor repressor ai receptor activator effector and unclear 2 5 testify of eps biotic consumption pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 pao1 a heterotrophic bacterium with labile qs function in sludge is selected for testifying the biotic consumption of eps cryopreservation strains were activated and grew in luria bertani lb broth at 30 c for 24 h one milliliter of activated strains was inoculated to 50 ml of extracted and purified eps solution and cultivated under 30 c for 20 h in order to simulating fna induction 50 ml of activated strains was cleaned from lb broth by ultrahigh speed centrifugation then the precipitate was suspended in 50 ml of eps solution with 1 26 mg hno2 n l of fna the change in biodegradability was reflected by the concentration of soluble chemical oxygen demand scod qs quenching qq agent 1 mg l of 2 5h furanone was added at the beginning of cultivation for verifying the role of qs gao et al 2022 the cell density was determined by detecting od600nm value the cultivation without eps addition was regarded as the blank but no obvious growth of pao1 was observed in blank group because of lacking of nutrition 2 6 cellular motility except the secretion of eps the motility can reshape the sludge microbial community the effect of fna perturbation on swimming ability was discussed by analyzing the changes in pao1 motility kim et al 2021 after pao1 activation 50 ml of strain solution was centrifugated and the precipitate was collected and suspended in 50 ml of fna modified saline solution at the 0 5 10 15 and 20 h of fna perturbation 10 µl of solution was sampled and dropped in the center of the motility medium solidified in a petri dish followed by incubation at 35 c for 24 h the cellular motility degree was assessed according to the maximal diameter of bacteria dispersal in plate surface the motility medium containing 1 w v of glucose 0 5 w v of agar 0 5 w v of peptone 0 2 w v of yeast extract and 10 of dmso qq experiment was also conducted to evaluate the role of qs in motility under fna perturbation 2 7 statistical analysis in this study the originpro 2022b was used for plotting and statistical analysis the difference analysis on eps content and ahl distribution was performed by one way anova herein p 0 05 and 0 01 was the evaluation criterion of significant and extremely significant difference respectively raman spectra was modified by baseline correction and curve smoothing 3 results 3 1 fluctuations of sludge morphology and components during fna treatment the continuous fluctuation in sludge spatial matrix was confirmed during fna treatment a typical sludge floc morphology covered by flocculent eps and constrained by filamentous bacteria was observed before fna treatment picture at 0 h of fna as shown in fig 1 a after being subject to fna solution 1 26 mg l fna this structure was destroyed eps layer got thin at the first 10 h and some cells came to appear on the surface undergoing 20 h of treatment partial eps layer disappeared inner mp was unveiled and densely aggregated microbial cells could be imaged clearly eps spatial structure was underpinned by the adhesive and viscoelastic molecules mainly pn and ps which were capable of gluing individual cells together during the matrix building neu et al 2001 in untreated sludge pn and ps contents in tb eps exceeded those in lb eps fig 1b then fna treatment significantly reduced the contents of pn and ps in total eps by 57 4 and 58 3 p 0 05 predominant decrease accounting for 88 3 arose in tb eps layer adjoining pellet rather the lb eps layer that was more accessible to fna solution pn ps ratios in range of 3 to 6 partly indicated the layered structure of sludge microbiota zhang et al 2007 3d eem fluorescence spectra was able to monitor the compositions of fluorescent substance in eps by determining the intensity at specific excitation emission wavelengths guo et al 2014 sun et al 2016 the detected fluorescent substances were normally divided into five types based on the distribution of excitation emission wavelengths in five spectrum regions coble 1996 all five types of fluorescent substances were detected in 3d eem spectra as shown in fig 1d but the intensities of protein like regions i and ii and fa like region iii substances were remarkably high as compared to the soluble microbial by product like compounds region iv and humic like substances region v bhatia et al 2013 dominguez et al 2010 at the beginning of sludge deformation fna 0 h the majority of fluorescent substances was concentrated in tb eps which concurred with the results of pn and ps contents fig 1b an immense reduction of protein like and fa like compounds in tb eps was detected in the first ten hours but the fluorescent compositions of tb eps slightly increased at 20 h on the contrary the fluorescent intensities of regions i ii and iii in lb eps slightly amplified during whole process the information of eps molecular structure was demonstrated in raman spectra fig 1e the assignment of raman peak position was based on reported literatures the band between 464 and 508 cm 1 was attributed to the presence of carbohydrates maquelin et al 2002 the variation ranging from 591 to 619 cm 1 was allocated to s s stretching vibrations of proteins whereas the c o h c c c n stretching were found around 1000 1200 cm 1 chen and lord 1976 wagner et al 2009 the band near 1440 cm 1 was ascribed to c o and coo vibrations in polysaccharide whereas the band near 1582 cm 1 was assigned to the ring stretching of guanine and adenine wagner et al 2009 the peaks around 1250 and 1650 cm 1 were due to the presence of amide iii and i chen and lord 1976 significant differences in raman spectra were marked in fig 1e in pristine sludge more functional groups existed in tb eps compared with lb eps because higher intensity of peaks was found in tb eps during fna treatment obvious reductions of s s c c c o c o and coo intensities were observed over sludge deformation at the end of treatment although the abundances of functional group were similar in lb eps and tb eps tb eps consisted of more carbohydrates and less s s group of proteins in addition the drifted peaks in range of 900 1200 cm 1 during fna treatment may represent the generation of small molecule byproducts from decomposing polymers jiang et al 2022a 3 2 fna induced ahl redistributions ahl molecules in lb eps tb eps and mp were extracted by modified stepwise procedure of ahl extraction six standard ahl types i e c4 hsl c6 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl c12 hsl and 3oc12 hsl were employed to detect because the existence of these ahls in sludge was reported in previous work feng et al 2019 maddela et al 2019 but c6 hsl and 3oc12 hsl molecules were not obtained in indigenous microbial community the results of endogenous ahl concentrations during deformation were shown in fig 2 a c8 hsl is the dominant ahl with 29 43 of total ahl in untreated sludge fig 2b and the ratios of measurable ahl species in total ahl declined in order of c12 hsl c4 hsl and c10 hsl fna treatment was capable of significantly changing the ahl concentration in sludge total ahl concentrations tremendously decreased from 265 ng g vss of fna 0 h to 193 ng g vss of fna 10 h and further reduced to 89 ng g vss of fna 20 h the reductions in c8 hsl c12 hsl c4 hsl and c10 hsl accounted for 40 3 29 2 23 1 and 7 4 of total reduction after 20 h of fna treatment at the initiation of treatment ahls in lb eps accounted for 36 0 of the total ahls and it was higher than the ahls in tb eps and mp fig 2b ahl contents in tb eps were similar with mp because the secretion and recognition of ahls achieved balance in stable qs system williams 2007 with fna treatment prolonging although the fall of ahl concentrations took place in every layer the highest reduction with 72 ng g vss came from lb eps layer after fna 20 h then ahl contents in tb eps and mp exceeded the lb eps at fna 10 h and 20 h which was opposite with the distribution in untreated microbiota fig 2b at the end of treatment mp ahls accounted for 42 7 of total ahl which exceeded the ratio of 25 8 in lb eps thus according to the ahl redistribution result endogenous ahls tended to transfer inward of sludge microbiota while sludge was subject to fna treatment the endogenous ahl concentrations in indigenous microbiota were extremely low according to our results and other reported data feng et al 2019 sun et al 2018 thus many researches have managed to improve wastewater system by boosting qs function via adding exogenous ahls de clippeleir et al 2011 gao et al 2019 hu et al 2016 in order to grappling with the effect of eps structure on exogenous ahl distribution c6 and 3oc12 hsl were selected for exogenous addition test because they were not detected in indigenous microbiota and could avoid the endogenous interference as much as possible two ahls with 1000 μg l were separately added into three sludge samples fna 0 10 and 20 h according to the fna content equation depending on ph and nitrite content the adjustment of ph into 7 00 could decrease the fna content into 0 126 hno2 n l that barely impacted sludge characteristics and microbiota activity duan et al 2020 lu et al 2021 thus the sludge samples subjected to 10 and 20 h of fna treatment were collected by ceasing fna treatment via adjusting ph to neutral after adequately mixing for 2 h they were extracted and detected following proposed stepwise procedure the concentrations of c6 and 3oc12 hsl in lb eps tb eps and mp of three sludge samples were shown in fig 3 a the recovery rates of c6 and 3oc12 hsl were stably around 84 using the stepwise procedure that we suggested in untreated sludge 653 86 μg l of c6 hsl and 752 64 μg l of 3oc12 hsl were found in lb eps but little and even none 3oc12 hsl ahls arrived mp while eps structure was destructed and eps contents reduce more ahls were able to be detected in tb eps and mp as diagramed in fig 3c in the sludge collected from fna 20 h c6 hsl evenly distributed in lb eps tb eps and mp and 3oc12 hsl in lb eps dropped to 452 63 μg l thus c6 hsl with shorter side chain may approach to the mp more easily with eps content reduction the correlation analysis between ahl concentration and eps content revealed that there was no significant impact of eps content on endogenous ahl redistribution but tb eps was capable of markedly dictating the distribution of exogenous addition ahls fig 3b notably based on the results of correlation fitting as shown in fig 3b the influence of tb eps component on 3oc12 hsl distribution outcompeted the influence on c6 hsl 3 3 fna driven expression differences in qs involved behaviours transcriptome analysis confirmed the expression differences of qs subfunctions during fna induced sludge deformation the expression of qs function was unceasingly upregulated by 38 in the whole duration fig 4 a then qs relevant genes were categorized into nine subfunctions including autoinducer ai production regulator decomposer transportor repressor ai receptor activator effector and unclear functions as shown in fig 4b except unclear subfunction the abundance of autoinducer was the highest but it was depressed by fna treatment the abundances of repressor ai receptor activator and effector were lower than 0 003 the transport through membrane and the recognition of ahl were improved by 23 9 and 46 6 respectively the ahl decomposition was also improved by 36 2 thus the depressed ai production and enhanced decomposer properly explicated the constant decrease in ahls shown in fig 2a correlation analysis fig 4c among differentially expressed kegg functions in level three was conducted for pinpointing the cellular behaviours impacted by qs system qs expression positively correlated with the expressions of sulfur metabolism mainly enzyme synthesis no 7 protein export no 14 platinum drug resistance no 25 bacterial chemotaxis no 35 and apoptosis no 37 in a significant degree otherwise biofilm formation no 34 phosphotransferase system no 27 methane no 5 and nitrogen no 6 metabolisms were depressed by fna treatment and showed the opposite expression consequences comparing with qs above results indicated that the microbiota under fna perturbation allocated the energy to stress resistance and resilience metabolisms instead of the inorganic assimilation metabolisms intriguingly the microbiota preferred to escaping from the stress locus which correlated with qs over forming biofilm against fna perturbation besides upregulated protein metabolism that positively correlated with qs mainly facilitated the enzyme synthesis among the 50 enzymes with the highest abundances 25 kinds were upregulated and all hydrolases for hydrolyzing protein ester and atp were located within the upregulation group as shown in fig 4d these hydrolases were capable of accelerating the degradation of polymers in sludge and energy generation bhatt et al 2021 komoszynski and wojtczak 1996 shetty et al 2017 thus qs potentially regulated eps degradation and cellular survival in sludge microbiota subject to fna treatment we thought this hypothesis was pivotal for explaining the qs involved collective behaviours responding to fna treatment and should be verified and discussed deeply 4 discussion our results demonstrated that fna induced transmutation of sludge microbiota mainly the deformation of eps structure determined the distribution of ahls whether they were excreted by indigenous microorganisms or added exogenously which eventually altered qs and qs involved metabolisms similar sludge microbiota transmutation inevitably happens when the sludge undergoes various perturbations such as feeding pattern abiotic stress and strain invasion feng et al 2019 sun et al 2022 xue et al 2021 ya et al 2023 hence the conclusion that spatial structure constructed by eps and mp directs the qs regulation by confining ai distribution may be ubiquitously prevailing in sludge and even other biofilm forms previous works have also suggested the differentially distribution of ahls in biomass and eps of sludge but they were experimented in plainly static stages feng et al 2019 sun et al 2018 our work further subdivided the ahl distribution in sublayers of eps and essentially refined this theory in a dynamic process with sludge microbiota deformation 4 1 causality among zoogloea deformation ahl distribution and qs expression in untreated sludge with typical layered floc structure eps can store more ahls comparing with mp as shown in fig 2b which was identical with the result from feng et al 2019 the extra ahl in eps may be ascribed to the secretion from planktonic cells subsequently owing to fna treatment sludge microbiota began to change in terms of eps content and molecular structure combining sem image fig 1a and eps content analysis fig 1b the unseen eps did not just drop and relocate to anywhere but was degraded we also noticed that the eps degradation largely took place in tb eps which was in agreement with distinct intensity reduction in raman spectra of tb eps fig 1d the more distinct reduction in tb eps was attributed to the decomposition and utilization of tb eps by aggregated cells which was discussed detailedly in section 4 2 former investigations mainly thought that eps degradation was attributed to the oxidation reaction caused by rnss chislett et al 2022 duan et al 2020 but our results suggested that under fna treatment a biotic process that cellular synthesis of hydrolases was amplified fig 4d may contribute to facilitating eps degradation and structure transformation particularly endopeptidase extracellular elastinolytic metalloproteinase esterase and serine endopeptidases were capable of efficiently decomposing pn ps and fa bhatt et al 2021 shetty et al 2017 this discovery may expand the mechanism of fna treatment on sludge to spontaneous cell behavior except chemical reaction during above depicted process concomitant redistribution of endogenous ahls was monitored in microbiota two distinct characteristics of ahl content changing were summarized firstly ahls transferred inward of the sludge microbiota resulting higher ahl content in mp than that in lb eps and tb eps thus the ahl distribution in microbiota through fna treatment was the opposite of that in untreated one the reservation of ahls in eps layer was assumed to depend on the abundant adsorb sites likely cooh and c oh islam et al 2020 siddharth et al 2021 with the dramatically reduction in eps the adsorb sites were accordingly damaged and then eps bonded ahls were released consequently microbes in mp were able to constantly access and utilize more ahls from eps which may explain the enhanced qs metabolism fig 4a this phenomenon implied that the change in microbiota structure caused the redistribution of endogenous ahl in other words it altered the route from ahl secreting individual to receiving individual this finding provided a definitely positive answer to whether ahl transfer within spatial matrix of microbiota altered qs expression furthermore it suggested the influence between eps and ahl was mutual rather than directed one way that ahls affected eps secretion as reported mukherjee and bossier 2019 papenfort and bassler 2016 it shall be worth noting that qs regulation relying on endogenous ahls may be inefficient for improving sludge activity due to the extremely low concentration of endogenous ahl then recent studies have conducted the exogenous addition of ahls into sludge for improving nitrogen removal performance de clippeleir et al 2011 hu et al 2016 tang et al 2018 correspondingly we testified the influence of microbiota structure on the distribution of exogenously added ahls our results indicated that eps layer can capture ahl molecules because most of exogenous ahls were blocked within lb eps and tb eps fig 3a and with eps reduction more ahls reached mp hence the quantity of exogenous ahl molecules that actually participated in qs system may be much lower than the added quantity the waste of ahl was seemingly inevitable in such application based on the correlation analysis tb eps locating in the middle of lb eps and mp significantly determined the exogenous ahl dispersal in microbiota for example the substantial decrease in tb eps component may lessen the obstruction of exogenous ahls from lb eps to mp however there was no significant correlation between endogenous ahls and eps because the fate of endogenous ahls was also impacted by other potential processes for instance its production transportation recognition and decomposition whiteley et al 2017 williams 2007 the second characteristic was the obvious reduction in ahl contents after fna treatment and this reduction was basically irrelevant with fna solution because the fna solution with same condition barely changed the ahl content in batch experiment that we pretested the reduction was ascribed to two reasons depressed synthesis and enhanced consumption as shown in fig 4b ahl production was depressed because in an oligotrophic environment nutrition has been wash out before fna treatment microbes may not have extra material and energy to producing more ahls the public good mukherjee and bossier 2019 but due to the inward transfer of eps ahls mp microbes can constantly receive ahls and upregulate qs function which was verified by the enhanced expression of transportor receptor and effector of ahls we therefore proposed the theory that fna induced transformation of sludge microbiota impacted qs function via redistributing ahls and this theory may be ubiquitous in various biofilms 4 2 qs behaviours responding to fna treatment upregulated qs function deriving from ahl redistribution potentially regulated other metabolisms with an emphasis on cellular motility and eps degradation as concluded from transcriptome analysis cellular motility the spontaneous movement of a cell translocating by consumption of energy scarinci and sourjik 2022 was elevated after fna induction according to the upregulations of chemotaxis and flagellar assembly fig 4a it potently altered the microbiota structure and was under the control of qs system laganenka et al 2016 papenfort and bassler 2016 transcriptome result also implied the significant positive relationship between chemotaxis and qs during fna treatment in order to empirically verifying the enhancement of fna on cellular motility swarming ability test was conducted using pao1 as model strain with flagella and pili structure kim et al 2021 coincidentally pao1 was also the most abundant qs function strain in our sludge as shown in fig s2 fig 5 a demonstrated that fna induction elongated the swarming distances of pao1 in disk but the elongation was nonlinear with fna time and it peaked at 10 h of fna when the distance extended by 68 3 the enhanced motility of sludge cells was mainly ascribed to the encouraged pili assembly pila and methylation chev chea and mcp fig 5a harvey et al 2018 karatan et al 2001 in the terms of cellular machinery the spiral rotation of flagella also powered the pao1 motility the motor motb a pivotal unit for generating flagella rotating energy by pumping proton out tan et al 2021 was spurred by fna induction because pumping proton out may moderate the intracellular acidity and fna content however the upregulation of negative regulator of flagellin synthesis coded by flgm indicated that sludge microbes no longer preferred to assembling new flagella during fna treatment thus the enhanced motility may mainly happen in the individual who already has complete flagella structure after quenching qs activity by adding qs inhibitor pao1 group failed to implement the strategic motility for adapting fna induction since the swarming distance continuously decreased with fna treating time fig 5a more importantly defective qs system was fatal for the survival of microbes coerced by fna without any colony growing in disk after fna treatment eventually cell translocation movement under the qs regulation can voluntarily break sludge microbiota structure as shown in fig 1a but why did the cells prefer to escape instead of forming biofilm after all it has been widely reported that bacteria within the biofilm possess stronger resistance against multiple abiotic and biotic stresses than the planktonic ones gedefie et al 2021 yao et al 2022 similar phenomenon was also reported in phosphate limited aquatic environment where the motility of v cholerae was activated but the biofilm is depressed with the regulation of phobr belonging to qs system jahid et al 2006 what should be highlighted was that both motility and biofilm were critically controlled by qs system feng et al 2021 proved that exogenous ahl addition speeded up the locomotion of planktonic cells to attachment surface thus shortening biofilm formation process biofilm formation actually an altruistic behaviour for participators xavier and foster 2007 may compromise the energy for maintaining self fitness against fna stress hence we thought the cells may initially adopt the motility strategy for escaping stress locus and foraging and then try to form biofilm in other place with mild stress and adequate nutrition but under the coordinated stress of oligotrophic condition and fna cytotoxicity biofilm was always inhibited future work should further figure out how qs system weighs and chooses which strategy is favorable for microbial survival qs function and abovementioned metabolisms contributing to the resistance against fna stress such as motility apoptosis and efflux pump demanded the energy consumption scarinci and sourjik 2022 the autotrophic capacity was impaired by fna since the severe inactivation of nitrogen and methane metabolisms fig 4a but the heterotrophic capacity was not completely inhibited by fna because several heterotrophic microbes with qs function reproduced during fna treatment as shown in fig s2 the latter was unexpected because sludge microbiota was featured with nutritional deprivation from sludge washing before fna treatment as described in experiment section another occurrence implying the energy production was that theoretically motility should be deteriorated during starvation jiang et al 2022b but the empirical result was the opposite previous works have corroborated that heterotrophic bacteria can urgently utilize eps for cellular activities in oligotrophic environment zhang and bishop 2003 thus vanished eps may be consumed as nutrition and this can plausibly explain the augmented synthesis of hydrolases we managed to ascertain this hypothesis by viably cultivating pao1 in medium with eps which was extracted from untreated sludge as sole nutrition source when there was no fna stress fig 5b pao1 multiplied linearly till 6 h it was worth noting that bacterial flocs were formed with the interference of eps after 12 h when planktonic cell density was high enough at the beginning of fna stress exposure fig 5c pao1 density decreased but owing to the eps decomposition it rose again after 8 h with the generation of scod representing the biodegradable substance in sludge guo et al 2014 this appropriately interpreted that eps reduction mainly took place in tb eps layer adjacent to microbe enriched pellet rather than in lb eps layer fig 1b and d fna enhanced sludge biodegradability has already been reported and rns oxidation capacity was thought to be the predominant explanation on eps degradation chislett et al 2022 wei et al 2018 our work further proved the nonnegligible role of biotic activity in eps degradation while the qs was inhibited pao1 density dramatically declined and less scod was generated combining this test eps variation and transcriptome analysis we concluded that in order to moderate starvation and fna qs system can accelerate hydrolase synthesis and then refractory eps was degraded to biodegradable substances as emergent nutrition during the whole course of pao1 growth in eps under fna stress no biofilm was formed no matter with active qs or not which was concert with our conclusion that fna depressed the biofilm formation in conclusion we have demonstrated how fna induced sludge microbiota structure transition impacts ahl redistribution within microbial consortium triggering the differentially expression of qs and qs involved metabolisms mainly eps consumption and motility as recapped in fig 6 in turn these metabolisms were capable of modifying microbiota structure biotic consumption on eps which can be promoted by hydrolase synthesis impacted the microbiota structure from three aspects providing emergent nutrition to heterotrophic bacteria for energy depended metabolisms motivating ahl redistribution due to adsorption site reduction and lessening the restraint on cellular motility because of thinner eps layer microbiota tended to translocate from stress spot instead of forming biofilm with the interference of qs system by coincidence during translocation flagellar rotation accompanied with proton efflux thus mitigating intracellular acidity and fna content fna treatment in wastewater system was mainly used to establish partial nitrification and improve methane production but both nitrogen and methane metabolisms were depressed and countered with qs function during treatment it implied that fna induced partial nitrification establishment and methane improvement did not happen with fna treatment but with the consequences of fna treatment we believed this result will benefit to mending the procedure of fna treatment in wastewater management 5 conclusions this study successfully disentangled the role of intricate qs regulation in fna treatment on sludge by combining dynamic ahl distribution over zoogloea deformation and variation in qs subfunction expression this conclusion revealed that besides ahl secretion and reception qs regulation was also modified by ahl dispersal within microbial consortium constructed by eps and aggregated cells two qs involved microbiota acclimatization behaviours recognized as eps biotic consumption and cellular motility undertook fna treatment consequences that included sludge mass reduction and flocs disintegration above inspiring conclusions will facilitate the research on qs role in the fluctuated

active floodplain the mobile colloids are multi phase assemblages consisting of si coated ferrihydrite nanoparticles and fe ii om complexes ferrihydrite nanoparticles persisted under both oxic and anoxic conditions which we attribute to passivation by si and om these findings suggest that mobile fe rich colloids generated in floodplains can persist during transport through redox variable soils

stream studies suggest that fe om colloids originating in soils are important sources of riverine fe olshansky et al 2018 indicating that soil stream interfaces are important loci of watershed fe export yet our ability to model colloid chemistry and transport across terrestrial aquatic interfaces is poor due to a dearth of information on mobile colloid phase identity and stability in natural aquatic systems fe is relatively abundant in floodplains where spatially temporally alternating soil redox conditions are favorable to the formation of nano scale fe oxides and sulfides pokrovsky and schott 2002 olshansky et al 2018 liao et al 2016 he et al 2019 noël et al 2020 these nanophases undergo rapid reductive or oxidative dissolution for them to transport across floodplains and stream water i e across oxic and anoxic environments continuous localized formation or dissolution of these nanophases must co occur or they need to be chemically kinetically stabilized against redox driven

thompson et al 2006 laboratory based studies have found that the transformation of ferrihydrite to fes depends on the s ii to fe molar ratio as well as on the presence and functional group content of om noël et al 2020 thomasarrigo et al 2019 whereas transformation of ferrihydrite to crystalline fe oxyhydroxides is dependent on fe ii fe iii aqueous molar ratio and the type of inorganic ligands in

kaegi et al 2010 lapworth et al 2013 moens et al 2021 stolpe et al 2013 although the influence of sio4 4 loading on transformations of ferrihydrite triggered by fe ii has remained controversial as both strong and minimal effects have been reported schulz et al 2022 jones et al 2009 kukkadapu et al 2004 the majority of studies on fe nanophases have been performed using either laboratory synthesized colloids liao et al 2020 liao et al 2017 li et al 2019 or fines extracted from soils sediments rod et al 2020 xia et al 2018 thus they are not necessarily representative of mobile groundwater colloids which are expected to exhibit pronounced compositional complexity our objective here was to isolate naturally occurring mobile fe rich colloids from soil water and characterize them at nano and molecular scale detail to understand their persistence and impacts on fe and nutrient transport soil water samples were collected from riparian anoxic zones of a redox active floodplain that is proximal to the slate river crested butte co usa across the hydrological transition from snowmelt to baseflow conditions this system serves as a model for the numerous similar

comprehensive approach identified mobile ferrihydrite based nanoparticles in reducing waters the colloids were identified as multi phase nanoparticles comprised of ferrihydrite coated by si and om that is further associated with fe ii and fe iii the stability of the ferrihydrite phase is attributed to the passivating effect of the si coating and om matrix that ultimately encapsulate the ferrihydrite nanoparticles the colloids exhibited a seasonally variable composition with a lower contribution of fe ii under more oxic baseflow conditions this study provides novel insights of the nanoscale structure and composition of natural fe rich colloids with implications for om and essential element as well as contaminant transport in watersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

pca analysis no of significant components and results from the tem and mössbauer analyses plausible components lc ls fits were performed using the athena software linear coefficients were constrained to be only positive the accuracy of this fitting procedure ranges between 25 and 5 of the stated values for each individual contribution and the detection limit for minor species is estimated to be 10 ostergren et al 1999 cancès et al 2005 additionally the fe k edge exafs spectra were analyzed by shell by shell fitting using the artemis software with feff code 6 ankudinov and ravel 1998 backscattering phase and amplitude functions were calculated using the feff6 program for fe iii c fe ii c fe iii o fe ii o fe iii s fe ii s fe iii fe iii fe iii fe ii and fe ii fe ii pairs the fixed amplitude reduction factor s02 was fixed at 0 83 for all samples liu and hesterberg 2011 fits were performed in r space over a 1 4 å range and all paths are single scattering only interatomic distances with acceptable uncertainty values were used in the final fit the quality of the lc ls and shell by shell fits was estimated by an r factor parameter rf of the following form rf σ k3χexp k3χfit 2 σ k3χexp 2 2 7 additional characterization nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims was employed to visualize the elemental distribution of stable isotopes in a representative colloid sample in brief colloids were deposited on a cu grid and dried after which sem was used to locate the colloids prior to the nanosims analysis in addition asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation combined with uv multiangle light scattering and differential refractive index detection af4 uv mals dri was used to characterize the colloids with respect to root mean square radius rrms hydrodynamic radius rh and shape factor rrms rh distributions trostle et al 2016 a detailed description of the nanosims and af4 analyses are presented in the supporting information pages s9 10 and s14 3 results 3 1 colloid abundance size and nanoscale elemental distributions colloids collected during snowmelt high river stage saturated soils may june referred to as snowmelt colloids were measured using a comprehensive suite of methods table s1 colloids collected under baseflow drought conditions late july referred to as baseflow colloids were measured with exafs common to both time points and mössbauer spectroscopy here we summarize our findings in a method by method order fe colloid concentrations 0 02 μm fraction as well as the distribution of fe ii and fe iii within the colloids varied substantially from may to july of 2021 table s2 despite comparable total aqueous fe concentrations 0 22 µm fe rich colloid concentrations peaked during snowmelt late may through mid june and then decreased as baseflow conditions were reached in july fe ii in the colloidal fraction followed a similar trend with a large drop in july 11 of total fe as compared to may 39 colloidal fe ii concentrations were inversely related to dissolved oxygen levels in july table s2 which rose from an average of 0 08 mg l 1 in june to 0 35 mg l 1 in july approx 0 9 and 3 9 of o2 saturation as soils drained during seasonal summer drying dewey et al 2021 cryo tem imaging of the snowmelt colloids revealed spherical particles ranging in size from approximately 10 to 100 nm fig 1 these included mono dispersed spheres as well as elongated assemblages of spheroids the fact that the colloidal nano spheres withstood radiation damage testing is consistent with a dominantly inorganic composition of the colloids fig s1 af4 analysis also indicated a heterogeneous particle size distribution with a root mean square radius rrms in the 10 to 200 nm range fig s2 furthermore the ratio of root mean square radius to the hydrodynamic radius rrms rh commonly known as the shape factor ranged from approximately 0 4 to 1 2 further supporting cryo tem imaging results showing the presences of spherical particles and spheroid assemblages of varying shapes trostle et al 2016 tem and sem eds elemental mapping of the snowmelt colloids figs 2 and s3 identified fe 13 3 atom o 42 8 c 36 4 and si 6 7 as the primary constituents smaller contributions from ca 0 38 al 0 31 and s 0 03 were also present calculated solid phase molar ratios were o fe 11 3 c fe 12 8 and si fe 1 0 these results are consistent with a mixture of fe oxide minerals and om aluminosilicates appear to be absent based on the large disparity in abundance between si al 20 1 rather the equimolar ratio of fe and si suggests that si is adsorbed on as monomers or polymers or coprecipitated in the colloids moreover the elemental map overlay of fe si and c fig 2 suggests that the fe particles are coated by si and embedded in an om si matrix adusei gyamfi et al 2019 nano sims analysis confirmed the co occurrence of fe o si c n and s figs s4 5 co location of fe and o supports the presence of an fe oxide mineral and co locality of c and n implies contribution from n rich om e g proteins and nucleic acids fig s4 some domains within examined samples exhibited spatial association between fe and low abundance s fig s5 suggesting that fe s interactions may be present at low abundance more details in supporting information page s14 3 2 colloid phase identity tem selected area electron diffraction saed analysis fig 2 of snowmelt colloid samples shows two weak diffraction rings corresponding to d spacing values of 0 146 and 0 251 nm that are consistent with a poorly crystalline 2 line ferrihydrite janney et al 2000 dardenne et al 2002 mössbauer spectroscopy of a baseflow colloid sample confirmed a best fit with two ferrihydrite phases containing different om si ratios chen et al 2015 eusterhues et al 2008 murad and cashion 2004 goethite hematite magnetite lepidocrocite and fes were not detected table s3 figs 3 and s6 these findings support our deductions from the tem and nanosims analyses that the ferrihydrite nanoparticles are associated with an om si matrix or coating the molecular structure around fe in the colloids was further characterized using fe k edge exafs fig 4 snowmelt and baseflow colloid samples were selected for additional analyses including lc ls fitting table s4 figs s7 8 and shell by shell fitting fig 4 table s5 both samples contained a mixture of fe ii and fe iii as demonstrated in the derivative fe k edge xanes spectra fig 4 yet the snowmelt colloid 0 02 0 22 µm sample had a higher absolute fe ii content whereas the baseflow colloid sample had a higher fe iii content in accordance with measured bulk fe ii and fe iii colloid concentrations table s2 exafs spectra from the baseflow colloids visibly resemble the spectra of ferrihydrite fig 4 middle and bottom panels linear combination least squares lc ls fitting was employed to identify major fe phases present and to compare contrast the baseflow and snowmelt colloids we found that four distinct model spectra were required for acceptable fits ferrihydrite ferrihydrite coated with om and complexes of fe ii and fe iii with om table s4 figs s7 8 superiority of ferrihydrite is illustrated in the fourier transform fig 4 with first and second neighbor peaks at 1 5 and 2 7 å respectively fit to the snowmelt colloids was poorer at 8 å 1 indicating that none of the reference compounds table s6 provide a perfect match to the natural samples as expected nevertheless these results clearly support the conclusion that multiple fe bearing species are present and moreover that both ferrihydrite and fe om complexes are present in the colloidal assemblages ferrihydrite increased in relative abundance from 21 snowmelt to 43 baseflow of total fe species as the hydrological site conditions changed from wet to dry table s4 the relative abundance of fe ii om complexes changed in the opposite direction dropping from 36 to 11 of total fe over this same time frame the snowmelt colloids are evidently more reduced e g higher relative abundance of fe ii than the baseflow colloids these observations demonstrate a variable composition of the colloid assemblages in response to changing aqueous chemical and hydrological conditions 3 3 quantitative molecular structure around fe shell by shell fitting of the fe exafs spectra was performed to quantify the molecular environment around fe in the colloid assemblages fig 4 as well as to supplement the results of the lc ls fitting particularly of the snowmelt colloids in all samples the fits indicated fe o distances of 1 95 and 2 08 å and fe fe distances of 3 07 å which are typical for fe oxyhydroxide minerals such as ferrihydrite table s5 fe ii or fe iii coordinated to organic compounds e g through carboxylate or phenolic functional groups yu et al 2015 daugherty et al 2017 may also be present fits were attempted with c neighbors being present at ca 2 8 å which would indicate bidentate coordination of fe by carboxylate groups this shell improved the fits substantially but the fitted parameters had relatively high uncertainty likely due to the presence of c neighbors at multiple distances and overlap with the exafs from fe neighbors and are not included in the presented fits a second fe fe pair distinguished by a 2 87 å interatomic distance table s5 fig s9 may be attributed to a tetrahedral fe ii coordination environment skomurski et al 2010 s neighbors at 2 27 å which were essential to fit the snowmelt exafs fig s9 are characteristic of fe s bond distances in sulfides yet neither fes or fes2 were detected in fe exafs lc ls table s4 or mössbauer analyses fig 3 therefore we infer that s is a minor constituent of ferrihydrite likely a result of superficial sulfidation the presence of s ii and fe ii in the snowmelt colloids is consistent with the conclusion above that they are more chemically reduced compared to the baseflow colloids 4 discussion 4 1 molecular structure and mechanisms of persistence of fe based colloids ferrihydrite is a widespread fe oxyhydroxide schwertmann and taylor 1989 in soils sediments rivers and lakes kennedy et al 2004 jambor and dutrizac 1998 its abundance may be attributed to its rapid precipitation kinetics it is usually the first solid fe oxyhydroxide phase to form upon oxidation of dissolved ferrous iron guo and barnard 2013 individual ferrihydrite particles are typically several nm in size aggregated schwertmann and taylor 1989 and reactive readily transforming into other fe oxyhydroxides thomasarrigo et al 2019 schwertmann and taylor 1989 few reports exist on stable colloidal ferrihydrite particles in natural settings particularly under reducing sulfidic conditions homoky et al 2021 gomez gonzalez et al 2016 in this study we found that despite anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen 0 08 mg l 1 and the presence of dissolved fe ii a significant portion of the colloidal fe occurred in its oxidized form as ferrihydrite as supported by saed fig 2 mössbauer fig 3 and fe exafs measurements fig 4 table s4 s5 fig s7 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to identify natural mobile ferrihydrite based colloids that persist in anoxic waters the roles that colloids play in biogeochemical cycling and in the regulation of nutrient contaminant and om availability and transport depend on the structures and compositions of the phases that co occur in the colloids and on how they behave in ensemble in this study ferrihydrite is coated with si and om and the ferrihydrite cores appear to be intimately associated with organic matter complexed to fe ii fe iii adsorption or coprecipitation of si and om are evident moreover despite excess aqueous fe ii at our sampling depth table s2 no fe ii catalyzed transformation of our ferrihydrite based colloids to secondary minerals such as goethite magnetite and lepidocrocite qafoku et al 2020 hansel et al 2005 cornell and giovanoli 1985 schwertmann and taylor 1989 was observed figs 3 and s6 the presence of coatings is significant because they are expected to kinetically or chemically stabilize the underlying nano sized 30 nm ferrihydrite particles previous studies have reported that ferrihydrite transformation is inhibited in the presence of organic inorganic compounds and sio4 4 kaegi et al 2010 giannetta et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 as well as po4 3 kraal et al 2022 in the case of si reductive transformation of si ferrihydrite coprecipitates was significantly retarded at solid phase si fe molar ratios above 0 18 schulz et al 2022 kaegi et al 2010 cismasu et al 2013 similarly for organic compounds c fe molar ratios above 1 6 have been reported to completely inhibit abiotic om ferrihydrite coprecipitate transformation chen et al 2015 though a different study found that ratios above 1 8 can enhance the biotic transformation pathway shimizu et al 2013 in comparison we observed high relative molar ratios of c fe 12 8 and si fe 1 0 jones et al 2009 this implies organic molecules of comparable size are associated with the ferrihydrite nanoparticles that are either coprecipitated and or adsorbed yang et al 2017 the superior c fe ratios of our natural colloids compared to laboratory synthesized analogues c fe 2 5 provide an explanation for the stability of these natural colloids against reductive transformation factors that favor delay inhibition of transformation likely include 1 high om si loading and resulting coverage of the ferrihydrite surface schulz et al 2022 giannetta et al 2020 cismasu et al 2013 thomasarrigo et al 2018 2 the presence of om fe ii complexes in solution which can bond and stabilize ferrihydrite pédrot et al 2011 and 3 surface organic functional groups particularly the extent and type of associated ligands zhou et al 2018 for the latter carboxylic acids play a key role in ferrihydrite transformation with the number of bound versus free carboxyl groups regulating surface reactivity thomasarrigo et al 2019 ultimately in this study we ascribe colloid persistence under anoxic reducing conditions to the passivating effect conferred by om and si coatings though no fe ii catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite was observed our results do reveal that fe ii is part of the colloidal assemblage likely as fe ii complexed by the om matrix as inferred from the fe exafs lc ls fitting and or embedded in the ferrihydrite structure as inferred from the fe exafs shell by shell fitting previous studies on the biotransformation of ferrihydrite have reported an intermediate fe ii enriched ferrihydrite in which fe ii is incorporated into the mineral structure with minimal phase change zachara et al 2007 thus we conclude that ferrihydrite based colloids in this study are coated by si or encapsulated in an om matrix that inhibits redox triggered transformations under conditions where pristine ferrihydrite would not prevail ferrihydrite om si associations in the colloids may serve a dual purpose which extends their passivating properties to offer protection against om degradation this can be attributed to the strong om mineral interaction and or to the formation of inaccessible om domains mikutta et al 2006 eusterhues et al 2014 baldock and skjemstad 2000 the incorporation of si as part of the om si matrix may offer enhanced protection against biological attack tamrat et al 2019 because om is a dominant component of the colloids their role in om preservation as well as om transport is expected to be important 4 2 watershed scale implications of fe based colloid persistence the dissolved fe pool i e fe that passes through a 0 45 µm membrane in ground and surface water investigations has long been recognized to contain a mixture of soluble fe ii and om complexed and colloidal fe perdue et al 1976 koenings 1976 the colloidal contribution varies substantially in terrestrial and aquatic systems bulk fe colloids of unknown phase identity and composition contributed between 17 and 99 of the total fe in porewaters of marine sediments 20 200 nm sized colloids homoky et al 2021 and between 30 and 50 in porewaters of peat soils 10 kda sized colloids pokrovsky et al 2005 in this study between 48 and 72 of the porewater fe at 180 cm depth was present as colloidal ferrihydrite nanoparticles 20 220 nm table s2 the presence of variable redox zones along groundwater flow paths is generally thought to be a barrier to advective transport of redox sensitive fe minerals such as ferrihydrite which undergo rapid reductive oxidative dissolution or precipitation partitioning to solid phase when appearing as compositionally pure materials adhikari et al 2019 noël et al 2017 however while fe transport could in principle occur through a series of colloid precipitation and dissolution steps along the groundwater flowpath i e as redox transitions occur this study suggests that a different mechanism previals rather we show that mobile ferrihydrite based colloids persist in anoxic soil water which implies that they can be transported through reduced zones containing abundant dissolved fe ii and discharged into surface waters given the considerable colloidal mass up to 30 mg l 1 fe colloids in slate river floodplain soil water especially during snowmelt table s2 it is reasonable to conclude that colloid borne fe and om may contribute significantly to element loading in slate river where the concentration of fe is 10 100 µg l 1 this conclusion emphasizes the need to improve colloid process representations flury and qiu 2008 johnson et al 1996 in watershed reactive transport models steefel et al 2015 4 3 seasonal variability of fe based colloid composition our colloids demonstrated seasonal compositional variability i e the baseflow colloids were more oxidized compared to the snowmelt colloids tables s4 5 and figs 3 4 and s7 lc ls fitting of the fe exafs spectra showed that the contribution of ferrihydrite to the colloidal assemblage was 41 during snowmelt which increased to 60 under baseflow conditions in comparison the fraction of fe ii decreased from 36 to 11 following the spring snowmelt in apparent response to intrusion of dissolved oxygen in july table s2 and s4 oxidation of fe ii is likely a primary driving force for the compositional variations witnessed in the baseflow colloids thus the decrease in om and fe ii in colloids collected under baseflow conditions can be attributed to decreasing abundance of fe ii om complexes this conclusion is consistent with previous riverine observations on the transport of fe as om associated colloids from soils during spring snowmelt olshansky et al 2018 thus it appears that seasonal hydrological events such as rainfall flooding and snowmelt can play important roles in regulating colloid concentrations and composition in floodplains 5 conclusions these findings confirm the presence of mobile ferrihydrite based om associated colloids in anoxic groundwater of a montane riparian floodplain we provide direct observational evidence in support of the riverine based work of olshansky 2018 which concluded that soil derived fe om colloids were important sources of fe loading in mountain streams the fact that fe ii and s are incorporated in a ferrihydrite based colloidal assemblage under anoxic conditions with excess dissolved fe ii implies that fe iii in ferrihydrite is passivated against reductive dissolution this stability is attributed to the presence of si and om coatings the persistence of these nominally redox active colloids under both anoxic and oxic

14792,fe rich mobile colloids play vital yet poorly understood roles in the biogeochemical cycling of fe in groundwater by influencing organic matter om preservation and fluxes of fe om and other essential micro nutrients yet few studies have provided molecular detail on the structures and compositions of fe rich mobile colloids and factors controlling their persistence in natural groundwater here we provide comprehensive new information on the sizes molecular structures and compositions of fe rich mobile colloids that accounted for up to 72 of aqueous fe in anoxic groundwater from a redox active floodplain the mobile colloids are multi phase assemblages consisting of si coated ferrihydrite nanoparticles and fe ii om complexes ferrihydrite nanoparticles persisted under both oxic and anoxic conditions which we attribute to passivation by si and om these findings suggest that mobile fe rich colloids generated in floodplains can persist during transport through redox variable soils and could be discharged to surface waters these results shed new light on their potential to transport fe om and nutrients across terrestrial aquatic interfaces graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe mineral oxidation reduction electron microscopy exafs mössbauer spectroscopy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fe rich mobile colloids are believed to play vital roles in micro nutrient biogeochemical cycling in natural waters boye et al 2010 homoky et al 2021 because they strongly adsorb and transport organic matter om and moderate the bioavailability of p fe mn and other metals liao et al 2020 thompson et al 2006 yan et al 2016 löv et al 2018 henderson et al 2012 liao et al 2017 pokrovsky and schott 2002 mylon et al 2004 recent in stream studies suggest that fe om colloids originating in soils are important sources of riverine fe olshansky et al 2018 indicating that soil stream interfaces are important loci of watershed fe export yet our ability to model colloid chemistry and transport across terrestrial aquatic interfaces is poor due to a dearth of information on mobile colloid phase identity and stability in natural aquatic systems fe is relatively abundant in floodplains where spatially temporally alternating soil redox conditions are favorable to the formation of nano scale fe oxides and sulfides pokrovsky and schott 2002 olshansky et al 2018 liao et al 2016 he et al 2019 noël et al 2020 these nanophases undergo rapid reductive or oxidative dissolution for them to transport across floodplains and stream water i e across oxic and anoxic environments continuous localized formation or dissolution of these nanophases must co occur or they need to be chemically kinetically stabilized against redox driven dissolution complexation or co precipitation of fe nanominerals with om noël et al 2020 thomasarrigo et al 2020 sharma et al 2010 or with dissolved cations anions can significantly alter these dynamics by stabilizing the nanophase schulz et al 2022 kaegi et al 2010 the role of organic and inorganic impurities in fe colloid structure and composition is key to understanding colloid mobility and persistence groundwater mixing at subsurface interfaces promotes contact between oxic and reducing often sulfidic soil porewaters that can generate either ferrihydrite and or fes colloids noël et al 2020 jakobsen and postma 1999 hassellöv and von der kammer 2008 as well as fe mineral transformation products such as lepidocrocite goethite and magnetite schulz et al 2022 qafoku et al 2020 thompson et al 2006 laboratory based studies have found that the transformation of ferrihydrite to fes depends on the s ii to fe molar ratio as well as on the presence and functional group content of om noël et al 2020 thomasarrigo et al 2019 whereas transformation of ferrihydrite to crystalline fe oxyhydroxides is dependent on fe ii fe iii aqueous molar ratio and the type of inorganic ligands in solution cl so4 2 co3 2 qafoku et al 2020 hansel et al 2005 cornell and giovanoli 1985 in contrast om coatings have been shown to prolong the stability of ferrihydrite colloid nanoparticles in solution noël et al 2020 thomasarrigo et al 2020 sharma et al 2010 the presence of strongly adsorbed ions such as sio4 4 po4 3 and even ca2 can also moderate the chemical stability of fe colloids kaegi et al 2010 lapworth et al 2013 moens et al 2021 stolpe et al 2013 although the influence of sio4 4 loading on transformations of ferrihydrite triggered by fe ii has remained controversial as both strong and minimal effects have been reported schulz et al 2022 jones et al 2009 kukkadapu et al 2004 the majority of studies on fe nanophases have been performed using either laboratory synthesized colloids liao et al 2020 liao et al 2017 li et al 2019 or fines extracted from soils sediments rod et al 2020 xia et al 2018 thus they are not necessarily representative of mobile groundwater colloids which are expected to exhibit pronounced compositional complexity our objective here was to isolate naturally occurring mobile fe rich colloids from soil water and characterize them at nano and molecular scale detail to understand their persistence and impacts on fe and nutrient transport soil water samples were collected from riparian anoxic zones of a redox active floodplain that is proximal to the slate river crested butte co usa across the hydrological transition from snowmelt to baseflow conditions this system serves as a model for the numerous similar gravel bed river floodplain systems in the rocky mountains and other alpine environments across the globe a suite of advanced methodologies was utilized to characterize mobile colloids collected during snowmelt including cascade filtration asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs mössbauer spectroscopy nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims cryo transmission electron microscopy cryo tem and transmission and scanning electron microscopies tem sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds this comprehensive approach identified mobile ferrihydrite based nanoparticles in reducing waters the colloids were identified as multi phase nanoparticles comprised of ferrihydrite coated by si and om that is further associated with fe ii and fe iii the stability of the ferrihydrite phase is attributed to the passivating effect of the si coating and om matrix that ultimately encapsulate the ferrihydrite nanoparticles the colloids exhibited a seasonally variable composition with a lower contribution of fe ii under more oxic baseflow conditions this study provides novel insights of the nanoscale structure and composition of natural fe rich colloids with implications for om and essential element as well as contaminant transport in watersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

backscattering phase and amplitude functions were calculated using the feff6 program for fe iii c fe ii c fe iii o fe ii o fe iii s fe ii s fe iii fe iii fe iii fe ii and fe ii fe ii pairs the fixed amplitude reduction factor s02 was fixed at 0 83 for all samples liu and hesterberg 2011 fits were performed in r space over a 1 4 å range and all paths are single scattering only interatomic distances with acceptable uncertainty values were used in the final fit the quality of the lc ls and shell by shell fits was estimated by an r factor parameter rf of the following form rf σ k3χexp k3χfit 2 σ k3χexp 2 2 7 additional characterization nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims was employed to visualize the elemental distribution of stable isotopes in a representative colloid sample in brief colloids were deposited on a cu grid and dried after which sem was used to locate the colloids prior to the nanosims analysis in addition asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation combined with uv multiangle light scattering and differential refractive index detection af4 uv mals dri was used to characterize the colloids with respect to root mean square radius rrms hydrodynamic radius rh and shape factor rrms rh distributions trostle et al 2016 a detailed description of the nanosims and af4 analyses are presented in the supporting information pages s9 10 and s14 3 results 3 1 colloid abundance size and nanoscale elemental distributions colloids collected during snowmelt high river stage saturated soils may june referred to as snowmelt colloids were measured using a comprehensive suite of methods table s1 colloids collected under baseflow drought conditions late july referred to as baseflow colloids were measured with exafs common to both time points and mössbauer spectroscopy here we summarize our findings in a method by method order fe colloid concentrations 0 02 μm fraction as well as the distribution of fe ii and fe iii within the colloids varied substantially from may to july of 2021 table s2 despite comparable total aqueous fe concentrations 0 22 µm fe rich colloid concentrations peaked during snowmelt late may through mid june and then decreased as baseflow conditions were reached in july fe ii in the colloidal fraction followed a similar trend with a large drop in july 11 of total fe as compared to may 39 colloidal fe ii concentrations were inversely related to dissolved oxygen levels in july table s2 which rose from an average of 0 08 mg l 1 in june to 0 35 mg l 1 in july approx 0 9 and 3 9 of o2 saturation as soils drained during seasonal summer drying dewey et al 2021 cryo tem imaging of the snowmelt colloids revealed spherical particles ranging in size from approximately 10 to 100 nm fig 1 these included mono dispersed spheres as well as elongated assemblages of spheroids the fact that the colloidal nano spheres withstood radiation damage testing is consistent with a dominantly inorganic composition of the colloids fig s1 af4 analysis also indicated a heterogeneous particle size distribution with a root mean square radius rrms in the 10 to 200 nm range fig s2 furthermore the ratio of root mean square radius to the hydrodynamic radius rrms rh commonly known as the shape factor ranged from approximately 0 4 to 1 2 further supporting cryo tem imaging results showing the presences of spherical particles and spheroid assemblages of varying shapes trostle et al 2016 tem and sem eds elemental mapping of the snowmelt colloids figs 2 and s3 identified fe 13 3 atom o 42 8 c 36 4 and si 6 7 as the primary constituents smaller contributions from ca 0 38 al 0 31 and s 0 03 were also present calculated solid phase molar ratios were o fe 11 3 c fe 12 8 and si fe 1 0 these results are consistent with a mixture of fe oxide minerals and om aluminosilicates appear to be absent based on the large disparity in abundance between si al 20 1 rather the equimolar ratio of fe and si suggests that si is adsorbed on as monomers or polymers or coprecipitated in the colloids moreover the elemental map overlay of fe si and c fig 2 suggests that the fe particles are coated by si and embedded in an om si matrix adusei gyamfi et al 2019 nano sims analysis confirmed the co occurrence of fe o si c n and s figs s4 5 co location of fe and o supports the presence of an fe oxide mineral and co locality of c and n implies contribution from n rich om e g proteins and nucleic acids fig s4 some domains within examined samples exhibited spatial association between fe and low abundance s fig s5 suggesting that fe s interactions may be present at low abundance more details in supporting information page s14 3 2 colloid phase identity tem selected area electron diffraction saed analysis fig 2 of snowmelt colloid samples shows two weak diffraction rings corresponding to d spacing values of 0 146 and 0 251 nm that are consistent with a poorly crystalline 2 line ferrihydrite janney et al 2000 dardenne et al 2002 mössbauer spectroscopy of a baseflow colloid sample confirmed a best fit with two ferrihydrite phases containing different om si ratios chen et al 2015 eusterhues et al 2008 murad and cashion 2004 goethite hematite magnetite lepidocrocite and fes were not detected table s3 figs 3 and s6 these findings support our deductions from the tem and nanosims analyses that the ferrihydrite nanoparticles are associated with an om si matrix or coating the molecular structure around fe in the colloids was further characterized using fe k edge exafs fig 4 snowmelt and baseflow colloid samples were selected for additional analyses including lc ls fitting table s4 figs s7 8 and shell by shell fitting fig 4 table s5 both samples contained a mixture of fe ii and fe iii as demonstrated in the derivative fe k edge xanes spectra fig 4 yet the snowmelt colloid 0 02 0 22 µm sample had a higher absolute fe ii content whereas the baseflow colloid sample had a higher fe iii content in accordance with measured bulk fe ii and fe iii colloid concentrations table s2 exafs spectra from the baseflow colloids visibly resemble the spectra of ferrihydrite fig 4 middle and bottom panels linear combination least squares lc ls fitting was employed to identify major fe phases present and to compare contrast the baseflow and snowmelt colloids we found that four distinct model spectra were required for acceptable fits ferrihydrite ferrihydrite coated with om and complexes of fe ii and fe iii with om table s4 figs s7 8 superiority of ferrihydrite is illustrated in the fourier transform fig 4 with first and second neighbor peaks at 1 5 and 2 7 å respectively fit to the snowmelt colloids was poorer at 8 å 1 indicating that none of the reference compounds table s6 provide a perfect match to the natural samples as expected nevertheless these results clearly support the conclusion that multiple fe bearing species are present and moreover that both ferrihydrite and fe om complexes are present in the colloidal assemblages ferrihydrite increased in relative abundance from 21 snowmelt to 43 baseflow of total fe species as the hydrological site conditions changed from wet to dry table s4 the relative abundance of fe ii om complexes changed in the opposite direction dropping from 36 to 11 of total fe over this same time frame the snowmelt colloids are evidently more reduced e g higher relative abundance of fe ii than the baseflow colloids these observations demonstrate a variable composition of the colloid assemblages in response to changing aqueous chemical and hydrological conditions 3 3 quantitative molecular structure around fe shell by shell fitting of the fe exafs spectra was performed to quantify the molecular environment around fe in the colloid assemblages fig 4 as well as to supplement the results of the lc ls fitting particularly of the snowmelt colloids in all samples the fits indicated fe o distances of 1 95 and 2 08 å and fe fe distances of 3 07 å which are typical for fe oxyhydroxide minerals such as ferrihydrite table s5 fe ii or fe iii coordinated to organic compounds e g through carboxylate or phenolic functional groups yu et al 2015 daugherty et al 2017 may also be present fits were attempted with c neighbors being present at ca 2 8 å which would indicate bidentate coordination of fe by carboxylate groups this shell improved the fits substantially but the fitted parameters had relatively high uncertainty likely due to the presence of c neighbors at multiple distances and overlap with the exafs from fe neighbors and are not included in the presented fits a second fe fe pair distinguished by a 2 87 å interatomic distance table s5 fig s9 may be attributed to a tetrahedral fe ii coordination environment skomurski et al 2010 s neighbors at 2 27 å which were essential to fit the snowmelt exafs fig s9 are characteristic of fe s bond distances in sulfides yet neither fes or fes2 were detected in fe exafs lc ls table s4 or mössbauer analyses fig 3 therefore we infer that s is a minor constituent of ferrihydrite likely a result of superficial sulfidation the presence of s ii and fe ii in the snowmelt colloids is consistent with the conclusion above that they are more chemically reduced compared to the baseflow colloids 4 discussion 4 1 molecular structure and mechanisms of persistence of fe based colloids ferrihydrite is a widespread fe oxyhydroxide schwertmann and taylor 1989 in soils sediments rivers and lakes kennedy et al 2004 jambor and dutrizac 1998 its abundance may be attributed to its rapid precipitation kinetics it is usually the first solid fe oxyhydroxide phase to form upon oxidation of dissolved ferrous iron guo and barnard 2013 individual ferrihydrite particles are typically several nm in size aggregated schwertmann and taylor 1989 and reactive readily transforming into other fe oxyhydroxides thomasarrigo et al 2019 schwertmann and taylor 1989 few reports exist on stable colloidal ferrihydrite particles in natural settings particularly under reducing sulfidic conditions homoky et al 2021 gomez gonzalez et al 2016 in this study we found that despite anoxic conditions dissolved oxygen 0 08 mg l 1 and the presence of dissolved fe ii a significant portion of the colloidal fe occurred in its oxidized form as ferrihydrite as supported by saed fig 2 mössbauer fig 3 and fe exafs measurements fig 4 table s4 s5 fig s7 to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to identify natural mobile ferrihydrite based colloids that persist in anoxic waters the roles that colloids play in biogeochemical cycling and in the regulation of nutrient contaminant and om availability and transport depend on the structures and compositions of the phases that co occur in the colloids and on how they behave in ensemble in this study ferrihydrite is coated with si and om and the ferrihydrite cores appear to be intimately associated with organic matter complexed to fe ii fe iii adsorption or coprecipitation of si and om are evident moreover despite excess aqueous fe ii at our sampling depth table s2 no fe ii catalyzed transformation of our ferrihydrite based colloids to secondary minerals such as goethite magnetite and lepidocrocite qafoku et al 2020 hansel et al 2005 cornell and giovanoli 1985 schwertmann and taylor 1989 was observed figs 3 and s6 the presence of coatings is significant because they are expected to kinetically or chemically stabilize the underlying nano sized 30 nm ferrihydrite particles previous studies have reported that ferrihydrite transformation is inhibited in the presence of organic inorganic compounds and sio4 4 kaegi et al 2010 giannetta et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 as well as po4 3 kraal et al 2022 in the case of si reductive transformation of si ferrihydrite coprecipitates was significantly retarded at solid phase si fe molar ratios above 0 18 schulz et al 2022 kaegi et al 2010 cismasu et al 2013 similarly for organic compounds c fe molar ratios above 1 6 have been reported to completely inhibit abiotic om ferrihydrite coprecipitate transformation chen et al 2015 though a different study found that ratios above 1 8 can enhance the biotic transformation pathway shimizu et al 2013 in comparison we observed high relative molar ratios of c fe 12 8 and si fe 1 0 jones et al 2009 this implies organic molecules of comparable size are associated with the ferrihydrite nanoparticles that are either coprecipitated and or adsorbed yang et al 2017 the superior c fe ratios of our natural colloids compared to laboratory synthesized analogues c fe 2 5 provide an explanation for the stability of these natural colloids against reductive transformation factors that favor delay inhibition of transformation likely include 1 high om si loading and resulting coverage of the ferrihydrite surface schulz et al 2022 giannetta et al 2020 cismasu et al 2013 thomasarrigo et al 2018 2 the presence of om fe ii complexes in solution which can bond and stabilize ferrihydrite pédrot et al 2011 and 3 surface organic functional groups particularly the extent and type of associated ligands zhou et al 2018 for the latter carboxylic acids play a key role in ferrihydrite transformation with the number of bound versus free carboxyl groups regulating surface reactivity thomasarrigo et al 2019 ultimately in this study we ascribe colloid persistence under anoxic reducing conditions to the passivating effect conferred by om and si coatings though no fe ii catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite was observed our results do reveal that fe ii is part of the colloidal assemblage likely as fe ii complexed by the om matrix as inferred from the fe exafs lc ls fitting and or embedded in the ferrihydrite structure as inferred from the fe exafs shell by shell fitting previous studies on the biotransformation of ferrihydrite have reported an intermediate fe ii enriched ferrihydrite in which fe ii is incorporated into the mineral structure with minimal phase change zachara et al 2007 thus we conclude that ferrihydrite based colloids in this study are coated by si or encapsulated in an om matrix that inhibits redox triggered transformations under conditions where pristine ferrihydrite would not prevail ferrihydrite om si associations in the colloids may serve a dual purpose which extends their passivating properties to offer protection against om degradation this can be attributed to the strong om mineral interaction and or to the formation of inaccessible om domains mikutta et al 2006 eusterhues et al 2014 baldock and skjemstad 2000 the incorporation of si as part of the om si matrix may offer enhanced protection against biological attack tamrat et al 2019 because om is a dominant component of the colloids their role in om preservation as well as om transport is expected to be important 4 2 watershed scale implications of fe based colloid persistence the dissolved fe pool i e fe that passes through a 0 45 µm membrane in ground and surface water investigations has long been recognized to contain a mixture of soluble fe ii and om complexed and colloidal fe perdue et al 1976 koenings 1976 the colloidal contribution varies substantially in terrestrial and aquatic systems bulk fe colloids of unknown phase identity and composition contributed between 17 and 99 of the total fe in porewaters of marine sediments 20 200 nm sized colloids homoky et al 2021 and between 30 and 50 in porewaters of peat soils 10 kda sized colloids pokrovsky et al 2005 in this study between 48 and 72 of the porewater fe at 180 cm depth was present as colloidal ferrihydrite nanoparticles 20 220 nm table s2 the presence of variable redox zones along groundwater flow paths is generally thought to be a barrier to advective transport of redox sensitive fe minerals such as ferrihydrite which undergo rapid reductive oxidative dissolution or precipitation partitioning to solid phase when appearing as compositionally pure materials adhikari et al 2019 noël et al 2017 however while fe transport could in principle occur through a series of colloid precipitation and dissolution steps along the groundwater flowpath i e as redox transitions occur this study suggests that a different mechanism previals rather we show that mobile ferrihydrite based colloids persist in anoxic soil water which implies that they can be transported through reduced zones containing abundant dissolved fe ii and discharged into surface waters given the considerable colloidal mass up to 30 mg l 1 fe colloids in slate river floodplain soil water especially during snowmelt table s2 it is reasonable to conclude that colloid borne fe and om may contribute significantly to element loading in slate river where the concentration of fe is 10 100 µg l 1 this conclusion emphasizes the need to improve colloid process representations flury and qiu 2008 johnson et al 1996 in watershed reactive transport models steefel et al 2015 4 3 seasonal variability of fe based colloid composition our colloids demonstrated seasonal compositional variability i e the baseflow colloids were more oxidized compared to the snowmelt colloids tables s4 5 and figs 3 4 and s7 lc ls fitting of the fe exafs spectra showed that the contribution of ferrihydrite to the colloidal assemblage was 41 during snowmelt which increased to 60 under baseflow conditions in comparison the fraction of fe ii decreased from 36 to 11 following the spring snowmelt in apparent response to intrusion of dissolved oxygen in july table s2 and s4 oxidation of fe ii is likely a primary driving force for the compositional variations witnessed in the baseflow colloids thus the decrease in om and fe ii in colloids collected under baseflow conditions can be attributed to decreasing abundance of fe ii om complexes this conclusion is consistent with previous riverine observations on the transport of fe as om associated colloids from soils during spring snowmelt olshansky et al 2018 thus it appears that seasonal hydrological events such as rainfall flooding and snowmelt can play important roles in regulating colloid concentrations and composition in floodplains 5 conclusions these findings confirm the presence of mobile ferrihydrite based om associated colloids in anoxic groundwater of a montane riparian floodplain we provide direct observational evidence in support of the riverine based work of olshansky 2018 which concluded that soil derived fe om colloids were important sources of fe loading in mountain streams the fact that fe ii and s are incorporated in a ferrihydrite based colloidal assemblage under anoxic conditions with excess dissolved fe ii implies that fe iii in ferrihydrite is passivated against reductive dissolution this stability is attributed to the presence of si and om coatings the persistence of these nominally redox active colloids under both anoxic and oxic conditions sheds new light on their ability to transport fe om and nutrients across terrestrial aquatic interfaces declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14793,although polyhalogenated carbazoles phczs have been widely detected in the marine environment their origin is far from clear in this study the formation of phczs in the chlorination of seawater containing carbazole and its derivatives was investigated a total of 14 phczs including six commonly found and eight unknown congeners were identified in the chlorination of seawater with carbazole in addition this study for the first time demonstrated the production of common phczs from the chlorination of seawater with 3 methyl carbazole and 3 formyl carbazole especially 1 8 dibromo 3 6 dichlorocarbazole from 3 methyl carbazole the formation of phczs in the reaction resulted from the halogenation of carbazole by reactive chlorine species rcs and mainly reactive bromine species rbs forming from the oxidation of bromide by rcs results also indicated that the reaction followed a successive halogenation pattern a higher content of free chlorine and bromide facilitated the generation of rbs while a higher concentration of doc exhibited an inhibitory effect the effects of free chlorine bromide doc and temperature on the formation of phczs were congener specific given the

zebrafish were inhibited by 36 ccz and 36 bcz at 0 5 mg l or higher concentration the same study also showed that 36 bcz caused more serious adverse effects on swimming or escaping behavior in zebrafish than 36 ccz did in the exposure to 2 bromocarbazole 2 bcz 3 bcz and 36 bcz female mice displayed a significant increase in relative liver weight ratio and abnormality in blood biochemical

yet been fully interpreted except that 2 7 dibromocarbazole 27 bcz 36 bcz and 3 6 diiodocarbazole 36 icz have a direct source from industrial use as photoelectric material intermediates generally both anthropogenic and natural sources are proposed to be responsible for the occurrence of phczs in the environment mumbo et al 2013 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for instance side effect reactions

according to the equation dh298 cch3 δfh298 c12h8n δfh298 ch3 δfh298 c13h11n the dft calculations of the other compounds were accomplished using a similar method the specific outputs are listed in table s2 s4 in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction products overall 14 phczs including six target phczs i e 3 bcz 36 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz 3 ccz and 1 b 36 ccz and eight phczs with unknown substituted patterns were detected in the chlorination of seawater containing carbazole the six target compounds were directly identified by their authentic standards the other eight phczs were tentatively identified as congeners of monobromocarbazole cz br monochloro monobromocarbazole cz clbr dibromocarbazole cz br2 monochloro dibromocarbazole cz clbr2 and tribromocarbazole cz br3 fig 1 specifically the unknown phczs were preliminary screened by extracting the possible molecular ion m z of phczs and analyzing halogen isotope ratio characteristics based on the fact of 79br 81br and 35cl 37cl in natural isotopic abundance was 1 1 and 3 1 respectively then the possible compounds were further analyzed under product ion scan to obtain major fragmentation ions for the interpretation of detailed chemical structures for example fig 1a shows the extract ion chromatograms eic of m z 246 0 and product ion scan chromatograms of the compound unc 1 the molecular ions show apparent isotope ions at m z 244 8 246 8 and the abundance ratio is very close to the theoretical value of 1 1 calculated from m m 2 suggesting one bromine atom in unc 1 the product ion scan of unc 1 showed the major fragment ions of m z 165 9 and 79 1 corresponding to the fragment ions of carbazole and br respectively these analytical results were the same as those of the 3 bcz standard therefore unc 1 was tentatively identified to be cz br using 36 bcz and 136 bcz as references one cz br2 unc 2 and three isomers of cz br3 unc 3 unc 4 and unc 5 could be identified in a similar way fig 1b and c for the identification of mixed halogenated carbazoles the molecular ions with unique isotopic ratio patterns were observed for example the molecular ion of unc 6 displays m m 2 m 4 of 3 4 1 at m z of 278 9 280 8 282 8 consistent with the calculated isotopic pattern for the molecular ion of cz clbr furthermore the product ion scan of unc 6 shows major fragment ions of the neutral loss of hcl and hbr from the molecular ion at m z of 243 6 and 199 6 fig 1d these results together suggested that unc 6 was an isomer of cz clbr similarly two isomers of cz clbr2 unc 7 and unc 8 were tentatively identified fig 1e due to the lack of authentic standards the detected cz br cz clbr cz br2 cz clbr2 and cz br3 were semi quantified using the reference standards of 3 bcz 3 bcz 36 bcz 36 bcz and 136 bcz respectively table 1 the formation of these unknown phczs was generally much lower than their corresponding isomers of 3 bcz 36 bcz and 136 bcz which agreed well with the finding that phczs are more stable with substitution at the positions of c 3 c 3 6 c 1 3 6 and c 1 3 6 8 mumbo et al 2013 the six target phczs detected in this study have been widely measured in the aquatic environment for example all these six phczs were detected in surface sediments from the coastal environment in northern germany with over 50 detection frequency for 3 ccz 36 bcz and 1 b 36 ccz chen et al 2016 several of the six congeners also coexist in seawater and sediment samples collected from aquatic environments like the east china sea the south china sea and the great lakes guo et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 deng et al 2023 peng et al 2023 in the chloroperoxidase catalyzed halogenation of carbazole one isomer of cz br3 was detected chen et al 2018 a few studies also reported the observation of unknown phczs in environmental samples in two sediment cores from lake michigan guo et al 2014 identified five isomers of cz br3 one isomer of cz br2 and one isomer of cz clbr2 along with cz br4 cz br5 cz clbr3 cz clbr4 cz clbr3i cz br4i and cz br3i2 in another study 26 phczs including 16 unknown substituted patterns e g four isomers of cz br3 one isomer of cz br2 and one isomer of cz clbr2 and 10 other congeners not related to this study were detected in sediments of lakes michigan superior and huron guo et al 2017 3 2 reaction pathways the overall possible formation pathways are outlined in fig 2 the formation of phczs during seawater chlorination probably involved two stages first rcs in naocl disinfectant oxidize bromide into rbs eqs 1 8 according to previous studies sivey et al 2015 huang et al 2021 1 hocl b r hobr c l 2 hobr b r h b r 2 h 2 o 3 hobr c l brcl h 2 o 4 2 hobr b r 2 o h 2 o 5 hocl hobr brocl h 2 o 6 brcl cl brc l 2 7 brcl b r b r 2 c l 8 b r 2 b r b r 3 second the reaction of rcs and rbs with carbazole led to the formation of various chlorocarbazoles e g 3 ccz and bromocarbazoles e g 3 bcz 36 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz in general the halogenation process was dominated by bromination because rbs is a more active halogenation agent towards organic compounds than rcs voudrias and reinhard 1988 likely due to this reason only a relatively low concentration of 3 ccz was detected in the reaction while not any other higher chlorinated carbazoles were observed lower halogenated carbazoles could undergo further halogenation in the reaction and form higher halogenated products for example 3 bcz could be converted to 36 bcz and 136 bcz in the reaction with rbs while 36 bcz to 136 bcz fig 3 suggesting a successive substitution pattern further halogenation became more difficult as the number of halogen atoms in phczs increased this is because the halide substituents have an electron withdrawing effect on the parent carbazole ring reducing the electrophilic substitution ability of reactive halogen species acero et al 2005 for this possible reason 1368 bcz in the reaction was detected in 240 min but not in 90 min the successive halogenation could also successfully explain the formation of mixed halogenated carbazoles the compound cz clbr e g unc 6 might be the product of either the chlorination of monobromocarbazole or the bromination of monochlorocarbazole the further bromination of cz clbr gave cz clbr2 e g unc 7 and unc 8 theoretically 1 b 36 ccz might be formed from either the bromination of 36 ccz or the chlorination of cz clbr e g 1 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole or 1 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole however 36 ccz was not detected in the reaction suggesting that 1 b 36 ccz was less likely from the bromination of 36 ccz therefore 1 b 36 ccz was possibly the chlorinated product of cz clbr this pathway is possible because unc 6 an isomer of cz clbr was measured at the concentration of 4 0 10 3 µmol l and may serve as the possible precursor a more possible congener of unc 6 was 1 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole because it could be formed from the bromination of 3 ccz this speculation could also explain why the further transformation of 3 ccz in the reaction was not accompanied by the formation of 36 ccz observed in the below study 3 3 effect of free chlorine bromide doc and temperature the effect of free chlorine on the reaction is illustrated in fig 4 the transformation of carbazole and the formation of rbs were obviously enhanced by a higher dose of free chlorine a higher concentration of free chlorine facilitated the formation of the higher brominated congeners for example 136 bcz and 1368 bcz were gradually formed as free chlorine increasing from 0 5 to 2 0 mg l in addition the dominant product gradually altered from 3 bcz to 36 bcz with increasing free chlorine these results could be explained by the fact that the increasing free chlorine promoted the generation of electrophilic substitution reagent rbs fig 4 however the formation of 136 bcz and 1368 bcz in 5 0 mg l and 10 0 mg l of free chlorine was less than that in 2 0 mg l of free chlorine this result suggests that phczs might be also oxidized to other products by free chlorine heeb et al 2014 found that although electrophilic substitution was the main reaction of rbs with phenolic compounds oxidative products were also observed due to electron transfer in the reaction likewise wang et al 2021 detected several alcohol ketone and quinone like products along with 136 ccz and 1368 ccz in the chlorination of drinking water containing 36 ccz suggesting the coexistence of halogenation and other reactions the concentration of bromide in the reaction significantly influenced the transformation of carbazole and the formation of rbs fig s1 both the transformation of carbazole and the formation of rbs were enhanced by increasing bromide concentration for example the transformation of carbazole was slower in the reaction with 0 085 mmol l of bromide than that in the treatments with 0 425 and 0 85 mmol l bromide the effect of bromide on the formation of phczs was congener specific except for 1368 bcz the other measured phczs i e 3 bcz 36 bcz 136 bcz 3 ccz and 1 b 36 ccz generally increased at first then followed by a decreasing trend the measured 3 ccz in the treatment with 0 085 mmol l bromide was constantly higher compared with the treatments with 0 425 and 0 85 mmol l the congener compositions in 240 min of reaction were almost consistent when the bromide concentration was higher than 0 425 mmol l this was probably because the generation rbs was high enough to react with 1 0 μmol l of carbazole similarly the formation of bromophenols during drinking water chlorination was significantly influenced by bromide only when the concentration of bromide was much lower than that of phenol acero et al 2005 the effect of doc on the reaction is illustrated in fig 5 the total conversion of carbazole significantly decreased from 98 in the reaction without srha to 52 in the reaction with 2 0 mg l srha the formation of 136 bcz exhibited a gradual decreasing tendency after 60 min in the reaction without srha while a constantly increasing trend was observed in the reaction with 0 5 mg l srha this result indicated that the addition of srha inhibited the further transformation of 136 bcz in the reaction with 2 0 mg l or a higher concentration of srha both the transformation of carbazole and the formation of phczs reduced markedly in addition the formation of rbs apparently decreased with the increasing srha these results were possibly because the amino acid like polyphenol like and aromatic substances in srha consumed rbs and competed with carbazole deborde and von gunten 2008 du et al 2019 likely due to the presence of doc the transformation of carbazole and formation of phczs in real seawater were slightly different from those in artificial seawater fig s2 compared with the reaction in artificial seawater the conversion of carbazole in the seawater from the south china sea with 2 25 mg l doc was lower and no 1368 bcz was observed while the other phczs were slightly higher these results coincided with the finding that srha in the artificial seawater inhibited the further transformation of 136 bcz to 1368 bcz compared with the reaction at 5 c the reaction at 25 c had a higher transformation of carbazole but a significantly lower yield of 36 bcz fig s2 however the temperature had a negligible effect on the formation of the other phczs i e 3 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz 3 ccz and 1 b 36 ccz these results suggested that a higher temperature would accelerate carbazole degradation while reducing phcz formation during seawater chlorination 3 4 other potential precursors for phczs like carbazole many carbazole derivatives exist naturally in the environment for instance alkyl substituted carbazole and acyl substituted carbazole are widely found in rutaceae family plants as alkaloids ma et al 2005 sukari et al 2013 tan et al 2022 alkyl substituted carbazole is also one of the most dominant nitrogen compounds in petroleum and is widely detected in oil sands bakr and wilkes 2002 manzano et al 2016 willsch et al 1997 methyl carbazole has been detected in snow sediment and air samples in the athabasca oil sands region from northern alberta canada ranging from 0 03 to 1010 pg l 81 7 4960 pg g dry weight and 0 001 0 027 pg m3 respectively chibwe et al 2019 these carbazole derivatives may serve as potential precursors for the formation of phczs therefore 3 methyl carbazole 3 formyl carbazole 2 hydroxyl carbazole indolo 2 3 a carbazole and benzo c carbazole were tested for the possible formation of phczs during seawater chlorination the results showed that phczs could be formed from the chlorination of 3 methyl carbazole and 3 formyl carbazole fig 6 the diversity and concentration of phczs increased significantly with the increase in free chlorine concentration overall 3 bcz 36 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz 1 b 36 ccz and 18 b 36 ccz could be formed from 3 methyl carbazole while 3 bcz 3 ccz 36 bcz 136 bcz and 1368 bcz could be produced from 3 formyl carbazole it is interesting to find 18 b 36 ccz in the chlorination of 3 methyl carbazole numerous studies reported the distribution of 18 b 36 ccz in the marine environment but its origin has not been fully understood parette et al 2015 zhou et al 2019a hu et al 2021 2022 deng et al 2023 peng 2023 this result suggests that the chlorination of seawater containing 3 methyl carbazole may be a novel source for 18 b 36 ccz in the reaction phczs were formed via bond breaking of the branched chain and the halogenation of the carbazole ring the transformation of carbazole derivatives to phczs is structure dependent because of the different bond dissociation energies between the branched chain and parent carbazole ring the generation of carbazole radicals was evaluated by the bond dissociation energies of cch3 in 3 methyl carbazole ccho in 3 formyl carbazole and coh in 2 hydroxyl carbazole according to the reaction c13h11n c12h8n ch3 c13h9no c12h8n cho and c12h9no c12h8n oh the corresponding bond dissociation energies were calculated to be 99 61147 kcal mol 99 2857923 kcal mol and 108 828328 kcal mol respectively table s2 s4 the higher bond dissociation energy of coh in 2 hydroxyl carbazole than that of the other two compounds indicates that the direct cleavage of the coh bond to form carbazole radicals would require higher energy thus hindered its transformation to carbazole and phczs similarly no phczs could be produced from indolo 2 3 a carbazole and benzo c carbazole with increasing number and stability of the branched chains 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the formation of phczs from the chlorination of seawater containing carbazole and its derivatives i e 3 methyl carbazole and 3 formyl carbazole the simultaneous formation of bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles could be attributed to the halogenation of carbazole by rcs and rbs the phczs were generally dominated by bromocarbazoles especially 36 bcz higher concentrations of free chlorine and bromide facilitated the generation of rbs while a higher concentration of doc showed an inhibitory effect on rbs formation in contrast the effect of free chlorine bromide and doc on the formation of phczs was generally congener specific although there were differences in the transformation of carbazole and the yield of 36 bcz the formation of the other measured phczs i e 3 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz 3 ccz and 1 b 36 ccz was comparable under both room temperature and low temperature 5 c given the widespread occurrence of carbazole and its derivatives in seawater and the extensive use of chlorination in seawater treatment seawater chlorination may serve as a possible anthropogenic source for phczs in the marine environment credit authorship

14793,although polyhalogenated carbazoles phczs have been widely detected in the marine environment their origin is far from clear in this study the formation of phczs in the chlorination of seawater containing carbazole and its derivatives was investigated a total of 14 phczs including six commonly found and eight unknown congeners were identified in the chlorination of seawater with carbazole in addition this study for the first time demonstrated the production of common phczs from the chlorination of seawater with 3 methyl carbazole and 3 formyl carbazole especially 1 8 dibromo 3 6 dichlorocarbazole from 3 methyl carbazole the formation of phczs in the reaction resulted from the halogenation of carbazole by reactive chlorine species rcs and mainly reactive bromine species rbs forming from the oxidation of bromide by rcs results also indicated that the reaction followed a successive halogenation pattern a higher content of free chlorine and bromide facilitated the generation of rbs while a higher concentration of doc exhibited an inhibitory effect the effects of free chlorine bromide doc and temperature on the formation of phczs were congener specific given the

2023 the pervasive distribution of phczs has been raising considerable concern because of the increasing evidence of their deleterious effects such as dioxin like toxicity persistence bioaccumulation

zebrafish were inhibited by 36 ccz and 36 bcz at 0 5 mg l or higher concentration the same study also showed that 36 bcz caused more serious adverse effects on swimming or escaping behavior in zebrafish than 36 ccz did in the exposure to 2 bromocarbazole 2 bcz 3 bcz and 36 bcz female mice displayed a significant increase in relative liver weight ratio and abnormality in blood biochemical indices such as urine glucose total cholesterol and glucose while in male mice only alkaline phosphatase level was promoted by 36 ccz ji et al 2023 the origin of most phczs in the environment has not yet been fully interpreted except that 2 7 dibromocarbazole 27 bcz 36 bcz and 3 6 diiodocarbazole 36 icz have a direct source from industrial use as photoelectric material intermediates generally both anthropogenic and natural sources are proposed to be responsible for the occurrence of phczs in the environment mumbo et al 2013 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for instance side effect reactions

drinking water containing carbazole chlorine disinfection of seawater is one of the most popular techniques used in petrochemical and steel industry facilities nuclear and thermal power plants and in

disinfecting wastewater effluents from toilet flushing with seawater ding et al 2013 one of the biggest issues for the chlorination of seawater is the formation of halogenated disinfection by products

molecular ions show apparent isotope ions at m z 244 8 246 8 and the abundance ratio is very close to the theoretical value of 1 1 calculated from m m 2 suggesting one bromine atom in unc 1 the product ion scan of unc 1 showed the major fragment ions of m z 165 9 and 79 1 corresponding to the fragment ions of carbazole and br respectively these analytical results were the same as those of the 3 bcz standard therefore unc 1 was tentatively identified to be cz br using 36 bcz and 136 bcz as references one cz br2 unc 2 and three isomers of cz br3 unc 3 unc 4 and unc 5 could be identified in a similar way fig 1b and c for the identification of mixed halogenated carbazoles the molecular ions with unique isotopic ratio patterns were observed for example the molecular ion of unc 6 displays m m 2 m 4 of 3 4 1 at m z of 278 9 280 8 282 8 consistent with the calculated isotopic pattern for the molecular ion of cz clbr furthermore the product ion scan of unc 6 shows major fragment ions of the neutral loss of hcl and hbr from the molecular ion at m z of 243 6 and 199 6 fig 1d these results together suggested that unc 6 was an isomer of cz clbr similarly two isomers of cz clbr2 unc 7 and unc 8 were tentatively identified fig 1e due to the lack of authentic standards the detected cz br cz clbr cz br2 cz clbr2 and cz br3 were semi quantified using the reference standards of 3 bcz 3 bcz 36 bcz 36 bcz and 136 bcz respectively table 1 the formation of these unknown phczs was generally much lower than their corresponding isomers of 3 bcz 36 bcz and 136 bcz which agreed well with the finding that phczs are more stable with substitution at the positions of c 3 c 3 6 c 1 3 6 and c 1 3 6 8 mumbo et al 2013 the six target phczs detected in this study have been widely measured in the aquatic environment for example all these six phczs were detected in surface sediments from the coastal environment in northern germany with over 50 detection frequency for 3 ccz 36 bcz and 1 b 36 ccz chen et al 2016 several of the six congeners also coexist in seawater and sediment samples collected from aquatic environments like the east china sea the south china sea and the great lakes guo et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 deng et al 2023 peng et al 2023 in the chloroperoxidase catalyzed halogenation of carbazole one isomer of cz br3 was detected chen et al 2018 a few studies also reported the observation of unknown phczs in environmental samples in two sediment cores from lake michigan guo et al 2014 identified five isomers of cz br3 one isomer of cz br2 and one isomer of cz clbr2 along with cz br4 cz br5 cz clbr3 cz clbr4 cz clbr3i cz br4i and cz br3i2 in another study 26 phczs including 16 unknown substituted patterns e g four isomers of cz br3 one isomer of cz br2 and one isomer of cz clbr2 and 10 other congeners not related to this study were detected in sediments of lakes michigan superior and huron guo et al 2017 3 2 reaction pathways the overall possible formation pathways are outlined in fig 2 the formation of phczs during seawater chlorination probably involved two stages first rcs in naocl disinfectant oxidize bromide into rbs eqs 1 8 according to previous studies sivey et al 2015 huang et al 2021 1 hocl b r hobr c l 2 hobr b r h b r 2 h 2 o 3 hobr c l brcl h 2 o 4 2 hobr b r 2 o h 2 o 5 hocl hobr brocl h 2 o 6 brcl cl brc l 2 7 brcl b r b r 2 c l 8 b r 2 b r b r 3 second the reaction of rcs and rbs with carbazole led to the formation of various chlorocarbazoles e g 3 ccz and bromocarbazoles e g 3 bcz 36 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz in general the halogenation process was dominated by bromination because rbs is a more active halogenation agent towards organic compounds than rcs voudrias and reinhard 1988 likely due to this reason only a relatively low concentration of 3 ccz was detected in the reaction while not any other higher chlorinated carbazoles were observed lower halogenated carbazoles could undergo further halogenation in the reaction and form higher halogenated products for example 3 bcz could be converted to 36 bcz and 136 bcz in the reaction with rbs while 36 bcz to 136 bcz fig 3 suggesting a successive substitution pattern further halogenation became more difficult as the number of halogen atoms in phczs increased this is because the halide substituents have an electron withdrawing effect on the parent carbazole ring reducing the electrophilic substitution ability of reactive halogen species acero et al 2005 for this possible reason 1368 bcz in the reaction was detected in 240 min but not in 90 min the successive halogenation could also successfully explain the formation of mixed halogenated carbazoles the compound cz clbr e g unc 6 might be the product of either the chlorination of monobromocarbazole or the bromination of monochlorocarbazole the further bromination of cz clbr gave cz clbr2 e g unc 7 and unc 8 theoretically 1 b 36 ccz might be formed from either the bromination of 36 ccz or the chlorination of cz clbr e g 1 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole or 1 bromo 6 chlorocarbazole however 36 ccz was not detected in the reaction suggesting that 1 b 36 ccz was less likely from the bromination of 36 ccz therefore 1 b 36 ccz was possibly the chlorinated product of cz clbr this pathway is possible because unc 6 an isomer of cz clbr was measured at the concentration of 4 0 10 3 µmol l and may serve as the possible precursor a more possible congener of unc 6 was 1 bromo 3 chlorocarbazole because it could be formed from the bromination of 3 ccz this speculation could also explain why the further transformation of 3 ccz in the reaction was not accompanied by the formation of 36 ccz observed in the below study 3 3 effect of free chlorine bromide doc and temperature the effect of free chlorine on the reaction is illustrated in fig 4 the transformation of carbazole and the formation of rbs were obviously enhanced by a higher dose of free chlorine a higher concentration of free chlorine facilitated the formation of the higher brominated congeners for example 136 bcz and 1368 bcz were gradually formed as free chlorine increasing from 0 5 to 2 0 mg l in addition the dominant product gradually altered from 3 bcz to 36 bcz with increasing free chlorine these results could be explained by the fact that the increasing free chlorine promoted the generation of electrophilic substitution reagent rbs fig 4 however the formation of 136 bcz and 1368 bcz in 5 0 mg l and 10 0 mg l of free chlorine was less than that in 2 0 mg l of free chlorine this result suggests that phczs might be also oxidized to other products by free chlorine heeb et al 2014 found that although electrophilic substitution was the main reaction of rbs with phenolic compounds oxidative products were also observed due to electron transfer in the reaction likewise wang et al 2021 detected several alcohol ketone and quinone like products along with 136 ccz and 1368 ccz in the chlorination of drinking water containing 36 ccz suggesting the coexistence of halogenation and other reactions the concentration of bromide in the reaction significantly influenced the transformation of carbazole and the formation of rbs fig s1 both the transformation of carbazole and the formation of rbs were enhanced by increasing bromide concentration for example the transformation of carbazole was slower in the reaction with 0 085 mmol l of bromide than that in the treatments with 0 425 and 0 85 mmol l bromide the effect of bromide on the formation of phczs was congener specific except for 1368 bcz the other measured phczs i e 3 bcz 36 bcz 136 bcz 3 ccz and 1 b 36 ccz generally increased at first then followed by a decreasing trend the measured 3 ccz in the treatment with 0 085 mmol l bromide was constantly higher compared with the treatments with 0 425 and 0 85 mmol l the congener compositions in 240 min of reaction were almost consistent when the bromide concentration was higher than 0 425 mmol l this was probably because the generation rbs was high enough to react with 1 0 μmol l of carbazole similarly the formation of bromophenols during drinking water chlorination was significantly influenced by bromide only when the concentration of bromide was much lower than that of phenol acero et al 2005 the effect of doc on the reaction is illustrated in fig 5 the total conversion of carbazole significantly decreased from 98 in the reaction without srha to 52 in the reaction with 2 0 mg l srha the formation of 136 bcz exhibited a gradual decreasing tendency after 60 min in the reaction without srha while a constantly increasing trend was observed in the reaction with 0 5 mg l srha this result indicated that the addition of srha inhibited the further transformation of 136 bcz in the reaction with 2 0 mg l or a higher concentration of srha both the transformation of carbazole and the formation of phczs reduced markedly in addition the formation of rbs apparently decreased with the increasing srha these results were possibly because the amino acid like polyphenol like and aromatic substances in srha consumed rbs and competed with carbazole deborde and von gunten 2008 du et al 2019 likely due to the presence of doc the transformation of carbazole and formation of phczs in real seawater were slightly different from those in artificial seawater fig s2 compared with the reaction in artificial seawater the conversion of carbazole in the seawater from the south china sea with 2 25 mg l doc was lower and no 1368 bcz was observed while the other phczs were slightly higher these results coincided with the finding that srha in the artificial seawater inhibited the further transformation of 136 bcz to 1368 bcz compared with the reaction at 5 c the reaction at 25 c had a higher transformation of carbazole but a significantly lower yield of 36 bcz fig s2 however the temperature had a negligible effect on the formation of the other phczs i e 3 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz 3 ccz and 1 b 36 ccz these results suggested that a higher temperature would accelerate carbazole degradation while reducing phcz formation during seawater chlorination 3 4 other potential precursors for phczs like carbazole many carbazole derivatives exist naturally in the environment for instance alkyl substituted carbazole and acyl substituted carbazole are widely found in rutaceae family plants as alkaloids ma et al 2005 sukari et al 2013 tan et al 2022 alkyl substituted carbazole is also one of the most dominant nitrogen compounds in petroleum and is widely detected in oil sands bakr and wilkes 2002 manzano et al 2016 willsch et al 1997 methyl carbazole has been detected in snow sediment and air samples in the athabasca oil sands region from northern alberta canada ranging from 0 03 to 1010 pg l 81 7 4960 pg g dry weight and 0 001 0 027 pg m3 respectively chibwe et al 2019 these carbazole derivatives may serve as potential precursors for the formation of phczs therefore 3 methyl carbazole 3 formyl carbazole 2 hydroxyl carbazole indolo 2 3 a carbazole and benzo c carbazole were tested for the possible formation of phczs during seawater chlorination the results showed that phczs could be formed from the chlorination of 3 methyl carbazole and 3 formyl carbazole fig 6 the diversity and concentration of phczs increased significantly with the increase in free chlorine concentration overall 3 bcz 36 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz 1 b 36 ccz and 18 b 36 ccz could be formed from 3 methyl carbazole while 3 bcz 3 ccz 36 bcz 136 bcz and 1368 bcz could be produced from 3 formyl carbazole it is interesting to find 18 b 36 ccz in the chlorination of 3 methyl carbazole numerous studies reported the distribution of 18 b 36 ccz in the marine environment but its origin has not been fully understood parette et al 2015 zhou et al 2019a hu et al 2021 2022 deng et al 2023 peng 2023 this result suggests that the chlorination of seawater containing 3 methyl carbazole may be a novel source for 18 b 36 ccz in the reaction phczs were formed via bond breaking of the branched chain and the halogenation of the carbazole ring the transformation of carbazole derivatives to phczs is structure dependent because of the different bond dissociation energies between the branched chain and parent carbazole ring the generation of carbazole radicals was evaluated by the bond dissociation energies of cch3 in 3 methyl carbazole ccho in 3 formyl carbazole and coh in 2 hydroxyl carbazole according to the reaction c13h11n c12h8n ch3 c13h9no c12h8n cho and c12h9no c12h8n oh the corresponding bond dissociation energies were calculated to be 99 61147 kcal mol 99 2857923 kcal mol and 108 828328 kcal mol respectively table s2 s4 the higher bond dissociation energy of coh in 2 hydroxyl carbazole than that of the other two compounds indicates that the direct cleavage of the coh bond to form carbazole radicals would require higher energy thus hindered its transformation to carbazole and phczs similarly no phczs could be produced from indolo 2 3 a carbazole and benzo c carbazole with increasing number and stability of the branched chains 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the formation of phczs from the chlorination of seawater containing carbazole and its derivatives i e 3 methyl carbazole and 3 formyl carbazole the simultaneous formation of bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles could be attributed to the halogenation of carbazole by rcs and rbs the phczs were generally dominated by bromocarbazoles especially 36 bcz higher concentrations of free chlorine and bromide facilitated the generation of rbs while a higher concentration of doc showed an inhibitory effect on rbs formation in contrast the effect of free chlorine bromide and doc on the formation of phczs was generally congener specific although there were differences in the transformation of carbazole and the yield of 36 bcz the formation of the other measured phczs i e 3 bcz 136 bcz 1368 bcz 3 ccz and 1 b 36 ccz was comparable under both room temperature and low temperature 5 c given the widespread occurrence of carbazole and its derivatives in seawater and the extensive use of chlorination in seawater treatment seawater chlorination may serve as a possible anthropogenic source for phczs in the marine environment credit authorship

14794,global warming is expected to increase the atmospheric evaporative demand and make more surface water for evapotranspiration aggerating water sources social and ecological shortage pan evaporation as a routine observation worldwide is an excellent metric to indicate the response of terrestrial evaporation to global warming however several non climatic effects such as instrument upgrades have destroyed the homogenization of pan evaporation and limited its applications in china 2400s meteorological stations have observed daily pan evaporation since 1951 the observed records became discontinuous and inconsistent due to the instrument upgrade from micro pan d20 to large pan e601 here combining the penpan model pm and random forest model rfm we developed a hybrid model to assimilate different types of pan evaporation into a consistent dataset based on the cross validation test on a daily scale the hybrid model has a lower bias rmse 0 41 mm day 1 and better stability nse 0 94 than the two sub models and the conversion coefficient method finally we produced a homogenized daily dataset of e601 across china from 1961 to 2018 based on this dataset we analyzed the long term trend of pan evaporation pan evaporation showed a 1 23 0 57 mm a 2 downward trend from 1961 1993 primarily caused by decreased pan evaporation in warm seasons over north china after 1993 the pan evaporation in south china increased significantly resulting in a 1 83 0 87 mm a 2 upward trend across china with better homogeneity and higher temporal resolution the new dataset is expected to promote drought monitoring hydrological modeling and water resources management free access to the dataset can be found at https figshare com s 0cdbd6b1dbf1e22d757e keywords pan evaporation small and large pans random forest model assimilation homogenization long term trend data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evaporation is a critical variable of the terrestrial water cycle which is crucial for studying the response and feedback of the water cycle to climate change fu et al 2009 as a routine meteorological observation pan evaporation indicates atmospheric evaporative demand and reflects environmental variables comprehensive effects on potential evapotranspiration roderick et al 2014 because of its simplicity and practicality pan evaporation has been observed worldwide in meteorological and hydrometric stations and is widely applied in agricultural schedules water source assessments and hydrological forecasting wang et al 2019a compared to newly observed technologies e g fluxes tower pan evaporation has a more extended history and better spatial coverage therefore it provides a reliable proxy for exploring the interannual variability and long term trend of terrestrial evaporation all types of pans provide ample water for evaporation so the critical factor controlling pan evaporation is the absorbed energy for the water in the evaporating pan based on the land atmosphere energy balance the water inside can absorb more energy used in evaporation with increasing air temperature thus in theory global warming is expected to increase pan evaporation wang et al 2012 however the observed pan evaporation did not show a corresponding upward trend and even decreased in several areas known as the pan evaporation paradox brutsaert and parlange 1998 roderick and farquhar 2002 so far debate remains over whether or why the pan evaporation paradox occurs and one of the key reasons is the inhomogeneities in the observation of pan evaporation fu et al 2009 xing et al 2016 pan evaporation is determined by various climate variables and is very sensitive to the changes in the observed environment rezaie balf et al 2018 wang et al 2019c therefore the time series of pan evaporation are prone to inhomogeneity caused by non climatic shifts including station relocation instrument replacement etc these inhomogeneities will seriously weaken the confidence in the long term trends estimated from the observation of pan evaporation hobbins et al 2004 jovanovic et al 2008 previous studies have encountered that the downward trend of pan evaporation weakens or disappears after the quality control of observed records for homogeneity jovanovic et al 2008 rayner 2007 robinson 1999 the inhomogeneities of pan evaporation include two main parts firstly the pan evaporation has various shifts in the time series caused by non climatic factors e g station relocation the standard homogenization methods are based on statistical models to detect the abrupt changes in the mean and probability distribution in observed records the most accurate way is to match a homogeneous reference series with similar climate conditions and observe practices with the target series it is common practice to match a homogeneous record from adjacent stations as the reference series however due to instrument upgrades pan evaporation has a larger spatial heterogeneity and less homogeneous records it is challenging to match the reference series for the target series through adjacent stations previous studies had to select another homogenization approach which does not require metadata and reference series wang et al 2019a but this approach would reduce the accuracy in the detection and correction of homogenization wang and feng 2013 secondly and more importantly the inconsistent in observed records was caused by the updating of observation instruments for example after the 1980s the evaporating pan gradually updated from d20 to e601 across china li et al 2016b due to different structures and installation methods the upgraded pan evaporation significantly differs in values and probability density distributions from before bruton et al 2000 li et al 2022 given the dramatic changes in pan evaporation before and after the upgrade it is essential to assimilate them to the consistent variable before homogenization based on the synchronous observation between d20 and e601 the early method used a conversion coefficient or empirical model to assimilate them into a consistent record abudu et al 2011 xiong et al 2012 however their performance had significant spatial temporal heterogeneity and could not fit the nonlinear interactivities between pan evaporation and other climate variables niu et al 2021 hence those simple assimilation approaches have substantial biases especially for regional daily scales consequently recent studies developed several physical based models to assimilate different types of pan evaporation lim et al 2016 wang et al 2018 yang and yang 2012 those models fully consider the aerodynamic and thermodynamic process and can efficiently simulate the vapor heat radiation transfer of pan evaporation wang et al 2018 therefore they performed better than the conversion coefficient methods or empirical models however the physical based models are based on a steady state energy balance assumption which requires a typical integration period of at least one week in summer and up to one month in winter hence it is hard to simulate the microphysical process of evaporating pan in diurnal variabilities and assimilate pan evaporation daily lim et al 2016 qiu et al 2022 additionally the models cannot simulate ice sublimation and are prone to ignore the pan evaporation during the ice period which may increase the uncertainty of pan evaporation in high altitude latitude zones recently the machine learning model as a data driven model has been widely applied in the assimilation and interpolation of climate data for its advantage in dealing with the complicated nonlinear relationship among climate variables kişi 2013 niu et al 2021 qasem et al 2019 lu et al 2018 evaluated several models for predicting the daily pan evaporation from related meteorological variables and found that the machine learning models performed better in prediction accuracy and model stability than empirical models el bilali et al 2023 develop an interpretable machine learning model to estimate daily pan evaporation and found that the model accurately captures the daily variations of pan evaporation and has an interpretability consistent well with the actual hydro climatic processes in a semi arid environment previous studies suggested that the tree based machine learning model performs well in reproducing diurnal pan evaporation and is more physically interoperable in assessing the importance of input variables wang et al 2017b the physical based and tree based machine learning models have an advantage in reproducing monthly and daily variations respectively therefore in this study we combined them into a hybrid model to assimilate d20 into e601 and thus produced a consistent series for daily pan evaporation then we used the hybrid model with the homogenous variables as input to create the reference series for correcting the non climatic shifts this scheme can solve the problems due to fewer homogenous records and larger spatial heterogeneity thus significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of homogenization for pan evaporation especially in regions with sparse stations finally based on the homogenized dataset we evaluated the long term trend and spatial pattern of pan evaporation over the past 60 years in china 2 dataset and methods 2 1 dataset the dataset used in our study was provided by the national climatic center of the china meteorological administration ncc cma http www nmic gov cn the daily records in this dataset were collected from 2400s stations in mainland china from 1951 to 2018 see fig 1 including daily maximum minimum mean air temperatures tmax tmin tmean wind speed ws sunshine duration ssd relative humidity rh pan evaporation of d20 e601b pans and so on cao et al 2016 du et al 2017 all observed records had undergone strict quality controls including assessment of spatiotemporal consistency identification of outliers and correction of suspicious and erroneous data du et al 2020 please refer to the supplementary material for more information on data quality controls as shown in fig 1 the spatial pattern of the meteorological stations over china is asymmetric much denser in east china than in west china we used the area weight average method to reduce these biases when calculating the national mean first we divided the study region into 1 1 grids covering china then we assigned all stations to the grids and the number of stations in each grid is shown in fig s1 there were 689 grids containing the valid stations accounting for 72 45 of the total finally the grid box value was the average of all selected stations in the grid and the national mean the area weight average of all valid grids note that this method may result in representativeness errors due to the bias between the grid s value and the stations average especially for grids with fewer stations and complicated terrain besides surface solar radiation rs is the primary energy source of pan evaporation and an essential variable for related physical models however due to the complex practices and expensive cost at most 130s stations provided the observation records of surface solar radiation in mainland china tang et al 2011 additionally instruments sensitivity drift and replacements resulted in a non climatic faster dimming before 1990 and a false sharp increase in observed rs from 1990 1993 wang 2014 the sparse stations and severe quality problems limit the application of observed rs in the assimilation and homogenization of pan evaporation therefore we derived rs from sunshine duration by an effective model developed by yang et al 2006 and improved by subsequent studies he et al 2018 more detailed information for the rs derived model was given by du et al 2018 sunshine duration derived rs performed well in revealing variabilities of surface solar radiation and accurately reflected the effects of clouds and aerosols magee et al 2014 wang and zeng 2012 additionally sunshine duration derived rs values are better consistent with the satellite retrievals reanalysis and model simulations than observed rs wang et al 2015 two observation instruments measure pan evaporation in meteorological stations d20 and e601 the d20 pan is a cylindrical copper barrel with a 10 cm depth and 20 cm diameter wang et al 2019c it is installed on a frame 70cm above the ground see fig s2 early pan evaporation is observed by the d20 pan which was generally replaced by the e601b pan across mainland china after 2002 the e601 pan is a cylindrical barrel made of white fiberglass with a depth of 68 7 cm and a diameter of 61 8 cm it is buried in the soil and the top is 30cm over the ground fig s3 usually pan evaporation is the level change of the free water surface in pans when the water surface is frozen it is measured by the weight change of the evaporating pan different from the detachable pan of d20 the pans of e601 are fixed on the ground and cannot be detached to weigh on freezing days therefore e601 cannot work and meteorological stations would reuse d20 to observe pan evaporation during freezing periods as a result meteorological stations have no synchronous observation of e601 and d20 used to train the model during the freezing period fortunately the hydrometric station will use movable e601 pans to observe pan evaporation when the water is frozen which can provide the synchronous observation of e601 and d20 during the freezing period we selected 134 hydrometric stations over regions where the water will freeze in winter see fig 1 which provide training samples for the nearby meteorological stations to develop the conversion model between d20 and e601 in the freezing period 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 assimilation models due to the replacement from d20 to e601 the pans size and installation changes made significant inconsistencies in the observed record to correct this problem we divide the changes in pan evaporation into monthly and daily changes on a monthly scale the evaporation pan is considered in a steady state energy balance namely that the energy change of the entire pan has little effect on pan evaporation wang et al 2018 developed the penpan v3 model based on existing penman style models and observation of pan evaporation in china compared with the semi empirical fitting approaches the penpan v3 model is entirely physical and performs better in simulating variabilities of pan evaporation on a monthly scale therefore we used the penpan v3 model to indicate the monthly changes of e601 in this study 1 m p s s β γ r n λ ρ w β γ s β γ v p d m w r ρ w t a d v ρ a n u 2 l η a q l where the detailed information for above parameters is shown in table 1 as mentioned above the penpan v3 model is based on a steady state energy balance assumption which for a e601 pan requires at least one week in summer and up to one month in winter so the all parameters in equation is estimated by the monthly input data daily there are energy changes in the pan and water body therefore from meteorological factors pan evapotranspiration is affected by energy changes in the pan water body and the pan wall previous research attempts to develop physical models based on boundary layer theory to fit the daily variabilities of pan evaporation however these models need the information of fluid motion and water temperature as input qiu et al 2022 because the meteorological station did not record such information limiting the application of those models in the assimilation of daily observation pan fortunately based on long term observation data in china we found that d20 and e601 also have a very significant linear correlation on a daily scale and the difference between them has an obvious spatial and temporal pattern which can be explained well by relevant meteorological variables see section 3 2 therefore based on the d20 combined with the time spatial and meteorological information we constructed a random forest algorithm model to characterize the daily variation of e601 see fig s4 2 d p f d 20 l a t l o n h j d a y d l e n r s t s

dlen is the length of daytime rs ts tmax tmin ta p pa u2 and rh indicate the solar radiation daily temperatures daily maximum minimum mean near surface air temperature precipitation air pressure wind speed and relative humidity respectively for more information on the random forest model please see the supplementary material to combine the two models in a hybrid model we first decompose the time series of pan evaporation into monthly and daily variations the decomposition method first train and optimize the penpan v3 model using monthly time series then we use the optimized penpan v3 model to provide a monthly time series of pan evaporation mp then we use the daily observation to subtract mp the residual part is the daily variations of pan evaporation then we use the residual time series as the dependent variable and pan evaporation from d20 related meteorological variables and spatiotemporal information as the independent variable to train the random forest model we use the random forest model to reproduce the daily variation of pan evaporation dp finally we combine the mp produced by the penpan v3 model with dp simulated by the random forest model as shown in equation 3 see fig 2 3 e 601 m p d p the above hybrid models are based on the prerequisite that liquid water is in the evaporating pan when the water in the evaporating pan freezes the physical process of water evaporation in the evaporating dish clock changes significantly from water evaporation to ice sublimation because the current physical models cannot effectively simulate the sublimation process in the evaporating pan most studies set the pan evaporation during the freezing period as 0 or use the pan evaporation of d20 during the freezing period to replace the value of e601 directly it leads to apparent pan evaporation biases during northern china s freezing period to overcome this shortcoming we constructed a conversion model between d20 and e601 during the freezing period which is suitable for the winter in northern china 4 e 601 θ m d 20 equation 4 uses conversion coefficients to estimate e601 from d20 in the freezing period we used the synchronous observation recorded by our hydrometric station to calculate the conversion coefficient from d20 to e601 then we use the inverse distance weight method to evaluate the conversion coefficient of the meteorological station based on the surrounding hydrological stations 5 θ m i 1 n q i θ i m i 1 n q i where qi indicates the distance from target station to the i th hydrometric stations m denotes the month of the conversion coefficient to test the performance of the model we utilized ten cross validation methods firstly we will randomly select 75 of the data from the training dataset to train the hybrid model and then use the remaining 25 to test the model performance then repeat the validation process ten times and evaluate the accuracy and stability of the model based on the average and variability of the ten validation results the percentage of bias pbias the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the performance of the hybrid model 6 p b i a s i n o i m i

the pbias and rmse indicate the relative and absolute error of model output respectively nse is used to exclude the influence of mean difference on the evaluation of model output which is ranged from negative infinity to 1 the higher the simulation accuracy of the model the closer the nse value is to 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 ogden et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2 2 2 homogenization method based on the hybrid model we assimilated pan evaporation from d20 and e601 in a continuous and consistent series of e601 however most of these time series have several non climatic shifts caused by changes in station locations observing practices and station environment which causes significant biases in detecting and attributing long term trends to adjust these shifts we used the rhtestsv4 a robust statistical method developed by wang 2008 to detect and correct non climatic influences on the time series of e601 rhtest v4 has been widely used by nnc cma and previous studies for climate data homogenization since it is practical to detect non climatic shifts in the time series of observed records and estimate their magnitude sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2013 due to the lack of homogenized reference and metadata previous studies had to use the pmf algorithm to detect the shifts in the time series of pan evaporation wang et al 2019a however this algorithm which only depends on mathematical statistics will significantly reduce the reliability of the detection for non climatic shifts on the one hand this algorithm cannot determine whether the identified shifts are caused by non climatic factors or climate change as a result the abrupt signals in climate change may be misjudged as non climatic shifts and removed on the other hand due to the different sensitivity of different meteorological variables to the impact of non factors there are differences in the probability of these breakpoints being detected and corrected resulting in the homogenized data which will break the physical consistency of pan evaporation with other meteorological variables thus improve the uncertainty in attribution analysis wang 2008 wang and feng 2013 here we use the hybrid model with homogeneous climate variables as input to produce a homogeneous e601 as a reference series for every station the only difference from the assimilation model see eq 4 is that we no longer use d20 as the input when training and deriving the random forest term see eq 3 in the hybrid model although this will reduce the accuracy of derived e601 daily it can ensure the homogeneity of the time series thus providing a homogeneous reference for the assimilated e601 at the target station compared to matching the reference series from adjacent stations the reference series derived by the hybrid model is better consistent with the target series in variabilities and long term trends see fig s5 then we selected the penalized maximal t test algorithm in rhtestsv4 which is recommended because it has better performance detecting the non climatic shifts in time series to test the homogeneity of the time series of the assimilated e601 wang and feng 2013 wang et al 2007 after seeing the change need to use two processes to determine whether climatic or non climatic factors cause these shifts first we use the metadata of the weather station to check whether the weather station has moved replaced instruments automated transformation and other activities when the shift occurs if it happens it implies that non climatic factors probably cause the shift secondly we need to check whether similar shifts co occur in the surrounding weather stations when the inhomogeneous breakpoints occur if they coincide the shift is probably caused by regional climate change rather than non climatic factors through two tests we screen out shifts caused by non climatic factors then use the qm algorithm provided by rhtest v4 to correct these shifts the non climatic shifts divide the time series into several segments the qm algorithm adjusts the empirical distribution of all segments to be consistent with a specific target segment the qm algorithm s adjustment value depends on the datum s empirical cumulative frequency to be adjusted which varies between different datum within the same segment depending on their corresponding empirical frequency therefore qm algorithm can adjust the non climatic changes in both the mean value and the probability density distribution cao et al 2016 wang 2008 the main processes of assimilation and homogenization are shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial pattern of pan evaporation during 1960 2018 more than 2400 weather stations observed pan evaporation across china as shown in fig 3 a the station number for d20 and e601 changed significantly before 1980 all stations used d20 to measure pan evaporation during 1980 2002 some stations began to use e601 and the number increased gradually however there was no apparent change in the number of d20 stations in this period indicating that most stations continued the observation of d20 after adding e601 therefore there were extensive parallel observations of d20 and e601 during this period since 2002 china s weather station has carried out a large scale automatic transformation the measurement of pan evaporation has gradually upgraded from manual observation to automatic observation using ultrasonic ranging xiong et al 2012 as a result the stations equipped with automated e601 began to stop using d20 and thus the synchronous observation stations dropped sharply after 2014 only about 500 stations kept the observation of d20 which is mainly distributed in north china to observe pan evaporation when the inside water is frozen on the contrary the number of stations for e601 has gradually increased becoming the primary evaporating pan of china s weather stations in spatial the station of d20 was much denser than that of e601 and thus has better spatial coverage and can provide more detailed information for the regional pan evaporation especially for areas with sparse stations see fig 3b there are 745 stations with the synchronous observation between d20 and e601 which cover most of mainland china and have an average of 2214 days equal to 6 1 years of synchronous records see fig 3c additionally the duration of synchronous observations has distinct interannual and spatial variabilities it is longest in low latitudes and gradually decreases from south to north especially in cold seasons see fig 3d the main reason for this spatiotemporal difference is that e601 cannot work during the freezing period the above results show that d20 has denser observation stations and more extended records which can provide more details of pan evaporation and make up for the lack of e601 during the freezing period compared with d20 the pan evaporation of e601 is closer to the natural water surface evaporation and gradually replaced d20 as the main pan of china s meteorological stations therefore integrating d20 and e601 to build a continuous series is the key to studying the response of pan evaporation to climate change in china fortunately the station observation has long term synchronous observation between d20 and e601 with good spatial coverage which makes it possible to develop the assimilation model of pan evaporations 3 2 relationship between d20 and e601 based on synchronous observation we analyze the relationship between d20 and e601 as shown in fig 4 a e601 has a robust linear relationship with d20 r2 0 79 across china see fig 4b and the pan evaporation of e601 is generally about half of that of d20 ratio 0 54 therefore previous studies were prone to use a constant value to convert d20 to e601 shen et al 2022 xiong et al 2012 however the ratio between e601 and d20 has apparent temporal and spatial heterogeneity see fig 4c in spatial the ratio of e601 to d20 is the highest in southern china and gradually decreases from south to north the average ratio of latitude zone drops from 0 55 around n20 to 0 47 around n50 see fig 4d additionally apart from n10 20 the ratio in other regions is the highest in january or december and the lowest in march or april above all the conversion coefficient method would lead to apparent conversion deviation especially daily or regional scale further based on partial correlation analysis we explored the contribution of related meteorological variables to the difference between d20 and e601 δde d20 e601 the results show that surface solar radiation rs and daily maximum temperatures tmax have a significant positive relationship with δde explaining 38 1 and 23 7 of the daily variations respectively see figs 5 b and f an alternative explanation is that the evaporating pan of d20 is smaller and suspended in air thus having a smaller heat capacity and larger surface proportion contact with solar radiation and air as a result the pan evaporation of d20 is more sensitive to rs and tmax than e601 in contrast the partial correlation coefficients for relative humidity rh and precipitation p with δde are negative indicating rain or high humidity would reduce the difference between d20 and e601 see fig 5e and h other variables including wind speed air pressure and daily minimum temperature have no significant effect on δde as a whole the meteorological variables can explain 92 6 variabilities of δde indicating it is feasible to use d20 and related meteorological variables to reproduce e601 fig 5i 3 3 evaluation of the assimilated model according to the above results we developed a hybrid model that combined physical and random forest models to derive the e601 from d20 and related meteorological variables on a daily scale firstly based on cross validation we compared the performance of four different assimilation schemes the conversion coefficients method cm the random forest model rfm eq 2 the panpen v3 model pm eq 1 the hybrid model of rfm and pm rfm pm eq 3 as shown in fig 6 a both rfm and pm have a higher nse than cm indicating they have a better performance in conversion accuracy additionally the pm is lower than rfm in the spatial difference of nse and exhibits better stability under different conditions note that the steady state condition is not satisfied when the pm model is used daily which would reduce its performance hence we use the pm model to simulate the monthly variability and rfm to simulate the daily variability for e601 fig 6a shows that the hybrid model has a significantly higher nse and lower standard deviation than other models this result indicates that the hybrid model has higher accuracy and stable performance in different regions and periods exhibiting better applicability in deriving daily e601 this result indicates that pm and rfm have an excellent complementary relationship with each other in reproducing the daily variation of pan evaporation further we evaluated the input variables contribution to the daily variability of e601 the results show that d20 has a main contribution and can explain 42 8 of the daily variation of e601 followed by rs rh and tmax which respectively explained 8 5 11 9 the contribution of other variables is relatively small and less than 5 the contributions of input meteorological variables are consistent with their partial correlation with de see fig 5 we also analyze the case without d20 as the input after removing d20 the derived e601 have no significant change in the mean value the model s performance has declined somewhat in daily shifts and long term trends figs s6a c but the decline is at most 16 9 see figs s6d the results suggested that other input variables can effectively compensate for the information loss due to removing d20 therefore it is feasible to use homogenous variables as input to prepare reference series for pan evaporation records after assimilation moreover when there is no d20 observation while other variables are complete the e601 can also be interpolated in this way additionally we found that the size of the training sample for the hybrid model is the critical factor affecting the model s performance the training sample size has a significant positive negative relationship with the r2 rmse which indicates that more training samples can efficiently improve the model s performance in capturing daily variability see figs 6b c as shown in fig 6d the trend deviation decreased fast with the sample size and trend to stable around 0 2 mm a 2 5 3 of total trend after the sample size of more than five years about 1800 samples therefore we must ensure that every station has more than five years of training samples to ensure that the derived e601 has good consistency with the observed e601 in long term trends according to the above results we selected the hybrid model rfm pm to convert d20 into e601 with other variables we use the principle of proximity to select training samples and ensure that the training sample size exceeds 1800 days for every station then based on rmse and nse we further refine the training samples to improve model accuracy and stability finally we used the trained model to derive daily e601 from d20 and related meteorological variables as shown in fig 7 a the derived e601 compares well with the observed value r2 0 94 the rmse and nse are 0 41 mm day 1 and 0 94 indicating that the hybrid model is accurate and stable daily in spatial both rmse and trend bias are relatively larger in the north china and tibetan plateau figs 7b and d these regions have freezing periods and sparse stations which could make it against assimilation accuracy to test the consistency of the observed and derived e601 in daily variability we conducted the correlation analysis on the detrended anomaly series without trend and seasonal cycle as shown in figs 5c except for parts of southern tibet the correlation coefficient of most of china exceeds 0 8 with an average of 0 92 the trend bias of derived e601 was larger in northern china and declined from north to south see fig 7d combining the derived and observed e601 we can get a consistent series of daily e601 for 2000s stations during 1960 2018 see figs 7e f 3 4 homogenization of the assimilated e601 after assimilating kinds of pan evaporation into e601 the records still have abrupt breakpoints caused by non climatic factors including station relocation instrument replacement and automation transformation see fig 8a we must detect and correct these non climatic shifts before estimating the long term trend of pan evaporation based on rhtest v4 software and metadata 9811 shifts were detected of which 6412 were confirmed as non climatic shifts they are distributed in the records from 2120 stations accounting for 99 7 of the total number of stations in spatial non climatic shifts are more concentrated in the eastern areas of china which experienced rapid urbanization in the past decades see fig 8 b most meteorological stations in china are located in the suburbs of cities cities fast expansion destroyed the original observation environment of meteorological stations leading to their relocation and the occurrence of non climatic shifts in observation records in addition the number of shifts varies significantly over time the year with the most breakpoints was around 2003 corresponding to china s large scale automatic transformation of meteorological stations following the 1980s the e601 began to be applied and gradually replaced d20 in some stations causing numerous non climatic shifts during the period of 1980 to 1985 see fig 8c after detecting these shifts we corrected them by qm algorithm from rhtest software wang et al 2010 wang et al 2007 finally we produced a homogeneous daily dataset of e601 in 2125 stations in china during 1960 2018 note that during the 1960s there was a significant change in the number of valid stations which increased from 1479 in 1961 to 2047 in 1968 and tended to stabilize since then see fig 8d however the number of valid grids in 1961 was only 48 6 97 less than that in 1968 hence the number change of valid stations has less effect on the national mean pan evaporation trend analysis 3 5 annual variabilities of pan evaporation based on the observed and homogenized dataset we analyzed the interannual variability and long term trend of pan evaporation during 1961 2018 over china d20 was consistent well with e601 in interannual variability during 1961 2002 see fig 9 for the long term trend there was an obvious turning point for pan evaporation trends in 1993 during 1960 1993 d20 decreased at 3 75 2 45 mm a 2 and about twice the reduction rate of the assimilated e601 2 35 1 68 mm a 2 given that the average value of e601 is about half of d20 the decline rate of pan evaporation measured by d20 is similar to that of e601 after homogenization the decline rate of e601 reduced to 1 23 0 93 mm a 2 namely that the 47 6 decline rate can be attributed to the inhomogeneity in pan evaporation before 1993 during 1993 2018 the e601 increased significantly and had no apparent difference in the increasing rate before and after homogenization which was 1 80 1 09 mm a 2 and 1 83 1 43 mm a 2 respectively after homogenization e601 showed a significant trend with a rate of 0 285 0 159 mm a 2 from 1961 to 2018 the trend of pan evaporation has significant seasonal differences and spatial patterns as shown in table 2 the change rate of e601 in warm seasons is about three times higher than in cold seasons from 1961 to 1993 the decline of pan evaporation was mainly distributed in northern china especially in the north china plain in contrast the pan evaporation in south china has no noticeable change and even shows a specific upward trend figs 10 a c from 1993 to 2018 pan evaporation increased mainly in southern china and part regions in northwestern china see figs 10d f in the past 60 years pan evaporation decreased significantly in the north china plain and parts of northern xinjiang especially in warm seasons other regions had an increasing trend and no noticeable seasonal difference see figs 10g i 4 discussion 4 1 hybrid model performance and controlling factors in this study the results indicate that machine learning and physical models perform significantly better than traditional empirical models consistent with previous studies feng et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b however there is still no consensus on which is better for machine learning and physical models on a monthly scale physical models have precise physical mechanisms and better interpretability and adaptability making them more widely used in pan evaporation s assimilation and attribution analysis stephens et al 2018 yang and yang 2012 our results also indicate that physical models perform better regarding model spatial stability especially in areas with sparse stations such as northwest china see fig 6a in contrast the machine learning models are the black box models without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes they can be trained with a large number of samples to predicting pan evaporation from input variables kisi 2015 tezel and buyukyildiz 2016 thus it is more available in complex environments and daily scales than physical models el bilali et al 2023 shabani et al 2020 however machine learning models are sensitive to the sample size so they have significant uncertainty in areas with sparse stations or short records al mukhtar 2021 as mentioned above there is an excellent complementary relationship between machine learning models and physical models theoretically better performance can be achieved if they are combined into a hybrid model our results proved that the hybrid model has better accuracy and stability pbias is 0 45 rmse is 0 41 mm day 1 and nse is 0 94 than random forest model or physical model see fig 6a the performance of the hybrid model is not only much higher than the standard proposed by ogden et al 2015 pbias 25 and nse 0 5 but also better or compatible in overall accuracy and stability compared to previous studies nse ranging from 0 52 0 96 el bilali et al 2023 lu et al 2018 niu et al 2021 the model s input variables are essential in predicting pan evaporation increasing input variables can theoretically provide more information to improve the model s performance however for physical models more variables might generate an over fitted complex model resulting in poor accuracy adamowski et al 2011 wang et al 2017b found that models based on linear regression or physical models are susceptible to missing values of input variables especially some critical variables such as solar radiation by comparing physical models with different combinations of input variables previous studies indicate that the machine learning models with more input variables generally had better accuracy without overfitting wu et al 2020 as shown in fig 6b the hybrid model similar to tree based machine learning models can effectively fill the information gap caused by d20 loss by improving the importance of other related variables thus effectively reducing the impact of the missing value on the model accuracy additionally the hybrid model can provide the importance of input variables with robust physical interpretability see fig 6b existing studies have evaluated the contribution of input variables in predicting pan evaporation and drawn different conclusions some studies believe solar radiation and air temperature are more effective in modeling pan evaporation wang et al 2017b in contrast others think that the contributions of relative humidity and wind speed are more important yan et al 2019 an alternative explanation is that the divergence is due to differences in parameterization schemes time scales and climate background among previous studies based on partial correlation analysis and hybrid model evaluation we found that on a daily scale solar radiation is the essential meteorological variable affecting pan evaporation followed by relative humidity see fig 5i however we found significant differences in the variables importance between the partial correlation analysis and the hybrid model fig 5i and fig 6b for example wind speed has a low correlation with pan evaporation but is of more significant importance in the hybrid model previous studies have also found a similar phenomenon wang et al 2017b which implies that the hybrid model can identify nonlinear relationships that cannot be identified by linear correlation analysis between wind speed and pan evaporation thus has a better performance than linear regression models 4 2 spatial pattern and seasonal contrast of pan evaporation an essential purpose of the observation networks for pan evaporation is to identify the climatology of potential evaporation previous studies reported that average annual pan evaporation ranged from 1613 to 1662 mm yr 1 based on d20 cong et al 2009 li et al 2016a niu et al 2021 we used the observation from 2145 stations and estimated the national area weighted average of d20 pan evaporation which was 1607 mm yr 1 slightly lower than previous studies based on the new dataset of e601 the annual pan evaporation in china was 973 mm yr 1 during 1961 2018 which was in the range of previous studies 921 1049 mm yr 1 li et al 2016a niu et al 2021 there are many alternative reasons for differences in the evaluation of annual pan evaporation among different studies such as the station number and interpolation methods our study used observations from more than 2000 stations providing more detailed information and better spatial coverage than previous studies fewer than 800 stations besides estimating the e601 pan evaporation during the freezing period is vital for annual evaporation existing studies set the e601 pan evaporation equal to zero or d20 pan evaporation when the pan water is frozen wang et al 2019a however by comparing the synchronous observation of d20 with the e601 from surrounding hydrologic stations the ratio of pan evaporation between d20 and e601 ranged from 0 23 to 0 78 during the freezing period therefore previous approaches would underestimate or overestimate the annual pan evaporation here we constructed a conversion model using d20 observations from the weather station and synchronous e601 observations from neighboring hydrologic stations thus converting d20 observations into e601 during the freezing periods compared to the above two schemes our method can provide a more accurate estimation for the pan evaporation of e601 during the freezing period as shown in figs s7 the spatial pattern of pan evaporation is consistent with previous studies li et al 2016a niu et al 2021 wang et al 2019a the regions with the highest pan evaporation are the southern tibetan plateau and the xinjiang province in china followed by the southern regions of china the sichuan basin the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river while the eastern regions of northeast china have the lowest pan evaporation see fig 7g there are also significant differences in the spatial pattern of pan evaporation between the warm and cold seasons in the warm seasons the pan evaporation of china is the highest in the northwest of china and gradually decreases to the southeast see fig 7h in the cold seasons pan evaporation is highest in southwest china followed by coastal areas in south china pan evaporation in other regions shows the apparent latitude belt distribution gradually decreasing from south to north see figs s7i the spatial patterns and seasonal contrast of pan evaporation estimated by the new dataset also agreed well with existing studies xiong et al 2012 besides pan evaporation numerous models have been proposed to estimate potential evaporation including aerodynamic temperature based radiation based and combination methods yang et al 2021 compared to previous studies the aerodynamics and combined methods have a more similar spatial pattern with pan evaporation estimated by the new dataset one important reason is that these two methods mainly estimate potential evapotranspiration through relative humidity and wind speed figs s8 shows that the essential climate variables for pan evaporation are relative humidity and wind speed which explain 70 84 spatial variation of pan evaporation which is consistent with previous studies zuo et al 2005 note that the spatial pattern of d20 is generally consistent with those of raw e601 and adjusted e601 see figs s7 without the significant difference mentioned in previous studies wang et al 2019a as shown in figs s8 for d20 and e601 the leading variables affecting the pan evaporation are relative humidity and wind speed the differences in pan evaporation between d20 and e601 are mainly distributed in areas with sparse stations or long freezing periods li et al 2016a xiong et al 2012 besides as shown in figs s8b the e601 can effectively reduce the impact of precipitation on pan evaporation thus enabling a more accurate assessment of the spatial pattern of pan evaporation especially in areas or seasons with high precipitation 4 3 interannual variability and long term trend evaporation is a critical component of the global terrestrial water cycle and affects regional climate change by adjusting the land atmosphere energy balance dai et al 2018 as a routine observation of evaporation pan evaporation has a more extended record and better spatial coverage than other observations e g fluxes tower therefore many previous studies try to explore the response of evaporation to climate change by analyzing the trend of pan evaporation mozny et al 2020 roderick et al 2009 roderick et al 2007 as mentioned above most existing studies used d20 to study the long term pan evaporation trends and extend the d20 time series by assimilating e601 or model simulation after 2002 jin et al 2022 wang et al 2019a the d20 decreased by 5 48 to 1 72 mm a 2 before the 1990s and increased by 1 05 to 7 90 mm a 2 after the 1990s table s2 in this study d20 decreased significantly by 3 75 2 45 mm a 2 during 1961 1993 and compared well with previous studies see fig 8 by the hybrid model we converted the d20 into e601 and found a downward trend of e601 during this period the trend was 2 35 1 68 and 1 23 0 57 mm a 2 before and after homogenization by comparison the downward trend of pan evaporation may be exaggerated by d20 and the inhomogeneities before the 1990s during 1993 2018 the e601 showed an upward trend increasing at 1 80 1 09 mm a 2 and 1 83 1 43 mm a 2 before and after homogenization respectively the inhomogeneities had less effect on the trend estimation during this period using linear conversion coefficients guan et al 2022 converted d20 into e601 based on parallel observations and found a 0 60 mm a 2 decreasing trend of e601 during 1961 2018 which is consistent with our results 0 29 0 35 mm a 2 before homogenization after homogenization the trend of e601 turned downward to upward and increased by 0 285 0 159 mm a 2 from 1961 2018 compared to previous studies we found that they had good consistency in the interannual change of pan evaporation and most experienced a process from decline to increase however there are apparent differences in the trend rate among existing studies including ours there are three alternative reasons for this difference the first is the difference in evaporating pan before 2002 most meteorological stations in china had mainly measured pan evaporation by d20 and d20 has continuous observation including the freezing period so most of the existing studies prefer to use d20 to evaluate the trend of pan evaporation especially some early studies however d20 has a copper pan wall and a smaller water capacity so it is more sensitive to changes in solar radiation than the actual natural water surface wang et al 2019b quantified the contributions of the water body and pan wall on the trends of d20 found that the pan wall changed the trend rate by 16 5 21 7 in contrast the pan wall of e601 is made of white fiberglass with a larger water capacity reducing the impact of the pan wall on the measurement of pan evaporation hence e601 is closer to the actual water surface so its trend is more helpful in exploring the response and feedback of terrestrial evaporation to climate change fu et al 2004 the second is the number of stations used in trend analysis the number of stations used in previous studies ranged from 55 to 806 a small number of sites lead to poor spatial representation especially in many western regions where no relevant sites provide data fig 9 shows significant spatial heterogeneity in the long term trend of pan evaporation when the spatial coverage of the station varies greatly it is bound to lead to differences in the national mean trends in our research we collected the pan evaporation observation from 2125 stations much more than the station number of previous studies achieving better space coverage in addition we converted usable stations into 1 1 grids to reduce the bias caused by uneven station distribution finally the inhomogeneity of pan evaporation records also plays a critical role in the trend difference as mentioned above many non climatic shifts in raw records of pan evaporation can cause trend biases especially for fewer stations used in studies jovanovic et al 2008 wang et al 2019a selected the penalized maximal f test algorithm in rhtests4 to detect and correct non climatic shifts in pan evaporation without metadata and reference series here we prepared reference series for each station based on the homogenized meteorological data and the hybrid model we identified the detected shifts by the penalized maximal t test in rhtests4 and furtherly checked them with metadata which can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of homogenization wang et al 2010 4 4 uncertainties of model derived e601 there are still some biases in the daily e601 dataset after assimilation and homogenization rmse and trend bias are larger in northern china and tibet plateau than in other areas all those areas have a freezing period in cold seasons the assimilation scheme still has deficiencies in reproducing pan evaporation during the freezing period especially for the freeze thaw process however the pan evaporation during the freezing period accounts for a small proportion 0 81 9 21 of the annual total so the bias in the freezing period would have less effect on the estimation of trends and yearly variations in addition we estimate the national average based on all areas covered by observation stations excluding areas without station observations such as the hinterland of tibetan plateau and the taklamakan desert how to integrate multi source data including satellite remote sensing and reanalysis products to accurately estimate pan evaporation in areas without station observations is a critical issue that we need to focus on in latter research 5 conclusion based on observations from 2000s stations over china during 1961 2018 we found a robust correlation between two evaporative pans d20 and e601 their differences in pan evaporation can be well explained by relevant climate variables such as solar radiation based on ten cross validation the hybrid model performed well in reproducing the absolute value rmse 0 41 mm day 1 and daily variability r2 0 94 when the sample size is longer than five years the trend bias tends to stabilize at 0 2 mm a 2 accounting for about 5 6 of the total trend then we assimilated all pan evaporation into e601 by the hybrid model and produced a homogeneous and consistent daily dataset from 1961 to 2018 over china the main advantages of the new dataset are as follows 1 the new dataset assimilates pan evaporation from 2000s meteorological stations in china which is superior to the existing dataset in terms of spatial coverage and station density thus providing more detailed information on the spatial pattern 2 the new dataset has increased the time resolution of pan evaporation from the monthly scale to the daily scale and constructed 58 year continuous records from 1961 2018 thus it has a longer time series and higher temporal resolution other existing dataset 3 due to the use of a new estimation of pan evaporation when the water in pan freezes it can effectively improve the accuracy in interpolation the missing value of e601 during freezing periods in northern china above all the new dataset is continuous and consistent with higher spatiotemporal resolution which would provide better support for detecting and attributing extreme climate events hydrologic and climatic modeling and refined water resources management further we continue optimizing the assimilation model by observing experiments under different conditions e g developing more physical models to replace the black box models and improving their physical interpretability daily 6 data

14794,global warming is expected to increase the atmospheric evaporative demand and make more surface water for evapotranspiration aggerating water sources social and ecological shortage pan evaporation as a routine observation worldwide is an excellent metric to indicate the response of terrestrial evaporation to global warming however several non climatic effects such as instrument upgrades have destroyed the homogenization of pan evaporation and limited its applications in china 2400s meteorological stations have observed daily pan evaporation since 1951 the observed records became discontinuous and inconsistent due to the instrument upgrade from micro pan d20 to large pan e601 here combining the penpan model pm and random forest model rfm we developed a hybrid model to assimilate different types of pan evaporation into a consistent dataset based on the cross validation test on a daily scale the hybrid model has a lower bias rmse 0 41 mm day 1 and better stability nse 0 94 than the two sub models and the conversion coefficient method finally we produced a homogenized daily dataset of e601 across china from 1961 to 2018 based on this dataset we analyzed the long term trend of pan evaporation pan evaporation showed a 1 23 0 57 mm a 2 downward trend from 1961 1993 primarily caused by decreased pan evaporation in warm seasons over north china after 1993 the pan evaporation in south china increased significantly resulting in a 1 83 0 87 mm a 2 upward trend across china with better homogeneity and higher temporal resolution the new dataset is expected to promote drought monitoring hydrological modeling and water resources management free access to the dataset can be found at https figshare com s 0cdbd6b1dbf1e22d757e keywords pan evaporation small and large pans random forest model assimilation homogenization long term trend data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evaporation is a critical variable of the terrestrial water cycle which is crucial for studying the response and feedback of the water cycle to climate change fu et al 2009 as a routine meteorological observation pan evaporation indicates atmospheric evaporative demand and reflects environmental variables comprehensive effects on potential evapotranspiration roderick et al 2014 because of its simplicity and practicality pan evaporation has been observed worldwide in meteorological and hydrometric stations and is widely applied in agricultural schedules water source assessments and hydrological forecasting wang et al 2019a compared to newly observed technologies e g fluxes tower pan evaporation has a more extended history and better spatial coverage therefore it provides a reliable proxy for exploring the interannual variability and long term trend of terrestrial evaporation all types of pans provide ample water for evaporation so the critical factor controlling pan evaporation is the absorbed energy for the water in the evaporating pan based on the land atmosphere energy balance the water inside can absorb more energy used in evaporation with increasing air temperature thus in theory global warming is expected to increase pan evaporation wang et al 2012 however the observed pan evaporation did not show a corresponding upward trend and even decreased in several areas known as the pan evaporation paradox brutsaert and parlange 1998 roderick and farquhar 2002 so far debate remains over whether or why the pan evaporation paradox occurs and one of the key reasons is the inhomogeneities in the observation of pan evaporation fu et al 2009 xing et al 2016 pan evaporation is determined by various climate variables and is very sensitive to the changes in the observed environment rezaie balf et al 2018 wang et al 2019c therefore the time series of pan evaporation are prone to inhomogeneity caused by non climatic shifts including station relocation instrument replacement etc these inhomogeneities will seriously weaken the confidence in the long term trends estimated from the observation of pan evaporation hobbins et al 2004 jovanovic et al 2008 previous studies have encountered that the downward trend of pan evaporation weakens or disappears after the quality control of observed records for homogeneity jovanovic et al 2008 rayner 2007 robinson 1999 the inhomogeneities of pan evaporation include two main parts firstly the pan evaporation has various shifts in the time series caused by non climatic factors e g station relocation the standard homogenization methods are based on statistical models to detect the abrupt changes in the mean and probability distribution in observed records the most accurate way is to match a homogeneous reference series with similar climate conditions and observe practices with the target series it is common practice to match a homogeneous record from adjacent stations as the reference series however due to instrument upgrades pan evaporation has a larger spatial heterogeneity and less homogeneous records it is challenging to match the reference series for the target series through adjacent stations previous studies had to select another homogenization approach which does not require metadata and reference series wang et al 2019a but this approach would reduce the accuracy in the detection and correction of homogenization wang and feng 2013 secondly and more importantly the inconsistent in observed records was caused by the updating of observation instruments for example after the 1980s the evaporating pan gradually updated from d20 to e601 across china li et al 2016b due to different structures and installation methods the upgraded pan evaporation significantly differs in values and probability density distributions from before bruton et al 2000 li et al 2022 given the dramatic changes in pan evaporation before and after the upgrade it is essential to assimilate them to the consistent variable before homogenization based on the synchronous observation between d20 and e601 the early method used a conversion coefficient or empirical model to assimilate them into a consistent record abudu et al 2011 xiong et al 2012 however their performance had significant spatial temporal heterogeneity and could not fit the nonlinear interactivities between pan evaporation and other climate variables niu et al 2021 hence those simple assimilation approaches have substantial biases especially for regional daily scales consequently recent studies developed several physical based models to assimilate different types of pan evaporation lim et al 2016 wang et al 2018 yang and yang 2012 those models fully consider the aerodynamic and thermodynamic process and can efficiently simulate the vapor heat radiation transfer of pan evaporation wang et al 2018 therefore they performed better than the conversion coefficient methods or empirical models however the physical based models are based on a steady state energy balance assumption which requires a typical integration period of at least one week in summer and up to one month in winter hence it is hard to simulate the microphysical process of evaporating pan in diurnal variabilities and assimilate pan evaporation daily lim et al 2016 qiu et al 2022 additionally the models cannot simulate ice sublimation and are prone to ignore the pan evaporation during the ice period which may increase the uncertainty of pan evaporation in high altitude latitude zones recently the machine learning model as a data driven model has been widely applied in the assimilation and interpolation of climate data for its advantage in dealing with the complicated nonlinear relationship among climate variables kişi 2013 niu et al 2021 qasem et al 2019 lu et al 2018 evaluated several models for predicting the daily pan evaporation from related meteorological variables and found that the machine learning models performed better in prediction accuracy and model stability than empirical models el bilali et al 2023 develop an interpretable machine learning model to estimate daily pan evaporation and found that the model accurately captures the daily variations of pan evaporation and has an interpretability consistent well with the actual hydro climatic processes in a semi arid environment previous studies suggested that the tree based machine learning model performs well in reproducing diurnal pan evaporation and is more physically interoperable in assessing the importance of input variables wang et al 2017b the physical based and tree based machine learning models have an advantage in reproducing monthly and daily variations respectively therefore in this study we combined them into a hybrid model to assimilate d20 into e601 and thus produced a consistent series for daily pan evaporation then we used the hybrid model with the homogenous variables as input to create the reference series for correcting the non climatic shifts this scheme can solve the problems due to fewer homogenous records and larger spatial heterogeneity thus significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of homogenization for pan evaporation especially in regions with sparse stations finally based on the homogenized dataset we evaluated the long term trend and spatial pattern of pan evaporation over the past 60 years in china 2 dataset and methods 2 1 dataset the dataset used in our study was provided by the national climatic center of the china meteorological administration ncc cma http www nmic gov cn the daily records in this dataset were collected from 2400s stations in mainland china from 1951 to 2018 see fig 1 including daily maximum minimum mean air temperatures tmax tmin tmean wind speed ws sunshine duration ssd relative humidity rh pan evaporation of d20 e601b pans and so on cao et al 2016 du et al 2017 all observed records had undergone strict quality controls including assessment of spatiotemporal consistency identification of outliers and correction of suspicious and erroneous data du et al 2020 please refer to the supplementary material for more information on data quality controls as shown in fig 1 the spatial pattern of the meteorological stations over china is asymmetric much denser in east china than in west china we used the area weight average method to reduce these biases when calculating the national mean first we divided the study region into 1 1 grids covering china then we assigned all stations to the grids and the number of stations in each grid is shown in fig s1 there were 689 grids containing the valid stations accounting for 72 45 of the total finally the grid box value was the average of all selected stations in the grid and the national mean the area weight average of all valid grids note that this method may result in representativeness errors due to the bias between the grid s value and the stations average especially for grids with fewer stations and complicated terrain besides surface solar radiation rs is the primary energy source of pan evaporation and an essential variable for related physical models however due to the complex practices and expensive cost at most 130s stations provided the observation records of surface solar radiation in mainland china tang et al 2011 additionally instruments sensitivity drift and replacements resulted in a non climatic faster dimming before 1990 and a false sharp increase in observed rs from 1990 1993 wang 2014 the sparse stations and severe quality problems limit the application of observed rs in the assimilation and homogenization of pan evaporation therefore we derived rs from sunshine duration by an effective model developed by yang et al 2006 and improved by subsequent studies he et al 2018 more detailed information for the rs derived model was given by du et al 2018 sunshine duration derived rs performed well in revealing variabilities of surface solar radiation and accurately reflected the effects of clouds and aerosols magee et al 2014 wang and zeng 2012 additionally sunshine duration derived rs values are better consistent with the satellite retrievals reanalysis and model simulations than observed rs wang et al 2015 two observation instruments measure pan evaporation in meteorological stations d20 and e601 the d20 pan is a cylindrical copper barrel with a 10 cm depth and 20 cm diameter wang et al 2019c it is installed on a frame 70cm above the ground see fig s2 early pan evaporation is observed by the d20 pan which was generally replaced by the e601b pan across mainland china after 2002 the e601 pan is a cylindrical barrel made of white fiberglass with a depth of 68 7 cm and a diameter of 61 8 cm it is buried in the soil and the top is 30cm over the ground fig s3 usually pan evaporation is the level change of the free water surface in pans when the water surface is frozen it is measured by the weight change of the evaporating pan different from the detachable pan of d20 the pans of e601 are fixed on the ground and cannot be detached to weigh on freezing days therefore e601 cannot work and meteorological stations would reuse d20 to observe pan evaporation during freezing periods as a result meteorological stations have no synchronous observation of e601 and d20 used to train the model during the freezing period fortunately the hydrometric station will use movable e601 pans to observe pan evaporation when the water is frozen which can provide the synchronous observation of e601 and d20 during the freezing period we selected 134 hydrometric stations over regions where the water will freeze in winter see fig 1 which provide training samples for the nearby meteorological stations to develop the conversion model between d20 and e601 in the freezing period 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 assimilation models due to the replacement from d20 to e601 the pans size and installation changes made significant inconsistencies in the observed record to correct this problem we divide the changes in pan evaporation into monthly and daily changes on a monthly scale the evaporation pan is considered in a steady state energy balance namely that the energy change of the entire pan has little effect on pan evaporation wang et al 2018 developed the penpan v3 model based on existing penman style models and observation of pan evaporation in china compared with the semi empirical fitting approaches the penpan v3 model is entirely physical and performs better in simulating variabilities of pan evaporation on a monthly scale therefore we used the penpan v3 model to indicate the monthly changes of e601 in this study 1 m p s s β γ r n λ ρ w β γ s β γ v p d m w r ρ w t a d v ρ a n u 2 l η a q l where the detailed information for above parameters is shown in table 1 as mentioned above the penpan v3 model is based on a steady state energy balance assumption which for a e601 pan requires at least one week in summer and up to one month in winter so the all parameters in equation is estimated by the monthly input data daily there are energy changes in the pan and water body therefore from meteorological factors pan evapotranspiration is affected by energy changes in the pan water body and the pan wall previous research attempts to develop physical models based on boundary layer theory to fit the daily variabilities of pan evaporation however these models need the information of fluid motion and water temperature as input qiu et al 2022 because the meteorological station did not record such information limiting the application of those models in the assimilation of daily observation pan fortunately based on long term observation data in china we found that d20 and e601 also have a very significant linear correlation on a daily scale and the difference between them has an obvious spatial and temporal pattern which can be explained well by relevant meteorological variables see section 3 2 therefore based on the d20 combined with the time spatial and meteorological information we constructed a random forest algorithm model to characterize the daily variation of e601 see fig s4 2 d p f d 20 l a t l o n h j d a y d l e n r s t s

dlen is the length of daytime rs ts tmax tmin ta p pa u2 and rh indicate the solar radiation daily temperatures daily maximum minimum mean near surface air temperature precipitation air pressure wind speed and relative humidity respectively for more information on the random forest model please see the supplementary material to combine the two models in a hybrid model we first decompose the time series of pan evaporation into monthly and daily variations the decomposition method first train and optimize the penpan v3 model using monthly time series then we use the optimized penpan v3 model to provide a monthly time series of pan evaporation mp then we use the daily observation to subtract mp the residual part is the daily variations of pan evaporation then we use the residual time series as the dependent variable and pan evaporation from d20 related meteorological variables and spatiotemporal information as the independent variable to train the random forest model we use the random forest model to reproduce the daily variation of pan evaporation dp finally we combine the mp produced by the penpan v3 model with dp simulated by the random forest model as shown in equation 3 see fig 2 3 e 601 m p d p the above hybrid models are based on the prerequisite that liquid water is in the evaporating pan when the water in the evaporating pan freezes the physical process of water evaporation in the evaporating dish clock changes significantly from water evaporation to ice sublimation because the current physical models cannot effectively simulate the sublimation process in the evaporating pan most studies set the pan evaporation during the freezing period as 0 or use the pan evaporation of d20 during the freezing period to replace the value of e601 directly it leads to apparent pan evaporation biases during northern china s freezing period to overcome this shortcoming we constructed a conversion model between d20 and e601 during the freezing period which is suitable for the winter in northern china 4 e 601 θ m d 20 equation 4 uses conversion coefficients to estimate e601 from d20 in the freezing period we used the synchronous observation recorded by our hydrometric station to calculate the conversion coefficient from d20 to e601 then we use the inverse distance weight method to evaluate the conversion coefficient of the meteorological station based on the surrounding hydrological stations 5 θ m i 1 n q i θ i m i 1 n q i where qi indicates the distance from target station to the i th hydrometric stations m denotes the month of the conversion coefficient to test the performance of the model we utilized ten cross validation methods firstly we will randomly select 75 of the data from the training dataset to train the hybrid model and then use the remaining 25 to test the model performance then repeat the validation process ten times and evaluate the accuracy and stability of the model based on the average and variability of the ten validation results the percentage of bias pbias the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the performance of the hybrid model 6 p b i a s i n o i m i

the pbias and rmse indicate the relative and absolute error of model output respectively nse is used to exclude the influence of mean difference on the evaluation of model output which is ranged from negative infinity to 1 the higher the simulation accuracy of the model the closer the nse value is to 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 ogden et al 2015 wang et al 2017a 2 2 2 homogenization method based on the hybrid model we assimilated pan evaporation from d20 and e601 in a continuous and consistent series of e601 however most of these time series have several non climatic shifts caused by changes in station locations observing practices and station environment which causes significant biases in detecting and attributing long term trends to adjust these shifts we used the rhtestsv4 a robust statistical method developed by wang 2008 to detect and correct non climatic influences on the time series of e601 rhtest v4 has been widely used by nnc cma and previous studies for climate data homogenization since it is practical to detect non climatic shifts in the time series of observed records and estimate their magnitude sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2013 due to the lack of homogenized reference and metadata previous studies had to use the pmf algorithm to detect the shifts in the time series of pan evaporation wang et al 2019a however this algorithm which only depends on mathematical statistics will significantly reduce the reliability of the detection for non climatic shifts on the one hand this algorithm cannot determine whether the identified shifts are caused by non climatic factors or climate change as a result the abrupt signals in climate change may be misjudged as non climatic shifts and removed on the other hand due to the different sensitivity of different meteorological variables to the impact of non factors there are differences in the probability of these breakpoints being detected and corrected resulting in the homogenized data which will break the physical consistency of pan evaporation with other meteorological variables thus improve the uncertainty in attribution analysis wang 2008 wang and feng 2013 here we use the hybrid model with homogeneous climate variables as input to produce a homogeneous e601 as a reference series for every station the only difference from the assimilation model see eq 4 is that we no longer use d20 as the input when training and deriving the random forest term see eq 3 in the hybrid model although this will reduce the accuracy of derived e601 daily it can ensure the homogeneity of the time series thus providing a homogeneous reference for the assimilated e601 at the target station compared to matching the reference series from adjacent stations the reference series derived by the hybrid model is better consistent with the target series in variabilities and long term trends see fig s5 then we selected the penalized maximal t test algorithm in rhtestsv4 which is recommended because it has better performance detecting the non climatic shifts in time series to test the homogeneity of the time series of the assimilated e601 wang and feng 2013 wang et al 2007 after seeing the change need to use two processes to determine whether climatic or non climatic factors cause these shifts first we use the metadata of the weather station to check whether the weather station has moved replaced instruments automated transformation and other activities when the shift occurs if it happens it implies that non climatic factors probably cause the shift secondly we need to check whether similar shifts co occur in the surrounding weather stations when the inhomogeneous breakpoints occur if they coincide the shift is probably caused by regional climate change rather than non climatic factors through two tests we screen out shifts caused by non climatic factors then use the qm algorithm provided by rhtest v4 to correct these shifts the non climatic shifts divide the time series into several segments the qm algorithm adjusts the empirical distribution of all segments to be consistent with a specific target segment the qm algorithm s adjustment value depends on the datum s empirical cumulative frequency to be adjusted which varies between different datum within the same segment depending on their corresponding empirical frequency therefore qm algorithm can adjust the non climatic changes in both the mean value and the probability density distribution cao et al 2016 wang 2008 the main processes of assimilation and homogenization are shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial pattern of pan evaporation during 1960 2018 more than 2400 weather stations observed pan evaporation across china as shown in fig 3 a the station number for d20 and e601 changed significantly before 1980 all stations used d20 to measure pan evaporation during 1980 2002 some stations began to use e601 and the number increased gradually however there was no apparent change in the number of d20 stations in this period indicating that most stations continued the observation of d20 after adding e601 therefore there were extensive parallel observations of d20 and e601 during this period since 2002 china s weather station has carried out a large scale automatic transformation the measurement of pan evaporation has gradually upgraded from manual observation to automatic observation using ultrasonic ranging xiong et al 2012 as a result the stations equipped with automated e601 began to stop using d20 and thus the synchronous observation stations dropped sharply after 2014 only about 500 stations kept the observation of d20 which is mainly distributed in north china to observe pan evaporation when the inside water is frozen on the contrary the number of stations for e601 has gradually increased becoming the primary evaporating pan of china s weather stations in spatial the station of d20 was much denser than that of e601 and thus has better spatial coverage and can provide more detailed information for the regional pan evaporation especially for areas with sparse stations see fig 3b there are 745 stations with the synchronous observation between d20 and e601 which cover most of mainland china and have an average of 2214 days equal to 6 1 years of synchronous records see fig 3c additionally the duration of synchronous observations has distinct interannual and spatial variabilities it is longest in low latitudes and gradually decreases from south to north especially in cold seasons see fig 3d the main reason for this spatiotemporal difference is that e601 cannot work during the freezing period the above results show that d20 has denser observation stations and more extended records which can provide more details of pan evaporation and make up for the lack of e601 during the freezing period compared with d20 the pan evaporation of e601 is closer to the natural water surface evaporation and gradually replaced d20 as the main pan of china s meteorological stations therefore integrating d20 and e601 to build a continuous series is the key to studying the response of pan evaporation to climate change in china fortunately the station observation has long term synchronous observation between d20 and e601 with good spatial coverage which makes it possible to develop the assimilation model of pan evaporations 3 2 relationship between d20 and e601 based on synchronous observation we analyze the relationship between d20 and e601 as shown in fig 4 a e601 has a robust linear relationship with d20 r2 0 79 across china see fig 4b and the pan evaporation of e601 is generally about half of that of d20 ratio 0 54 therefore previous studies were prone to use a constant value to convert d20 to e601 shen et al 2022 xiong et al 2012 however the ratio between e601 and d20 has apparent temporal and spatial heterogeneity see fig 4c in spatial the ratio of e601 to d20 is the highest in southern china and gradually decreases from south to north the average ratio of latitude zone drops from 0 55 around n20 to 0 47 around n50 see fig 4d additionally apart from n10 20 the ratio in other regions is the highest in january or december and the lowest in march or april above all the conversion coefficient method would lead to apparent conversion deviation especially daily or regional scale further based on partial correlation analysis we explored the contribution of related meteorological variables to the difference between d20 and e601 δde d20 e601 the results show that surface solar radiation rs and daily maximum temperatures tmax have a significant positive relationship with δde explaining 38 1 and 23 7 of the daily variations respectively see figs 5 b and f an alternative explanation is that the evaporating pan of d20 is smaller and suspended in air thus having a smaller heat capacity and larger surface proportion contact with solar radiation and air as a result the pan evaporation of d20 is more sensitive to rs and tmax than e601 in contrast the partial correlation coefficients for relative humidity rh and precipitation p with δde are negative indicating rain or high humidity would reduce the difference between d20 and e601 see fig 5e and h other variables including wind speed air pressure and daily minimum temperature have no significant effect on δde as a whole the meteorological variables can explain 92 6 variabilities of δde indicating it is feasible to use d20 and related meteorological variables to reproduce e601 fig 5i 3 3 evaluation of the assimilated model according to the above results we developed a hybrid model that combined physical and random forest models to derive the e601 from d20 and related meteorological variables on a daily scale firstly based on cross validation we compared the performance of four different assimilation schemes the conversion coefficients method cm the random forest model rfm eq 2 the panpen v3 model pm eq 1 the hybrid model of rfm and pm rfm pm eq 3 as shown in fig 6 a both rfm and pm have a higher nse than cm indicating they have a better performance in conversion accuracy additionally the pm is lower than rfm in the spatial difference of nse and exhibits better stability under different conditions note that the steady state condition is not satisfied when the pm model is used daily which would reduce its performance hence we use the pm model to simulate the monthly variability and rfm to simulate the daily variability for e601 fig 6a shows that the hybrid model has a significantly higher nse and lower standard deviation than other models this result indicates that the hybrid model has higher accuracy and stable performance in different regions and periods exhibiting better applicability in deriving daily e601 this result indicates that pm and rfm have an excellent complementary relationship with each other in reproducing the daily variation of pan evaporation further we evaluated the input variables contribution to the daily variability of e601 the results show that d20 has a main contribution and can explain 42 8 of the daily variation of e601 followed by rs rh and tmax which respectively explained 8 5 11 9 the contribution of other variables is relatively small and less than 5 the contributions of input meteorological variables are consistent with their partial correlation with de see fig 5 we also analyze the case without d20 as the input after removing d20 the derived e601 have no significant change in the mean value the model s performance has declined somewhat in daily shifts and long term trends figs s6a c but the decline is at most 16 9 see figs s6d the results suggested that other input variables can effectively compensate for the information loss due to removing d20 therefore it is feasible to use homogenous variables as input to prepare reference series for pan evaporation records after assimilation moreover when there is no d20 observation while other variables are complete the e601 can also be interpolated in this way additionally we found that the size of the training sample for the hybrid model is the critical factor affecting the model s performance the training sample size has a significant positive negative relationship with the r2 rmse which indicates that more training samples can efficiently improve the model s performance in capturing daily variability see figs 6b c as shown in fig 6d the trend deviation decreased fast with the sample size and trend to stable around 0 2 mm a 2 5 3 of total trend after the sample size of more than five years about 1800 samples therefore we must ensure that every station has more than five years of training samples to ensure that the derived e601 has good consistency with the observed e601 in long term trends according to the above results we selected the hybrid model rfm pm to convert d20 into e601 with other variables we use the principle of proximity to select training samples and ensure that the training sample size exceeds 1800 days for every station then based on rmse and nse we further refine the training samples to improve model accuracy and stability finally we used the trained model to derive daily e601 from d20 and related meteorological variables as shown in fig 7 a the derived e601 compares well with the observed value r2 0 94 the rmse and nse are 0 41 mm day 1 and 0 94 indicating that the hybrid model is accurate and stable daily in spatial both rmse and trend bias are relatively larger in the north china and tibetan plateau figs 7b and d these regions have freezing periods and sparse stations which could make it against assimilation accuracy to test the consistency of the observed and derived e601 in daily variability we conducted the correlation analysis on the detrended anomaly series without trend and seasonal cycle as shown in figs 5c except for parts of southern tibet the correlation coefficient of most of china exceeds 0 8 with an average of 0 92 the trend bias of derived e601 was larger in northern china and declined from north to south see fig 7d combining the derived and observed e601 we can get a consistent series of daily e601 for 2000s stations during 1960 2018 see figs 7e f 3 4 homogenization of the assimilated e601 after assimilating kinds of pan evaporation into e601 the records still have abrupt breakpoints caused by non climatic factors including station relocation instrument replacement and automation transformation see fig 8a we must detect and correct these non climatic shifts before estimating the long term trend of pan evaporation based on rhtest v4 software and metadata 9811 shifts were detected of which 6412 were confirmed as non climatic shifts they are distributed in the records from 2120 stations accounting for 99 7 of the total number of stations in spatial non climatic shifts are more concentrated in the eastern areas of china which experienced rapid urbanization in the past decades see fig 8 b most meteorological stations in china are located in the suburbs of cities cities fast expansion destroyed the original observation environment of meteorological stations leading to their relocation and the occurrence of non climatic shifts in observation records in addition the number of shifts varies significantly over time the year with the most breakpoints was around 2003 corresponding to china s large scale automatic transformation of meteorological stations following the 1980s the e601 began to be applied and gradually replaced d20 in some stations causing numerous non climatic shifts during the period of 1980 to 1985 see fig 8c after detecting these shifts we corrected them by qm algorithm from rhtest software wang et al 2010 wang et al 2007 finally we produced a homogeneous daily dataset of e601 in 2125 stations in china during 1960 2018 note that during the 1960s there was a significant change in the number of valid stations which increased from 1479 in 1961 to 2047 in 1968 and tended to stabilize since then see fig 8d however the number of valid grids in 1961 was only 48 6 97 less than that in 1968 hence the number change of valid stations has less effect on the national mean pan evaporation trend analysis 3 5 annual variabilities of pan evaporation based on the observed and homogenized dataset we analyzed the interannual variability and long term trend of pan evaporation during 1961 2018 over china d20 was consistent well with e601 in interannual variability during 1961 2002 see fig 9 for the long term trend there was an obvious turning point for pan evaporation trends in 1993 during 1960 1993 d20 decreased at 3 75 2 45 mm a 2 and about twice the reduction rate of the assimilated e601 2 35 1 68 mm a 2 given that the average value of e601 is about half of d20 the decline rate of pan evaporation measured by d20 is similar to that of e601 after homogenization the decline rate of e601 reduced to 1 23 0 93 mm a 2 namely that the 47 6 decline rate can be attributed to the inhomogeneity in pan evaporation before 1993 during 1993 2018 the e601 increased significantly and had no apparent difference in the increasing rate before and after homogenization which was 1 80 1 09 mm a 2 and 1 83 1 43 mm a 2 respectively after homogenization e601 showed a significant trend with a rate of 0 285 0 159 mm a 2 from 1961 to 2018 the trend of pan evaporation has significant seasonal differences and spatial patterns as shown in table 2 the change rate of e601 in warm seasons is about three times higher than in cold seasons from 1961 to 1993 the decline of pan evaporation was mainly distributed in northern china especially in the north china plain in contrast the pan evaporation in south china has no noticeable change and even shows a specific upward trend figs 10 a c from 1993 to 2018 pan evaporation increased mainly in southern china and part regions in northwestern china see figs 10d f in the past 60 years pan evaporation decreased significantly in the north china plain and parts of northern xinjiang especially in warm seasons other regions had an increasing trend and no noticeable seasonal difference see figs 10g i 4 discussion 4 1 hybrid model performance and controlling factors in this study the results indicate that machine learning and physical models perform significantly better than traditional empirical models consistent with previous studies feng et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b however there is still no consensus on which is better for machine learning and physical models on a monthly scale physical models have precise physical mechanisms and better interpretability and adaptability making them more widely used in pan evaporation s assimilation and attribution analysis stephens et al 2018 yang and yang 2012 our results also indicate that physical models perform better regarding model spatial stability especially in areas with sparse stations such as northwest china see fig 6a in contrast the machine learning models are the black box models without prior knowledge of the underlying physical processes they can be trained with a large number of samples to predicting pan evaporation from input variables kisi 2015 tezel and buyukyildiz 2016 thus it is more available in complex environments and daily scales than physical models el bilali et al 2023 shabani et al 2020 however machine learning models are sensitive to the sample size so they have significant uncertainty in areas with sparse stations or short records al mukhtar 2021 as mentioned above there is an excellent complementary relationship between machine learning models and physical models theoretically better performance can be achieved if they are combined into a hybrid model our results proved that the hybrid model has better accuracy and stability pbias is 0 45 rmse is 0 41 mm day 1 and nse is 0 94 than random forest model or physical model see fig 6a the performance of the hybrid model is not only much higher than the standard proposed by ogden et al 2015 pbias 25 and nse 0 5 but also better or compatible in overall accuracy and stability compared to previous studies nse ranging from 0 52 0 96 el bilali et al 2023 lu et al 2018 niu et al 2021 the model s input variables are essential in predicting pan evaporation increasing input variables can theoretically provide more information to improve the model s performance however for physical models more variables might generate an over fitted complex model resulting in poor accuracy adamowski et al 2011 wang et al 2017b found that models based on linear regression or physical models are susceptible to missing values of input variables especially some critical variables such as solar radiation by comparing physical models with different combinations of input variables previous studies indicate that the machine learning models with more input variables generally had better accuracy without overfitting wu et al 2020 as shown in fig 6b the hybrid model similar to tree based machine learning models can effectively fill the information gap caused by d20 loss by improving the importance of other related variables thus effectively reducing the impact of the missing value on the model accuracy additionally the hybrid model can provide the importance of input variables with robust physical interpretability see fig 6b existing studies have evaluated the contribution of input variables in predicting pan evaporation and drawn different conclusions some studies believe solar radiation and air temperature are more effective in modeling pan evaporation wang et al 2017b in contrast others think that the contributions of relative humidity and wind speed are more important yan et al 2019 an alternative explanation is that the divergence is due to differences in parameterization schemes time scales and climate background among previous studies based on partial correlation analysis and hybrid model evaluation we found that on a daily scale solar radiation is the essential meteorological variable affecting pan evaporation followed by relative humidity see fig 5i however we found significant differences in the variables importance between the partial correlation analysis and the hybrid model fig 5i and fig 6b for example wind speed has a low correlation with pan evaporation but is of more significant importance in the hybrid model previous studies have also found a similar phenomenon wang et al 2017b which implies that the hybrid model can identify nonlinear relationships that cannot be identified by linear correlation analysis between wind speed and pan evaporation thus has a better performance than linear regression models 4 2 spatial pattern and seasonal contrast of pan evaporation an essential purpose of the observation networks for pan evaporation is to identify the climatology of potential evaporation previous studies reported that average annual pan evaporation ranged from 1613 to 1662 mm yr 1 based on d20 cong et al 2009 li et al 2016a niu et al 2021 we used the observation from 2145 stations and estimated the national area weighted average of d20 pan evaporation which was 1607 mm yr 1 slightly lower than previous studies based on the new dataset of e601 the annual pan evaporation in china was 973 mm yr 1 during 1961 2018 which was in the range of previous studies 921 1049 mm yr 1 li et al 2016a niu et al 2021 there are many alternative reasons for differences in the evaluation of annual pan evaporation among different studies such as the station number and interpolation methods our study used observations from more than 2000 stations providing more detailed information and better spatial coverage than previous studies fewer than 800 stations besides estimating the e601 pan evaporation during the freezing period is vital for annual evaporation existing studies set the e601 pan evaporation equal to zero or d20 pan evaporation when the pan water is frozen wang et al 2019a however by comparing the synchronous observation of d20 with the e601 from surrounding hydrologic stations the ratio of pan evaporation between d20 and e601 ranged from 0 23 to 0 78 during the freezing period therefore previous approaches would underestimate or overestimate the annual pan evaporation here we constructed a conversion model using d20 observations from the weather station and synchronous e601 observations from neighboring hydrologic stations thus converting d20 observations into e601 during the freezing periods compared to the above two schemes our method can provide a more accurate estimation for the pan evaporation of e601 during the freezing period as shown in figs s7 the spatial pattern of pan evaporation is consistent with previous studies li et al 2016a niu et al 2021 wang et al 2019a the regions with the highest pan evaporation are the southern tibetan plateau and the xinjiang province in china followed by the southern regions of china the sichuan basin the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river while the eastern regions of northeast china have the lowest pan evaporation see fig 7g there are also significant differences in the spatial pattern of pan evaporation between the warm and cold seasons in the warm seasons the pan evaporation of china is the highest in the northwest of china and gradually decreases to the southeast see fig 7h in the cold seasons pan evaporation is highest in southwest china followed by coastal areas in south china pan evaporation in other regions shows the apparent latitude belt distribution gradually decreasing from south to north see figs s7i the spatial patterns and seasonal contrast of pan evaporation estimated by the new dataset also agreed well with existing studies xiong et al 2012 besides pan evaporation numerous models have been proposed to estimate potential evaporation including aerodynamic temperature based radiation based and combination methods yang et al 2021 compared to previous studies the aerodynamics and combined methods have a more similar spatial pattern with pan evaporation estimated by the new dataset one important reason is that these two methods mainly estimate potential evapotranspiration through relative humidity and wind speed figs s8 shows that the essential climate variables for pan evaporation are relative humidity and wind speed which explain 70 84 spatial variation of pan evaporation which is consistent with previous studies zuo et al 2005 note that the spatial pattern of d20 is generally consistent with those of raw e601 and adjusted e601 see figs s7 without the significant difference mentioned in previous studies wang et al 2019a as shown in figs s8 for d20 and e601 the leading variables affecting the pan evaporation are relative humidity and wind speed the differences in pan evaporation between d20 and e601 are mainly distributed in areas with sparse stations or long freezing periods li et al 2016a xiong et al 2012 besides as shown in figs s8b the e601 can effectively reduce the impact of precipitation on pan evaporation thus enabling a more accurate assessment of the spatial pattern of pan evaporation especially in areas or seasons with high precipitation 4 3 interannual variability and long term trend evaporation is a critical component of the global terrestrial water cycle and affects regional climate change by adjusting the land atmosphere energy balance dai et al 2018 as a routine observation of evaporation pan evaporation has a more extended record and better spatial coverage than other observations e g fluxes tower therefore many previous studies try to explore the response of evaporation to climate change by analyzing the trend of pan evaporation mozny et al 2020 roderick et al 2009 roderick et al 2007 as mentioned above most existing studies used d20 to study the long term pan evaporation trends and extend the d20 time series by assimilating e601 or model simulation after 2002 jin et al 2022 wang et al 2019a the d20 decreased by 5 48 to 1 72 mm a 2 before the 1990s and increased by 1 05 to 7 90 mm a 2 after the 1990s table s2 in this study d20 decreased significantly by 3 75 2 45 mm a 2 during 1961 1993 and compared well with previous studies see fig 8 by the hybrid model we converted the d20 into e601 and found a downward trend of e601 during this period the trend was 2 35 1 68 and 1 23 0 57 mm a 2 before and after homogenization by comparison the downward trend of pan evaporation may be exaggerated by d20 and the inhomogeneities before the 1990s during 1993 2018 the e601 showed an upward trend increasing at 1 80 1 09 mm a 2 and 1 83 1 43 mm a 2 before and after homogenization respectively the inhomogeneities had less effect on the trend estimation during this period using linear conversion coefficients guan et al 2022 converted d20 into e601 based on parallel observations and found a 0 60 mm a 2 decreasing trend of e601 during 1961 2018 which is consistent with our results 0 29 0 35 mm a 2 before homogenization after homogenization the trend of e601 turned downward to upward and increased by 0 285 0 159 mm a 2 from 1961 2018 compared to previous studies we found that they had good consistency in the interannual change of pan evaporation and most experienced a process from decline to increase however there are apparent differences in the trend rate among existing studies including ours there are three alternative reasons for this difference the first is the difference in evaporating pan before 2002 most meteorological stations in china had mainly measured pan evaporation by d20 and d20 has continuous observation including the freezing period so most of the existing studies prefer to use d20 to evaluate the trend of pan evaporation especially some early studies however d20 has a copper pan wall and a smaller water capacity so it is more sensitive to changes in solar radiation than the actual natural water surface wang et al 2019b quantified the contributions of the water body and pan wall on the trends of d20 found that the pan wall changed the trend rate by 16 5 21 7 in contrast the pan wall of e601 is made of white fiberglass with a larger water capacity reducing the impact of the pan wall on the measurement of pan evaporation hence e601 is closer to the actual water surface so its trend is more helpful in exploring the response and feedback of terrestrial evaporation to climate change fu et al 2004 the second is the number of stations used in trend analysis the number of stations used in previous studies ranged from 55 to 806 a small number of sites lead to poor spatial representation especially in many western regions where no relevant sites provide data fig 9 shows significant spatial heterogeneity in the long term trend of pan evaporation when the spatial coverage of the station varies greatly it is bound to lead to differences in the national mean trends in our research we collected the pan evaporation observation from 2125 stations much more than the station number of previous studies achieving better space coverage in addition we converted usable stations into 1 1 grids to reduce the bias caused by uneven station distribution finally the inhomogeneity of pan evaporation records also plays a critical role in the trend difference as mentioned above many non climatic shifts in raw records of pan evaporation can cause trend biases especially for fewer stations used in studies jovanovic et al 2008 wang et al 2019a selected the penalized maximal f test algorithm in rhtests4 to detect and correct non climatic shifts in pan evaporation without metadata and reference series here we prepared reference series for each station based on the homogenized meteorological data and the hybrid model we identified the detected shifts by the penalized maximal t test in rhtests4 and furtherly checked them with metadata which can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of homogenization wang et al 2010 4 4 uncertainties of model derived e601 there are still some biases in the daily e601 dataset after assimilation and homogenization rmse and trend bias are larger in northern china and tibet plateau than in other areas all those areas have a freezing period in cold seasons the assimilation scheme still has deficiencies in reproducing pan evaporation during the freezing period especially for the freeze thaw process however the pan evaporation during the freezing period accounts for a small proportion 0 81 9 21 of the annual total so the bias in the freezing period would have less effect on the estimation of trends and yearly variations in addition we estimate the national average based on all areas covered by observation stations excluding areas without station observations such as the hinterland of tibetan plateau and the taklamakan desert how to integrate multi source data including satellite remote sensing and reanalysis products to accurately estimate pan evaporation in areas without station observations is a critical issue that we need to focus on in latter research 5 conclusion based on observations from 2000s stations over china during 1961 2018 we found a robust correlation between two evaporative pans d20 and e601 their differences in pan evaporation can be well explained by relevant climate variables such as solar radiation based on ten cross validation the hybrid model performed well in reproducing the absolute value rmse 0 41 mm day 1 and daily variability r2 0 94 when the sample size is longer than five years the trend bias tends to stabilize at 0 2 mm a 2 accounting for about 5 6 of the total trend then we assimilated all pan evaporation into e601 by the hybrid model and produced a homogeneous and consistent daily dataset from 1961 to 2018 over china the main advantages of the new dataset are as follows 1 the new dataset assimilates pan evaporation from 2000s meteorological stations in china which is superior to the existing dataset in terms of spatial coverage and station density thus providing more detailed information on the spatial pattern 2 the new dataset has increased the time resolution of pan evaporation from the monthly scale to the daily scale and constructed 58 year continuous records from 1961 2018 thus it has a longer time series and higher temporal resolution other existing dataset 3 due to the use of a new estimation of pan evaporation when the water in pan freezes it can effectively improve the accuracy in interpolation the missing value of e601 during freezing periods in northern china above all the new dataset is continuous and consistent with higher spatiotemporal resolution which would provide better support for detecting and attributing extreme climate events hydrologic and climatic modeling and refined water resources management further we continue optimizing the assimilation model by observing experiments under different conditions e g developing more physical models to replace the black box models and improving their physical interpretability daily 6 data
