11275,in water scarce areas policy makers frequently opt for water conservation and saving technologies wcsts as a measure to ensure resource use sustainability although this policy is subject to scientific and political debate this paper presents an application of an integrated methodological approach for analysing the costs and benefits of using wcsts to achieve water policy objectives the focus is on the measures aimed at reducing irrigation water abstraction under the 1st and 2nd cycle of water framework directive implementation in the guadalquivir river basin southern spain the method is a combination of a multicriteria assessment of the main effects of water saving investments at basin level estimated using a selected group of indicators in a second stage a cost benefit analysis is conducted the study finds a benefit to cost ratio of 4 1 1 for the guadalquivir river basin thus concluding that irrigation modernization in this case study has been a good social investment the method can be extended to other hydrological systems aquifer basins to draw general conclusions keywords water framework directive irrigation efficiency irrigated agriculture water conservation and saving technologies ecosystem services water economics 1 introduction the world s population is expected to grow to almost 10 billion by 2050 boosting agricultural demand leading to more intense competition for natural resources especially water that appears as one of the most limiting factors to deliver sustainable food and agricultural production while world population has rapidly increased the use of freshwater for human consumption agriculture industry and other uses has increased six fold with agriculture representing 70 of total water withdrawal and accounts for 86 of consumption fao 2017 nowadays water scarcity is considered one of the greatest risks facing the planet world economic forum 2016 water use describes the total water withdrawn by the farmer from its source when the seasonal crop irrigation requires 10 000 m3 even if the farm returns 30 percent of the withdrawn water to the watershed the farm still needs all 10 000 m3 to operate water consumption is the portion of water use that is consumed by crop transpiration and evaporation and is not returned to the hydrological system increasing irrigation efficiency has been suggested as a solution to water scarcity but its potential rebound effect increased ex post water consumption is receiving growing attention although improved irrigation efficiency may reduce water use some authors argue that paradoxically it may also increase water consumption perry et al 2017 unless strict governance measures are introduced to control increased consumption huang et al 2017 berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2018a b on the other hand modern irrigation technologies are considered a measure for climate change adaptation projected higher temperatures lower rainfall more frequent droughts and improving guaranteed water supply and water quality in a context of growing scarcity modern irrigation technologies may result in reduced water use but they frequently increase energy consumption due to pressurized networks and consequently greenhouse gas ghg emissions fernández garcía et al 2014 mushtaq et al 2013 unless improved application efficiency reduces pumping costs sanchis ibor et al 2016 both negative effects higher ghg emissions and likely rebound effects have been suggested as potential conflicts that may arise from increasing irrigation efficiency subsidies mushtaq et al 2013 analyse the climate change impact of irrigation modernization in australia although the analysis was limited to a financial effects and b emissions of co2eq due to the change from previous open channels to pressurized networks our approach takes into consideration additional effects of technological change a wider review of published literature analysing the effects of investment in irrigation water saving measures can be found in berbel et al 2015 perry et al 2017 european union water policy is largely based on the water framework directive wfd which sets out ambitious objectives for the quality and protection of all waters bodies ecological status quantitative status chemical status and protected area objectives the river basin management plans rbmps are a key element of the wfd providing the overall context for water management in the river basin district the rbmps in spain have been developed in line with the wfd agenda and include investment in irrigation water saving as part of the programme of measures the wfd art 11 proposes the use of cost effectiveness analysis cea as a general method for water policy decision making berbel et al 2011 while cost benefit analysis cba is recommended as a tool for dealing with possible derogation from environmental objectives provided for in wfd art 4 cea is a decision method that ranks intervention alternatives comparing relative costs in monetary terms and the relevant outcome under consideration measured in physical terms e g reduction in water withdrawal reduction of nitrogen load cba assigns a monetary value both to the cost and the effects nevertheless cba has rarely been applied in wfd implementation feuillette et al 2016 european commission 2015 this paper aims to contribute to the scarce literature on the use of cba in the specific context of the wfd and water saving investment and presents an application of cba to investment in irrigation water saving measures 2 case study after a severe drought during the 90 s the spanish ministry of agriculture approved an irrigation plan mapa 2001 in which the main measure was the transformation of old open channel distribution systems into pressurized pipe networks the goal of the plan was to save 3000 mm3 annually fernández garcía et al 2014 the second phase of irrigation modernization was linked to the development and approval of 1 st and 2nd cycle rbmps both under the wfd implementation berbel et al 2012 analyse the guadalquivir rbmp and the role of wcsts also called modernization the implementation of wcsts resulted in estimated water savings of 259 5 hm3 berbel et al 2011 the guadalquivir river basin grb contains 25 of spain s irrigated land and the longest of the southern rivers 657 km it can thus be considered one of the most important basins in spain it covers an area of 57 679 km2 and has a population of 4 3 million the basin has a mediterranean climate with a heterogeneous precipitation distribution the annual average temperature is 16 8 c and the annual average precipitation is 573 mm with a range between 260 mm and 983 mm standard deviation of 161 mm the average renewable resources that means the quantity of water that go into the basin each year amount to a median value of 5 1 km3 year berbel et al 2012 reservoirs storage capacity is through a complex and interconnected system of 65 dams have a global storage capacity of 8 5 km3 the main land uses in the basin are forestry 49 1 agriculture 47 2 urban areas 1 9 and wetlands 1 8 confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 fig 1 economic activities in the grb generated around 69 8 billion in 2015 equivalent to 7 of the value of spanish gdp over 71 of gva in the grb is concentrated in the service sector industrial activities amount to 16 of gva energy production 8 and agricultural production 5 global water abstractions in the grb are estimated at 3 8 km3 year confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 local and seasonal droughts cause aquifer salinization and environmental stress moreover water quality is a significant problem throughout the river basin the main sources of pollution include urban and industrial wastewater discharge erosion and nutrient and pesticide runoff from agricultural land confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 basin water agency was created in 1927 and today has a mixed success in water governance according hydrological plan 2015 39 of surface water bodies and 37 of groundwater bodies have an environmental status less than good due to quantitative or qualitative pressures confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 this figure is over eu average 50 but still unsatisfactory the best results in grb have been achieved in regulated surface water 80 of water supply where a minimum guaranteed environmental flow is defined and strictly respected as part of river protection water use overexploitation emerges in groundwater resources 19 of water supply where some aquifers are severely damaged such as the iconic doñana natural park area under pressure for high value berries scheffer et al 2015 and conflict is still unsettled while other aquifers in the basin have reached a sustainable governance management berbel et al 2018a b 3 methodology cba assigns values to non monetary flows e g reduced diffuse pollution with the aims to evaluate positive and negative consequences benefits and costs of economic activities by estimating the monetary flow associated with policy induced changes it can thus be used to assess policy making choy 2018 cba is an analytical tool for evaluating the economic advantages or disadvantages of an investment decision to assess the welfare change attributable to it this tool has been used in hydro economic decision making contexts such as watershed conservation measures burnett et al 2017 or aquifer recharge birol et al 2010 our approach to cba will be divided into three phases fig 2 illustrates phase 1 which is sub divided into the following steps i the identification and characterization of water saving investment measures ii the identification of the different responses iii the identification of the direct and indirect outcomes secondly once both direct and indirect outcomes have been identified a set of indicators is defined and evaluated to estimate these effects in economic terms finally a cba is carried out to predict whether the multiple benefits of irrigation modernization policy both monetary and non monetary outcomes outweigh its multiple costs including non monetary cost water policies are often still evaluated primarily according to their financial costs since such costs tend to be relatively easy to calculate the calculation of all costs and benefits including second order indirect effects on sectors and non priced environmental effects is a more difficult task brouwer and sheremet 2017 the cba will be carried out to evaluate and compare the various advantages and disadvantages of the investments in water saving measures in a structured and systematic way the benefits are compared with the associated costs within a common analytical framework with clearly defined spatial and temporal boundaries since these costs and benefits relate to a wide range of impacts measured in widely differing units a monetary value is assigned as the common denominator to enable a meaningful comparison that includes discounting future cost and benefits the results of this analysis can be interpreted as a b c ratio that is total benefits divided by total costs a ratio greater than one indicates that the policy measure is beneficial from a social point of view and hence yields a welfare improvement 3 1 cost estimation 3 1 1 financial cost the identification and characterization of wcst measures have been taken from the guadalquivir rbmp 2016 2021 the annual equivalent cost aec is used as an indicator of financial cost the time horizon for this type of infrastructure is typically 25 years and a discount rate of 4 is used operating cost items of water investments generally include energy materials services technical and administrative personnel maintenance and sludge management costs the annual equivalent cost aec is defined as 1 aec r 1 r n 1 r n 1 i omc where i represents the investment costs omc are the operational and maintenance costs r is the discount rate and n is the useful life of the project or measure the time horizon for this type of infrastructure is typically 25 years also including the construction period in this study the selected discount rate is r 4 the rate used by the spanish ministry magrama to evaluate the programme of measures for wfd implementation nevertheless different discount rates has been calculated in order to test the results the most frequent rates used in environmental policy analysis are r 2 r 3 and r 4 according to our estimation which is based on the analysis of guadalquivir rbmp 2016 2021 measures the value of total accumulated capital investments is 934 2 million eur this capital investment generates operational and maintenance costs of around 61 4 million eur year marm 2009 assuming parameters for capital equivalent costs of n 25 years and r 4 and including the above mentioned o m cost the total aec is 121 18 million eur year the cae would be 109 25 million eur year for r 2 and 115 04 million eur year for r 3 3 1 2 co2 emission cost the investment in irrigation water saving measures in the grb is reflected in the continuous increase in the drip irrigated area in the basin it is currently the most widespread irrigation method in the grb used in 66 of the total irrigated area magrama 2015 expósito and berbel 2017a b quote the substantial investments made as part of the intense investment in irrigation water saving measures in the basin have also resulted in an increase in water costs in both nominal and real terms the increased energy cost is included in the annual operation and maintenance expenses incorporated in the aec obtained according to the formula 1 explained in the previous section nevertheless the increase in energy use has important effects on the environment due to the higher co2 emissions the cost of this growth in co2 emissions due to higher energy use has been estimated based in part on the european investment bank 2014 the volume of additional emissions released into the atmosphere due to wstc measures is quantified on the basis of measure specific emission factors t co2 per kwh in this case expressed in tonnes per year in 2015 oecd electricity generation produced 404 gco2 kwh 4 less than in 2014 and over 20 less than in 1990 thus reaching its lowest levels to date notably in both oecd europe and oecd america iea 2017 camacho et al 2017 estimate the energy required for different crops irrigated by localized irrigation in the grb reporting an average of 563 kw h ha the guadalquivir rbmp estimates the area affected by irrigation wcsts at 365 588 ha implying an increase in co2eq the economic value of co2eq emissions is obtained by multiplying tonnes of co2 emitted by a unit cost expressed in monetary terms the us environmental protection agency epa and other us federal agencies estimate the social cost of carbon sc co2 to value the climate impacts of rulemakings epa 2016 the sc co2 is a measure in dollars of the long term damage done by a tonne of carbon dioxide co2 emissions in a given year this dollar figure also represents the value of damages avoided for a small emission reduction i e the benefit of a co2 reduction the sc co2 is intended as a comprehensive estimate of climate change damages and includes changes in net agricultural productivity human health damage to property due to increased flood risk and changes in energy system costs such as reduced costs for heating and increased costs for air conditioning the current sc co2 estimate calculated by the epa is 47 t co2 38 5 eur t and will be used here to assess the climate impacts of co2eq emission changes finally in order to determine the external cost of co2 emissions the following simplified formula should be applied 2 c o s t c o 2 e q δ c o 2 e q s c c o 2 e q where δ c o 2 e q is the incremental volume of co2eq emissions produced by the project and s c c o 2 e q is the shadow price per unit damage cost of co2eq updated and expressed in prices of the year in which the analysis is carried out the results are shown in table 1 3 2 benefit estimation selected indicators used to calculate the benefits of the investments in irrigation water saving measures are summarized in table 2 it should be noted that we have not included the water savings as a benefit due that water consumption does not decreased after modernization as it has been commented previously the reduction in water use withdrawals is not valued directly although the increase in water supply guarantee as the non used water is stored in aquifer or reservoir for future campaigns and guarantee of other services including e flow furthermore available data are annual water use while water consumption et is not reported and should be estimated with a certain degree of uncertainty and it is out of the scope of this paper 3 2 1 increase in water productivity to estimate the increase in water productivity we have selected the ratio of gross value added gva to water use apparent water productivity does not capture the productivity of the resource alone since other factors mainly land labour capital and management are also included young and loomis 2014 this ratio does not give the value of marginal productivity and additionally the numerator is the gva which also includes items such as salary and interest however according to young and loomis 2014 the ratio is a useful indicator for economic analysis and water management the increase in water productivity due to the investment in irrigation water saving measures in the grb is according to expósito and berbel 2017a b the combined result of two cumulative effects increasing the numerator higher value added in the crop plan and reducing the denominator lower water use this increase is estimated at 0 12 eur m3 agricultural sector growth produces a multiplier effect in the industry mainly agri food processors but also other complementary industries and services mainly transport and service providers to farms and food processors the multipliers should be defined locally at a basin level and the scarce available reports use gva to estimate multiplier effects howitt et al 2015 have estimated a multiplier effect of agriculture in the rest of the economy equal to 1 49 for california agriculture similar to grb due to this multiplier effect when agricultural gva irrigation increases by 1 eur the gva of the economy as a whole grows by 1 49 eur i e 0 49 for the non agricultural sectors this is the lowest value found in the literature after a thorough review and is and is the same as the value quoted for spain gómez ramos and pérez 2012 the increase in the gva of irrigation agriculture derived from modernization is estimated at 148 8 million eur for the whole basin the multiplier effect of this change in agricultural output is 72 9 million eur which will be observed in increased industrial and services gva 3 2 2 employment increase public policies may affect employment by directly creating jobs or facilitating job creation in labour markets with high unemployment such employment changes may have significant net efficiency benefits which should be included in the cba bartik 2012 argues that when local unemployment rates are high local employment benefits may be as great as 70 of the direct earnings effect of the labour demand shock if the policy has multiplier effects these employment benefits could exceed the payroll costs of direct hires eurostat measures agricultural productivity by two ratios gva ha and gva worker average labour productivity was eur 31 953 year 2017 for eu 17 while andalusian agrarian labour productivity is 33 673 eur worker and 45 956 eur worker in the rest of the economy average 2013 2015 we use the values of labour productivity to estimate the impact of changes in the regional gva on employment this multiplier effect will be different in the agricultural and non agricultural sectors according the productivity of labour as a result we estimate an increase of 4419 agricultural work unit wu year in agricultural employment and an increase of 1587 wu year in non agricultural employment ine 2018 3 2 3 increase in tree crop area agriculture can be an effective mechanism to mitigate the increase in atmospheric co2 plants serve as carbon c sinks due to their vital function of photosynthesis through this function vegetation absorbs co2 produced by respiration and other natural processes e g decomposition of organic matter the uptake of co2 by plant ecosystems constitutes an important component in the overall carbon c balance the co2 fixed by the plants is the result of the difference between the atmospheric co2 absorbed during the process of photosynthesis and the co2 emitted into the atmosphere during respiration the increase in co2 absorption is directly correlated with the increase in crops et this difference is converted into biomass and usually ranges between 45 50 of the dry weight of the plant therefore if growth is high natural vegetation and agricultural crops act as carbon sinks a considerable increase in the area occupied by olive trees and citrus crops in the grb has been registered due to the water saving measures in the case of olive trees the area is 23 3 higher than before the implementation of the measures espada carbó 2013 estimates that the trees sequester an average of 23 1 tons of atmospheric co2 ha year the external benefit of the co2 reduction has been calculated using the simplified formula 2 above 3 2 4 decrease in fertilizer applied per ha the reduction in fertilizer application is a direct benefit in terms of cost savings for farmers and reduced co2 emissions and fossil resources used to produce fertilizer it also yields an indirect benefit by reducing diffuse pollution jucar rbmp magrama 2016 reported a 10 decrease in fertilizer pressure applied volume in the basin due to the water saving measures it implies on the one hand a reduction in the cost of inputs for farmers incorporated in the increase in water productivity seen in the previous section and on the other hand a reduction in co2 emissions the external benefit of the co2 emissions prevented has been calculated using the simplified formula 2 data about fertilizer consumption in andalusia have been collected from the spanish association of fertilizer manufacturers anfee 2018 3 2 5 diffuse water pollution reduction the decrease in water pollution is a consequence of both the decrease in fertilizer applied kg ha detailed in the previous section and the reduction in return flows after the investment in wcsts garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 estimate an 88 reduction in volume and a 20 and 24 reduction respectively in salt and nitrate n similar results are reported for by jiménez aguirre and isidoro 2018 who quote a reduction in salt and nitrate loads of 60 4 for exported salts mg ha yr and 70 4 n ha yr respectively valuation of n removal is based on la notte et al 2015 who assign a monetary cost to ecosystem services n removal in the northern mediterranean region based on their models we use a value for the cost of n removal of 208 eur t 2430 million eur 11 67million n input to rivers 3 2 6 increase in guaranteed water supply water supply guarantee in grb increased following the introduction of water saving measures before wcsts implementation the guadalquivir rbmp 2009 2015 estimated a 33 probability of failure to guarantee supply i e water right entitlement were not served 33 of the years and this failure rate fell to 18 after the modernization investment berbel et al 2011 the estimated valuation of the increase is based on the different levels of guaranteed water supply established for the water entitlement in the grb there are two levels of guarantee high level household and industry and low level agriculture and others additionally hydropower production is constrained by the available water flow the grb defines the guarantee and the water tariff premium to be paid by those holding high security water rights compared to lower guarantee user rights holders of high security entitlements industrial and urban users pay the water agency tariff regulation fee canon de regulation with a 3 1 premium ratio compared to low security holders irrigation 4 results the method applied has identified some changes in key indicators and converted them into social welfare measures using commonly accepted criteria the results of this evaluation of water saving measures in the grb are summarized in table 3 the results show a high social benefit compared to the cost despite the relevance of the results they refer to a river basin in southern spain and so the impact will be very location specific the methodology should therefore be considered as a proposal and evaluations of other regions where water saving measures have been adopted as a policy option should be carried out for grb the provisioning services d e and f suppose 80 of the benefits while the regulatory ecosystem services selected make up 20 no attempt has been made to valuate cultural or biodiversity services because of the complexities and uncertainty in such a subjective valuation martin ortega et al 2012 martin ortega et al 2009 applied choice experiment and multicriteria techniques to the valuation of perceived subjective benefits of water quality improvements in the grb finding a wtp in the range of 11 5 to 14 0 eur person for subjective improvements from current to good and very good status of water bodies respectively this subjective valuation has not been included in the analysis to avoid double counting as some of the drivers of subjective valuation are related to increases in quantity quality and reliability which are already included in our evaluation the aggregate wtp for the grb is 49 5 million eur 11 5 eur person x 4 3 million this value is lower than our estimation for global benefit and it does not include the provisioning services increased value employment and guaranteed irrigation supply but it is remarkable close to the value of improved regulatory services g h i so the estimates are in a similar range 5 discussion the analysis presented here is valid as a general method of assessment but it should be carefully applied to the selected territorial unit the grb has come under close scrutiny as it is one of the most important agricultural production areas in spain to our knowledge this is the first attempt to apply a cost benefit analysis including a set of indicators to the grb previous analyses have focused only on partial aspects previous analyses of the social impact of water saving measures in andalusia have shown an increase of 28 2 in agricultural employment corominas and cuevas 2017 which is a higher value than that estimated using our approach 4 in our opinion previous estimates overvalue the impact as they compare rain fed land with new irrigated land whereas our estimation concentrates on the impact of wcsts in land that is already irrigated the value found in this study is in line with expósito and berbel 2017a b regarding the direct economic impact irrigation gva the combined impact of water saving investment and crop intensification is 272 million eur 14 estimated by comparing the year 2005 when modernization began and 2012 expósito and berbel 2017a b the authors do not divide the value increase into two components a change over time towards higher value crops fruit trees and vegetables gradually replaced by commodity crops and b the productivity gain generated by modernization our model estimates 149 million eur y as the increased value due to wcsts exclusively the increase in co2eq due to pressurized networks has been addressed previously fernández garcía et al 2014 focus on energy costs estimating that the water cost in the grb has increased more than 100 in eur m3 with energy in almost all the irrigation districts energy represents up to 50 of the total water costs in modernized grb systems mushtaq et al 2013 estimate that 120 hm3 year of water savings achieved in australia through drip irrigation adoption would increase ghg emissions by 250 000 t co2eq year that is 2 08 kgco2eq m3 we estimate a volume of 83 187 t co2eq generated to achieve water savings of 259 5 hm3 0 32 kgco2eq m3 the differences may be explained by two differential factors the energy mix with a higher presence of renewables and nuclear power in spain and the effectiveness of water saving with a compulsory reduction in water entitlements of around 50 in the spanish case which is not common in the australian case the valuation of an increase in guaranteed water supply has not been included in previous research as a relevant output but our analysis finds a high value for this output with a direct economic impact of 32 6 the valuation of guaranteed supply has been based on the different levels of guaranteed water supply established for water entitlements in the grb in the murray darling basin it is estimated at 0 10 eur m3 based on water entitlement trade abares 2018 this value is similar to the willingness to pay wtp for increased guarantee estimated for grb farmers mesa jurado et al 2012 which was in the range 0 05 to 0 07 eur m3 the impact of modernization in terms of improved quality is relevant at basin scale the analysis to convert the reduction in nitrogen leaching into water bodies into an economic benefit is based on two references the jucar rb eastern spain magrama 2016 which estimates excess nitrogen in water bodies at 61 kg n m3 and garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 who estimate a 20 reduction in the leached nitrogen after wcst implementation in an irrigation unit in the ebro no attempt has been made to evaluate the non market benefit of water quality improvement martin ortega et al 2011 estimate a value of 46 5 eur per capita in the grb which amounts to around 198 million eur year this is higher than the estimate for regulatory services but it should be borne in mind that modernization is only a part of the total rbmp and urban water treatment is the most expensive measure and the one with the greatest impact on water quality nevertheless the fact that quality improvement due to modernization indicators g h and i account for circa 80 million eur year may be considered in the range of subjective welfare valuation identified as willingness to pay or wtp finally it should be mentioned that water related benefits d f h i are 70 of benefits with the remaining 30 related to climate change mitigation and social economic outputs thus suggesting the need for an extended analysis of water policy that goes beyond water itself 6 concluding remarks the valuation exercise conducted in this research should be considered a relevant case study as the grb contains 25 of spain s total irrigated area and it is a competitive and productive region the financial and technical effort represented by modernization has not been subject to a comprehensive evaluation such as the one presented here the investment in high tech irrigation or wcsts is a hot topic in the agricultural and water economics literature due to the hypothetical rebound effects and the financial support of donor agencies that see the measure as a solution to water scarcity the case studied here does not account for the rebound effect as there are two specific conditions in place that theoretically control this effect berbel and mateos 2014 a the prohibition of irrigated area expansion that has been in effect since 2005 and b the government support subsidies for wcsts which mean that the water agency retains 50 of all water savings these conditions may not apply elsewhere so if the proposed methodology is applied to other regions the expansion of irrigated area should be part of the analysis the methodological problem is to disentangle the expansion of the irrigated area that is trigged by wcsts from the historical trend of irrigation expansion where a worldwide annual growth in irrigated area of around 0 3 1961 2008 has been observed fao 2011 this long term trend is explained mainly by the different productivity of irrigated vs rain fed land the results of the analysis done in this research show that investment in wcst measures for irrigation is a rational policy for water resources management that goes beyond resource efficiency to include benefits in terms of water environmental services such as reduced pollution increased productivity value employment generation and improved reliability of water supply wcsts can be seen as a measure for climate change adaptation when facing a more uncertain water supply and higher temperatures with the associated extreme heat events and increased evapotranspiration we hope that our work has contributed to clarifying some of the issues related to water use efficiency measures acknowledgements the

11275,in water scarce areas policy makers frequently opt for water conservation and saving technologies wcsts as a measure to ensure resource use sustainability although this policy is subject to scientific and political debate this paper presents an application of an integrated methodological approach for analysing the costs and benefits of using wcsts to achieve water policy objectives the focus is on the measures aimed at reducing irrigation water abstraction under the 1st and 2nd cycle of water framework directive implementation in the guadalquivir river basin southern spain the method is a combination of a multicriteria assessment of the main effects of water saving investments at basin level estimated using a selected group of indicators in a second stage a cost benefit analysis is conducted the study finds a benefit to cost ratio of 4 1 1 for the guadalquivir river basin thus concluding that irrigation modernization in this case study has been a good social investment the method can be extended to other hydrological systems aquifer basins to draw general conclusions keywords water framework directive irrigation efficiency irrigated agriculture water conservation and saving technologies ecosystem services water economics 1 introduction the world s population is expected to grow to almost 10 billion by 2050 boosting agricultural demand leading to more intense competition for natural resources especially water that appears as one of the most limiting factors to deliver sustainable food and agricultural production while world population has rapidly increased the use of freshwater for human consumption agriculture industry and other uses has increased six fold with agriculture representing 70 of total water withdrawal and accounts for 86 of consumption fao 2017 nowadays water scarcity is considered one of the greatest risks facing the planet world economic forum 2016 water use describes the total water withdrawn by the farmer from its source when the seasonal crop irrigation requires 10 000 m3 even if the farm returns 30 percent of the withdrawn water to the watershed the farm still needs all 10 000 m3 to operate water consumption is the portion of water use that is consumed by crop transpiration and evaporation and is not returned to the hydrological system increasing irrigation efficiency has been suggested as a solution to water scarcity but its potential rebound effect increased ex post water consumption is receiving growing attention although improved irrigation efficiency may reduce water use some authors argue that paradoxically it may also increase water consumption perry et al 2017 unless strict governance measures are introduced to control increased consumption huang et al 2017 berbel and mateos 2014 berbel et al 2018a b on the other hand modern irrigation technologies are considered a measure for climate change adaptation projected higher temperatures lower rainfall more frequent droughts and improving guaranteed water supply and water quality in a context of growing scarcity modern irrigation technologies may result in reduced water use but they frequently increase energy consumption due to pressurized networks and consequently greenhouse gas ghg emissions fernández garcía et al 2014 mushtaq et al 2013 unless improved application efficiency reduces pumping costs sanchis ibor et al 2016 both negative effects higher ghg emissions and likely rebound effects have been suggested as potential conflicts that may arise from increasing irrigation efficiency subsidies mushtaq et al 2013 analyse the climate change impact of irrigation modernization in australia although the analysis was limited to a financial effects and b emissions of co2eq due to the change from previous open channels to pressurized networks our approach takes into consideration additional effects of technological change a wider review of published literature analysing the effects of investment in irrigation water saving measures can be found in berbel et al 2015 perry et al 2017 european union water policy is largely based on the water framework directive wfd which sets out ambitious objectives for the quality and protection of all waters bodies ecological status quantitative status chemical status and protected area objectives the river basin management plans rbmps are a key element of the wfd providing the overall context for water management in the river basin district the rbmps in spain have been developed in line with the wfd agenda and include investment in irrigation water saving as part of the programme of measures the wfd art 11 proposes the use of cost effectiveness analysis cea as a general method for water policy decision making berbel et al 2011 while cost benefit analysis cba is recommended as a tool for dealing with possible derogation from environmental objectives provided for in wfd art 4 cea is a decision method that ranks intervention alternatives comparing relative costs in monetary terms and the relevant outcome under consideration measured in physical terms e g reduction in water withdrawal reduction of nitrogen load cba assigns a monetary value both to the cost and the effects nevertheless cba has rarely been applied in wfd implementation feuillette et al 2016 european commission 2015 this paper aims to contribute to the scarce literature on the use of cba in the specific context of the wfd and water saving investment and presents an application of cba to investment in irrigation water saving measures 2 case study after a severe drought during the 90 s the spanish ministry of agriculture approved an irrigation plan mapa 2001 in which the main measure was the transformation of old open channel distribution systems into pressurized pipe networks the goal of the plan was to save 3000 mm3 annually fernández garcía et al 2014 the second phase of irrigation modernization was linked to the development and approval of 1 st and 2nd cycle rbmps both under the wfd implementation berbel et al 2012 analyse the guadalquivir rbmp and the role of wcsts also called modernization the implementation of wcsts resulted in estimated water savings of 259 5 hm3 berbel et al 2011 the guadalquivir river basin grb contains 25 of spain s irrigated land and the longest of the southern rivers 657 km it can thus be considered one of the most important basins in spain it covers an area of 57 679 km2 and has a population of 4 3 million the basin has a mediterranean climate with a heterogeneous precipitation distribution the annual average temperature is 16 8 c and the annual average precipitation is 573 mm with a range between 260 mm and 983 mm standard deviation of 161 mm the average renewable resources that means the quantity of water that go into the basin each year amount to a median value of 5 1 km3 year berbel et al 2012 reservoirs storage capacity is through a complex and interconnected system of 65 dams have a global storage capacity of 8 5 km3 the main land uses in the basin are forestry 49 1 agriculture 47 2 urban areas 1 9 and wetlands 1 8 confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 fig 1 economic activities in the grb generated around 69 8 billion in 2015 equivalent to 7 of the value of spanish gdp over 71 of gva in the grb is concentrated in the service sector industrial activities amount to 16 of gva energy production 8 and agricultural production 5 global water abstractions in the grb are estimated at 3 8 km3 year confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 local and seasonal droughts cause aquifer salinization and environmental stress moreover water quality is a significant problem throughout the river basin the main sources of pollution include urban and industrial wastewater discharge erosion and nutrient and pesticide runoff from agricultural land confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 basin water agency was created in 1927 and today has a mixed success in water governance according hydrological plan 2015 39 of surface water bodies and 37 of groundwater bodies have an environmental status less than good due to quantitative or qualitative pressures confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir 2015 this figure is over eu average 50 but still unsatisfactory the best results in grb have been achieved in regulated surface water 80 of water supply where a minimum guaranteed environmental flow is defined and strictly respected as part of river protection water use overexploitation emerges in groundwater resources 19 of water supply where some aquifers are severely damaged such as the iconic doñana natural park area under pressure for high value berries scheffer et al 2015 and conflict is still unsettled while other aquifers in the basin have reached a sustainable governance management berbel et al 2018a b 3 methodology cba assigns values to non monetary flows e g reduced diffuse pollution with the aims to evaluate positive and negative consequences benefits and costs of economic activities by estimating the monetary flow associated with policy induced changes it can thus be used to assess policy making choy 2018 cba is an analytical tool for evaluating the economic advantages or disadvantages of an investment decision to assess the welfare change attributable to it this tool has been used in hydro economic decision making contexts such as watershed conservation measures burnett et al 2017 or aquifer recharge birol et al 2010 our approach to cba will be divided into three phases fig 2 illustrates phase 1 which is sub divided into the following steps i the identification and characterization of water saving investment measures ii the identification of the different responses iii the identification of the direct and indirect outcomes secondly once both direct and indirect outcomes have been identified a set of indicators is defined and evaluated to estimate these effects in economic terms finally a cba is carried out to predict whether the multiple benefits of irrigation modernization policy both monetary and non monetary outcomes outweigh its multiple costs including non monetary cost water policies are often still evaluated primarily according to their financial costs since such costs tend to be relatively easy to calculate the calculation of all costs and benefits including second order indirect effects on sectors and non priced environmental effects is a more difficult task brouwer and sheremet 2017 the cba will be carried out to evaluate and compare the various advantages and disadvantages of the investments in water saving measures in a structured and systematic way the benefits are compared with the associated costs within a common analytical framework with clearly defined spatial and temporal boundaries since these costs and benefits relate to a wide range of impacts measured in widely differing units a monetary value is assigned as the common denominator to enable a meaningful comparison that includes discounting future cost and benefits the results of this analysis can be interpreted as a b c ratio that is total benefits divided by total costs a ratio greater than one indicates that the policy measure is beneficial from a social point of view and hence yields a welfare improvement 3 1 cost estimation 3 1 1 financial cost the identification and characterization of wcst measures have been taken from the guadalquivir rbmp 2016 2021 the annual equivalent cost aec is used as an indicator of financial cost the time horizon for this type of infrastructure is typically 25 years and a discount rate of 4 is used operating cost items of water investments generally include energy materials services technical and administrative personnel maintenance and sludge management costs the annual equivalent cost aec is defined as 1 aec r 1 r n 1 r n 1 i omc where i represents the investment costs omc are the operational and maintenance costs r is the discount rate and n is the useful life of the project or measure the time horizon for this type of infrastructure is typically 25 years also including the construction period in this study the selected discount rate is r 4 the rate used by the spanish ministry magrama to evaluate the programme of measures for wfd implementation nevertheless different discount rates has been calculated in order to test the results the most frequent rates used in environmental policy analysis are r 2 r 3 and r 4 according to our estimation which is based on the analysis of guadalquivir rbmp 2016 2021 measures the value of total accumulated capital investments is 934 2 million eur this capital investment generates operational and maintenance costs of around 61 4 million eur year marm 2009 assuming parameters for capital equivalent costs of n 25 years and r 4 and including the above mentioned o m cost the total aec is 121 18 million eur year the cae would be 109 25 million eur year for r 2 and 115 04 million eur year for r 3 3 1 2 co2 emission cost the investment in irrigation water saving measures in the grb is reflected in the continuous increase in the drip irrigated area in the basin it is currently the most widespread irrigation method in the grb used in 66 of the total irrigated area magrama 2015 expósito and berbel 2017a b quote the substantial investments made as part of the intense investment in irrigation water saving measures in the basin have also resulted in an increase in water costs in both nominal and real terms the increased energy cost is included in the annual operation and maintenance expenses incorporated in the aec obtained according to the formula 1 explained in the previous section nevertheless the increase in energy use has important effects on the environment due to the higher co2 emissions the cost of this growth in co2 emissions due to higher energy use has been estimated based in part on the european investment bank 2014 the volume of additional emissions released into the atmosphere due to wstc measures is quantified on the basis of measure specific emission factors t co2 per kwh in this case expressed in tonnes per year in 2015 oecd electricity generation produced 404 gco2 kwh 4 less than in 2014 and over 20 less than in 1990 thus reaching its lowest levels to date notably in both oecd europe and oecd america iea 2017 camacho et al 2017 estimate the energy required for different crops irrigated by localized irrigation in the grb reporting an average of 563 kw h ha the guadalquivir rbmp estimates the area affected by irrigation wcsts at 365 588 ha implying an increase in co2eq the economic value of co2eq emissions is obtained by multiplying tonnes of co2 emitted by a unit cost expressed in monetary terms the us environmental protection agency epa and other us federal agencies estimate the social cost of carbon sc co2 to value the climate impacts of rulemakings epa 2016 the sc co2 is a measure in dollars of the long term damage done by a tonne of carbon dioxide co2 emissions in a given year this dollar figure also represents the value of damages avoided for a small emission reduction i e the benefit of a co2 reduction the sc co2 is intended as a comprehensive estimate of climate change damages and includes changes in net agricultural productivity human health damage to property due to increased flood risk and changes in energy system costs such as reduced costs for heating and increased costs for air conditioning the current sc co2 estimate calculated by the epa is 47 t co2 38 5 eur t and will be used here to assess the climate impacts of co2eq emission changes finally in order to determine the external cost of co2 emissions the following simplified formula should be applied 2 c o s t c o 2 e q δ c o 2 e q s c c o 2 e q where δ c o 2 e q is the incremental volume of co2eq emissions produced by the project and s c c o 2 e q is the shadow price per unit damage cost of co2eq updated and expressed in prices of the year in which the analysis is carried out the results are shown in table 1 3 2 benefit estimation selected indicators used to calculate the benefits of the investments in irrigation water saving measures are summarized in table 2 it should be noted that we have not included the water savings as a benefit due that water consumption does not decreased after modernization as it has been commented previously the reduction in water use withdrawals is not valued directly although the increase in water supply guarantee as the non used water is stored in aquifer or reservoir for future campaigns and guarantee of other services including e flow furthermore available data are annual water use while water consumption et is not reported and should be estimated with a certain degree of uncertainty and it is out of the scope of this paper 3 2 1 increase in water productivity to estimate the increase in water productivity we have selected the ratio of gross value added gva to water use apparent water productivity does not capture the productivity of the resource alone since other factors mainly land labour capital and management are also included young and loomis 2014 this ratio does not give the value of marginal productivity and additionally the numerator is the gva which also includes items such as salary and interest however according to young and loomis 2014 the ratio is a useful indicator for economic analysis and water management the increase in water productivity due to the investment in irrigation water saving measures in the grb is according to expósito and berbel 2017a b the combined result of two cumulative effects increasing the numerator higher value added in the crop plan and reducing the denominator lower water use this increase is estimated at 0 12 eur m3 agricultural sector growth produces a multiplier effect in the industry mainly agri food processors but also other complementary industries and services mainly transport and service providers to farms and food processors the multipliers should be defined locally at a basin level and the scarce available reports use gva to estimate multiplier effects howitt et al 2015 have estimated a multiplier effect of agriculture in the rest of the economy equal to 1 49 for california agriculture similar to grb due to this multiplier effect when agricultural gva irrigation increases by 1 eur the gva of the economy as a whole grows by 1 49 eur i e 0 49 for the non agricultural sectors this is the lowest value found in the literature after a thorough review and is and is the same as the value quoted for spain gómez ramos and pérez 2012 the increase in the gva of irrigation agriculture derived from modernization is estimated at 148 8 million eur for the whole basin the multiplier effect of this change in agricultural output is 72 9 million eur which will be observed in increased industrial and services gva 3 2 2 employment increase public policies may affect employment by directly creating jobs or facilitating job creation in labour markets with high unemployment such employment changes may have significant net efficiency benefits which should be included in the cba bartik 2012 argues that when local unemployment rates are high local employment benefits may be as great as 70 of the direct earnings effect of the labour demand shock if the policy has multiplier effects these employment benefits could exceed the payroll costs of direct hires eurostat measures agricultural productivity by two ratios gva ha and gva worker average labour productivity was eur 31 953 year 2017 for eu 17 while andalusian agrarian labour productivity is 33 673 eur worker and 45 956 eur worker in the rest of the economy average 2013 2015 we use the values of labour productivity to estimate the impact of changes in the regional gva on employment this multiplier effect will be different in the agricultural and non agricultural sectors according the productivity of labour as a result we estimate an increase of 4419 agricultural work unit wu year in agricultural employment and an increase of 1587 wu year in non agricultural employment ine 2018 3 2 3 increase in tree crop area agriculture can be an effective mechanism to mitigate the increase in atmospheric co2 plants serve as carbon c sinks due to their vital function of photosynthesis through this function vegetation absorbs co2 produced by respiration and other natural processes e g decomposition of organic matter the uptake of co2 by plant ecosystems constitutes an important component in the overall carbon c balance the co2 fixed by the plants is the result of the difference between the atmospheric co2 absorbed during the process of photosynthesis and the co2 emitted into the atmosphere during respiration the increase in co2 absorption is directly correlated with the increase in crops et this difference is converted into biomass and usually ranges between 45 50 of the dry weight of the plant therefore if growth is high natural vegetation and agricultural crops act as carbon sinks a considerable increase in the area occupied by olive trees and citrus crops in the grb has been registered due to the water saving measures in the case of olive trees the area is 23 3 higher than before the implementation of the measures espada carbó 2013 estimates that the trees sequester an average of 23 1 tons of atmospheric co2 ha year the external benefit of the co2 reduction has been calculated using the simplified formula 2 above 3 2 4 decrease in fertilizer applied per ha the reduction in fertilizer application is a direct benefit in terms of cost savings for farmers and reduced co2 emissions and fossil resources used to produce fertilizer it also yields an indirect benefit by reducing diffuse pollution jucar rbmp magrama 2016 reported a 10 decrease in fertilizer pressure applied volume in the basin due to the water saving measures it implies on the one hand a reduction in the cost of inputs for farmers incorporated in the increase in water productivity seen in the previous section and on the other hand a reduction in co2 emissions the external benefit of the co2 emissions prevented has been calculated using the simplified formula 2 data about fertilizer consumption in andalusia have been collected from the spanish association of fertilizer manufacturers anfee 2018 3 2 5 diffuse water pollution reduction the decrease in water pollution is a consequence of both the decrease in fertilizer applied kg ha detailed in the previous section and the reduction in return flows after the investment in wcsts garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 estimate an 88 reduction in volume and a 20 and 24 reduction respectively in salt and nitrate n similar results are reported for by jiménez aguirre and isidoro 2018 who quote a reduction in salt and nitrate loads of 60 4 for exported salts mg ha yr and 70 4 n ha yr respectively valuation of n removal is based on la notte et al 2015 who assign a monetary cost to ecosystem services n removal in the northern mediterranean region based on their models we use a value for the cost of n removal of 208 eur t 2430 million eur 11 67million n input to rivers 3 2 6 increase in guaranteed water supply water supply guarantee in grb increased following the introduction of water saving measures before wcsts implementation the guadalquivir rbmp 2009 2015 estimated a 33 probability of failure to guarantee supply i e water right entitlement were not served 33 of the years and this failure rate fell to 18 after the modernization investment berbel et al 2011 the estimated valuation of the increase is based on the different levels of guaranteed water supply established for the water entitlement in the grb there are two levels of guarantee high level household and industry and low level agriculture and others additionally hydropower production is constrained by the available water flow the grb defines the guarantee and the water tariff premium to be paid by those holding high security water rights compared to lower guarantee user rights holders of high security entitlements industrial and urban users pay the water agency tariff regulation fee canon de regulation with a 3 1 premium ratio compared to low security holders irrigation 4 results the method applied has identified some changes in key indicators and converted them into social welfare measures using commonly accepted criteria the results of this evaluation of water saving measures in the grb are summarized in table 3 the results show a high social benefit compared to the cost despite the relevance of the results they refer to a river basin in southern spain and so the impact will be very location specific the methodology should therefore be considered as a proposal and evaluations of other regions where water saving measures have been adopted as a policy option should be carried out for grb the provisioning services d e and f suppose 80 of the benefits while the regulatory ecosystem services selected make up 20 no attempt has been made to valuate cultural or biodiversity services because of the complexities and uncertainty in such a subjective valuation martin ortega et al 2012 martin ortega et al 2009 applied choice experiment and multicriteria techniques to the valuation of perceived subjective benefits of water quality improvements in the grb finding a wtp in the range of 11 5 to 14 0 eur person for subjective improvements from current to good and very good status of water bodies respectively this subjective valuation has not been included in the analysis to avoid double counting as some of the drivers of subjective valuation are related to increases in quantity quality and reliability which are already included in our evaluation the aggregate wtp for the grb is 49 5 million eur 11 5 eur person x 4 3 million this value is lower than our estimation for global benefit and it does not include the provisioning services increased value employment and guaranteed irrigation supply but it is remarkable close to the value of improved regulatory services g h i so the estimates are in a similar range 5 discussion the analysis presented here is valid as a general method of assessment but it should be carefully applied to the selected territorial unit the grb has come under close scrutiny as it is one of the most important agricultural production areas in spain to our knowledge this is the first attempt to apply a cost benefit analysis including a set of indicators to the grb previous analyses have focused only on partial aspects previous analyses of the social impact of water saving measures in andalusia have shown an increase of 28 2 in agricultural employment corominas and cuevas 2017 which is a higher value than that estimated using our approach 4 in our opinion previous estimates overvalue the impact as they compare rain fed land with new irrigated land whereas our estimation concentrates on the impact of wcsts in land that is already irrigated the value found in this study is in line with expósito and berbel 2017a b regarding the direct economic impact irrigation gva the combined impact of water saving investment and crop intensification is 272 million eur 14 estimated by comparing the year 2005 when modernization began and 2012 expósito and berbel 2017a b the authors do not divide the value increase into two components a change over time towards higher value crops fruit trees and vegetables gradually replaced by commodity crops and b the productivity gain generated by modernization our model estimates 149 million eur y as the increased value due to wcsts exclusively the increase in co2eq due to pressurized networks has been addressed previously fernández garcía et al 2014 focus on energy costs estimating that the water cost in the grb has increased more than 100 in eur m3 with energy in almost all the irrigation districts energy represents up to 50 of the total water costs in modernized grb systems mushtaq et al 2013 estimate that 120 hm3 year of water savings achieved in australia through drip irrigation adoption would increase ghg emissions by 250 000 t co2eq year that is 2 08 kgco2eq m3 we estimate a volume of 83 187 t co2eq generated to achieve water savings of 259 5 hm3 0 32 kgco2eq m3 the differences may be explained by two differential factors the energy mix with a higher presence of renewables and nuclear power in spain and the effectiveness of water saving with a compulsory reduction in water entitlements of around 50 in the spanish case which is not common in the australian case the valuation of an increase in guaranteed water supply has not been included in previous research as a relevant output but our analysis finds a high value for this output with a direct economic impact of 32 6 the valuation of guaranteed supply has been based on the different levels of guaranteed water supply established for water entitlements in the grb in the murray darling basin it is estimated at 0 10 eur m3 based on water entitlement trade abares 2018 this value is similar to the willingness to pay wtp for increased guarantee estimated for grb farmers mesa jurado et al 2012 which was in the range 0 05 to 0 07 eur m3 the impact of modernization in terms of improved quality is relevant at basin scale the analysis to convert the reduction in nitrogen leaching into water bodies into an economic benefit is based on two references the jucar rb eastern spain magrama 2016 which estimates excess nitrogen in water bodies at 61 kg n m3 and garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 who estimate a 20 reduction in the leached nitrogen after wcst implementation in an irrigation unit in the ebro no attempt has been made to evaluate the non market benefit of water quality improvement martin ortega et al 2011 estimate a value of 46 5 eur per capita in the grb which amounts to around 198 million eur year this is higher than the estimate for regulatory services but it should be borne in mind that modernization is only a part of the total rbmp and urban water treatment is the most expensive measure and the one with the greatest impact on water quality nevertheless the fact that quality improvement due to modernization indicators g h and i account for circa 80 million eur year may be considered in the range of subjective welfare valuation identified as willingness to pay or wtp finally it should be mentioned that water related benefits d f h i are 70 of benefits with the remaining 30 related to climate change mitigation and social economic outputs thus suggesting the need for an extended analysis of water policy that goes beyond water itself 6 concluding remarks the valuation exercise conducted in this research should be considered a relevant case study as the grb contains 25 of spain s total irrigated area and it is a competitive and productive region the financial and technical effort represented by modernization has not been subject to a comprehensive evaluation such as the one presented here the investment in high tech irrigation or wcsts is a hot topic in the agricultural and water economics literature due to the hypothetical rebound effects and the financial support of donor agencies that see the measure as a solution to water scarcity the case studied here does not account for the rebound effect as there are two specific conditions in place that theoretically control this effect berbel and mateos 2014 a the prohibition of irrigated area expansion that has been in effect since 2005 and b the government support subsidies for wcsts which mean that the water agency retains 50 of all water savings these conditions may not apply elsewhere so if the proposed methodology is applied to other regions the expansion of irrigated area should be part of the analysis the methodological problem is to disentangle the expansion of the irrigated area that is trigged by wcsts from the historical trend of irrigation expansion where a worldwide annual growth in irrigated area of around 0 3 1961 2008 has been observed fao 2011 this long term trend is explained mainly by the different productivity of irrigated vs rain fed land the results of the analysis done in this research show that investment in wcst measures for irrigation is a rational policy for water resources management that goes beyond resource efficiency to include benefits in terms of water environmental services such as reduced pollution increased productivity value employment generation and improved reliability of water supply wcsts can be seen as a measure for climate change adaptation when facing a more uncertain water supply and higher temperatures with the associated extreme heat events and increased evapotranspiration we hope that our work has contributed to clarifying some of the issues related to water use efficiency measures acknowledgements the

11276,in order to explore the utilization of groundwater resource field experiments were conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the shiyang river basin of northwest china altogether nine treatments included three water levels w1 w2 and w3 1etc 2 3etc and 1 2etc etc 555 mm in combination with three salinity levels s1 s2 and s3 0 71 g l 3 g l and 6 g l soil water content soil salt content and yield of maize for seed production were measured for studying the effects of deficit irrigation with saline water on water salt distribution and water use efficiency of maize for seed production the results showed that soil water content of saline water irrigation was higher than fresh water irrigation and soil salt content increased with increase of irrigation water salinity under the same irrigation water amount soil water content of deficit irrigation was lower than sufficient irrigation and soil salt content increased with decrease of irrigation water amount under the same irrigation water salinity the soil salt accumulation increased gradually with increase of irrigation water salinity and decrease of irrigation water amount under the combined effect of irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity irrigation with water salinity of 3 g l and water amount of 370 mm will not cause a substantial yield reduction and could increase water use efficiency of maize for seed production irrigation schedule with irrigation water amount about 370 mm and irrigation water salinity below 3 g l is recommended in this study area the irrigation schedule of this study can be used in the practice of agricultural production and the results show a reasonably utilization of saline water thereby supplying theoretical guidance for water saving irrigation development keywords saline water irrigation deficit irrigation soil water salt distribution maize for seed production yield water use efficiency 1 introduction the shiyang river basin is an interior river basin that confronted excessive water explore and utilization contradiction between water demand and water resources as well as environmental deterioration in northwest china kang et al 2004 for this arid area with surface water resources shortage the groundwater is an important resource for social and economic development maintaining the ecological environment and agricultural production due to excessive exploration of local water resources the groundwater salinity increased year by year the general groundwater salinity is 0 5 1 0 g l in upstream region 1 0 3 0 g l in midstream region 3 0 9 0 g l in downstream region and up to 10 0 g l in partial region of shiyang river basin huang et al 2010 feng et al 2014 in order to make up the shortage of fresh water resources and ensure the steady development of agricultural production in arid area saline water irrigation and deficit irrigation have been widely used in agricultural production ali et al 2007 chauhan et al 2008 geerts and raes 2009 ahmed et al 2010 the most important consideration in the utilization of saline water irrigation is crop yield malash et al 2005 a large number of experiments have shown that the crops yield irrigated by saline water or brackish water can close or achieve to the yield irrigated by fresh water for some salt tolerant crops niu et al 2010 wan et al 2010 malasha et al 2012 singh and panda 2012 however the use of saline water may cause salt accumulation change the way of soil water salt movement and the soil environment of farmland ultimately reducing crop productivity by hindering water uptake wan et al 2010 huang et al 2010 wang et al 2015 the principle of using saline water irrigation is that the salt accumulation in the soil does not exceed the salt tolerance limit of the crop deficit irrigation provides a mean of increasing water use efficiency by reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on yield mao et al 2003 panda et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 the crop is exposed to a certain level of water stress either during a particular period or throughout the whole growing season in this method the expectation is that any yield reduction especially in water limiting situations will be compensated by increased production from the additional irrigated area with the water saved by deficit irrigation ali et al 2007 many investigations have been carried out worldwide regarding the effects of deficit irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency mansourifar et al 2010 salemi et al 2011 ahmadi et al 2015 they reported that regulated deficit irrigation provides a means of reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on the yield webber et al 2006 geerts and raes 2009 du et al 2010 kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 soil water salt distribution crop yield and water use efficiency under combined deficit and saline water irrigation are different to those under separate deficit or saline irrigation shani and dudley 2001 stressed that the maximum yield and the corresponding irrigation water quantity for poor quality water are less than those for good quality water jiang et al 2013 reported that spring wheat is sensitive to deficit irrigation especially at the booting to grain filling stages but was not significantly affect by saline irrigation and the combination of deficit irrigation and saline water irrigation maize is one of the most important crops in the world and is sensitive to salt content panda et al 2004 leogrande et al 2016 mohammadi et al 2011 reported that the water deficit and salinity stress had a significant effect on grain yield of hybrid maize the maize for seed production is one of the main economic crops and the planting area of maize is rapidly increasing in arid northwest china however soil water salt distribution yield and water use efficiency of maize for seed production under deficit irrigation with saline water have been reported rarely this study has an important theoretical significance for deficit irrigation and saline water irrigation theory and also guides agricultural production practice the objectives of this study were 1 to study the effects of deficit irrigation with saline water on soil water salt distribution 2 to study the effects of deficit irrigation with saline water on yield and yield components of maize for seed production 3 to study the effects of deficit irrigation with saline water on water use efficiency of maize for seed production 2 materials and methods 2 1 general description of the study area field experiments were conducted from 2012 to 2013 at the shiyang river experimental station of china agriculture university 102 52 e 37 52 n in the middle reaches of shiyang river basin located in gansu province of northwest china the area is characterized as a typical arid climate zone with an altitude of 1581 m the average annual rainfall and potential evaporation of this area is 164 4 mm and 2000 mm respectively the groundwater depth in the experimental area is about 48 m the experiments were conducted in non weighing lysimeter containing 18 test pits with an area of 6 66 square meters 3 33 m 2 m and depth of 3 m each test pits was separated by cement concrete and the bottom was a cement floor the physical and chemical properties of the test soil before experiments are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental design irrigation was performed with three water amount levels of 1etc w1 2 3etc w2 and 1 2etc w3 etc was the average evapotranspiration of maize for seed production the sufficient irrigation water requirement for maize during each growth stage was decided by the reference crop water requirements and kc 1 e t c k c e t 0 the et0 was calculated by penman menteith method the kc of maize for each specific growth stage was referred to former study results tong 2007 the total crop water requirement of maize was 555 mm calculated by eq 1 the maize was irrigated 5 times according to the local experience at different growth stage the total irrigation quota was the total water amount during the whole growth period the irrigation was performed with three salinity levels of 0 71 g l s1 3 g l s2 6 g l s3 which represented groundwater salinity of the upstream midstream and downstream of shiyang river there were 9 treatments with two replicates 18 test pits were laid out by split plot arrangement the irrigation schedule is decided as table 2 the sowing irrigation and harvest times are shown in table 3 spring irrigation was a special irritation in this area that performed once at the volume of about 120 mm half a month before sowing every year for the purpose of salt leaching and soil water conservation fresh water with a salinity of 0 71 g l was obtained from a local well according to composition of the local groundwater saline water of 3 g l and 6 g l were prepared artificially by dissolving nacl mgso4 and caso4 in fresh water at a mass ratio of 2 2 1 respectively the ph of different irrigation water was about 7 maize for seed production of the variety of golden northwest no 22 was sowed in one line male plant and seven line female plant with 56 plants in each test pits before sowing the whole plots were fertilized with 375 kg hm2 of n 225 kg hm2 of p2o5 and 300 kg hm2 of k2o as a basal fertilizer cultural practices were executed following local experience 2 3 meteorological data and sampling methods an automatic meteorological station weather hark campbell scientific usa was installed at the experimental station temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed and solar radiation were measured and the data was recorded every hour total precipitation during the maize growth stage in 2012 and 2013 was 130 mm and 64 6 mm respectively the soil samples were taken before seeding after harvest and before or after irrigation using soil auger during the growth period of maize at the depth of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm in 2012 and 2013 the soil moisture was measured using gravimetric method the reserved soil samples were air dried ground and passed through 1 mm sieve soil leachates were prepared at soil to water ratio of 1 5 electrical conductivity ec1 5 was measured using sg 3 conductivity meter sg3 elk742 mettler toledo international inc switzerland and translated into soil salinity by using the equation s 0 0275ec1 5 0 1366 wang et al 2016 after harvest maize yield components such as ear length ear diameter and aboveground dry matter were determined by taking average of 6 plants per plot the weight of 100 grains for

y is the maize yield kg hm2 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water distribution soil water distribution was mainly affected by irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity under saline water irrigation soil water distribution at the same irrigation water amount but different irrigation water salinity is shown in fig 1 it can be seen from fig 1 that soil water content gradually increased with increase of irrigation water salinity under the same irrigation water amount except sufficient irrigation w1 and mild deficit irrigation w2 in 2012 which mean that soil water content of the saline water irrigation was higher than fresh water irrigation and this phenomenon became more obvious with time increase of saline water irrigation it can be explained that the salt brought into the soil by saline water irrigation would lower the soil water potential which then caused salt stress on crops and affected the root water uptake the results are in accordance with research of ben asher et al 2006 and jiang et al 2016 there was no obvious difference of soil water distribution among three irrigation water salinity through w1 and w2 treatment in 2012 the year of 2012 was a normal flow year the rainfall was larger than 2013 with a rainfall amount up to 130 mm during the whole maize growing period which weaken the effects of deficit irrigation on soil water distribution to some extent soil water distribution of each treatment was basically the same under the same irrigation salinity fig 2 the soil water content of w1 and w2 treatment was significantly higher than w3 treatment and the soil water content of w2 treatment was slight lower than w1 treatment but no significant difference it was evident that the soil water content decreased slightly when adopting deficit irrigation of 2 3 etc than sufficient irrigation 3 2 soil salt distribution after saline water irrigation soil salt content was mainly affected by irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity fig 3 presents soil salt distribution under different irrigation water salinity with the same amount it can be seen from fig 3 that soil salt content increased with increase of irrigation water salinity under the same irrigation amount except for w1 and w2 treatment in 2012 the change rule of soil salt distribution was not clear at the early stage of maize for seed production under w1 and w2 treatment in 2012 this was mainly that the little salt was brought into soil at the early growth period and the change rule was not noticeable until the middle and late stage of maize growth period with the accumulation of saline water irrigation fig 4 presents soil salt distribution under different irrigation water amount with the same salinity it showed that soil salt content increased with decreased of irrigation amount under the same irrigation salinity except for s2 and s3 treatment in 2013 the main reason was that the soil salt content was mainly accumulated in the crop root soil layer and it could not be fully leached with a smaller irrigation amount inversely soil salt content could be leached down to 100 cm soil layer with the large irrigation amount therefore the continuous use of saline water irrigation would make soil salt content increase rapidly the smaller the irrigation water amount the greater the irrigation water salinity and the more soil salt accumulation however soil salt content could not be fully leached by a small amount of irrigation water because it was mainly accumulated in the crop root soil layer and caused salt stress so as to affect the normal growth of crop malash et al 2005 feng et al 2017 in practice we need to consider the influence of irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity when formulating irrigation schedule of crop in soil salinization area table 5 shows the soil salt accumulation of different treatments in 0 100 cm after the harvest of maize for seed production during 2012 and 2013 in comparison to before the experiments through the analysis of table 5 the soil salt accumulation of each treatment increased with the increase in the use of saline water irrigation the soil salt accumulation of all treatments in 2013 were higher than those in 2012 even if under the sufficient irrigation of fresh water soil salt accumulation increased slightly the soil salt accumulation increased by 0 031 g kg in 2013 compared with in 2012 therefore soil salt accumulation would increase by adopting saline water irrigation for a long time and soil salt accumulation would intensify with increase of irrigation water salinity in terms of soil salt accumulation rate it was the highest under saline water irrigation with 6 g l with the same irrigation amount but different soil salinity during the 2 year experiments the salt accumulation rate of w2s3 treatment was 48 68 and 55 67 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the salt accumulation rate of fresh water irrigation was the smallest and it was 3 99 and 7 76 of w1s1 treatment in 2012 and 2013 respectively the salt accumulation rate under saline water irrigation with 3 g l was between 30 and 50 and it increased gradually with decrease of irrigation water amount under the same irrigation water salinity taking s2 treatment as an example the salt accumulation rate of w1s2 w2s2 and w3s2 was 30 29 31 70 46 61 and 36 33 36 83 48 73 in 2012 and 2013 respectively therefore comprehensively considered the effect of irrigation water amount and salinity the soil salt accumulation increased gradually with increase of irrigation water salinity and decrease of irrigation water amount 3 3 the yield and its components of maize for seed production table 6 presents the yield of maize for seed production during the 2 year irrigation experiments the results showed that the maize for seed production had experienced different degrees of yield reduction along with the increase of irrigation water salinity under the same irrigation water amount the reduction rate was 2 2 11 5 and 2 0 14 8 in 2012 and 2013 respectively taking w2 treatment as an example compared to w2s1 treatment the yield of w2s2 and w2s3 treatments were reduced by 2 2 11 5 and 2 0 13 0 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the yield of maize for seed production under w1 and w3 treatments showed a similar rule it was clear that the maize for seed production yield of appropriate saline water irrigation came close to the yield of fresh water irrigation however much high irrigation water salinity would greatly reduce the yield of maize for seed production the yield of maize for seed production gradually decreased with decrease of irrigation water amount under the same irrigation water salinity the reduction rate was 2 6 31 1 and 4 7 34 3 in 2012 and 2013 respectively taking s2 treatment as an example compared to w1s2 treatment the yield of w2s2 and w3s2 treatments were reduced by 2 6 28 4 and 4 7 29 4 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the yield of maize for seed production of s1 and s3 treatments showed a similar rule it can be seen that moderate deficit irrigation had slight effect on maize yield but excessive deficit irrigation would result in a great reduction in maize yield under both soil water salt stress compare to w1s1 treatment the maize yield of w2s2 w2s3 w3s2 w3s3 treatments were reduced by 6 3 15 2 31 2 34 4 and 10 9 20 8 33 5 39 0 in 2012 and 2013 respectively thus it can be seen that the irrigation with water salinity of 3 g l and the water amount of 2 3 etc will not cause a substantial yield reduction of maize for seed production in this study area table 7 is the variance analysis result of maize for yield and its component factors in two years irrigation experiments the significant difference among treatment is analyzed by double factor analysis of variance the different irrigation treatments were subjected to tukey s test p 0 05 results indicated that the irrigation water amount had significant influence on ear length ear diameter hundred grain weight dry matter weight and yield and the irrigation water salinity had significant influence on hundred grain weight and yield in 2012 the interaction between irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity had only significant influence on hundred grain weight in 2012 the irrigation water amount had significant influence on ear length and the irrigation water salinity had significant influence on ear length ear diameter dry matter weight and yield in 2013 the interaction between irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity had significant influence on ear length and yield in 2013 3 4 the water use efficiency of maize for seed production table 8 shows the water use efficiency of maize for seed production in different treatments the water use efficiency of maize was mainly affected by water consumption and yield from table 8 analysis we can see that the water use efficiency of deficit irrigation treatment was generally grater than sufficient irrigation treatment taking 2012 as an example the minimum water use efficiency of maize was w1 treatment and the value was 1 11 kg m3 the water use efficiency of w2 and w3 treatment increased by 15 32 and 1 80 under fresh water irrigation by 22 43 and4 67 under irrigation water salinity with 3 g l in comparison of w1 treatment respectively the water use efficiency of maize which was adopted deficit irrigation with irrigation water amount of 2 3 etc was the largest under the same irrigation water salinity the use efficiency of maize for seed production had the similar rule in 2013 the results showed that a certain degree of deficit irrigation was beneficial to improve the water use efficiency of crop but excessive deficit irrigation would also reduce the water use efficiency of maize for seed production the use efficiency of maize was also affected by irrigation water salinity the water use efficiency of maize of w1 and w3 treatment decreased with increase in irrigation water salinity in two years experiments taking w1 treatment in 2013 as an example the water use efficiency of w1s2 and w1s3 treatment decreased by 5 32 and 6 44 in comparison of w1s1 treatment respectively the water use efficiency of maize decreased more obvious under the greater irrigation water salinity except for w2 treatment the use efficiency of maize had the similar rule in 2012 the maximum water use efficiency of maize was w2s2 treatment and the maximum value was 1 31 kg m3 and 1 28 kg m3 respectively in 2012 and 2013 the results showed that the water use efficiency of maize could be increased with irrigation water amount of 2 3 etc and irrigation water salinity of below 3 g l under soil water salt stress 4 conclusions we performed deficit irrigation with saline water experiments for 2 consecutive years to study the effects of deficit irrigation with saline water on soil water salt distribution and water use efficiency of maize for seed production in arid northwest china the main conclusions of this study were that soil water salt distribution was affected by both irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity under deficit irrigation with saline water the soil water content of saline water irrigation was higher than fresh water irrigation and soil salt content increased with increase of irrigation water salinity under the same irrigation water amount the soil water content of deficit irrigation was lower than sufficient irrigation and soil salt content increased with decrease of irrigation water amount under the same irrigation water salinity the soil salt accumulation increased gradually with increase of irrigation water salinity and decrease of irrigation water amount under the combined effect of irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity irrigation with water salinity of 3 g l and water amount of 370 mm will not cause a substantial yield reduction and could increase water use efficiency of maize for seed production irrigation schedule with irrigation water amount about 370 mm and irrigation water salinity below 3 g l is recommended in this study area therefore it can realize the reasonable utilization of saline water and water saving irritation and this irrigation schedule can be promoted in the practice of agricultural production acknowledgements this research was

water irrigation deficit irrigation soil water salt distribution maize for seed production yield water use efficiency 1 introduction the shiyang river basin is an interior river basin that confronted excessive water explore and utilization contradiction between water demand and water resources as well as environmental deterioration in northwest china kang et al 2004 for this arid area with surface water resources shortage the groundwater is an important resource for social and economic development maintaining the ecological environment and agricultural production due to excessive exploration of local water resources the groundwater salinity increased year by year the general groundwater salinity is 0 5 1 0 g l in upstream region 1 0 3 0 g l in midstream region 3 0 9 0 g l in downstream region and up to 10 0 g l in partial region of shiyang river basin huang et al 2010 feng et al 2014 in order to make up the shortage of fresh water resources and ensure the steady development of agricultural production in arid area saline water irrigation and deficit irrigation have been widely used in agricultural production ali et al 2007 chauhan et al 2008 geerts and raes 2009 ahmed et al 2010 the most important consideration in the utilization of saline water irrigation is crop yield malash et al 2005 a large number of experiments have shown that the crops yield irrigated by saline water or brackish water can close or achieve to the yield irrigated by fresh water for some salt tolerant crops niu et al 2010 wan et al 2010 malasha et al 2012 singh and panda 2012 however the use of saline water may cause salt accumulation change the way of soil water salt movement and the soil environment of farmland ultimately reducing crop productivity by hindering water uptake wan et al 2010 huang et al 2010 wang et al 2015 the principle of using saline water irrigation is that the salt accumulation in the soil does not exceed the salt tolerance limit of the crop deficit irrigation provides a mean of increasing water use efficiency by reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on yield mao et al 2003 panda et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 the crop is exposed to a certain level of water stress either during a particular period or throughout the whole growing season in this method the expectation is that any yield reduction especially in water limiting situations will be compensated by increased production from the additional irrigated area with the water saved by deficit irrigation ali et al 2007 many investigations have been carried out worldwide regarding the effects of deficit irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency mansourifar et al 2010 salemi et al 2011 ahmadi et al 2015 they reported that regulated deficit irrigation provides a means of reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on the yield webber et al 2006 geerts and raes 2009 du et al 2010 kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 soil water salt distribution crop yield and water use efficiency under combined deficit and saline water irrigation are different to those under separate deficit or saline irrigation shani and dudley 2001 stressed that the maximum yield and the corresponding irrigation water quantity for poor quality water are less than those for good quality water jiang et al 2013 reported that spring wheat is sensitive to deficit irrigation especially at the booting to grain filling stages but was not significantly affect by saline irrigation and the combination of deficit irrigation and saline water irrigation maize is one of the most important crops in the world and is sensitive to salt content panda et al 2004 leogrande et al 2016 mohammadi et al 2011 reported that the water deficit and salinity stress had a significant effect on grain yield of hybrid maize the maize for seed production is one of the main economic crops and the planting area of maize is rapidly increasing in arid northwest china however soil water salt distribution yield and water use efficiency of maize for seed production under deficit irrigation with saline water have been reported rarely this study has an important theoretical significance for

salinity had significant influence on ear length and yield in 2013 3 4 the water use efficiency of maize for seed production table 8 shows the water use efficiency of maize for seed production in different treatments the water use efficiency of maize was mainly affected by water consumption and yield from table 8 analysis we can see that the water use efficiency of deficit irrigation treatment was generally grater than sufficient irrigation treatment taking 2012 as an example the minimum water use efficiency of maize was w1 treatment and the value was 1 11 kg m3 the water use efficiency of w2 and w3 treatment increased by 15 32 and 1 80 under fresh water irrigation by 22 43 and4 67 under irrigation water salinity with 3 g l in comparison of w1 treatment respectively the water use efficiency of maize which was adopted deficit irrigation with irrigation water amount of 2 3 etc was the largest under the same irrigation water salinity the use efficiency of maize for seed production had the similar rule in 2013 the results showed that a certain degree of deficit irrigation was beneficial to improve the water use efficiency of crop but excessive deficit irrigation would also reduce the water use efficiency of maize for seed production the use efficiency of maize was also affected by irrigation water salinity the water use efficiency of maize of w1 and w3 treatment decreased with increase in irrigation water salinity in two years experiments taking w1 treatment in 2013 as an example the water use efficiency of w1s2 and w1s3 treatment decreased by 5 32 and 6 44 in comparison of w1s1 treatment respectively the water use efficiency of maize decreased more obvious under the greater irrigation water salinity except for w2 treatment the use efficiency of maize had the similar rule in 2012 the maximum water use efficiency of maize was w2s2 treatment and the maximum value was 1 31 kg m3 and 1 28 kg m3 respectively in 2012 and 2013 the results showed that the water use efficiency of maize could be increased with irrigation water amount of 2 3 etc and irrigation water salinity of below 3 g l under soil water salt stress 4 conclusions we performed deficit irrigation with saline water experiments for 2 consecutive years to study the effects of deficit irrigation with saline water on soil water salt distribution and water use efficiency of maize for seed production in arid northwest china the main conclusions of this study were that soil water salt distribution was affected by both irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity under deficit irrigation with saline water the soil water content of saline water irrigation was higher than fresh water irrigation and soil salt content increased with increase of irrigation water salinity under the same irrigation water amount the soil water content of deficit irrigation was lower than sufficient irrigation and soil salt content increased with decrease of irrigation water amount under the same irrigation water salinity the soil salt accumulation increased gradually with increase of irrigation water salinity and decrease of irrigation water amount under the combined effect of irrigation water amount and irrigation water salinity irrigation with water salinity of 3 g l and water amount of 370 mm will not cause a substantial yield reduction and could increase water use efficiency of maize for seed production irrigation schedule with irrigation water amount about 370 mm and irrigation water salinity below 3 g l is recommended in this study area therefore it can realize the reasonable utilization of saline water and water saving irritation and this irrigation schedule can be promoted in the practice of agricultural production acknowledgements this research was

irrigation management have been suggested to achieve high yields with less water used by the crop i e evapotranspiration et this study of maize evaluated twelve treatments with varying levels of deficit irrigation during late vegetative and maturation grain filling growth stages in semi arid northern colorado in particular application of greater deficit during the late vegetative state with full or nearly full et during the rest of the season consistently resulted in yield similar to full et treatments while saving approximately 15 17 of et maize given 40 of full et during the late vegetative period had slightly reduced leaf area index lai with significant leaf curling thus reduced light interception during vegetative growth however when plants were fully watered during anthesis all treatments had full canopy cover with no differences in light interception the efficiency of photosystem ii quantum yield declined with water stress but recovered with re watering the ability of photosystem ii and light interception to recover after stress when well watered suggests that reductions in biomass and yield resulted from stomatal closure reduced photochemistry or loss of xylem conductance that was temporary with little indication of permanent decline in carbon assimilation after reducing et in vegetative stages maize appears able to achieve high grain yield if soil water is readily available during the reproductive and maturation stages however plants given full or nearly full irrigation during the entire vegetative period followed by stress later on during the maturation period had dramatically greater yield loss than et savings thus while strategic deficit irrigation might maintain yield with less water it may be especially important for buffering crops

derner et al 2015 knapp et al 2008 seager and vecchi 2010 past research in agronomic water use has focused on improving irrigation efficiency i e water consumed as a fraction of water applied however poor irrigation efficiency at the farm scale may not necessarily result in a marked decline in watershed scale efficiency because some water losses runoff and deep percolation may return to the watershed and be used downstream however as water supplies have become over allocated and basin wide efficiencies have increased crop water productivity i e yield per unit water consumed by the crop

payero et al 2006 tolk et al 1999 yilmaz et al 2010 however curvilinear water production functions wpfs have been found when deficit irrigation was unevenly applied across the season with more water

current equations for estimating irrigation requirements e g fao 56 penman monteith based equations assume a constant marginal water productivity throughout plant development and maturation but it is well known that crop sensitivity to drought varies across plant developmental stages such that these equations may be over simplified and have room for improvement questions also remain on how to apply deficit irrigation across the season for highest water productivity assuming the producer does not have access to adequate water to maximize production typical recommendations for maize under rdi include supplying et during anthesis and initial grain fill which are recognized as the most sensitive stages to drought stress çakir 2004 kirda et al 1999 yilmaz et al 2010 but optimal times to apply deficits are not well established deficit irrigation in early vegetative stages may negatively affect yield in corn by producing weak plants or limiting the number of rows on the developing ear huang et al 2002 kirda et al 1999 stevens et al 1986 but see kang et al 2000 pandey et al 2000 however applying irrigation during vegetative stages could accelerate increases in leaf area light interception and photosynthesis and thus increase yield per total plant water consumption geerts and raes 2009 nonetheless stress during vegetative stages may precondition plants to tolerate greater drought stress during later stages in crop development such as the grain filling stage in maize harb et al 2010 thus the optimal timing for applying water deficits to achieve the highest water

table 1 the 2012 season was abnormally hot and dry leading to approximately 140 mm greater et usage by the fully irrigated treatment compared to the 2013 season especially during the late vegetative period table 1 lai was significantly different among the twelve treatments near the end of the first stress period late vegetative and during the second stress period grain filling fig 2 in 2013 differences in lai at grain filling may have been partially due to leaf senescence because samples were taken later in the season when lai was collected during the reproductive period in 2013 there were no differences in lai among treatments in both years light interception measurements indicated significantly less light interception with stress in the late vegetative stress period among the twelve treatments likely due to a combination of leaf curling and reduced canopy development but all treatments achieved mid day light interception above 80 full interception when given full irrigation during anthesis fig 3 the quantum yield of photosystem ii showed acclimation to water stress during both stress periods in both years with declines in stressed treatments compared to treatments with less deficits among the twelve fig 4 in both years the quantum yield of photosystem ii in water deficit treatments recovered to approach levels in well watered treatments when given full irrigation during anthesis the increase in quantum yield in plants previously under deficit suggested that stressed plants were not permanently impaired by moderate deficit levels although the most stressed treatments in 2012 50 50 and 40 40 did not show full recovery measurements indicated about a 10 15 d lag in acclimation of quantum yield to water stress after the water status of the

had enough support to warrant consideration aic values of 2nd degree polynomial fits were lower but indicated improvement over linear fits by only 1 in 2012 and 2 in 2013 however the y intercept from a linear fit in 2012 was positive y intercept 2030 which is not possible because it suggests that yield is produced by crop entirely without using any et in 2013 the projected et to begin producing yield was only 60 mm while experience in the central plains indicates that at least 200 mm of effective seasonal precipitation is required to produce maize grain yield this implies that the wpf must be concave downward moreover in 2013 when functions were re fit after including additional treatments that were not significantly different from the fit functions i e 80 65 80 50 65 80 65 50 65 40 the

fig 5 interestingly treatments with 65 et targets in the late vegetative period did not significantly differ from the equal stress wpf in either year regardless of the level of et supplied in the grain filling period in contrast to those with 80 et targets in the late vegetative period that had significantly lower yields when given less than 65 et later in the season 65 x and 80 x curves fig 5 both years the irrigation treatment with 65 et targeted in the late vegetative period and 80 et during the grain filling period consistently achieved yields that were not significantly less than the full irrigation treatment while saving 15 17 of crop et 100 130 mm harvest index varied among the twelve treatments with the treatment targeting 65 80 deficit having significantly higher hi in both years than treatments with full or nearly full et targeted in the late vegetative period that had targets of less than 65 et during the grain filling period table 1 fig 5 stalk dry weights at the end of the vegetative period predicted yield in treatments among all treatment except those with greater deficits during the grain filling period which overestimated yield data not shown these treatments with relatively higher stress during the second than during the first stress period tended to have the lowest hi values indicating the grain fill penalty of late season deficits and a lack of compensation from stem reserves that might be available in plants well irrigated throughout the vegetative period 4 discussion imposing deficit irrigation during the late vegetative stage with no to moderate stress at other stages appears to maximize yield per water used by maize analyses of lai and light interception suggest that even if crop canopy developed more slowly as judged from lai curves or curled under deficit irrigation as judged by oscillations in light interception during stress applying approximately 55 et during late the vegetative period the lowest actual et achieved was not enough to permanently limit potential light interception as indicated by similarity at the measurement of light interception after a period in which all treatments were fully watered the capacity of photosynthesis as indicated by chlorophyll fluorescence fluctuated with plant adaptation to water availability and suggested full or nearly full recovery of photosynthetic functioning after re watering plants previously under water stress yield responses to varying annual et were characterized with curvilinear relationships in both years with the timing of deficits consistently affecting productivity treatments with full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period followed by severe deficits during grain filling 100 50 and 80 40 et treatments had significantly lower yields than projected for their annual et and lower yield than several treatments with less total et the timing of deficits clearly affected water productivity in this study several studies have identified anthesis and the phase immediately following anthesis seed set during the early reproductive stage as the most sensitive to water deficits nesmith and ritchie 1992a westgate and boyer 1985a but the intension here was to identify the timing of water deficit outside of this critical period that could reduce water consumption and minimize yield losses other studies have shown that water productivity differs with the timing of water application nesmith and ritchie 1992b c payero et al 2009 in these studies however water deficits either were not imposed by growth stage or comparisons of deficits from different growth stages were not evaluated within the same study comparing regulated deficit irrigation occurring in different growth stages strategic deficit irrigation sdi we found several treatments with greater deficits during the vegetative period had higher water productivity and overall less annual et compared to treatments with full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period and deficits during grain filling despite having similar deficits in the maturation period maize responds to adequate water with high productivity but yields decline sharply when water is reduced payero et al 2006 steduto et al 2012 the shape of the wpf yield et response has been the subject of debate if yield declines linearly with water deficits deficit irrigation is not beneficial for producers because the marginal productivity of water is constant resulting in no increase in marginal productivity between full and deficit irrigation trout and dejonge 2017 moreover because an increment of water is required to produce the first increment of yield deficit irrigation will have lower water productivity than full irrigation in terms of total consumed water trout and dejonge 2017 in this dataset we found curvilinear responses between yield and et in both years were more robust another study found curvilinear responses trout and dejonge 2017 although linear responses have predominated in the literature farré and faci 2006 igbadun et al 2006 oktem et al 2003 pandey et al 2000 payero et al 2006 payero et al 2009 tolk et al 1999 yilmaz et al 2010 in studies with linear responses the intent was often to apply stress evenly throughout the year although this often was not well documented payero et al 2009 attempted to vary water deficits in periods from july through september but analyses of the general response of yield et were examined among all treatments without examining the effects of specific timing curvilinear responses may be a result of adequate water availability during anthesis as it has been clearly demonstrated that maize yield is increased with full irrigation during anthesis and pollination to alleviate stress when sensitivity of maize to water stress is greatest salter and goode 1967 westgate and boyer 1985b the ability of photosystem ii and light interception to recover when well watered after stress suggests that reductions in biomass and yield resulted from stomatal closure reduced photochemistry or loss of xylem conductance that was largely temporary because deficit treatments reached full or nearly full canopy cover and could recover physiologically plants stressed during the vegetative stage but given increased water available during the grain filling stage were able to use this water to support grain production as shown by their yield and harvest index responses on the other hand treatments with full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period followed by severe deficits during grain filling had reduced yields even compared to treatments that used overall less annual et in conclusion results here clearly indicate benefits to applying deficits during the late vegetative period if there is a chance that the water supply might be inadequate to meet full irrigation targets during the maturation period although producers with limited surface water supplies or groundwater well capacity constraints may not be able to adequately control the timing of irrigation producers with reservoir storage or legally restricted groundwater pumping can decide when to apply their limited supplies limited surface water supplies may run out before the end of the season or pumping capacity may be inadequate to meet crop demands when crop water use is high however results here suggest that producers in these situations may be able to increase maize crop production by limiting irrigation during late vegetative stages to prevent larger losses that may occur when maize is given full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period and then severe deficits during grain fill acknowledgments the structure of treatments was developed with valuable input from d shaner

deficit irrigation during late vegetative and maturation grain filling growth stages in semi arid northern colorado in particular application of greater deficit during the late vegetative state with

all treatments had full canopy cover with no differences in light interception the efficiency of photosystem ii quantum yield declined with water stress but recovered with re watering the ability of photosystem ii and light interception to recover after stress when well watered suggests that reductions in biomass and yield resulted from stomatal closure reduced photochemistry or loss of xylem conductance that was temporary with little indication of permanent decline in carbon assimilation after reducing et in vegetative stages maize appears able to achieve high grain yield if soil water is readily available during the reproductive and maturation stages however plants given full or nearly full irrigation during the entire vegetative period followed by stress later on during the

maximize crop water productivity yield per unit water used by the crop rather than simply maximizing yield debaeke and aboudrare 2004 producers in semi arid regions face increasing scarcity of irrigation water due to the growing demand from urban centers and industry depletion of groundwater aquifers increased environmental and recreational demand and a shifting and more volatile climate derner et al 2015 knapp et al 2008 seager and vecchi 2010 past research in agronomic water use has focused on improving irrigation efficiency i e water consumed as a fraction of water applied however poor irrigation efficiency at the farm scale may not necessarily result in a marked decline in watershed scale efficiency because some water losses runoff and deep percolation may return to the watershed and be used downstream however as water supplies have become over allocated and basin wide efficiencies have increased crop water productivity i e yield per unit water consumed by the crop represents an opportunity to further improve irrigation water use efficiency water productivity wp is defined as crop yield per total evapotranspiration et of the cropping system required to bring the crop to maturity regulated deficit irrigation rdi which strategically supplies less water than required to achieve maximal yield has been a primary strategy targeted in water limited environments for maximizing wp english et al 2002 fereres and soriano 2007 geerts and raes 2009 pereira et al 2002 linear relationships between yield and et indicate that maximal water productivity and economic return will be achieved when water is supplied in sufficient quantity to achieve maximal yield a wp function must be curvilinear and concave downward for deficit irrigation to provide increased water productivity trout and dejonge 2017 in some crops e g cotton soybean wheat the relationship between yield and et is curvilinear and convex such that wp may be maximized at less than maximum et henggeler et al 2002 sincik et al 2008 tavakkoli and oweis 2004 in the case of maize wp is high relative to other agronomic crops but yield decreases steeply with decreasing et often linearly particularly when water is withheld evenly across the season with about one third of total et consumed before reproduction farré and faci 2006 igbadun et al 2006 oktem et al 2003 pandey et al 2000 payero et al 2006 tolk et al 1999 yilmaz et al 2010 however curvilinear water production functions wpfs have been found when deficit irrigation was unevenly applied across the season with more water supplied during the anthesis and initial grain fill stages trout and dejonge 2017 when maize yields are known to be most sensitive to water stress salter and goode 1967 westgate and boyer 1985b current equations for estimating irrigation requirements e g fao 56 penman monteith based equations assume a constant marginal water productivity throughout plant development and maturation but it is well known that crop sensitivity to drought varies across plant developmental stages such that these equations may be over simplified and have room for improvement questions also remain on how to apply deficit irrigation across the season for highest water productivity assuming the producer does not have access to adequate water to maximize production typical recommendations for maize under rdi include supplying et during anthesis and initial grain fill which are recognized as the most sensitive stages to drought stress çakir 2004 kirda et al 1999 yilmaz et al 2010 but optimal times to apply deficits are not well established deficit irrigation in early vegetative stages may negatively affect yield in corn by producing weak plants or limiting the number of rows on the developing ear huang et al 2002 kirda et al 1999 stevens et al 1986 but see kang et al 2000 pandey et al 2000 however applying irrigation during vegetative stages could accelerate increases in leaf area light interception and photosynthesis and thus increase yield per total plant water consumption geerts and raes 2009 nonetheless stress during vegetative stages may precondition plants to tolerate greater drought stress during later stages in crop development such as the grain filling stage in maize harb et al 2010 thus the optimal timing for applying water deficits to achieve the highest water productivity by maize has yet to be determined approximately one quarter of the irrigated crop area in the us is within the northern great plains represented by colorado montana nebraska north dakota south dakota and wyoming derner et al 2015 within the northern great plains more irrigated land is planted to maize than any other crop this trend is increasing with an unprecedented transition in agricultural land use from grassland to annual crops derner et al 2015 wright and wimberly 2013 maize generates the greatest economic revenue in the northern plains at ca 13 3 billion with the next valued crop generating less than half of this revenue derner et al 2015 globally maize is one of the top four staple crops supporting human populations fao 2003 it is also an important feed for livestock with growing importance as people in developing counties increasingly demand a diet with more meat and dairy fao 2012 usda 2012 the aim of this paper is to investigate maize yield responses to seasonally distributed deficit irrigation and identify underlying factors causing these responses to better understand improvements that can be made in irrigation management and crop physiology that determines water productivity specifically we sought to 1 examine yield responses to et deficits independently targeted during two stress periods the late vegetative v8 vt and grain filling r4 r6 stages to determine the shape of the response curve and identify treatments that hinder or maintain yield and 2 identify if water productivity was limited by canopy development or photosynthetic

approximately 25 ppm n we note that differences in n input among treatments largely mirror expected differences in yield potential associated with the varying water levels of water deficit in most years irrigation deficits were applied independently during two stress periods corresponding with late vegetative v8 vt and grain filling r4 r6 stages fig 1 stress periods were chosen to avoid stress during the formation of rows on the developing ear at v7 stevens et al 1986 treatments with similar et targets between the two stress periods were used to establish the wp function used as a baseline for comparison combinations of irrigation deficit varying timing and amount were established to test the hypotheses of preconditioning plants to maintain yield under stress through prior exposure to stress and identify yield impacts of stress between the two stress periods with analyses across the treatment matrix fig 1 2 2 irrigation management and water balance weather data from a coagmet

soil water content taken with tdr on the face of the wall in 15 cm increments across and down these pits show that moisture from irrigation dissipated across rows within a day of irrigations and that the entire wetting zone was captured by the soil moisture readings root zone soil water content was based on depth weighted average soil water content to 105 cm assuming the soil water was evenly

per season to quantify crop development ten plants were collected from the middle eight rows the north and south sections of each plot in areas with representative plant density the row length of each

calculating lai leaves were cut from stems at the collars and scanned with a leaf area meter li 3100c li cor lincoln nebraska usa and then leaves and stems from each sample were dried and weighed

table 1 the 2012 season was abnormally hot and dry leading to approximately 140 mm greater et usage by the fully irrigated treatment compared to the 2013 season especially during the late vegetative period table 1 lai was significantly different among the twelve treatments near the end of the first stress period late vegetative and during the second stress period grain filling fig 2 in 2013 differences in lai at grain filling may have been partially due to leaf senescence because samples were taken later in the season when lai was collected during the reproductive period in 2013 there were no differences in lai among treatments in both years light interception measurements indicated significantly less light interception with stress in the late vegetative stress period among the twelve treatments likely due to a combination of leaf curling and reduced canopy development but all treatments achieved mid day light interception above 80 full interception when given full irrigation during anthesis fig 3 the quantum yield of photosystem ii showed acclimation to water stress during both stress periods in both years with declines in stressed treatments compared to treatments with less deficits among the twelve fig 4 in both years the quantum yield of photosystem ii in water deficit treatments recovered to approach levels in well watered treatments when given full irrigation during anthesis the increase in quantum yield in plants previously under deficit suggested that stressed plants were not permanently impaired by moderate deficit levels although the most stressed treatments in 2012 50 50 and 40 40 did not show full recovery measurements indicated about a 10 15 d lag in acclimation of quantum yield to water stress after the water status of the treatments changed e g lag in treatment differences separating or coming together after deficit treatments were imposed or removed linear regression wpf fit to treatments with equal deficit targets i

had enough support to warrant consideration aic values of 2nd degree polynomial fits were lower but indicated improvement over linear fits by only 1 in 2012 and 2 in 2013 however the y intercept from a linear fit in 2012 was positive y intercept 2030 which is not possible because it suggests that yield is produced by crop entirely without using any et in 2013 the projected et to begin producing yield was only 60 mm while experience in the central plains indicates that at least 200 mm of effective seasonal precipitation is required to produce maize grain yield this implies that the wpf must be concave downward moreover in 2013 when functions were re fit after including additional treatments that were not significantly different from the fit functions i e 80 65 80 50 65 80 65 50 65 40 the linear fit was much worse than the second order polynomial fit r 2 adj 0 75 and 0 93 respectively thus due to practical limitations of the linear extrapolations and improved regression fits in both years r2 adj 0 96 and 0 89 in 2012 and 2013 respectively fits of second order polynomials were considered more robust in both years fig 5 treatments with 100 and 80 et targets in the late vegetative period that had targets of less than 65 et during the grain filling period suffered significant yield losses compared to the equal stress wpf 100 50 80 50 and 80 40 in 2012 100 50 and 80 40 in 2013 fig 5 interestingly treatments with 65 et targets in the late vegetative period did not significantly differ from the equal stress wpf in either year regardless of the level of et supplied in the grain filling period in contrast to those with 80 et targets in the late vegetative period that had significantly lower yields when given less than 65 et later in the season 65 x and 80 x curves fig 5 both years the irrigation treatment with 65 et targeted in the late vegetative period and 80 et during the grain filling period consistently achieved yields that were not significantly less than the full irrigation treatment while saving 15 17 of crop et 100 130 mm harvest index varied among the twelve treatments with the treatment targeting 65 80 deficit having significantly higher hi in both years than treatments with full or nearly full et targeted in the late vegetative period that had targets of less than 65 et during the grain filling period table 1 fig 5 stalk dry weights at the end of the vegetative period predicted yield in treatments among all treatment except those with greater deficits during the grain filling period which overestimated yield data not shown these treatments with relatively higher stress during the second than during the first stress period tended to have the lowest hi values indicating the grain fill penalty of late season deficits and a lack of compensation from stem reserves that might be available in plants well irrigated throughout the vegetative period 4 discussion imposing deficit irrigation during the late vegetative stage with no to moderate stress at other stages appears to maximize yield per water used by maize analyses of lai and light interception suggest that even if crop canopy developed more slowly as judged from lai curves or curled under deficit irrigation as judged by oscillations in light interception during stress applying approximately 55 et during late the vegetative period the lowest actual et achieved was not enough to permanently limit potential light interception as indicated by similarity at the measurement of light interception after a period in which all treatments were fully watered the capacity of photosynthesis as indicated by chlorophyll fluorescence fluctuated with plant adaptation to water availability and suggested full or nearly full recovery of photosynthetic functioning after re watering plants previously under water stress yield responses to varying annual et were characterized with curvilinear relationships in both years with the timing of deficits consistently affecting productivity treatments with full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period followed by severe deficits during grain filling 100 50 and 80 40 et treatments had significantly lower yields than projected for their annual et and lower yield than several treatments with less total et the timing of deficits clearly affected water productivity in this study several studies have identified anthesis and the phase immediately following anthesis seed set during the early reproductive stage as the most sensitive to water deficits nesmith and ritchie 1992a westgate and boyer 1985a but the intension here was to identify the timing of water deficit outside of this critical period that could reduce water consumption and minimize yield losses other studies have shown that water productivity differs with the timing of water application nesmith and ritchie 1992b c payero et al 2009 in these studies however water deficits either were not imposed by growth stage or comparisons of deficits from different growth stages were not evaluated within the same study comparing regulated deficit irrigation occurring in different growth stages strategic deficit irrigation sdi we found several treatments with greater deficits during the vegetative period had higher water productivity and overall less annual et compared to treatments with full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period and deficits during grain filling despite having similar deficits in the maturation period maize responds to adequate water with high productivity but yields decline sharply when water is reduced payero et al 2006 steduto et al 2012 the shape of the wpf yield et response has been the subject of debate if yield declines linearly with water deficits deficit irrigation is not beneficial for producers because the marginal productivity of water is constant resulting in no increase in marginal productivity between full and deficit irrigation trout and dejonge 2017 moreover because an increment of water is required to produce the first increment of yield deficit irrigation will have lower water productivity than full irrigation in terms of total consumed water trout and dejonge 2017 in this dataset we found curvilinear responses between yield and et in both years were more robust another study found curvilinear responses trout and dejonge 2017 although linear responses have predominated in the literature farré and faci 2006 igbadun et al 2006 oktem et al 2003 pandey et al 2000 payero et al 2006 payero et al 2009 tolk et al 1999 yilmaz et al 2010 in studies with linear responses the intent was often to apply stress evenly throughout the year although this often was not well documented payero et al 2009 attempted to vary water deficits in periods from july through september but analyses of the general response of yield et were examined among all treatments without examining the effects of specific timing curvilinear responses may be a result of adequate water availability during anthesis as it has been clearly demonstrated that maize yield is increased with full irrigation during anthesis and pollination to alleviate stress when sensitivity of maize to water stress is greatest salter and goode 1967 westgate and boyer 1985b the ability of photosystem ii and light interception to recover when well watered after stress suggests that reductions in biomass and yield resulted from stomatal closure reduced photochemistry or loss of xylem conductance that was largely temporary because deficit treatments reached full or nearly full canopy cover and could recover physiologically plants stressed during the vegetative stage but given increased water available during the grain filling stage were able to use this water to support grain production as shown by their yield and harvest index responses on the other hand treatments with full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period followed by severe deficits during grain filling had reduced yields even compared to treatments that used overall less annual et in conclusion results here clearly indicate benefits to applying deficits during the late vegetative period if there is a chance that the water supply might be inadequate to meet full irrigation targets during the maturation period although producers with limited surface water supplies or groundwater well capacity constraints may not be able to adequately control the timing of irrigation producers with reservoir storage or legally restricted groundwater pumping can decide when to apply their limited supplies limited surface water supplies may run out before the end of the season or pumping capacity may be inadequate to meet crop demands when crop water use is high however results here suggest that producers in these situations may be able to increase maize crop production by limiting irrigation during late vegetative stages to prevent larger losses that may occur when maize is given full or nearly full irrigation during the vegetative period and then severe deficits during grain fill acknowledgments the structure of treatments was developed with valuable input from d shaner

11278,a key determinant of water limited yield potential in dryland agriculture is the soil s plant available water capacity pawc the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit over the rooting depth to simulate water limited yield potential yw a crop model must be parameterised for the local edaphic conditions which require a quantitative description of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth often these soil properties have to be estimated from existing soil surveys which creates uncertainty for drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth the impact of uncertainty in these soil properties on the estimation of yw has not previously been reported using the agricultural production systems simulator apsim a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the effect of uncertainties in drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth on wheat yw for two contrasting rainfall sites high and low with two typical soil types shallow sandy duplex and clay in western australia simulation results demonstrated that the resultant change in pawc was the dominant driver of a change in the estimate of yw irrespective of whether such a change was caused by drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth estimated errors that underestimated or overestimated pawc by up to 20 mm only had a marginal impact on yw less than 200 kg ha 1 in all environments soil type location but when this error was more than 20 mm an underestimation would cause more severe deviation of yw of wheat than an overestimation on average 40 mm underestimation of pawc resulted into 530 kg ha 1 of yw while this amount of overestimation caused overestimation of yw about 290 kg ha 1 the bias of underestimated wheat yw due to underestimation of pawc was generally increased with rainfall up to 350 mm we conclude that it is better to estimate soil hydrological parameters towards overestimating pawc than to underestimate pawc however where possible all three soil hydrological parameters should be estimated as accurately as possible keywords drained upper limit crop lower limit rooting depth pawc apsim yield potential 1 introduction process based crop simulation models are useful tools for agricultural analysis they have been widely used for predicting crop yield batchelor et al 2002 gabrielle et al 2002 wart et al 2013 and yield gaps lobell et al 2010 wart et al 2013 as well as understanding the adaptation of crops to their environments chapman 2008 kirkegaard and hunt 2010 shorter et al 1991 villalobos et al 1996 and improving management practices in agricultural systems matthews et al 2002 yu et al 2006 crop models require inputs of soil physical and hydrological properties besides climate and crop data however when crop models like the agricultural production systems simulator apsim that requires inputs of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth are used to simulate crops at regional or larger spatial scales it is often difficult to precisely characterise these attributes of the soil due to the inherent variability in natural processes costly monitoring or imperfections in data measurements wang et al 2005 wu et al 2010 national soil maps often provide information on a local dominant soil but at a field scale the soil may be misrepresented therefore unlike climate data soil databases that precisely define the soil hydrological properties at an appropriate scale rarely exist as a result these parameters have to be inferred from nearby soil surveys and local knowledge however estimating soil hydrological parameters may be imprecise which in turn leads to biased estimates of plant available water capacity pawc the total amount of water a soil can store it is defined as the volumetric difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit over a crop s rooting depth dalgliesh and foale 1998 biased estimates of pawc can consequently lead to the miscalculation of how much water can enter the storage the pawc is a key factor impacting the availability of water to plants and therefore a biased estimate of pawc can lead to errors in yield of crop in rainfed cropping the imprecise estimates of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth and their impact on pawc inevitably result in incorrect estimates of crop yield or yield gaps aggarwal 1995 makowski et al 2006 tremblay and wallach 2004 this is particularly the case in dryland agriculture in arid and semi arid regions where cropping depends heavily on pawc and rainfall the effect that poor estimation of soil hydrological characterisation can have on crop yield predictions in dryland cropping system has occasionally been considered for instance lawless et al 2008 used the sirius wheat simulation model to analyse the effect of uncertainty in soil moisture characteristics on the precision of simulated crop growth and development and concluded that quantitative soil moisture attributes should be made in order to accurately predict crop yield pogson et al 2012 assessed the sensitivity of crop model predictions to entire meteorological and soil input datasets and their results highlighted that the estimation of soil water parameters wilt point and field capacity was likely to become increasingly critical in areas affected by climate change however it is still unclear how much error can be tolerated for soil hydrological parameters to generate acceptable yield potential estimates in water limited environments yw it is also unclear which hydrological parameter has more relative importance to affect yw in this study we used apsim to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the estimation of wheat yw to the change in soil hydrological parameters drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth at two contrasting rainfall sites for two typical soil types in western australia the objective of this study was to produce a detailed understanding of the effects of uncertainties of pawc resulted from biased estimation of soil hydrological attributes on crop yw it was hypothesised that the biased estimation of soil hydrological parameters would have more effects on wheat yw for the low pawc soil in high rainfall zone moreover rooting depth and the time course of its development are crucial processes in the model which controls the water uptake pattern water deficit can slow down the rooting depth development and vice versa resulting in an overreaction of the crop to water shortage asseng et al 1998b as such it was also hypothesised that rooting depth would have more relative importance among the three parameters as it affects both crop growth and water budget thus the aims of this study were to 1 quantify the bias in simulated wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc caused by inputs of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth 2 to determine the relative importance of the three parameters and 3 to identify the relationship between the biased crop yw with variable rainfall 2 materials and method 2 1 apsim model description apsim agricultural production systems simulator is a cropping systems simulation model that allows models of crops pastures soil water nutrients and erosion to be flexibly configured to simulate diverse agricultural systems holzworth et al 2014 it runs at a daily time step using daily meteorological data including maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall and total solar radiation the model has been widely used to assess on farm management practices climate risk change adaptation strategies farming systems design for production or resource management objectives and many other applications anwar et al 2009 asseng et al 1998a b 2004 keating et al 2003 mccown et al 1996 wang et al 2011 wessolek and asseng 2006 apsim is also being used by commercial growers as a decision support tool for in season crop management via the yield prophet online management tool hochman et al 2009 in the apsim model the soilwat module simulates the various vertical water movements in a layered soil system using a multi layer cascading approach the water characteristics of the soil are specified in terms of air dry the lower limit drained upper limit and saturated volumetric water content in each soil layer while to conduct on farm crop simulations parameter of crop lower limit at each layer in the soil profile is also needed drained upper limit and crop lower limit represent the maximum and minimum soil water content available to a specific crop over the potential rooting depth together they are used to define pawc of the soil following the procedure of dalgliesh and foale 1998 thus pawc is the measure of the plant available water capacity directly related to crop yield potential especially under water limited conditions oliver et al 2006 2 2 modelling the effects of the uncertainties in soil parameters on rainfed wheat yield potential two typical soils shallow sandy duplex called thereafter sand and clay were selected to evaluate the effects of the uncertainties in drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth which cause the uncertainties in pawc accordingly on wheat yw in western australia where wheat grows under rain fed conditions producing about 50 of australia s total wheat production sand and clay are ranked second and third in terms of area distribution gravel accounts for the largest area accounting for 14 9 and 10 0 respectively across the western australia wheat belt in the baseline simulation table 1 150 cm of rooting depth was used for both soils based on asseng et al 2000 twelve layers were considered with 10 cm depth in each of the top 10 layers and 20 cm and 30 cm depth in the last two layers respectively the typical values of drained upper limit and crop lower limit in each layer for the two soils table 1 were obtained from apsoil oliver and robertson 2009 the corresponding pawc in each layer was also shown in table 1 the pawc in 150 cm soil profile was 88 and 124 cm for sand and clay respectively to quantify the effects of uncertain inputs in drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth on simulated wheat yw a series of changes were made to these parameters relative to the standard values for each soil table 1 sensible estimates of drained upper limit must be smaller than saturated volumetric water content and larger than crop lower limit therefore to change drained upper limit for each layer it was increased by 20 dul20 40 dul40 and 60 dul60 of the difference between saturated volumetric water content and drained upper limit for each layer and decreased by 20 dul 20 40 dul 40 and 60 dul 60 of the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit similarly sensible estimates of crop lower limit must be smaller than drained upper limit therefore to increase crop lower limit it was increased by 20 cll20 40 cll40 and 60 cll60 of the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit to decrease crop lower limit it was decreased by 20 cll 20 40 cll 40 and 60 cll 60 of its own original values considering that crop lower limit was usually assumed to be equal to lower limit and air dry was also set to equal to lower limit in deep layer lower limit and air dry were also decreased by 20 40 and 60 of their own original values oliver and robertson 2009 to allow apsim to run rooting depth was altered by varying the maximum rooting depth from the default 150 cm rd150 to 60 cm rd60 90 cm rd90 120 cm rd120 180 cm rd180 210 cm rd210 and 240 cm rd240 table 2 respectively but holding the crop lower limit and drained upper limit constant the values of drained upper limit and crop lower limit for the soil deeper than 150 cm were assumed to be equal to those in the layer of 120 150 cm the simulated wheat yields with the changed parameters were compared with those simulated with the standard values to calculate the changes in wheat yw 2 3 study sites and climate data the sensitivity analysis was conducted using historical long term daily climate data 1956 2015 at two contrasting rainfall sites kojonup in the high rainfall zone and merredin in the low rainfall zone on average 1956 2015 at kojonup annual rainfall was about 490 mm with 370 mm falling during wheat growing season may october while at merredin annual rainfall was about 325 mm with 215 mm of growing season rainfall for all simulations the soil water profile was reset on 1 january each year to crop lower limit assuming maximum water use in the previous crop asseng et al 2000 robertson et al 2002 surface organic matter was also reset on 1 january each year to 1000 kg ha of wheat to represent the stubble from the previous year s crop with a c n ratio of 70 the wheat cultivar yitpi was used throughout the simulations sowing date was controlled by a sowing rule it was sown when at least 20 mm and 15 mm of rainfall was accumulated over a five day period between may 1 and june 30 at kojonup and merredin respectively simulations were conducted with unlimited nitrogen to allow better exploration of the effect of hydrological parameters 3 results 3 1 the effects of the change in hydrological parameters on pawc the changes of pawc caused by the changes of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth were shown in table 2 for sand if drained upper limit was overestimated by 20 40 and 60 pawc would be overestimated by 64 128 and 192 mm in 150 cm soil profile respectively while the corresponding proportional underestimation of drained upper limit resulted into pawc being underestimated by 18 53 mm for clay pawc was overestimated by 45 134 mm if drained upper limit was overestimated by 20 60 and these underestimations of drained upper limit caused 25 75 mm of underestimation of pawc comparing the two soils when drained upper limit was overestimated by the same percentage of the difference of their own saturated volumetric water content and drained upper limit larger bias of estimated pawc incurred in sand in contrast drained upper limit underestimation did not cause obvious difference in pawc deviation if crop lower limit was overestimated by 20 60 of the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit pawc would be underestimated by 18 53 mm for sand and 25 75 mm for clay the underestimation of crop lower limit by 20 60 would result into an overestimation of pawc by 43 130 mm and 63 188 mm for sand and clay respectively compared with the baseline value 150 cm of rooting depth pawc would be underestimated by16 mm under 120 cm of rooting depth to 48 mm under 60 cm of rooting depth similar range of pawc was overestimated when rooting depth was increased to 180 and 240 cm 3 2 the effects of the uncertainties in pawc caused by hydrological parameters on simulated rainfed wheat yield potential the average change in simulated wheat yw with the change in pawc as affected by drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth for two soils at two sites were shown in fig 1 for both sand and clay at both high and low rainfall sites the average changes in wheat yw showed similar exponential response patterns to the changes in pawc no matter which factor drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth affected it fig 1a d that is for a specific soil at a site if an overestimation underestimation of drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth resulted in a same amount of overestimation underestimation of pawc it would result in a very similar deviation of wheat yw estimates in general the overestimation of pawc caused the overestimation of wheat yw and vice versa the amplitude of the change of wheat yw was different depending on the soil type and rainfall for example at high rainfall site an overestimation of 50 mm of pawc would result in an overestimation of 460 kg ha 1 of wheat yw 9 9 for sand fig 1a while this overestimation in pawc would cause 210 kg ha 1 4 2 of an overestimation of wheat yw for clay fig 1b at low rainfall site 390 kg ha 1 16 6 of wheat yw would be overestimated by 50 mm of overestimation of pawc for sand fig 1c and 240 kg ha 1 9 0 of wheat yw was overestimated by this pawc for clay fig 1d the larger absolute yield change occurred at high rainfall site when pawc was overestimated but the relative changes indicate that simulated crop yield is more sensitive to the change in pawc in low rainfall region the asymptotes values for the functions of the overestimation of wheat yw with overestimated pawc were 720 and 357 kg ha 1 for sand and clay at high rainfall site respectively fig 1a b when pawc was overestimated more than about 125 mm fig 1a b estimates of wheat yw would barely be affected by pawc for both soils bias within about 10 of asymptote at low rainfall site wheat yw would barely change with pawc bias within about 10 of asymptotes 640 kg ha 1 for sand and 530 kg ha 1 for clay when pawc was overestimated more than about 130 mm fig 1c for sand and 180 mm fig 1d for clay compared to the effects of overestimation of pawc the underestimation of pawc had more severe effects on estimates of yw for two soils at both sites fig 1a d if pawc was underestimated about 50 mm at high rainfall site wheat yw would be underestimated about 1000 kg ha 1 21 6 for sand fig 1a and 530 kg ha 1 10 5 for clay fig 1b at low rainfall site this amount of underestimation of pawc resulted into underestimation of about 820 kg ha 1 35 0 of wheat yw for sand fig 1c and 460 kg ha 1 17 0 for clay fig 1d these biases of estimated wheat yw were much larger than those caused by the corresponding overestimation of pawc see above again the large relative changes in wheat yw in low rainfall site indicate that simulated yw is more sensitive to the change in pawc in low rainfall area 3 3 effects of the change in soil parameters on rainfed wheat yield potential under variable rainfall the above results showed that the changes of wheat yw responded similar to drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth if their biased estimates caused the same amount of bias of pawc therefore the overestimation of drained upper limit d20 d40 and d60 and its underestimation d 20 d 40 and d 60 were selected to analyse the response of biased estimates of wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc as affected by soil hydrological to variable rainfall a preliminary analysis data not shown showed that the biases in the simulated wheat yw had a better relationship with growing season rainfall than growing season rainfall plus pre sowing soil water at high rainfall site while at low rainfall site the biased estimates had a better correlation with growing season rainfall plus pre sowing soil water as such the response of biased estimates of wheat yw caused by pawc to rainfall during wheat growing season was analysed for the high rainfall site and such response to rainfall during wheat growing season plus pre sowing soil water was analysed for the low rainfall site the response of overestimated underestimated wheat yw caused by overestimated underestimated pawc as affected by drained upper limit for sand at high rainfall site was shown in fig 2 when pawc was overestimated as a result of overestimation of drained upper limit the amplitude of the overestimation of wheat yw was enlarged with the growing season rainfall but when growing season rainfall was larger than 310 mm fig 2a overestimation of pawc barely affected the estimation of wheat yw the distribution of biased estimates of yw caused by d20 table 1 was not obviously different from that as affected by d40 or d60 fig 2a when pawc was underestimated the magnitude of the underestimation of wheat yw increased with growing season rainfall and this increase rate with rainfall was faster for larger pawc underestimation fig 2b when growing season rainfall was larger than 350 mm fig 2b the response of biased estimates of wheat yw was less a very similar response of biased estimate of yw due to uncertainties in pwac as affected by drained upper limit to rainfall was obtained for clay at high rainfall site fig 3 at low rainfalls for the sand soil when growing season rainfall plus pre sowing soil water was less than 250 mm fig 4 a simulated wheat yw was not affected by the overestimation of pawc caused by overestimation of drained upper limit fig 4a if pre sowing soil water plus pre sowing soil water was more than 250 mm the magnitude of biased estimates of yw increased with the plant available water when pawc was underestimated the magnitude of the underestimation of wheat yw increased with the increase of plant available water fig 4b a similar response of biased estimates of wheat yw affected by pawc to plant available water was obtained for clay data not shown 4 discussion and conclusion changes in soil hydrological characteristics e g drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth influence a soil s ability to store water or the plant s ability to extract water from the soil for example pawc for a sand soil could be increased from 88 mm to 152 mm if the value of its drained upper limit was overestimated only by 20 as defined in this study but it would be decreased to 70 mm if drained upper limit water content was underestimated by 20 the variations of crop lower limit and rooting depth also generated large variations in plant available water capacity the uncertainties in the estimation of these soil hydrological properties will strongly affect the accuracy of estimating a soil s capacity to retain water for plant use as such uncertainty in soil hydrological parameters that are used in a crop model to simulate crop yield potential would inevitably cause a major fraction of the bias in yield simulations this is particularly the case for dryland agriculture in arid or semi arid areas where uncertainty in estimation of soil water holding capacity can have large effects on the simulations of yield potential as crop depends heavily on water that has accumulated in the soil from rainfall to shed light on such effects this paper presents how the uncertainties in estimation of drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth which affect the accuracy of the soil s pawc accordingly on crop wheat yw when they are used as inputs in an agricultural system model understanding the effect of uncertainties in soil hydrological parameters on the simulations of wheat water limited potential yield is useful not only for researchers but also farmers as well crop models such as apsim are increasingly directly or indirectly used by farmers to assist them in the planning management of their farms for example from 2009 to 2015 between 100 and 307 farmers in western australia used apsim model to simulate their crops and manage inputs as part of the yield prophet framework hochman et al 2009 https www yieldprophet com au yp home aspx we evaluated our results with regard to changing pawc by varying drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth reasonably and the change in the amplitude of wheat yw due to the uncertainties in pawc the simulations demonstrate that the estimates of soil hydrological parameters have an important and quantifiable effect on simulation of crop yields the changes in simulated wheat yw showed an exponential response to the changes in pawc for both soils at two sites with contrasting rainfall this is in an agreement with early work in lawes et al 2009 mullins 1981 yang et al 2016 who also highlighted the importance of pawc in determining crop yield the largest bias of simulated wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc occurred for a sand soil at high rainfall site in this case an overestimation and underestimation of pawc of 50 mm could resulted into 458 kg ha 1 and 997 kg ha 1 respectively this confirms our first hypothesis that the simulated wheat yw would be more sensitive to the uncertainties in soil hydrological parameters for the low pawc soil in the high rainfall region the three hydrological parameters i e drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth had very similar effects on the change in simulated wheat yw for each selected soil at a specified site if the biased estimates of them caused the same amount of variation of pawc consequently our second hypothesis that the parameter of rooting depth would play a more important role in estimating crop yw was rejected the results also indicate that even if there are biases in estimation of these hydrological parameters crop yield potential can still be simulated accurately if these biases could be compensated to get the pawc estimated correctly therefore more attention should be given to more accurately estimate a soil s water holding capacity rather than a specified soil parameter however since these are some of the key soil hydrological parameters required by crop models like apsim we argue that it is important to estimate the soil hydrological parameters as accurately as possible to reduce the uncertainties in simulated yields for both soils the absolute yield was affected more when pawc was underestimated by the uncertainties in hydrological parameters in the high rainfall region compared to the low rainfall region at the high rainfall site kojonup long term average pre growing season rainfall november april is 370 mm and growing season rainfall is 120 mm while the average pre growing season rainfall and growing season rainfall are 210 mm and 110 mm respectively at the low rainfall site merredin the growing season rainfall at kojonup is almost double that at merredin water availability is the driving factor of wheat growth in the region like western australia when a soil is used to simulate dryland crop production at two such sites if its pawc was underestimated the resultant decrease in soil water storage capacity would result in more rainfall conversion into drainage or runoff and less effective rainfall stored in the soil at the high rainfall site in the simulations as a result the amplitude of the underestimated yw would be larger at sites in a high rainfall area the magnitude of biased wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc was generally smaller for the soil of clay at both sites compared with sand this is probably because a clay has a higher pawc has the ability to store more water and still holds sufficient water to buffer a period of moisture stress from the perspective of soil hydrological properties the clay soil used in this study has higher values of drained upper limit and crop lower limit across the root zone profile than sand table 1 it also has a larger pawc which enables the crop to perform well for a longer time after significant rainfall compared with the smaller pawc of the sand so crops grown in the large pawc soil benefits more than those in the low pawc soil in water limited even though the same percentage of underestimate of drained upper limit overestimate of crop lower limit generally caused larger decrease in pawc for clay than for sand the pawc of clay is still higher than that of sand the overestimate of drained upper limit underestimate of crop lower limit for clay also generally results into larger overestimated pawc which leads into even larger pawc for clay therefore if a soil has large pawc the importance of estimating it precisely is relatively reduced in contrast the underestimation of pawc on a sand would result in a greater impact on yw than the corresponding overestimation of pawc this occurred because a reduction in the soil s water holding capacity resulted into crops experiencing moisture stress sooner and with greater severity similar findings have been reported by araya et al 2016 it is therefore better to slightly overestimate rather than underestimate pawc when soil hydraulic parameters must be estimated if pawc was overestimated or underestimated by 20 mm it would only have marginal impact on estimated wheat yw with 200 overestimated or 130 kg ha 1 underestimated deviation in contrast when pawc was underestimated by 50 mm it resulted in an underestimation of yield by approximately 1000 kg ha 1 but when pawc was overestimated by 50 mm it resulted in an overestimation of yield by 500 kg ha 1 this shows that if pawc was estimated with an error of more than 20 mm an underestimation would cause more severe deviation of wheat yw than an overestimation imprecise estimates of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth and their impact on pawc inevitably result in poor simulations of crop yield a direct field measurement of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth should always be the preferred method of obtaining soil hydrologic parameters for modelling purposes unfortunately such measurement are frequently unavailable these research has shown that small errors 20 mm in estimated pawc are acceptable and will have minimum impact on simulated yield rainfall has a clear effect on the biased estimate of wheat yw as affected by the uncertainties in soil hydrological parameters when pawc was overestimated yw was also overestimated once growing season rainfalls exceeded 300 mm the impact of pawc on yw declined because 300 mm of rainfall roughly meets the water demand of a wheat crop in these regions oliver et al 2009 in general the bias of underestimated wheat yw due to underestimation of pawc increased with rainfall lawes et al 2009 in conclusion if an error in estimation of drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth generated an equivalent change in pawc for a specified soil then the error in yw would be similar across all hydraulic properties the underestimation of pawc would incur more severe deviation of yw estimates than the same amount of its overestimation it is important to measure all three soil hydrological parameters as accurately as possible to reduce the uncertainties in simulate yield but overestimation for pawc rather than underestimation should be considered when soil parameters have to be estimated acknowledgement this work was supported by grains research

11278,a key determinant of water limited yield potential in dryland agriculture is the soil s plant available water capacity pawc the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit over the rooting depth to simulate water limited yield potential yw a crop model must be parameterised for the local edaphic conditions which require a quantitative description of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth often these soil properties have to be estimated from existing soil surveys which creates uncertainty for drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth the impact of uncertainty in these soil properties on the estimation of yw has not previously been reported using the agricultural production systems simulator apsim a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the effect of uncertainties in drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth on wheat yw for two contrasting rainfall sites high and low with two typical soil types shallow sandy duplex and clay in western australia simulation results demonstrated that the resultant change in pawc was the dominant driver of a change in the estimate of yw irrespective of whether such a change was caused by drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth estimated errors that underestimated or overestimated pawc by up to 20 mm only had a marginal impact on yw less than 200 kg ha 1 in all environments soil type location but when this error was more than 20 mm an underestimation would cause more severe deviation of yw of wheat than an overestimation on average 40 mm underestimation of pawc resulted into 530 kg ha 1 of yw while this amount of overestimation caused overestimation of yw about 290 kg ha 1 the bias of underestimated wheat yw due to underestimation of pawc was generally increased with rainfall up to 350 mm we conclude that it is better to estimate soil hydrological parameters towards overestimating pawc than to underestimate pawc however where possible all three soil hydrological parameters should be estimated as accurately as possible keywords drained upper limit crop lower limit rooting depth pawc apsim yield potential 1 introduction process based crop simulation models are useful tools for agricultural analysis they have been widely used for predicting crop yield batchelor et al 2002 gabrielle et al 2002 wart et al 2013 and yield gaps lobell et al 2010 wart et al 2013 as well as understanding the adaptation of crops to their environments chapman 2008 kirkegaard and hunt 2010 shorter et al 1991 villalobos et al 1996 and improving management practices in agricultural systems matthews et al 2002 yu et al 2006 crop models require inputs of soil physical and hydrological properties besides climate and crop data however when crop models like the agricultural production systems simulator apsim that requires inputs of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth are used to simulate crops at regional or larger spatial scales it is often difficult to precisely characterise these attributes of the soil due to the inherent variability in natural processes costly monitoring or imperfections in data measurements wang et al 2005 wu et al 2010 national soil maps often provide information on a local dominant soil but at a field scale the soil may be misrepresented therefore unlike climate data soil databases that precisely define the soil hydrological properties at an appropriate scale rarely exist as a result these parameters have to be inferred from nearby soil surveys and local knowledge however estimating soil hydrological parameters may be imprecise which in turn leads to biased estimates of plant available water capacity pawc the total amount of water a soil can store it is defined as the volumetric difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit over a crop s rooting depth dalgliesh and foale 1998 biased estimates of pawc can consequently lead to the miscalculation of how much water can enter the storage the pawc is a key factor impacting the availability of water to plants and therefore a biased estimate of pawc can lead to errors in yield of crop in rainfed cropping the imprecise estimates of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth and their impact on pawc inevitably result in incorrect estimates of crop yield or yield gaps aggarwal 1995 makowski et al 2006 tremblay and wallach 2004 this is particularly the case in dryland agriculture in arid and semi arid regions where cropping depends heavily on pawc and rainfall the effect that poor estimation of soil hydrological characterisation can have on crop yield predictions in dryland cropping system has occasionally been considered for instance lawless et al 2008 used the sirius wheat simulation model to analyse the effect of uncertainty in soil moisture characteristics on the precision of simulated crop growth and development and concluded that quantitative soil moisture attributes should be made in order to accurately predict crop yield pogson et al 2012 assessed the sensitivity of crop model predictions to entire meteorological and soil input datasets and their results highlighted that the estimation of soil water parameters wilt point and field capacity was likely to become increasingly critical in areas affected by climate change however it is still unclear how much error can be tolerated for soil hydrological parameters to generate acceptable yield potential estimates in water limited environments yw it is also unclear which hydrological parameter has more relative importance to affect yw in this study we used apsim to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the estimation of wheat yw to the change in soil hydrological parameters drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth at two contrasting rainfall sites for two typical soil types in western australia the objective of this study was to produce a detailed understanding of the effects of uncertainties of pawc resulted from biased estimation of soil hydrological attributes on crop yw it was hypothesised that the biased estimation of soil hydrological parameters would have more effects on wheat yw for the low pawc soil in high rainfall zone moreover rooting depth and the time course of its development are crucial processes in the model which controls the water uptake pattern water deficit can slow down the rooting depth development and vice versa resulting in an overreaction of the crop to water shortage asseng et al 1998b as such it was also hypothesised that rooting depth would have more relative importance among the three parameters as it affects both crop growth and water budget thus the aims of this study were to 1 quantify the bias in simulated wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc caused by inputs of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth 2 to determine the relative importance of the three parameters and 3 to identify the relationship between the biased crop yw with variable rainfall 2 materials and method 2 1 apsim model description apsim agricultural production systems simulator is a cropping systems simulation model that allows models of crops pastures soil water nutrients and erosion to be flexibly configured to simulate diverse agricultural systems holzworth et al 2014 it runs at a daily time step using daily meteorological data including maximum and minimum temperatures rainfall and total solar radiation the model has been widely used to assess on farm management practices climate risk change adaptation strategies farming systems

2006 apsim is also being used by commercial growers as a decision support tool for in season crop management via the yield prophet online management tool hochman et al 2009 in the apsim model the soilwat module simulates the various vertical water movements in a layered soil system using a multi layer cascading approach the water characteristics of the soil are specified in terms of air dry the lower limit drained upper limit and saturated volumetric water content in each soil layer while to conduct on farm crop simulations parameter of crop lower limit at each layer in the soil profile is also needed drained upper limit and crop lower limit represent the maximum and minimum soil water content available to a specific crop over the potential rooting depth together they are used to define pawc of the soil following the procedure of dalgliesh and foale 1998 thus pawc is the measure of the plant available water capacity directly related to crop yield potential especially under water limited conditions oliver et al 2006 2 2 modelling the effects of the uncertainties in soil parameters on rainfed wheat yield potential two typical soils shallow sandy duplex called thereafter sand and clay were selected to evaluate the effects of the uncertainties in drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth which cause the uncertainties in pawc accordingly on wheat yw in western australia where wheat grows under rain fed conditions producing about 50 of australia s total wheat production sand and clay are ranked second and third in terms of area distribution gravel accounts for the largest area accounting for 14 9 and 10 0 respectively across the western australia wheat belt in the baseline simulation table 1 150 cm of rooting depth was used for both soils based on asseng et al 2000 twelve layers were considered with 10 cm depth in each of the top 10 layers and 20 cm and 30 cm depth in the last two layers respectively the typical values of drained upper limit and crop lower limit in each layer for the two soils table 1 were obtained from apsoil oliver and robertson 2009 the corresponding pawc in each layer was also shown in table 1 the pawc in 150 cm soil profile was 88 and 124 cm for sand and clay respectively to quantify the effects of uncertain inputs in drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth on simulated wheat yw a series of changes were made to these parameters relative to the standard values for each soil table 1 sensible estimates of drained upper limit must be smaller than saturated volumetric water content and larger than crop lower limit therefore to change drained upper limit for each layer it was increased by 20 dul20 40 dul40 and 60 dul60 of the difference between saturated volumetric water content and drained upper limit for each layer and decreased by 20 dul 20 40 dul 40 and 60 dul 60 of the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit similarly sensible estimates of crop lower limit must be smaller than drained upper limit therefore to increase crop lower limit it was increased by 20 cll20 40 cll40 and 60 cll60 of the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit to decrease crop lower limit it was decreased by 20 cll 20 40 cll 40 and 60 cll 60 of its own original values considering that crop lower limit was usually assumed to be equal to lower limit and air dry was also set to equal to lower limit in deep layer lower limit and air dry were also decreased by 20 40 and 60 of their own original values oliver and robertson 2009 to allow apsim to run rooting

the crop lower limit and drained upper limit constant the values of drained upper limit and crop lower limit for the soil deeper than 150 cm were assumed to be equal to those in the layer of 120 150 cm the simulated wheat yields with the changed parameters were compared with those simulated with the standard values to calculate the changes in wheat yw 2 3 study sites and climate data the sensitivity analysis was conducted using historical long term daily climate data 1956 2015 at two contrasting rainfall sites kojonup in the high rainfall zone and merredin in the low rainfall zone on average 1956 2015 at kojonup annual rainfall was about 490 mm with 370 mm falling during wheat growing season may october while at merredin annual rainfall was about 325 mm with 215 mm of growing season rainfall for all simulations the soil water profile was reset on 1 january each year to crop lower limit assuming maximum water use in the previous crop asseng et al 2000 robertson et al 2002

hydrological parameters on pawc the changes of pawc caused by the changes of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth were shown in table 2 for sand if drained upper limit was overestimated by 20 40 and 60 pawc would be overestimated by 64 128 and 192 mm in 150 cm soil profile respectively while the corresponding proportional underestimation of drained upper limit resulted into pawc being underestimated by 18 53 mm for clay pawc was overestimated by 45 134 mm if drained upper limit was overestimated by 20 60 and these underestimations of drained upper limit caused 25 75

cm of rooting depth to 48 mm under 60 cm of rooting depth similar range of pawc was overestimated when rooting depth was increased to 180 and 240 cm 3 2 the effects of the uncertainties in pawc caused by hydrological parameters on simulated rainfed wheat yield potential the average change in simulated wheat yw with the change in pawc as affected by drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth for two soils at two sites were shown in fig 1 for both sand and clay at both high and low rainfall sites the average changes in wheat yw showed similar exponential response patterns to the changes in pawc no matter which factor drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth affected it fig 1a d that is for a specific soil at a site if an overestimation underestimation of drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth resulted in a same amount of overestimation underestimation of pawc it would result in a very similar deviation of wheat yw estimates in general the overestimation of pawc caused the overestimation of wheat yw and vice versa the amplitude of the change of wheat yw was different depending on the soil type and rainfall for example at high rainfall site an overestimation of 50 mm of pawc would result in an overestimation of 460 kg ha 1 of wheat yw 9 9 for sand fig 1a while this overestimation in pawc would cause 210 kg ha 1 4 2 of an overestimation of wheat yw for clay fig 1b at low rainfall site 390 kg ha 1 16 6 of wheat yw would be overestimated by 50 mm of overestimation of pawc for sand fig 1c and 240 kg ha 1 9 0 of wheat yw was overestimated by this pawc for clay fig 1d the larger absolute yield change occurred at high rainfall site when pawc was overestimated but the relative changes indicate that simulated crop yield is more sensitive to the change in pawc in low rainfall region the asymptotes values for the functions of the overestimation of wheat yw with overestimated pawc were 720 and 357 kg ha 1 for sand and clay at high rainfall site respectively fig 1a b when pawc was overestimated more than about 125 mm fig 1a b estimates of wheat yw would barely be affected by pawc for both soils bias within about 10 of asymptote at low rainfall site wheat yw would barely change with pawc bias within about 10 of asymptotes 640 kg ha 1 for sand and 530 kg ha 1 for clay when pawc was overestimated more than about 130 mm fig 1c for sand and 180 mm fig 1d for clay compared to the effects of overestimation of pawc the underestimation of pawc had more severe effects on estimates of yw for two soils at both sites fig 1a d if pawc was underestimated about 50 mm at high rainfall site wheat yw would be underestimated about 1000 kg ha 1 21 6 for sand fig 1a and 530 kg ha 1 10 5 for clay fig 1b at low rainfall site this amount of underestimation of pawc resulted into underestimation of about 820 kg ha 1 35 0 of wheat yw for sand fig 1c and 460 kg ha 1 17 0 for clay fig 1d these biases of estimated wheat yw were much larger than those caused by the corresponding overestimation of pawc see above again the large relative changes in wheat yw in low rainfall site indicate that simulated yw is more sensitive to the change in pawc in low rainfall area 3 3 effects of the change in soil parameters on rainfed wheat yield potential under variable rainfall the above results showed that the changes of wheat yw responded similar to drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth if their biased estimates caused the same amount of bias of pawc therefore the overestimation of drained upper limit d20 d40 and d60 and its underestimation d 20 d 40 and d 60 were selected to analyse the response of biased estimates of wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc as affected by soil hydrological to variable rainfall a preliminary analysis data not shown showed that the biases in the simulated wheat yw had a better relationship with growing season rainfall than growing season rainfall plus pre sowing soil water at high rainfall site while at low rainfall site the biased estimates had a better correlation with growing season rainfall plus pre sowing soil water as such the response of biased estimates of wheat yw caused by pawc to rainfall during wheat growing season was analysed for the high rainfall site and such response to rainfall during wheat growing season plus pre sowing soil water was analysed for the low rainfall site the response of overestimated underestimated wheat yw caused by overestimated underestimated pawc as affected by drained upper limit for sand at high rainfall site was shown in fig 2 when pawc was overestimated as a result of overestimation of drained upper limit the amplitude of the overestimation of wheat yw was enlarged with the growing season rainfall but when growing season rainfall was larger than 310 mm fig 2a overestimation of pawc barely affected the estimation of wheat yw the distribution of biased estimates of yw caused by d20 table 1 was not obviously different from that as affected by d40 or d60 fig 2a when pawc was underestimated the magnitude of the underestimation of wheat yw increased with growing season rainfall and this increase rate with rainfall was faster for larger pawc underestimation fig 2b when growing season rainfall was larger than 350 mm fig 2b the response of biased estimates of wheat yw was less a very similar response of biased estimate of yw due to uncertainties in pwac as affected by drained upper limit to rainfall was obtained for clay at high rainfall site fig 3 at low rainfalls for the sand soil when growing season rainfall plus pre sowing soil water was less than 250 mm fig 4 a simulated wheat yw was not affected by the overestimation of pawc caused by overestimation of drained upper limit fig 4a if pre sowing soil water plus pre sowing soil water was more than 250 mm the magnitude of biased estimates of yw increased with the plant available water when pawc was underestimated the magnitude of the underestimation of wheat yw increased with the increase of plant available water fig 4b a similar response of biased estimates of wheat yw affected by pawc to plant available water was obtained for clay data not shown 4 discussion and conclusion changes in soil hydrological characteristics e g drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth influence a soil s ability to store water or the plant s ability to extract water from the soil for example pawc for a sand soil could be increased from 88 mm to 152 mm if the value of its drained upper limit was overestimated only by 20 as defined in this study but it would be decreased to 70 mm if drained upper limit water content was underestimated by 20 the variations of crop lower limit and rooting depth also generated large variations in plant available water capacity the uncertainties in the estimation of these soil hydrological properties will strongly affect the accuracy of estimating a soil s capacity to retain water for plant use as such uncertainty in soil hydrological parameters that are used in a crop model to simulate crop yield potential would inevitably cause a major fraction of the bias in yield simulations this is particularly the case for dryland agriculture in arid or semi arid areas where uncertainty in estimation of soil water holding capacity can have large effects on the simulations of yield potential as crop depends heavily on water that has accumulated in the soil from rainfall to shed light on such effects this paper presents how the uncertainties in estimation of drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth which affect the accuracy of the soil s pawc accordingly on crop wheat yw when they are used as inputs in an agricultural system model understanding the effect of uncertainties in soil hydrological parameters on the simulations of wheat water limited potential yield is useful not only for researchers but also farmers as well crop models such as apsim are increasingly directly or indirectly used by farmers to assist them in the planning management of their farms for example from 2009 to 2015 between 100 and 307 farmers in western australia used apsim model to simulate their crops and manage inputs as part of the yield prophet framework hochman et al 2009 https www yieldprophet com au yp home aspx we evaluated our results with regard to changing pawc by varying drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth reasonably and the change in the amplitude of wheat yw due to the uncertainties in pawc the simulations demonstrate that the estimates of soil hydrological parameters have an important and quantifiable effect on simulation of crop yields the changes in simulated wheat yw showed an exponential response to the changes in pawc for both soils at two sites with contrasting rainfall this is in an agreement with early work in lawes et al 2009 mullins 1981 yang et al 2016 who also highlighted the importance of pawc in determining crop yield the largest bias of simulated wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc occurred for a sand soil at high rainfall site in this case an overestimation and underestimation of pawc of 50 mm could resulted into 458 kg ha 1 and 997 kg ha 1 respectively this confirms our first hypothesis that the simulated wheat yw would be more sensitive to the uncertainties in soil hydrological parameters for the low pawc soil in the high rainfall region the three hydrological parameters i e drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth had very similar effects on the change in simulated wheat yw for each selected soil at a specified site if the biased estimates of them caused the same amount of variation of pawc consequently our second hypothesis that the parameter of rooting depth would play a more important role in estimating crop yw was rejected the results also indicate that even if there are biases in estimation of these hydrological parameters crop yield potential can still be simulated accurately if these biases could be compensated to get the pawc estimated correctly therefore more attention should be given to more accurately estimate a soil s water holding capacity rather than a specified soil parameter however since these are some of the key soil hydrological parameters required by crop models like apsim we argue that it is important to estimate the soil hydrological parameters as accurately as possible to reduce the uncertainties in simulated yields for both soils the absolute yield was affected more when pawc was underestimated by the uncertainties in hydrological parameters in the high rainfall region compared to the low rainfall region at the high rainfall site kojonup long term average pre growing season rainfall november april is 370 mm and growing season rainfall is 120 mm while the average pre growing season rainfall and growing season rainfall are 210 mm and 110 mm respectively at the low rainfall site merredin the growing season rainfall at kojonup is almost double that at merredin water availability is the driving factor of wheat growth in the region like western australia when a soil is used to simulate dryland crop production at two such sites if its pawc was underestimated the resultant decrease in soil water storage capacity would result in more rainfall conversion into drainage or runoff and less effective rainfall stored in the soil at the high rainfall site in the simulations as a result the amplitude of the underestimated yw would be larger at sites in a high rainfall area the magnitude of biased wheat yw due to the uncertainties of pawc was generally smaller for the soil of clay at both sites compared with sand this is probably because a clay has a higher pawc has the ability to store more water and still holds sufficient water to buffer a period of moisture stress from the perspective of soil hydrological properties the clay soil used in this study has higher values of drained upper limit and crop lower limit across the root zone profile than sand table 1 it also has a larger pawc which enables the crop to perform well for a longer time after significant rainfall compared with the smaller pawc of the sand so crops grown in the large pawc soil benefits more than those in the low pawc soil in water limited even though the same percentage of underestimate of drained upper limit overestimate of crop lower limit generally caused larger decrease in pawc for clay than for sand the pawc of clay is still higher than that of sand the overestimate of drained upper limit underestimate of crop lower limit for clay also generally results into larger overestimated pawc which leads into even larger pawc for clay therefore if a soil has large pawc the importance of estimating it precisely is relatively reduced in contrast the underestimation of pawc on a sand would result in a greater impact on yw than the corresponding overestimation of pawc this occurred because a reduction in the soil s water holding capacity resulted into crops experiencing moisture stress sooner and with greater severity similar findings have been reported by araya et al 2016 it is therefore better to slightly overestimate rather than underestimate pawc when soil hydraulic parameters must be estimated if pawc was overestimated or underestimated by 20 mm it would only have marginal impact on estimated wheat yw with 200 overestimated or 130 kg ha 1 underestimated deviation in contrast when pawc was underestimated by 50 mm it resulted in an underestimation of yield by approximately 1000 kg ha 1 but when pawc was overestimated by 50 mm it resulted in an overestimation of yield by 500 kg ha 1 this shows that if pawc was estimated with an error of more than 20 mm an underestimation would cause more severe deviation of wheat yw than an overestimation imprecise estimates of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth and their impact on pawc inevitably result in poor simulations of crop yield a direct field measurement of drained upper limit crop lower limit and rooting depth should always be the preferred method of obtaining soil hydrologic parameters for modelling purposes unfortunately such measurement are frequently unavailable these research has shown that small errors 20 mm in estimated pawc are acceptable and will have minimum impact on simulated yield rainfall has a clear effect on the biased estimate of wheat yw as affected by the uncertainties in soil hydrological parameters when pawc was overestimated yw was also overestimated once growing season rainfalls exceeded 300 mm the impact of pawc on yw declined because 300 mm of rainfall roughly meets the water demand of a wheat crop in these regions oliver et al 2009 in general the bias of underestimated wheat yw due to underestimation of pawc increased with rainfall lawes et al 2009 in conclusion if an error in estimation of drained upper limit crop lower limit or rooting depth generated an equivalent change in pawc for a specified soil then the error in yw would be similar across all hydraulic properties the underestimation of pawc would incur more severe deviation of yw estimates than the same amount of its overestimation it is important to measure all three soil hydrological parameters as accurately as possible to reduce the uncertainties in simulate yield but overestimation for pawc rather than underestimation should be considered when soil parameters have to be estimated acknowledgement this work was supported by grains research

11279,the use of treated waste water tww as an alternative to limit water use in agriculture practices in the context of global warming is of particular importance especially in countries where water resources are limited in this study we assessed the effect of tww irrigation on two eucalyptus species e camaldulensis and e occidentalis in their early stages of growth up to one year after seedling and transplantation in pot experiment and compared to well water ww irrigation changes in plant growth traits characteristics including plant height stem diameter number of leaves and leaf mass per area lma were analysed as well as the modification of root and leaves secondary metabolic profiles and total phenolic contents soil physico chemical parameters were also measured before and after the experiment our results showed that both species do not have the same response to tww irrigation while most growth recorded parameters were most affected in e camaldulensis after one year of growth with tww e occidentalis had its leaf number significantly increased with tww after seven months leaves were lighter and smaller than the ones obtained with ww irrigation after four months but the reduction of weight and area was proportional in such a way that lma was not affected and this effect was transitory such effect was not observed with e camaldulensis concerning root and leaf secondary metabolite profiles changes in both plant part extract compositions were observed according to irrigation type though these were weak compared to plant species identity common metabolic patterns following tww irrigation could be showed in both species like for example the increase of quercetin glucosinnapate in leaf extracts or the decrease of two peduncalagin isomers detected as major compounds in the same extracts though some differences were also observed particularly e occidentalis had more compounds decreased in its roots than e camaldulensis when irrigated with tww while in leaves the tendency was inverted total phenolic content was decreased in both species and for both plant parts but this diminution was more pronounced in e occidentalis roots we also noticed modifications in soil parameters after tww exposure and some were dependant on the species of eucalyptus like for example soil organic matter content which increased with tww in the case of e occidentalis whereas it decreased for e camaldulensis all these results let us hypothesize that e occidentalis possess better adaptation capabilities to tww irrigation than e camaldulensis and that

dominated root defences among other components belonging to primary or secondary metabolism and that these compounds display a significant phylogenetic signal allowing the authors to conclude that more closely related species have more similar root chemistry which may influence their susceptibility to belowground enemies and soil organic matter accrual thus the objectives of this study are i to investigate the impact of tww irrigation on soil properties and growth traits of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis in comparison with well water ww and ii to compare the secondary metabolite profiles of root and leaf extracts of eucalyptus grown on different conditions in order to generally assess the effect of tww irrigation on eucalyptus performance traits 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and treatment conditions plantation of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis were carried out in a greenhouse at the regional station of the national institute of research on rural engineering water and forest inrgref gabes tunisia from may 2 2014 to september 28 2015 the seeds of the two eucalyptus species studied e camaldulensis and e occidentalis were obtained and identified by the seed department of the national institute of research in rural engineering waters and forests pr khouja mohamed larbi inrgref tunisia they were harvested from two arboreta in zrig and hicha gabès tunisia the first planted with e occidentalis which was introduced from australia in 1959 and the second planted with e camaldulensis introduced in 1998 from pakistan voucher specimens are conserved at the seed department of inrgref under the number 15 101 and 16 035 for e occidentalis and e camaldulensis respectively seeds were sown in 100 pots 30 60 cm containing experimental soil 3 4 sand and 1 4 manure for e camaldulensis the sowing of 50 pots was done in may 2014 after germination only one plant was kept in each pot during the first three months of cultivation plants were daily irrigated with ww after this acclimation period the experiment started in august 2014 with plant height 28 28 1 23 cm and stem diameter 3 87 0 13 mm for e occidentalis the sowing of 50 pots was done in september 2014 after 2 months of acclimation the experiment started in november 2014 with plant height 12 55 0 75 cm and stem diameter 1 20 0 06 mm two water types were used ww and tww which was obtained from the wastewater treatment station of chatt essalem gabes the experimental design was a totally randomized block each block consisted of 4 individuals including two control plants irrigated with ww and two treated plants irrigated with tww irrigation was carried out twice a week with 300 ml in summer and 200 ml in winter 2 2 soil characteristics the initial substrates were analyzed physico chemical properties of the experimental soil were determined in the laboratory of crda gabes the initial soil was made up of organic matter 0 87 total limestone 2 19 conductivity 16

conductivity and gypsum table 1 the techniques used are those cited by naanaa and susini 1988 2 3 analysis of water types used for irrigation tww samples were directly collected at the main outlet of the wastewater treatment plant and ph and conductivity was measured in situ by means of a ph meter afnor nf t 90 008 and conductivity meter afnor nf en 27888 then shortly after collection major ions

digestion afnor nf en iso 15587 1 table 2 presents all the physico chemical parameters measured for ww and tww used in the study 2 4 growth parameters the culture of e camaldulensis was monitored for one year and the parameters were measured during three periods february 2015 may 2015 and september 2015 whereas for e occidentalis we could only monitor growth parameters for seven months even though one year of experiment was planned for both species the end of the experiment for e occidentalis was imposed by the state of the plants that were attacked by a disease caused by a fungus preventing any attempt to continue the experiment for this species consequently parameters were measured in february 2015 april 2015 and may 2015 the experiment was carried on with e camaldulensis to observe the effect of tww after one year of treatment as it was initially planned for each plant height stem diameter number of leaves number of branches leaf mass and leaf area were measured in addition leaf mass per area lma was calculated as the ratio between leaf mass and leaf area de la riva et al 2016 2 5 plant metabolites analysis plant samples roots and leaves of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis were collected at the end of pot experiment after 12 months september 2015 and 7 months may 2015 of irrigation respectively five plants were collected for each condition fresh plant parts leaves or roots were stored for 24 h at 80 c before being freeze dried and crushed into a fine powder by using tissue lyser ii retsch plant metabolites were extracted by the immersion of 50 mg of samples in 1 ml of absolute meoh followed by ultra sonication for 15 min at room temperature the extraction process was repeated three times and supernatants were pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure stored at 20 c and then dissolved in absolute meoh to a concentration of 10 mg ml before analysis pham et al 2017 2 6 quantification of total phenolic content quantification of phenolic compounds of each extract was performed using the modified folin ciocalteu method of bekir et al 2013 folin and ciocalteu 1927 singleton and rossi 1965 in brief the diluted solution of each extract 0 5 ml was mixed with folin ciocalteu reagent 0 2 n 2 5 ml left at room temperature for 3 min and then sodium carbonate solution 75 g l 1 in water 2 ml was added the mixtures were vortexed and incubated at 40 c

hrms and ms² spectra and relative rts data were compared with literature reports for compounds identified in eucalyptus genus table s1 2 9 statistical analysis data were tested using analysis of variance anova followed by student s test to determine the significant difference among the treatment means at p 0 05 to evaluate differences in metabolite composition between plants irrigated with ww or tww peaks in chromatograms recorded at λ 280 nm were integrated and aligned in a matrix for each plant part in order to perform principal component analysis pca using r software ade4 package the compounds responsible for the discrimination between treatment conditions were further analyzed using anova followed by tukey s honest significant difference hsd tests when data followed normality and homoscedasticity or with kruskal wallis test for non parametric values all analyses were conducted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil analysis post treatment soil analysis was performed table 1 while the minimum ph 7 80 was observed in soil irrigated with ww for e occidentalis compared to tww 8 09 soil initial ph value 8 24 was not significantly modified with e camaldulensis irrigated with ww ph 8 13 or with tww ph 8 21 an increase in soil organic matter som was noticed with both species and with both irrigation types but the highest content 1 91 was obtained for e occidentalis irrigated with tww and e camaldulensis irrigated with ww also a decrease of the initial soil conductivity 16 41 ms cm after plant cultivation was observed for both species but this diminution was more pronounced with ww irrigation in the case of e occidentalis down to 4 67 ms cm vs 8 54 ms cm with tww irrigation whereas for e camaldulensis the minimum value was obtained with tww irrigation 9 20 ms cm vs 12 93 ms cm with ww irrigation gypsum content followed the same tendency as conductivity table 1 we can then conclude that tww application changed soil properties such as ph soil organic matter som conductivity and gypsum contents which may influence eucalyptus growth compared to ww treated soils an alcalinization was recorded in soils irrigated with tww for both species many studies showed that the irrigation with tww generated soil alcalinization bame et al 2014 castro et al 2011 mojiri 2011 and it can be caused by plant roots in response to toxic elements detected in tww blossfeld et al 2010 javed et al 2013 on the other hand it is also interesting to notice that compared to ww irrigation som increased with tww in e occidentalis rhizosphere whereas it decreased for e camaldulensis 3 2 wastewater analysis the physico chemical characteristics of tww and ww were evaluated and compared with tunisian limits table 2 cod and sm were found higher than authorized limits in tww and measured respectively at 216 mg l 1 and 45 mg l 1 the concentrations of few anions ammonium 11 2 mg l 1 sulfate 1667 9 mg l 1 and metallic trace elements cd 0 3 mg l 1 in tww were above the irrigation standards up to hundred times higher for ammonium or cd treated wastewater from step gabes has high cod and sm levels which could explain its high content of ammonium priso et al 2010 3 3 effect of irrigation with tww on growth of e camaldulensis after six months of irrigation the difference between treatments was not significant for all parameters measured fig 1 a g after nine months of irrigation plant height was significantly higher in control plants 97 42 2 59 cm vs 83 04 3 5 cm fig 1a a significant difference was also shown in lma in treated plants with tww 30 51 0 76 g cm 2 vs 28 7 0 41 g cm 2 fig 1g however after one year of irrigation plant height stem diameter number of ramifications and number of leaves were significantly higher in plants irrigated with ww than with tww fig 1a d concerning e camaldulensis our results thus show that the irrigation with tww negatively affects all the morphological parameters studied after one year of growth except for leaf mass leaf area and lma 3 4 effect of irrigation with tww on the growth of e occidentalis after four months of irrigation leaf mass and leaf area were significantly higher 0 48 0 02 g vs 0 41 0 02 g and 19 86 1 08 cm² vs 16 7 0 53 cm² respectively in plants irrigated with ww fig 2 e f whereas lma was not significantly modified fig 2g after six months of irrigation a significant increase was shown in plant height 63 59 2 08 cm vs 56 14 2 32 cm and stem diameter 7 04 0 3 cm vs 6 11 0 27 cm in treated plants with tww compared to ww treatment fig 2a and b after seven months of irrigation the number of leaves was significantly higher in tww treated plants 90 3 3 54 fig 2c and no significant difference was observed between treatments for the other parameters thus for e occidentalis the irrigation with tww positively affects some parameters after seven month of growth plant height stem diameter and number of leaves but leaf mass and leaf area were negatively affected after four months though this reduction of mass and area was proportional in such a way that lma was not affected more than that this effect was transitory and these parameters were not significantly different among treatments after seven months 3 5 total phenolic contents total phenolic contents of eucalyptus leaf and root extracts are presented in table 3 and vary from 310 61 7 43 to 531 22 29 16 μg gae 100 g dw in leaves and from 33 26 1 26 μg to 199 37 10 71 μg gae 100 g dw in roots considering both species leaf extracts irrigated with ww presented the highest content in total phenolics 531 22 29 16 and

310 61 7 43 and 351 67 9 15 μg gae 100 g dw for e camaldulensis and e occidentalis respectively concerning root extracts total phenolic content was approximatively two e camaldulensis to eight e occidentalis times less important than in leaves and a similar tendency of decreased content of phenolics was observed with tww irrigation though this effect seemed to be more pronounced with e occidentalis where total phenolic content in roots was divided by two with tww irrigation from 67 44 2 88 to 33 26 1 26 μg gae 100 g dw whereas it decreased by approximatively 20 for e camaldulensis from 199 37 10 71 to 151 07 7 16 μg gae 100 g dw 3 6 metabolic profiling of uv absorbing compounds in eucalyptus extracts metabolite profiling was based on uv absorbing compounds and performed for leaves and root extracts of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis irrigated with tww or ww pca allowed to show differences between samples concerning leaf extracts pca performed for both species fig 3 enabled to separate the two species along axis 1 fig 3a the effect of irrigation condition was distinguishable along axis 3 fig 3b the analysis of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis leaf extracts alone fig 3c d respectively allowed to distinguish the effect of irrigation conditions along axis 3 for e camaldulensis fig 3c and along axis 4 for e occidentalis fig 3d for root extracts both species could also be separated along axis 1 fig 3e and the effect of irrigation condition was roughly separated along axis 2 fig 3f when both species were analyzed separately fig 3g h the separation between irrigation conditions was better with e occidentalis fig 3g than with e camaldulensis fig 3h 3 7 secondary metabolites affected by tww irrigation the compounds involved in the different group segregation were further analyzed using monovariate analysis to see if significant changes in concentrations of these compounds could be shown according to irrigation conditions in order to tentatively identify these discriminating peaks their uv hrms and ms ms spectra were compared with literature table 4 a shows the compounds which present a significant diminution in leaf extracts when exposed to tww irrigation among them four were annotated as ellagitanin derivatives and more precisely two peduncalagin isomers detected as major peaks in the extracts were both decreased with tww irrigation in both species another compound was annotated as quercetin glucuronide and was only significantly decreased in e camaldulensis leaf extracts exposed to tww among the compounds that were found in higher concentrations in tww treated leaf extracts only one was significantly increased and was tentatively annotated as quercetin glycosinnapate after comparison with literature table 4b concerning discriminating compound in root extracts three were found as significantly decreased in tww treated root extracts of e occidentalis among which two were tentatively annotated as methylphloroglucinol o galloylhexose and procyanidin trimer table 5 a the latter being also significantly decreased in tww treated e camaldulensis root extracts one compound hypothetically annotated as ellagic acid derivative because of its uv spectrum was found as increased with tww irrigation in root extracts of both species but this effect was only significant when taking both species into account table 5b concerning secondary metabolism and more precisely phenolic compounds that were mainly detected with our uv based metabolic profiling approach changes in both plants part extract compositions were observed according to irrigation type still plant species identity remained the major parameter explaining variances in profiles in each case common metabolic patterns following tww irrigation could be shown in both species like for example the increase of quercetin glycosinnapate in leaf extracts or the decrease of two peduncalagin isomers which were detected as major compounds in the same extracts some differences were also observed particularly e occidentalis had more compounds decreased in its roots than e camaldulensis when irrigated with tww while in leaves the tendency was inverted total phenolic content was decreased with tww treatment in both species and for both plant parts but this diminution was more pronounced in e occidentalis roots where total phenolic content was divided by two with tww irrigation compared to ww as noticed above som increased at the same time in these soils altogether these results let us hypothesize that as the diminution in root total phenolic content is correlated with an increase in som tww irrigation may induce an increase in phenol rhizodeposition either by direct toxic effect or by indirect stimulation of root cell turnover and or active exudation the fact that two compounds were found significantly decreased in e occidentalis root extract and not in e camaldulensis one which was not identified and methylphloroglucinol o galloylhexose which were both detected as minor compounds in the extracts could not explain this potential effect of increased phenolic rhizodeposition but there are other phenolic polymers like complex tannins and lignin that may account for most of the root mass and total phenolic content that are not extracted detected with our experimental protocol it is interesting to notice that a certain graduation in time in the effects of tww irrigation on e occidentalis could be observed after four months of growth leaves were smaller and lighter but lma was not affected after six months plants had a bigger stem and were higher and after seven months they had more leaves but all the other parameters were identical to that obtained with ww irrigation this along with the potent increase in rhizodeposition described above allows us to hypothesize that changes in root metabolism may occur early which probably leads to the diminution in leaf sizes observed after four months that could be the consequence of a reallocation of plant biomass and energy to belowground parts moreover the fact that lma was maintained and that this effect was transitory is in favor of a controlled diminution rather than a toxic effect changes in root metabolism may also modify the interactions with rhizosphere microbial communities allowing the recruitment of beneficial microbes in the case of pollution induced changes as hypothesized by thijs et al 2016 in their plant call for support theory the recruitment of microbes possessing phytostimulating properties in the rhizosphere like for example plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr that are able to produce phyto hormones or modify plant auxin production goswami et al 2016 may lead in a longer term to an enhanced aerial biomass starting with stems and following with leaf numbers as observed in our case concerning e camaldulensis such effects were not observed though a diminution in root phenolic content was also observed and it is quantitatively comparable to that observed with e occidentalis although e camaldulenis roots were older however this diminution of root phenolics with tww irrigation was not accompanied with som increase as in the case of e occidentalis qualitative changes may then be important to be precisely analyzed to better understand this difference of adaptation between species in this regard the characterization of the functional role of methylphloroglucinol o galloylhexose needs to be further addressed as this was the compound being the most significantly decreased in e occidentalis but not in e camaldulensis root extracts and it might then participate in the observed effects 4 conclusion it can be concluded that growth of eucalyptus was influenced by irrigation with tww but antagonistic effect was observed between the two species tested a negative effect of all the studied morphological parameters except for leaf mass leaf area and lma in eucalyptus camaldulensis plants irrigated with tww was observed whereas positive effects on some parameters plant height stem diameter and number of leaves in eucalyptus occidentalis were noted the analysis of root and leaf extracts secondary metabolic profiles as well as total phenolics and soil physico chemical parameters led us to hypothesize that the positive effects of tww irrigation observed only with e occidentalis might result from changes in root metabolism that may occur early after plants exposure to tww which eventually led to phytostimulation possibly via the recruitment of beneficial microbes

11279,the use of treated waste water tww as an alternative to limit water use in agriculture practices in the context of global warming is of particular importance especially in countries where water resources are limited in this study we assessed the effect of tww irrigation on two eucalyptus species e camaldulensis and e occidentalis in their early stages of growth up to one year after seedling and transplantation in pot experiment and compared to well water ww irrigation changes in plant growth traits characteristics including plant height stem diameter number of leaves and leaf mass per area lma were analysed as well as the modification of root and leaves secondary metabolic profiles and total phenolic contents soil physico chemical parameters were also measured before and after the experiment our results showed that both species do not have the same response to tww irrigation while most growth recorded parameters were most affected in e camaldulensis after one year of growth with tww e occidentalis had its leaf number significantly increased with tww after seven months leaves were lighter and smaller than the ones obtained with ww irrigation after four months but the reduction of weight and area was proportional in such a way that lma was not affected and this effect was transitory such effect was not observed with e camaldulensis concerning root and leaf secondary metabolite profiles changes in both plant part extract compositions were observed according to irrigation type though these were weak compared to plant species identity common metabolic patterns following tww irrigation could be showed in both species like for example the increase of quercetin glucosinnapate in leaf extracts or the decrease of two peduncalagin isomers detected as major compounds in the same extracts though some differences were also observed particularly e occidentalis had more compounds decreased in its roots than e camaldulensis when irrigated with tww while in leaves the tendency was inverted total phenolic content was decreased in both species and for both plant parts but this diminution was more pronounced in e occidentalis roots we also noticed modifications in soil parameters after tww exposure and some were dependant on the species of eucalyptus like for example soil organic matter content which increased with tww in the case of e occidentalis whereas it decreased for e camaldulensis all these results let us hypothesize that e occidentalis possess better adaptation capabilities to tww irrigation than e camaldulensis and that

water shortage inside arid and semiarid regions such as africa south asia southern europe and the middle east is one of the greatest challenges in today s world the challenge involves the exploitation of water used for drinking agriculture and the preservation of limited freshwater ecosystems gatica and cytryn 2013 as a result treated waste water tww can replace fresh water and satisfy different agricultural demands such as medicinal plants and industrial crops cultivation previous studies have shown that tww irrigation has got many advantages in agriculture associated with soil structure and fertility pedrero and alarcón 2009 it can improve growth productivity of some species bedbabis et al 2010 improve air quality and increase local timber production farahat and linderholm 2013 also tww irrigation increases soil organic matter jueschke et al 2008 mañas et al 2009 as well as the concentrations of different nutrients involved in plant growth such as nitrogen phosphorus iron manganese potassium calcium magnesium and others gatica and cytryn 2013 as a result the use of tww for irrigation can have significant effects on soil quality increased salinity and decreased soil ph gatica and cytryn 2013 despite the benefits of tww irrigation this operation is associated with biological risk factors many studies have found a high number of total coliforms and fecal coliforms in crops irrigated with tww while others have detected bacterial pathogens such as salmonella streptococcus clostridium shigella and vibrio spp mañas et al 2009 samie et al 2009 several non biological risk factors can result from the direct application of tww such as phytotoxicity due to the high content of salts and the contamination with metals such as cadmium cd nickel ni and chromium cr which may not be safe for medicinal use and thus represents potential risks for human beings or livestock bedbabis et al 2010 farahat and linderholm 2013 world health organization who has prepared in

use of recycled wastewater has been adopted in tunisia since 1960 klay et al 2010 tww quality is confirmed at the secondary level using biological processes bedbabis et al 2010 here we have used two species of eucalyptus as a plant model eucalyptus myrtaceae family is a native genus from australia and comprises about 700 species cheng et al 2009 highly adapted to many environments constraints such as severe saline and drought conditions by maintaining high transpiration rates and characterized by genetic variability and economic value fine et al 2013 since 1957 117 species of the genus eucalyptus have been introduced and placed from the north to the south of tunisia into 30 arboretums ben jemâa et al 2012 eucalyptus is used in folk medicine for a variety of medical conditions a number of studies have analysed the phytochemical composition of eucalyptus extracts and are presented in table s1 boulekbache makhlouf et al 2010 eucalyptus is a good source of bioactive compounds and secondary metabolites such as triterpenic acids and phenolic compounds with important added value santos et al 2013 eucalyptus camaldulensis and e occidentalis are very common in the arid south tunisia especially in the region of gabes introduced by inrgref they have a growth adaptation in the arid region they show rapid growth tolerance to salinity tolerance to drought and intense flowering saadaoui et al 2018 for example the relative tolerance of e camaldulensis to salinity was studied because this species has a large range of economic use as fodder fuelwood and furniture rawat and banerjee 1998 e camaldulensis is also known for containing bioactive products that demonstrated antibacterial cimanga et al 2002 antifungal su et al 2006 analgesic anti inflammatory silva et al 2003 antioxidative and antiradical activities siramon et al 2013 eucalyptus occidentalis is an australian tree species that has been largely employed for forestation in arid areas of the mediterranean basin as they are well resistant to salinity drought and provide high quality wood and fodder jeddi et al 2009 on the other hand few studies have been published concerning its pharmacological properties this species is known for containing kaempferol derivatives that showed apoptosis induction via caspase activation benyahia et al 2004 being devoid of motility and immune system plants have elaborated a huge variety of secondary metabolites that serve as alternative defence strategies in the protection from pests and diseases and also serve as tools to overcome abiotic stress constraints adapt to the changing environment and survive ibrahim et al 2012 edreva et al 2008 more specifically phenolic compounds are well known free radical scavengers that protect cells from oxidative and uv stresses but they are also involved in many biotic interactions from symbiosis establishment and attraction of pollinating organisms to allelopathic interactions with other plants and organisms bennett and wallsgrove 1994 cheynier et al 2013 they are also involved in plant protection to metal contamination since plants respond to this stress via several mechanisms including the modulation of secondary metabolism in plant tissues and notably phenolic compounds singh et al 2016 michalet et al 2017 pham et al 2017 furthermore senior et al 2016 have shown that in eucalyptus phenolics dominated root defences among other components belonging to primary or secondary metabolism and that these compounds display a significant phylogenetic signal allowing the authors to conclude that more closely related species have more similar root chemistry which may influence their susceptibility to belowground enemies and soil organic matter accrual thus the objectives of this study are i to investigate the impact of tww irrigation on soil properties and growth traits of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis in comparison with well water ww and ii to compare the secondary metabolite profiles of root and leaf extracts of eucalyptus grown on different conditions in order to generally assess the effect of tww irrigation on eucalyptus performance traits 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and treatment conditions plantation of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis were carried out in a greenhouse at the regional station of the national institute of research on rural engineering water and forest inrgref gabes tunisia from may 2 2014 to september 28 2015 the seeds of the two eucalyptus species studied e camaldulensis and e occidentalis were obtained and identified by the seed department of the national institute of research in rural engineering waters and forests pr khouja mohamed larbi inrgref tunisia they were harvested from two arboreta in zrig and hicha gabès tunisia the first planted with e occidentalis which was introduced from australia in 1959 and the second planted with e camaldulensis introduced in 1998 from pakistan voucher specimens are conserved at the seed department of inrgref under the number 15 101 and 16 035 for e occidentalis and e camaldulensis respectively seeds were sown in 100 pots 30 60 cm containing experimental soil 3 4 sand and 1 4 manure for e camaldulensis the sowing of 50 pots was done in may 2014 after germination only one plant was kept in each pot during the first three months of cultivation plants were daily irrigated with ww after this acclimation period the experiment started in august 2014 with plant height 28 28 1 23 cm and stem diameter 3 87 0 13 mm for e occidentalis the sowing of 50 pots was done in september 2014 after 2 months of acclimation the experiment started in november 2014 with plant height 12 55 0 75 cm and stem diameter 1 20 0 06 mm two water types were used ww and tww which was obtained from the wastewater treatment station of chatt essalem gabes the experimental design was a totally randomized block each block consisted of 4 individuals including two control plants irrigated with ww and two treated plants irrigated with tww irrigation was carried out twice a week with 300 ml in summer and 200 ml in winter 2 2 soil characteristics the initial substrates were analyzed physico chemical properties of the experimental soil were determined in the laboratory of crda gabes the initial soil was made up of organic matter 0 87 total limestone 2 19 conductivity 16 41 ms cm and gypsum 0 87 with a ph of 8 27 after plant harvesting seven months for e occidentalis and one year for e camaldulensis the control and treated soils were analyzed for ph organic matter conductivity and gypsum table 1 the techniques used are those cited by naanaa and susini 1988 2 3 analysis of water types used for irrigation tww samples were directly collected at the main outlet of the wastewater treatment plant and ph and conductivity was measured in situ by means of a ph meter afnor nf t 90 008 and conductivity meter afnor nf en 27888 then shortly after collection major ions ca mg nh4 cl and so4 and nutritive salts concentrations were measured using ion chromatography metrohm 850 ic chlorides and alkalinity were determined by titration rodier et al 1996 analysis of metallic trace elements were carried out by icp ms horiba scientific physico chemical parameters of ww obtained from national water distribution utility sonede gabes were analysed before the starting of the experiment using the same method described for tww except for metallic trace elements that were analysed using atomic absorption spectrometry avanta gbc spectrometer after aqua regia acid digestion afnor nf en iso 15587 1 table 2 presents all the physico chemical parameters measured for ww and tww used in the study 2 4 growth parameters the culture of e camaldulensis was monitored for one year and the parameters were measured during three periods february 2015 may 2015 and september 2015 whereas for e occidentalis we could only monitor growth parameters for seven months even though one year of experiment was planned for both species the end of the experiment for e occidentalis was imposed by the state of the plants that were attacked by a disease caused by a fungus preventing any attempt to continue the experiment for this species consequently parameters were measured in february 2015 april 2015 and may 2015 the experiment was carried on with e camaldulensis to observe the effect of tww after one year of treatment as it was initially planned for each plant height stem diameter number of leaves number of branches leaf mass and leaf area were measured in addition leaf mass per area lma was calculated as the ratio between leaf mass and leaf area de la riva et al 2016 2 5 plant metabolites analysis plant samples roots and leaves of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis were collected at the end of pot experiment after 12 months september 2015 and 7 months may 2015 of irrigation respectively five plants were collected for each condition fresh plant parts leaves or roots were stored for 24 h at 80 c before being freeze dried and crushed into a fine powder by using tissue lyser ii retsch plant metabolites were extracted by the immersion of 50 mg of samples in 1 ml of absolute meoh followed by ultra sonication for 15 min at room temperature the extraction process was repeated three times and supernatants were pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure stored at 20 c and then dissolved in absolute meoh to a concentration of 10 mg ml before analysis pham et al 2017 2 6 quantification of total phenolic content quantification of phenolic compounds of each extract was performed using the modified folin ciocalteu method of bekir et al 2013 folin and ciocalteu 1927 singleton and rossi 1965 in brief the diluted solution of each extract 0 5 ml was mixed with folin ciocalteu reagent 0 2 n 2 5 ml left at room temperature for 3 min and then sodium carbonate solution 75 g l 1 in water 2 ml was added the mixtures were vortexed and incubated at 40 c for 30 min the absorbance was read at λ 765 nm against blank water total phenolic contents in extracts were calculated as gallic acid equivalents gae from a calibration curve 0 300 mg l results were expressed as mg gae 100 g dry weight mg gae 100 g dw all measurements were performed in triplicate 2 7 uhplc dad esi qtof analysis uhplc dad esi qtof analysis was performed on an agilent infinity 1290

280 320 360 and 430 nm and uv vis spectra were recorded between 190 and 600 nm the chromatograms recorded at λ 280 nm were selected for statistical analysis the esi source was optimized as follows positive and negative ionization mode in auto msms scan spectra from m z 100 to 2000 capillary voltage 3 5 kv nozzle voltage 2 kv fragmentor 110 v and fixed collision induced dissociation cid energy at 20 ev nitrogen was used as the nebulizing gas with a flow rate of 12 l min and a temperature of 310 c at 40 psi 2 8 metabolite annotation the annotation of metabolites in extracts was based on uv hrms and ms² spectra and relative rts data were compared with literature reports for compounds identified in eucalyptus genus table s1 2 9 statistical analysis data were tested using analysis of variance anova followed by student s test to determine the significant difference among the treatment means at p 0 05 to evaluate differences in metabolite composition between plants irrigated with ww or tww peaks in chromatograms recorded at λ 280 nm were integrated and aligned in a matrix for each plant part in order to perform principal component analysis pca using r software ade4 package the compounds responsible for the discrimination between treatment conditions were further analyzed using anova followed by tukey s honest significant difference hsd tests when data followed normality and homoscedasticity or with kruskal wallis test for non parametric values all analyses were conducted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil analysis post treatment soil analysis was performed table 1 while the minimum ph 7 80 was observed in soil irrigated with ww for e occidentalis compared to tww 8 09 soil initial ph value 8 24 was not significantly modified with e camaldulensis irrigated with ww ph 8 13 or with tww ph 8 21 an increase in soil organic matter som was noticed with both species and with both irrigation types but the highest content 1 91 was obtained for e occidentalis irrigated with tww and e camaldulensis irrigated with ww also a decrease of the initial soil conductivity 16 41 ms cm after plant cultivation was observed for both species but this diminution was more pronounced with ww irrigation in the case of e occidentalis down to 4 67 ms cm vs 8 54 ms cm with tww irrigation whereas for e camaldulensis the minimum value was obtained with tww irrigation 9 20 ms cm vs 12 93 ms cm with ww irrigation gypsum content followed the same tendency as conductivity table 1 we can then conclude that tww application changed soil properties such as ph soil organic matter som conductivity and gypsum contents which may influence eucalyptus growth compared to ww treated soils an alcalinization was recorded in soils irrigated with tww for both species many studies showed that the irrigation with tww generated soil alcalinization bame et al 2014 castro et al 2011 mojiri 2011 and it can be caused by plant roots in response to toxic elements detected in tww blossfeld et al 2010 javed et al 2013 on the other hand it is also interesting to notice that compared to ww irrigation som increased with tww in e occidentalis rhizosphere whereas it decreased for e camaldulensis 3 2 wastewater analysis the physico chemical characteristics of tww and ww were evaluated and compared with tunisian limits table 2 cod and sm were found higher than authorized limits in tww and measured respectively at 216 mg l 1 and 45 mg l 1 the concentrations of few anions ammonium 11 2 mg l 1 sulfate 1667 9 mg l 1 and metallic trace elements cd 0 3 mg l 1 in tww were above the irrigation standards up to hundred times higher for ammonium or cd treated wastewater from step gabes has high cod and sm levels which could explain its high content of ammonium priso et al 2010 3 3 effect of irrigation with tww on growth of e camaldulensis after six months of irrigation the difference between treatments was not significant for all parameters measured fig 1 a g after nine months of irrigation plant height was significantly higher in control plants 97 42 2 59 cm vs 83 04 3 5 cm fig 1a a significant difference was also shown in lma in treated plants with tww 30 51 0 76 g cm 2 vs 28 7 0 41 g cm 2 fig 1g however after one year of irrigation plant height stem diameter number of ramifications and number of leaves were significantly higher in plants irrigated with ww than with tww fig 1a d concerning e camaldulensis our results thus show that the irrigation with tww negatively affects all the morphological parameters studied after one year of growth except for leaf mass leaf area and lma 3 4 effect of irrigation with tww on the growth of e occidentalis after four months of irrigation leaf mass and leaf area were significantly higher 0 48 0 02 g vs 0 41 0 02 g and 19 86 1 08 cm² vs 16 7 0 53 cm² respectively in plants irrigated with ww fig 2 e f whereas lma was not significantly modified fig 2g after six months of irrigation a significant increase was shown in plant height 63 59 2 08 cm vs 56 14 2 32 cm and stem diameter 7 04 0 3 cm vs 6 11 0 27 cm in treated plants with tww compared to ww treatment fig 2a and b after seven months of irrigation the number of leaves was significantly higher in tww treated plants 90 3 3 54 fig 2c and no significant difference was observed between treatments for the other parameters thus for e occidentalis the irrigation with tww positively affects some parameters after seven month of growth plant height stem diameter and number of leaves but leaf mass and leaf area were negatively affected after four months though this reduction of mass and area was proportional in such a way that lma was not affected more than that this effect was transitory and these parameters were not significantly different among treatments after seven months 3 5 total phenolic contents total phenolic contents of eucalyptus leaf and root extracts are presented in table 3 and vary from 310 61 7 43 to 531 22 29 16 μg gae 100 g dw in leaves and from 33 26 1 26 μg to 199 37 10 71 μg gae 100 g dw in roots considering both species leaf extracts irrigated with ww presented the highest content in total phenolics 531 22 29 16 and 434 23 9 27 μg gae 100 g dw for e camaldulensis and e occidentalis respectively compared with extracts from plants irrigated with tww where total phenolic content was approximatively decreased by 30 310 61 7 43 and 351 67 9 15 μg gae 100 g dw for e camaldulensis and e occidentalis respectively concerning root extracts total phenolic content was approximatively two e camaldulensis to eight e occidentalis times less important than in leaves and a similar tendency of decreased content of phenolics was observed with tww irrigation though this effect seemed to be more pronounced with e occidentalis where total phenolic content in roots was divided by two with tww irrigation from 67 44 2 88 to 33 26 1 26 μg gae 100 g dw whereas it decreased by approximatively 20 for e camaldulensis from 199 37 10 71 to 151 07 7 16 μg gae 100 g dw 3 6 metabolic profiling of uv absorbing compounds in eucalyptus extracts metabolite profiling was based on uv absorbing compounds and performed for leaves and root extracts of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis irrigated with tww or ww pca allowed to show differences between samples concerning leaf extracts pca performed for both species fig 3 enabled to separate the two species along axis 1 fig 3a the effect of irrigation condition was distinguishable along axis 3 fig 3b the analysis of e camaldulensis and e occidentalis leaf extracts alone fig 3c d respectively allowed to distinguish the effect of irrigation conditions along axis 3 for e camaldulensis fig 3c and along axis 4 for e occidentalis fig 3d for root extracts both species could also be separated along axis 1 fig 3e and the effect of irrigation condition was roughly separated along axis 2 fig 3f when both species were analyzed separately fig 3g h the separation between irrigation conditions was better with e occidentalis fig 3g than with e camaldulensis fig 3h 3 7 secondary metabolites affected by tww irrigation the compounds involved in the different group segregation were further analyzed using monovariate analysis to see if significant changes in concentrations of these compounds could be shown according to irrigation conditions in order to tentatively identify these discriminating peaks their uv hrms and ms ms spectra were compared with literature table 4 a shows the compounds which present a significant diminution in leaf extracts when exposed to tww irrigation among them four were annotated as ellagitanin derivatives and more precisely two peduncalagin isomers detected as major peaks in the extracts were both decreased with tww irrigation in both species another compound was annotated as quercetin glucuronide and was only significantly decreased in e camaldulensis leaf extracts exposed to tww among the compounds that were found in higher concentrations in tww treated leaf extracts only one was significantly increased and was tentatively annotated as quercetin glycosinnapate after comparison with literature table 4b concerning discriminating compound in root extracts three were found as significantly decreased in tww treated root extracts of e occidentalis among which two were tentatively annotated as methylphloroglucinol o galloylhexose and procyanidin trimer table 5 a the latter being also significantly decreased in tww treated e camaldulensis root extracts one compound hypothetically annotated as ellagic acid derivative because of its uv spectrum was found as increased with tww irrigation in root extracts of both species but this effect was only significant when taking both species into account table 5b concerning secondary metabolism and more precisely phenolic compounds that were mainly detected with our uv based metabolic profiling approach changes in both plants part extract compositions were observed according to irrigation type still plant species identity remained the major parameter explaining variances in profiles in each case common metabolic patterns following tww irrigation could be shown in both species like for example the increase of quercetin glycosinnapate in leaf extracts or the decrease of two peduncalagin isomers which were detected as major compounds in the same extracts some differences were also observed particularly e occidentalis had more compounds decreased in its roots than e camaldulensis when irrigated with tww while in leaves the tendency was inverted total phenolic content was decreased with tww treatment in both species and for both plant parts but this diminution was more pronounced in e occidentalis roots where total phenolic content was divided by two with tww irrigation compared to ww as noticed above som increased at the same time in these soils altogether these results let us hypothesize that as the diminution in root total phenolic content is correlated with an increase in som tww irrigation may induce an increase in phenol rhizodeposition either by direct toxic effect or by indirect stimulation of root cell turnover and or active exudation the fact that two compounds were found significantly decreased in e occidentalis root extract and not in e camaldulensis one which was not identified and methylphloroglucinol o galloylhexose which were both detected as minor compounds in the extracts could not explain this potential effect of increased phenolic rhizodeposition but there are other phenolic polymers like complex tannins and lignin that may account for most of the root mass and total phenolic content that are not extracted detected with our experimental protocol it is interesting to notice that a certain graduation in time in the effects of tww irrigation on e occidentalis could be observed after four months of growth leaves were smaller and lighter but lma was not affected after six months plants had a bigger stem and were higher and after seven months they had more leaves but all the other parameters were identical to that obtained with ww irrigation this along with the potent increase in rhizodeposition described above allows us to hypothesize that changes in root metabolism may occur early which probably leads to the diminution in leaf sizes observed after four months that could be the consequence of a reallocation of plant biomass and energy to belowground parts moreover the fact that lma was maintained and that this effect was transitory is in favor of a controlled diminution rather than a toxic effect changes in root metabolism may also modify the interactions with rhizosphere microbial communities allowing the recruitment of beneficial microbes in the case of pollution induced changes as hypothesized by thijs et al 2016 in their plant call for support theory the recruitment of microbes possessing phytostimulating properties in the rhizosphere like for example plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr that are able to produce phyto hormones or modify plant auxin production goswami et al 2016 may lead in a longer term to an enhanced aerial biomass starting with stems and following with leaf numbers as observed in our case concerning e camaldulensis such effects were not observed though a diminution in root phenolic content was also observed and it is quantitatively comparable to that observed with e occidentalis although e camaldulenis roots were older however this diminution of root phenolics with tww irrigation was not accompanied with som increase as in the case of e occidentalis qualitative changes may then be important to be precisely analyzed to better understand this difference of adaptation between species in this regard the characterization of the functional role of methylphloroglucinol o galloylhexose needs to be further addressed as this was the compound being the most significantly decreased in e occidentalis but not in e camaldulensis root extracts and it might then participate in the observed effects 4 conclusion it can be concluded that growth of eucalyptus was influenced by irrigation with tww but antagonistic effect was observed between the two species tested a negative effect of all the studied morphological parameters except for leaf mass leaf area and lma in eucalyptus camaldulensis plants irrigated with tww was observed whereas positive effects on some parameters plant height stem diameter and number of leaves in eucalyptus occidentalis were noted the analysis of root and leaf extracts secondary metabolic profiles as well as total phenolics and soil physico chemical parameters led us to hypothesize that the positive effects of tww irrigation observed only with e occidentalis might result from changes in root metabolism that may occur early after plants exposure to tww which eventually led to phytostimulation possibly via the recruitment of beneficial microbes
