between anas and canas while maintaining robust tce dechlorination due to similar relative abundances of d mccartyi and functional redundancy among each functional guild supporting d mccartyi activity d mccartyi transcriptomic analysis identified the genes encoding for ribosomal rna and the reductive dehalogenases tcea and vcra as the most expressed genes in canas while hup and vhu were the most

community assembly processes and inter species interaction networks that promote successful bioremediation are difficult to predict within the flow dominated physico chemical conditions occurring in the subsurface kinnunen et al 2016 dechlorinating microbial communities have mainly been studied in batch reactors characterized by high initial concentrations of substrates nutrients and electron acceptors and dynamic conditions as dechlorination proceeds the knowledge acquired from such feast and famine laboratory incubations has been extremely useful for understanding the dynamics of dechlorinating communities but is difficult to extrapolate to flowing groundwater plumes which are continuous oligotrophic fluidic ecosystems with site specific hydraulic retention times and relatively constant and low concentrations of contaminants substrates and nutrients stroo et al 2010 continuous flow bioreactors generate conditions that are more environmentally and ecologically relevant to groundwater plumes than batch systems in addition continuous culture systems can be highly reproducible platforms for dynamic perturbation under rigorously defined and controlled conditions relevant to systems level omics and electron flow studies structural and functional dynamics of dechlorinating communities have been investigated in continuous flow biofilm and packed

the effects on the microbial community structure induced by kinetic mode changes from feast and famine conditions anas to the continuous feeding of low nutrient concentrations canas a d mccartyi genus wide microarray was applied to study the transcriptional dynamics of d mccartyi populations present in canas 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum culture a 3 0 l cmfr was inoculated with dechlorinating enrichment culture anas at 5 v v anas was originally enriched from contaminated soil obtained from alameda naval air station ca and has been functionally stable for more than 15 years in a continuously stirred semi batch reactor every two weeks 25 mm or 2 8 g l 1 lactate was supplied as both electron donor and carbon source and 0 1 mm or 13 μg l 1 tce was supplied as the terminal electron acceptor the growth and maintenance procedures of anas have been previously described lee et al 2011 west et al 2013 two distinct d mccartyi strains were identified and isolated from anas strain anas1 which contains the tce reductive dehalogenase gene tcea and strain anas2 which contains the vc reductive dehalogenase gene vcra lee et al 2011 anas has been extensively studied richardson

for the growth of d mccartyi strain 195 he et al 2007 by including 10 mm lactate as the electron donor carbon source and by increasing the concentration of l cysteine and sodium sulfide na2s reducing agent to 0 4 mm of each to ensure anoxic conditions inside the influent tubing and reactor supplemental material table s1 johnson et al 2008 lactate was supplied to the reactor at a rate of 750 μmol d

cmfr maintained steady state for five srts i e stable levels of chlorinated ethenes ethene methane hydrogen lactate volatile fatty acids and specific biomarkers for 200 days duplicate culture samples were collected during three consecutive srts at stages i ii iii to generate biological triplicates for subsequent dna rna studies briefly 100 ml culture samples were collected in duplicate at the sample port and filtered on a 0 2 μm autoclaved gvwp filter durapore membrane millipore billerica ma each filter was immediately placed in a 2 ml attached screw cap micro centrifuge tube corning lowell ma frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until further processing the cmfr design configuration and maintenance strategies as well as routine sample collection and preparation procedures are summarized in the supporting material 2 3 chemical and molecular methods chloroethenes ethene and methane were measured by injecting 100 μl headspace sample to a fid gas chromatograph agilent technologies santa clara ca and 300 μl headspace was injected into a rgd gas chromatograph trace analytical menlo park ca for hydrogen quantification as previously described freeborn et al 2005 lee et al 2006 organic acids including lactate acetate and propionate were analyzed in 2 ml liquid samples by hplc equipped with a photodiode array detector set at 210 nm waters 2996 photodiode array detector milford ma as previously described freeborn et al 2005 quantification of bacteria archaea and specific microbial populations or functional groups present in canas was performed at regular interval times using real time quantitative pcr qpcr targeting tcea and vcra genes and different regions of 16 s rrna genes as previously reported men et al 2012 west et al 2013 with primers summarized in table s3 cell lysis was carried out by mechanical and chemical disruption and nucleic acids were purified using a previously described phenol extraction west et al 2008 dna and rna were separated using allprep dna rna mini kit qiagen valencia ca according to the manufacturer s instruction rna was eluted from the spin column with 100 μl of nuclease free water and was further purified by using turbo dna free kit ambion austin tx to remove additional dna contamination according to the manufacturer s instructions the quality of rna samples was checked by electrophoresis and the concentration of rna samples was quantified using a nanophotometer p 300 implen westlake village ca usa the ratio of a260 a280 for all samples was between 1 80 and 2 0 purified rna was stored in nuclease free water at 80 c prior to further analysis 2 4 microbial community structure analysis using targeted sequencing of 16 s rrna genes sequencing of the v4 hypervariable region amplicons was performed on a hiseq 2000 in a 2 150 bp configuration due to quality issues single reads instead of assembled read pairs were kept for downstream analyses sequences were analyzed through our internal rrna short amplicon analysis pipeline as previously described tremblay et al 2015 yergeau et al 2015 briefly reads were quality filtered and quality trimmed and clustered at 97 similarity resulting otus were assigned to a taxonomic lineage using the rdp classifier with a greengenes v13 5 training set otu tables were generated filtered to exclude eukaryotes and chloroplasts and normalized using the trimmed mean of m values tmm method in the edger package robinson et al 2010 mcmurdie et al 2014 tmm normalized otu tables were used for assessing relative abundances of otus for every taxonomic level and computing beta diversity metrics repeated rarefactions at 5000 reads performing 10 iterations at each sampling depth were generated from the raw un normalized otu table to generate alpha diversity metrics taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity metrics were computed using qiime and downstream analyses were done with in house perl and r scripts otu tables and further details on 16 s amplicon sequencing are included in supplemental material 2 5 nucleotide sequence accession numbers raw sequence reads of the 16 s rrna gene amplicon data for this project are

a new feeding cycle when the culture was in starvation condition 2 anas 20 h the culture was metabolically active after 20 h of feeding all dechlorination metabolites were present 3 canas biological triplicate samples were collected from stage i ii and iii at steady state fig 2 microarray sample preparation and application procedures were previously described west et al 2013 briefly 1 μg of community genomic dna gdna was used for dna analysis and 10 μg of community total rna was used as starting material for rna analysis as previously described west et al 2008 all probe sets that were detected as present by dna microarray analysis were used in the rna analysis dna for any particular orf was deemed present if each replicate probe set for that orf had signal intensity greater than 140 and a p value less than 0 05 in the dna chips rna for any particular orf was considered present if the average signal intensity of the probe sets for that orf was greater than 120 the criteria applied in this study are the same as previously described for the anas transcriptomic study west et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state performance of the community the 40 day srt selected for this study was lower than that of anas table s1 and was based on two objectives to avoid washing out the slow growing microorganisms e g syntrophs and to maintain a sufficient steady state volumetric biomass productivity cells l 1 d 1 for molecular analyses the basic maintenance parameters for canas are compared with previous cmfr pce tce dechlorination to ethene studies in table 1 the donor to acceptor ratio in the influent supplied to canas was about 19 1 based on 12 equivalents of available electrons per mole of lactate and 6 eeq per mole of tce reduced ensuring tce to be the limiting reactant for dechlorination as observed in tce contaminated plumes with the electron donor concentration in excess samples were collected at steady state for both microbial community structure and transcriptomic analyses during the experimental period from day 201 to day 400 fig 2 during this time around 92 of tce in the influent 1 8 mm 0 13 mmol tce d 1 0 075 l d 1 influent was converted to 1 5 0 10 mm ethene 0 09 0 06 mm vinyl chloride vc and 0 03 0 01 mm cis dce fig 2a based on effluent sample measurement the chlorinated solvent recovery rate ranged from 83 to 108 during the experimental period fig 2a the dechlorination rate of the reactor was 120 μmol cl l 1 d 1 methane concentration in the reactor was maintained at a low level of 0 56 0 10 mm with a production rate of 14 2 5 μmol l 1 d 1 anas the inoculum of canas consistently exhibited faster growth of d mccartyi strain anas1 with one copy of tcea than anas2 with one copy of vcra resulting in a anas1 anas2 ratio of 4 1 lee et al 2011 in canas this ratio was stably maintained near 1 1 6 2 2 8 108 cell ml 1 vs 5 8 1 2 108 cell ml 1 fig 2c demonstrating that sustained exposure to low tce concentrations electron acceptor limitation and constant supplies of electron donor nutrients and growth factors can shift the relative abundances of d mccartyi populations as has previously been shown under electron donor limitation mayer blackwell et al 2017 the abundance of d mccartyi strain anas2 which is responsible for vc reduction in the microbial community could be increased in the completely mixed flow reactor and thus could facilitate more complete dechlorination complete fermentation of 10 mm lactate in the influent was observed with the accumulation of propionate and acetate in the reactor effluent at concentrations of 3 1 0 4 mm and 6 7 0 7 mm respectively fig 2b h2 concentrations were maintained at around 0 2 μm data not shown which was greater than the reported minimum h2 threshold 2 nm to support dechlorination yang et al 1998 recovery of electron equivalents was 95 108 throughout the steady state period table 2 a result similar to previous bioreactor studies drzyzga et al 2001 only 6 1 of the electrons were consumed for reductive dechlorination while 75 2 accumulated as propionate and acetate and 2 4 as methane and trace h2 biomass production accounts for a large portion of electron flow in this reactor 15 8 compared to previous studies 7 5 9 2 azizian et al 2010 berggren et al 2013 biomass calculations assumed an elemental microbial cell composition of c5h7o2n an average dry cell weight of 1 1 10 14 g cell 1 with the assumption the average cell size is 0 2 μm in diameter 2 μm in length 20 of the cell is in the solid form 90 of the solid is in

copies ml 1 based on average qpcr of 16 s rrna copy numbers fig s3 duhamel et al 2007 the ratios of d mccartyi 16 s rrna copies to total 16 s rrna copies including bacteria and archaea were 4 2 0 4 5 8 0 3 and 5 3 0 4 for canas at stages i ii and iii and 4 1 0 2 and 4 7 0 1 for anas during active and inactive dechlorination fig s3 b west et al 2013 to our knowledge only one other study has reported cell densities and production rates of d mccartyi in a cmfr with sustainable dechlorination to ethene table 1 delgado et al 2014 here 85 of tce in the influent was converted to ethene with a dechlorination rate of 120 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 which is lower than the highest dechlorination rate reported in a chemostat 130 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 srt 3 d delgado et al 2014 but higher than a previous study with a 55 day srt exhibiting a dechlorination rate of 80 μmol cl l 1 d 1 table 1 berggren et al 2013 the relatively high d mccartyi cell concentration 1 2 0 3 109 cells ml 1 fig s3a observed in canas is comparable to the previously reported maximum d mccartyi cell concentrations obtained in laboratory studies vainberg et al 2009 delgado et al 2014 the d mccartyi production rate in canas 3 1010 cells l 1 d 1 srt 40 days was about 10 of that observed in the 3 day srt chemostat delgado et al 2014 table 1 which is explained by the dilution rate srt 1 of canas that is much lower than the reported maximum specific growth rates of d mccartyi 0 21 0 4 d 1 cupples et al 2003 2004 johnson et al 2008 the cell yield of d mccartyi relative to tce dechlorination in canas reached 2 5 0 7 108 cells per μmol cl released table 1 which is in the range of previously reported cell yields of d mccartyi isolates he et al 2007 cheng et al 2009 men et al 2012 yan et al 2012 2013 mao et al 2015 cooper et al 2015 but lower than the yield reported in the 3 day srt chemostat 5 3 108 cells per μmol cl released delgado et al 2014 likely due to enhanced endogenous cell decay within canas and the ability of d mccartyi to decouple dechlorination from growth for maintenance activities cupples et al 2003 2004 johnson et al 2008 3 2 microbial community structure analysis no significant difference in alpha diversity was observed between canas and anas using the faith s phylogenetic diversity index pd 21 6 3 1 and 23 7 1 7 respectively p 0 3709 unpaired two tailed t test with welch s correction or the non phylogenetic shannon s index 3 8 1 4 for canas and 6 0 0 2 for anas p 0 1163 and chao 1 estimators 551 9 166 1 for canas and 717 9 22 4 for anas p 0 2241 however the composition and the relative abundance of otus identified in anas and canas demonstrated a microbial community structural shift along with the maintenance of tce dechlorination performance archaea and bacteria in canas represented 0 44 0 19 and 99 56 0 19 of the community respectively with a significant difference in relative abundances compared to anas 4 86 0 95 p 0 0014 and 95 1 0 94 p 0 0014 the lower relative abundance of archaea in canas is consistent with the decreased methanogenic activity observed in the cmfr fig 2a 0 04 mol methane mol lactate for canas and 0 23 mol methane mole lactate for anas at the phylum and class levels canas is dominated by members of proteobacteria 77 9 7 of which 91 8 8 belong to the class gammaproteobacteria and firmicutes 16 6 0 99 9 0 02 of which belong to the class clostridia figs s4 and s5 anas is characterized by a more even community with proteobacteria 49 4 7 identified as the prominent phylum but with a dominance of the class deltaproteobacteria 99 8 0 03 figs s4 and s5 the gini coefficients g calculated on the basis of the taxonomy tables phylum l2 and class l3 levels demonstrated a lower evenness in canas than in anas g l2 0 94 0 01 g l3 0 96 0 01 and g l2 0 86 0 02 g l3 0 94 0 01 respectively fig s6 at the taxonomic family level twelve families with a relative abundance higher than 1 were maintained during the feast and famine feeding cycle of anas i e desulfovibrionaceae clostridiaceae members from an unidentified family of clostridiales clostridiales order porphyromonadaceae sphaerochaetaceae thermovirgaceae methanobacteriaceae spirochaetaceae anaerolinaceae dethiosulfovibrionaceae members from an unidentified family of bacteroidales bacteroidales order and thermotogaceae fig 3 in canas only five dominant families persisted at a relative abundance higher than 1 i e pseudomonadaceae desulfovibrionaceae clostridiaceae members from an unidentified family of clostridiales clostridiales order and peptococcaceae fig 3 compared to anas the microbial community in canas shifted to a new composition with the identification of two dominant families that exhibited a relative abundance to bacteria and archaea lower than 0 3 in anas pseudomonadaceae 66 16 of canas and peptococcaceae 2 1 0 5 of canas the high abundance of pseudomonas was confirmed by qpcr of 16 s rrna to exclude gene tag sequencing biases data not shown although pseudomonadaceae is mostly associated with aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria all members of peptococcaceae of the order clostridiales are obligate anaerobes commonly involved in syntrophic associations kleinsteuber et al 2012 stackebrandt 2014 the relative abundance of clostridiaceae increased from 1 5 to 7 0 in canas from stage i to iii which is similar to anas 8 2 4 5 desulfovibrionaceae was relatively stable in canas 1 9 0 28 which is much lower than the relative abundance observed in anas 48 4 7 methanobacteriaceae was the most abundant archaeal family detected in both canas and anas and accounted for 0 43 0 19 and 4 6 0 91 of the total community respectively in canas 98 2 3 of archaeal otus belong to the methanobacteriaceae 96 6 0 of methanobacterium sp of which most members are hydrogenotrophic methanogens oren 2014 in anas 95 0 5 of archaeal otus belong to the methanobacteriaceae and 4 6 0 5 belong to the methanospirillaceae which mainly catalyzes methanogenesis from h2 co2 oren 2014 the relative abundances of dehalococcoidaceae in canas 0 59 0 26 for stages i ii iii were similar to anas 0 69 0 04 for anas 0h anas 20 h and anas 27 h with the maintenance of robust dechlorination rates i e 12 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 for canas and 59 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 for anas in all conditions the relative abundance of dehalococcoides sp detected by gene tag sequencing was lower than the percentage calculated from qpcr analysis 4 6 fig s3 the structural regime shift observed between canas and anas i e change in the microbial community composition and structure bürgmann et al 2011 engel et al 2014 andersen et al 2009 scheffer and carpenter 2003 was confirmed using hierarchical cluster and pcoa analyses hierarchical cluster analysis of the most abundant otus at the class level fig s7 and family level fig 4 identified in anas and canas indicates that samples segregate according to their reactor type pairwise intra and inter cluster distances analysis for anas and canas fig s8 a showed that intra cluster comparisons anas anas and canas canas and inter cluster distances anas canas were significantly greater than intra cluster distances p 0 0001 fig s8 a in addition the weighted unifrac based pcoa demonstrated anas and canas formed two distinct clusters along pco1 78 variation supporting their separation fig s8 b in this study the microbial community structure of a tce dechlorinating enrichment culture maintained functionally active for more than 15 years in a semi batch reactor significantly shifted after inoculation and maintenance in a cmfr despite the observed community structural shift canas demonstrated a high functional robustness with the maintenance of efficient tce dechlorination to ethene although large proportions of facultative anaerobic microorganisms were detected in canas e g pseudomonadaceae with a significant decrease in relative abundance of the strictly anaerobic desulfovibrionaceae family the dechlorination function was stably preserved suggesting that anas1 and anas2 could take advantage of the functional redundancy of microbial functional guilds that support their activities using qpcr measurements normalized to the bacterial and archaeal 16 s rrna copies detected in the whole community d mccartyi accounted for around 4 6 of the community in both anas and canas as reported in other tce dechlorinating d mccartyi containing communities azizian et al 2008 behrens et al 2008 west et al 2013 in the ev 5l and vs 5l cmfrs table 1 mayer blackwell et al 2016 2017 the relative abundance of d mccartyi was higher than 90 of the total bacterial community using targeted sequencing of the hypervariable v1v2 or v2v3 16 s rrna regions in the cmfr pm 2l 2 ii used to inoculate the cmfr pm 5l table 1 dehalococcoides sp accounted for around 35 of the bacterial community using 16 s rrna based qpcr assays berggren et al 2013 in this study we used the primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 tremblay et al 2015 for targeted amplicon sequencing which shows a single primer mismatch at the eleventh position from the 5 end of the reverse primer 806r position 10 from the 3 end 5 ggactachvg g a gtwtctaat 3 with the 16 s rrna sequence of d mccartyii strain 195 in silico analysis of the primer pair 515 f 806r with primer blast ye et al 2012 revealed the same single base mismatch for all d s mccartyi 16 s rrna sequences this can explain the lower relative abundance values of d mccartyi sp in canas measured by 16 s amplicon sequencing compared to qpcr assays apprill et al 2015 apprill et al 2015 reported the underestimation of sar11 bacterioplankton due to the effect of a single internal primer template mismatch at the position 8 from the 5 end of the reverse primer 806r it is also possible that different sample preparation methods cells were collected by filtration or by centrifugation could lead to the discrepancy between the amplicon sequencing and the qpcr results using qpcr measurements the 16 s gene copies of methanogens in canas were below 30 of those measured in anas fig s3a west et al 2013 similar results were obtained based on 16 s amplicon sequencing with a ratio of methanobacteriaceae in canas vs anas of 0 093 0 045 indicating that canas has about 10 of the abundance of methanobacteriaceae compared to anas h2 levels measured in canas were maintained at about 0 2 μm which is higher than the required methanogenic threshold yang et al 1998 loffler et al 1999 however methane production was only about 30 compared to ethene production based on electron equivalents table 2 this contrasts with the anas bioreactor in which methane production was about 500 of ethene production west et al 2013 since methanogenesis requires more reduced redox conditions eh 200 mv than reductive dechlorination and oxygen reduction le mer et al 2001 methane production in canas might be limited by the increase of the redox potential as observed by the dominance of facultative anaerobic microorganisms 3 3 transcriptional analysis gene expression profiles of d mccartyi in anas during active anas 20 h and inactive anas 0h dechlorination were compared with those obtained in canas under sustained dechlorination at steady state in order to make valid comparisons of transcriptomic data between the two consortia all expression levels were normalized to amended standard samples because dehalococcoides species were present at similar relative abundances in both anas and canas fig s3b unsurprisingly the gene expression profiles of d mccartyi in canas remained relatively constant in the three consecutive stages fig 5 while the expression profile of anas varied significantly as expected in a semi batch reactor most highly expressed genes in canas throughout the experimental period were genes encoding for ribosomal rna 5 s 16 s and 23 s rrna and reductive dehalogenases tcea and vcra interestingly the expression levels of tcea det0079 were significantly lower in canas p 0 03 while vcra was significantly higher p 0 03 compared to anas during active dechlorination the transcriptomic results agree with the higher cell ratio of anas2 to anas1 observed in canas compared to anas the tcea anchor protein gene det0078 and two other rdase genes det0173 and det 1545 in canas were similar to those detected in anas active fig 5 in contrast the expression levels of putative hydrogenases hym hup vhu hyc ech hyp and several oxidoreductase genes fdh mod nuo fpof por were significantly lower compared to anas active but higher than expression levels detected in anas starved fig 5 supporting material table s4 specifically the most highly expressed hydrogenases in canas were hup det0111 hym det0728 vhu which were expressed to the same extent or slightly lower as detected in anas active but were significantly higher than anas starved table s4 other oxidoreductases followed the same trend as the hydrogenase expression table s4 with the expression of the putative formate dehydrogenase fdh det 0185 0187 in canas at about 20 of that measured in anas active but 8 to 10 times higher than in anas starved a previous study had shown that the expression levels of det 0187 in dechlorinating microbial communities were similar or higher than those of the hydrogenases under batch growth conditions morris et al 2007 however a recent transcriptomic study revealed that det0187 was expressed at similar levels to the hup subunit det 0112 in multiple d mccartyi strains mansfeldt et al 2014 the fdh like oxidoreductase det0187 was shown to be associated with the fdh like protein det0112 from the hup operon mansfeldt et al 2014 and a recent transcriptomic study of d mccartyi containing microbial communities indicated the expression pattern of the hup and the fdh like oxidoreductase are strongly linked mansfeldt et al 2016 although the exact function of the fdh like oxidoreductase in d mccartyi remains unknown protein analysis of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 suggested it is involved in the enzyme complexes that are critical to the electron transport chain of the d mccartyi species kublik et al 2016 türkowsky et al 2018 in our study the expression levels of fdh det0186 det 0187 in both anas and canas were found to be at similar levels to the hydrogenases hup hym and vhu supplemental material table s4 consistent with the previous findings mansfeldt et al 2014 2016 heavner et al 2018 previous studies have shown that d mccartyi must rely on exogenous corrinoids for rdase activity magnuson et al 1998 banerjee and ragsdale 2003 johnson et al 2008 west et al 2013 yan et al 2013 men et al 2015 genes associated with corrinoid salvaging and transport were most highly expressed in anas active with lower expression levels of both corrinoid transport and synthesis genes throughout the different monitored stages of canas supplemented with higher concentrations of vitamin b12 fig 5 consistent with a previous study of dehalococcoides mccartyi 195 grown with excess or limiting vitamin b12 johnson et al 2008 the different expression patterns of corrinoid related genes compared to genes for rdases indicate the expression of corrinoid related genes may not be appropriate biomarkers for chlorinated ethene dechlorination activity previous studies have proposed hydrogenase genes hupl as biomarkers to indicate the activity of reductive dechlorination morris et al 2007 rowe et al 2008 berggren et al 2013 in this study we found similar positive correlation between hupl and tcea gene expression previous modeling studies have indicated that transcripts instead of dna proteins vss may serve as better biomarkers to predict reductive dechlorination performance baelum et al 2013 heavner et al 2013 however the consistent high levels of expression demonstrated for active and starving conditions of anas suggest that this approach is problematic 4 conclusion dechlorinating microbial communities have been extensively studied in batch reactors to reveal their dynamics as dechlorination proceeds and to construct kinetic models of reductive dechlorination pathways of chlorinated ethenes however it is difficult to extrapolate the knowledge acquired from such transient and fluctuating systems to flowing groundwater plumes with continuous and sustained supply of low concentrations of contaminants nutrients and substrates it is critical to understand the microbial community structure and dynamics in such continuous flow conditions in order to validate the applications of molecular biomarkers or mathematical models during the bioremediation practices in this study we developed a completely mixed flow reactor containing the tce dechlorinating community canas from a long term dechlorinating enrichment culture anas maintained in a semi batch reactor based on the reactor performance assessment microbial community structure analysis and the transcriptome dynamic analysis the findings present in this study are as follows the reductive dechlorinating microbial community canas developed in the completely mixed flow reactor showed effective tce reduction at the selected srt 40 days with the major end product of ethene 85 and a very low production of other intermediates vc cis dce at the steady state condition the microbial community structure shifted significantly from semi continuous flow condition to completely mixed flow condition while robust reductive dechlorination performance was stably maintained suggesting that anas1 and anas2 could take advantage of the functional redundancy of microbial functional guilds that support their activities the ratio of d mccartyi strains anas1 to anas2 was stably maintained near 1 1 in the canas compared with 4 1 in the anas demonstrating that sustained exposure to low tce concentrations can shift the relative abundance of d mccartyi populations this is the first study to examine global gene expression of dehalococcoides species under continuous flow conditions the most highly expressed genes encoded for ribosomal rna and reductive dehalogenases tcea and vcra while the expression of putative hydrogenases and several oxidoreductases genes were maintained at the levels between the anas active and anas inactive conditions suggesting that we need to be careful when selecting biomarkers to indicate reductive dechlorination activity declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

triplicate samples were collected from stage i ii and iii at steady state fig 2 microarray sample preparation and application procedures were previously described west et al 2013 briefly 1 μg of community genomic dna gdna was used for dna analysis and 10 μg of community total rna was used as starting material for rna analysis as previously described west et al 2008 all probe sets that were detected as present by dna microarray analysis were used in the rna analysis dna for any particular orf was deemed present if each replicate probe set for that orf had signal intensity greater than 140 and a p value less than 0 05 in the dna chips rna for any particular orf was considered present if the average signal intensity of the probe sets for that orf was greater than 120 the criteria applied in this study are the same as previously described for the anas transcriptomic study west et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state performance of the community the 40 day srt

the limiting reactant for dechlorination as observed in tce contaminated plumes with the electron donor concentration in excess samples were collected at steady state for both microbial community

of 14 2 5 μmol l 1 d 1 anas the inoculum of canas consistently exhibited faster growth of d mccartyi strain anas1 with one copy of tcea than anas2 with one copy of vcra resulting in a anas1 anas2 ratio of 4 1 lee et al 2011 in canas this ratio was stably maintained near 1 1 6 2 2 8 108 cell ml 1 vs 5 8 1 2 108 cell ml 1 fig 2c demonstrating that sustained exposure to low tce concentrations electron acceptor limitation and constant supplies of electron donor nutrients and growth factors can shift the relative abundances of d mccartyi populations as has previously been shown under electron donor limitation mayer blackwell et al 2017 the abundance of d mccartyi strain anas2 which is responsible for vc reduction in the microbial community could be increased in the completely mixed flow reactor and thus could facilitate more complete dechlorination complete fermentation of 10 mm lactate in the influent was observed with the accumulation of propionate and acetate in the reactor effluent at concentrations of 3 1 0 4 mm and 6 7 0 7 mm respectively fig 2b h2 concentrations were maintained at around 0 2 μm data not shown which was greater than the reported minimum h2 threshold 2 nm to support dechlorination yang et al 1998 recovery of electron equivalents was 95 108 throughout the steady state period table 2 a result similar to previous bioreactor studies drzyzga et al 2001 only 6 1 of the electrons were consumed for reductive dechlorination while 75 2 accumulated as propionate and acetate and 2 4 as methane and trace h2 biomass production accounts for a large portion of electron flow in this reactor 15 8 compared to previous studies 7 5 9 2 azizian et al 2010 berggren et al 2013 biomass calculations assumed an elemental microbial cell composition of

reported cell densities and production rates of d mccartyi in a cmfr with sustainable dechlorination to ethene table 1 delgado et al 2014 here 85 of tce in the influent was converted to ethene with a dechlorination rate of 120 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 which is lower than the highest dechlorination rate reported in a chemostat 130 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 srt 3 d delgado et al 2014 but higher than a previous study with a 55 day srt exhibiting a dechlorination rate of 80 μmol cl l 1 d 1 table 1 berggren et al 2013 the relatively high d mccartyi cell concentration 1 2 0 3 109 cells ml 1 fig s3a observed in

1010 cells l 1 d 1 srt 40 days was about 10 of that observed in the 3 day srt chemostat delgado et al 2014 table 1 which is explained by the dilution rate srt 1 of canas that is much lower than the reported maximum specific growth rates of d mccartyi 0 21 0 4 d 1 cupples et al 2003 2004 johnson et al 2008 the cell yield of d mccartyi relative to tce dechlorination in canas reached 2 5 0 7 108

cooper et al 2015 but lower than the yield reported in the 3 day srt chemostat 5 3 108 cells per μmol cl released delgado et al 2014 likely due to enhanced endogenous cell decay within canas and the ability of d mccartyi to decouple dechlorination from growth for maintenance activities cupples et al 2003 2004 johnson et al 2008 3 2 microbial community structure analysis no significant difference

methanogenesis from h2 co2 oren 2014 the relative abundances of dehalococcoidaceae in canas 0 59 0 26 for stages i ii iii were similar to anas 0 69 0 04 for anas 0h anas 20 h and anas 27 h with the maintenance of robust dechlorination rates i e 12 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 for canas and 59 μmol cl 1 l 1 d 1 for anas in all conditions the relative abundance of dehalococcoides sp detected by gene tag sequencing was lower than the percentage calculated from qpcr analysis 4 6 fig s3 the structural regime shift observed between canas and anas i e change in the microbial community composition and structure bürgmann et al 2011 engel et al 2014 andersen et al 2009 scheffer and carpenter 2003 was confirmed using hierarchical cluster and pcoa analyses hierarchical cluster analysis of the most abundant otus at the class level fig s7 and family level fig 4 identified in anas and canas indicates that samples segregate according to their reactor type pairwise intra and inter cluster distances analysis for anas and canas fig s8 a showed that intra cluster comparisons anas anas and canas canas and inter cluster distances anas canas were significantly greater than intra cluster distances p 0 0001 fig s8 a in addition the weighted unifrac based pcoa demonstrated anas and canas formed two distinct clusters along pco1 78 variation supporting their separation fig s8 b in this study the microbial community structure of a tce dechlorinating enrichment culture maintained functionally active for more than 15 years in a semi batch reactor significantly shifted after inoculation and maintenance in a cmfr despite the observed community structural shift canas demonstrated a high functional robustness with the maintenance of efficient tce dechlorination to ethene although large proportions of facultative anaerobic microorganisms were detected in canas e g pseudomonadaceae with a significant decrease in relative abundance of the strictly anaerobic desulfovibrionaceae family the dechlorination function was stably preserved suggesting that anas1 and anas2 could take advantage of the functional redundancy of microbial functional guilds that support their activities using qpcr measurements normalized to the bacterial and archaeal 16 s rrna copies detected in the whole community d mccartyi accounted for around 4 6 of the community in both anas and canas as reported in other tce dechlorinating d mccartyi containing communities azizian et al 2008 behrens et al 2008 west et al 2013 in the ev 5l and vs 5l cmfrs table 1 mayer blackwell et al 2016 2017 the relative abundance of d mccartyi was higher than 90 of the total bacterial community using targeted sequencing of the hypervariable v1v2 or v2v3 16 s rrna regions in the cmfr pm 2l 2 ii used to inoculate the cmfr pm 5l table 1 dehalococcoides sp accounted for around 35 of the bacterial community using 16 s rrna based qpcr assays berggren et al 2013 in this study we used the primer pair 515f 806r caporaso et al 2011 tremblay et al 2015 for targeted amplicon sequencing which shows a single primer mismatch at the eleventh position from the 5 end of the reverse primer 806r position 10 from the 3 end 5 ggactachvg g a gtwtctaat 3 with the 16 s rrna sequence of d mccartyii strain 195 in silico analysis of the primer pair 515 f 806r with primer blast ye et al 2012 revealed the same single base mismatch for all d s mccartyi 16 s rrna sequences this can explain the lower relative abundance values of d mccartyi sp in canas measured by 16 s amplicon sequencing compared to qpcr assays apprill et al 2015 apprill et al 2015 reported the underestimation of sar11 bacterioplankton due to the effect of a single internal primer template mismatch at the position 8 from the 5 end of the reverse primer 806r it is also possible that different sample preparation methods cells were collected by filtration or by centrifugation could lead to the discrepancy between the amplicon sequencing and the qpcr results using qpcr measurements the 16 s gene copies of methanogens in canas were below 30 of those measured in anas fig s3a west et al 2013 similar results were obtained based on 16 s amplicon sequencing with a ratio of methanobacteriaceae in canas vs anas of 0 093 0 045 indicating that canas has about 10 of the abundance of methanobacteriaceae compared to anas h2 levels measured in canas were maintained at about 0 2 μm which is higher than the required methanogenic threshold yang et al 1998 loffler et al 1999 however methane production was only about 30 compared to ethene production based on electron equivalents table 2 this contrasts with the anas bioreactor in which methane production was about 500 of ethene production west et al 2013 since methanogenesis requires more reduced redox conditions eh 200 mv than reductive dechlorination and oxygen reduction le mer et al 2001 methane production in canas might be limited by the increase of the redox potential as observed by the dominance of facultative anaerobic microorganisms 3 3 transcriptional analysis gene expression profiles of d mccartyi in anas during active anas 20 h and inactive anas 0h dechlorination were compared with those obtained in canas under sustained dechlorination at steady state in order to make valid comparisons of transcriptomic data between the two consortia all expression levels were normalized to amended standard samples because dehalococcoides species were present at similar relative abundances in both anas and canas fig s3b unsurprisingly the gene expression profiles of d mccartyi in canas remained relatively constant in the three consecutive stages fig 5 while the expression profile of anas varied significantly as expected in a semi batch reactor most highly expressed genes in canas throughout the experimental period were genes encoding for ribosomal rna 5 s 16 s and 23 s rrna and reductive dehalogenases tcea and vcra interestingly the expression levels of tcea det0079 were significantly lower in canas p 0 03 while vcra was significantly higher p 0 03 compared to anas during active dechlorination the transcriptomic results agree with the higher cell ratio of anas2 to anas1 observed in canas compared to anas the tcea anchor protein gene det0078 and two other rdase genes det0173 and det 1545 in canas were similar to those detected in anas active fig 5 in contrast the expression levels of putative hydrogenases hym hup vhu hyc ech hyp and several oxidoreductase genes fdh mod nuo fpof por were significantly lower compared to anas active but higher than expression levels detected in anas starved fig 5 supporting material table s4 specifically the most highly expressed hydrogenases in canas were hup det0111 hym det0728 vhu which were expressed to the same extent or slightly lower as detected in anas active but were significantly higher than anas starved table s4 other oxidoreductases followed the same trend as the hydrogenase expression table s4 with the expression of the putative formate dehydrogenase fdh det 0185 0187 in canas at about 20 of that measured in anas active but 8 to 10 times higher than in anas starved a previous study had shown that the expression levels of det 0187 in dechlorinating microbial communities were similar or higher than those of the hydrogenases under batch growth conditions morris et al 2007 however a recent transcriptomic study revealed that det0187 was expressed at similar levels to the hup subunit det 0112 in multiple d mccartyi strains mansfeldt et al 2014 the fdh like oxidoreductase det0187 was shown to be associated with the fdh like protein det0112 from the hup operon mansfeldt et al 2014 and a recent transcriptomic study of d mccartyi containing microbial communities indicated the expression pattern of the hup and the fdh like oxidoreductase are strongly linked mansfeldt et al 2016 although the exact function of the fdh like oxidoreductase in d mccartyi remains unknown protein analysis of d mccartyi strain cbdb1 suggested it is involved in the enzyme complexes that are critical to the electron transport chain of the d mccartyi species kublik et al 2016 türkowsky et al 2018 in our study the expression levels of fdh det0186 det 0187 in both anas and canas were found to be at similar levels to the hydrogenases hup hym and vhu supplemental material table s4 consistent with the previous findings mansfeldt et al 2014 2016 heavner et al 2018 previous studies have shown that d mccartyi must rely on exogenous corrinoids for rdase activity magnuson et al 1998 banerjee and ragsdale 2003 johnson et al 2008 west et al 2013 yan et al 2013 men et al 2015 genes associated with corrinoid salvaging and transport were most highly expressed in anas active with lower expression levels of both corrinoid transport and synthesis genes throughout the different monitored stages of canas supplemented with higher concentrations of vitamin b12 fig 5 consistent with a previous study of dehalococcoides mccartyi 195 grown with excess or limiting vitamin b12 johnson et al 2008 the different expression patterns of corrinoid related genes compared to genes for rdases indicate the expression of corrinoid related genes may not be appropriate biomarkers for chlorinated ethene dechlorination activity previous studies have proposed hydrogenase genes hupl as biomarkers to indicate the activity of reductive dechlorination morris et al 2007 rowe et al 2008 berggren et al 2013 in this study we found similar positive correlation between hupl and tcea gene expression previous modeling studies have indicated that transcripts instead of dna proteins vss may serve as better biomarkers to predict reductive dechlorination performance baelum et al 2013 heavner et al 2013 however the consistent high levels of expression demonstrated for active and starving conditions of anas suggest that this approach is problematic 4 conclusion dechlorinating microbial communities have been extensively studied in batch reactors to reveal their dynamics as dechlorination proceeds and to construct kinetic models of reductive dechlorination pathways of chlorinated ethenes however it is difficult to extrapolate the knowledge acquired from such transient and fluctuating systems to flowing groundwater plumes with continuous and sustained supply of low concentrations of contaminants nutrients and substrates it is critical to understand the microbial community structure and dynamics in such continuous flow conditions in order to validate the applications of molecular biomarkers or mathematical models during the bioremediation practices in this study we developed a completely mixed flow reactor containing the tce dechlorinating community canas from a long term dechlorinating enrichment culture anas maintained in a semi batch reactor based on the reactor performance assessment microbial community structure analysis and the transcriptome dynamic analysis the findings present in this study are as follows the reductive dechlorinating microbial community canas developed in the completely mixed flow reactor showed effective tce reduction at the selected srt 40 days with the major end product of ethene 85 and a very low production of other intermediates vc cis dce at the steady state condition the microbial community structure shifted significantly from semi continuous flow condition to completely mixed flow condition while robust reductive dechlorination performance was stably maintained suggesting that anas1 and anas2 could take advantage of the functional redundancy of microbial functional guilds that support their activities the ratio of d mccartyi strains anas1 to anas2 was stably maintained near 1 1 in the canas compared with 4 1 in the anas demonstrating that sustained exposure to low tce concentrations can shift the relative abundance of d mccartyi populations this is the first study to examine global gene expression of dehalococcoides species under continuous flow conditions the most highly expressed genes encoded for ribosomal rna and reductive dehalogenases tcea and vcra while the expression of putative hydrogenases and several oxidoreductases genes were maintained at the levels between the anas active and anas inactive conditions suggesting that we need to be careful when selecting biomarkers to indicate reductive dechlorination activity declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

18816,the paper reports on the development of an advanced lagrangian particle tracking model of sludge flocs that takes into account its nonspherical shape the internal porosity and permeability as well as the nonhomogenous mass distribution the floc shapes sizes and free settling velocities are determined based on the experimental measurement of settling sludge flocs originating from a wastewater treatment plant based on the floc shape characterization a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid is selected as the modelled sludge particle in order to determine the main particle characteristics e g the internal porosity the density and the flow permeability a lagrangian particle tracking model is developed based on brenner s drag model for a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid and a buoyancy force model for a porous particle the model is implemented for numerical simulations of the free settling process the obtained floc characteristics are presented in the form of a two part polynomial fitting curve which can be used to model floc characteristics the values of settling velocities of flocs computed by the model show very good agreement with experimental results futhermore as the internal structure of a floc is seldom uniform the nonhomogeneous mass distribution is considered influencing the rotational and translational motions of the settling flocs the nonhomogeneous mass distribution is introduced into the floc settling model the parametric analyses of different barycentre offsets and shear rates are performed and their influences on the free settling velocity are evaluated the presented modelling approach can also be applied to flocculent settling of alum and other flocs in drinking water treatment plants the developed lagrangian model is suitable for use as a point source within the framework of eulerian flow computations and is solved as a two phase flow model with a suitable computational fluid dynamics code graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge floc settling velocity prolate spheroidal floc non homogenous porous floc lagrangian particle tracking model 1 introduction in a wastewater treatment plant the final stage consists of the sedimentation process performed in a sedimentation tank droste and gehr 2019 due to the intense mixing in the aerobic phase of the plant operation the sludge flocs are predominantly well distributed within the volume of the liquid phase entering the sedimentation tank after entering the sedimentation starts in the settling zone where the process is characterised by the unhindered settling of the sludge flocs i e without interaction with other flocs in a dilute liquid particle flow regime the flocs then accumulate in the sludge zone where the sludge floc concentration increases and particle particle interactions start to influence the settling velocities of the flocs with intermediate and dense liquid particle flow regimes crowe et al 2011 in general the sludge flocs having a settling velocity larger than the critical particle are removed from the liquid entering the outlet zone of the sedimentation tank as the settling behaviour of the flocs is influenced by the floc s physical properties and its interaction with the liquid flow it is extremely important to determine these parameters correctly the sedimentation velocity of a floc is influenced significantly by its diameter and density as predicted by the stokes settling model but can also depend on the floc shape and porous internal structure as flocs are agglomerates of many primary particles vahedi and gorczyca 2014 the floc properties determine the magnitude of interaction forces with the liquid phase where the drag force and the buoyancy force are the most important contributions determination of the floc properties is frequently done by using a combined experimental and computational approach where the experiments provide information on the floc sizes and settling velocities in a free settling environment while computational models serve as the basis for calculation of hydrodynamic properties as well as the floc densities since the sludge particles are typically smaller than the smallest flow structures the point particle approximation can be used when developing computational sedimentation models crowe et al 2011 the majority of computational force models assume a spherical floc shape which thus hydrodynamically is also the most studied one the sphere models can be extended to nonspherical shapes by introducing a shape factor e g the sphericity of a particle hölzer and sommerfeld 2009 mando and rosendahl 2010 while such an approach is easy to implement and can lead to simple to use computational models for the point particle approximation zastawny et al 2012 it does not provide much improvement in terms of a more detailed particle fluid flow interaction model as the floc shape is a result of an agglomeration process in the active phase of the wastewater treatment its volume is composed of numerous smaller primary particles forming a larger porous volume consisting of primary particles and the fluid due to the porous structure the fluid can penetrate and the flow through the floc alters the floc hydrodynamic properties hsu and hsieh 2003 in order to establish a computationally lean model the porosity and the permeability of flocs are applied further in the floc forces and properties models furthermore a floc force model that takes into account more details of the floc shape can further improve the accuracy of sludge floc fluid flow interaction models the use of advanced computational techniques in the modelling of activated sludge systems is still one of the major challenges in the wastewater sector and the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd to model different stages in activated sludge systems is becoming one of the most advanced wastewater engineering tools karpinska and bridgeman 2016 the cfd tool must incorporate a multiphase flow model where the building blocks are either a eulerian or a lagrangian two phase flow model karpinska and bridgeman 2016 xu et al 2017 gao and stenstrom 2018 with regard to the secondary settling which is one of the most sensitive processes in activated sludge plants the lagrangian model is the most accurate option for numerical simulation of floc trajectories as the dimensions of a typical settling tank are very large and the corresponding computational grid for the cfd typically consists of elements much larger than the size of a sludge floc the point particle approximation in combination with the lagrangian particle tracking provides an accurate computational tool for studying such systems also detailed flow field computations by implementing the large eddy simulations les al sammarraee et al 2009 showed that the smaller particles typically below 250 μ m are the critical ones with the tendency to exit the system with the effluent a consequence of long sedimentation times influenced by the turbulent regions at the inflow and outflow of a sedimentation basin when dealing with nonspherical particles tracking the orientation of a nonspherical particle in a flow field is an important aspect of an accurate two phase flow computational model as it determines the orientation of the force vector acting on the particle gunes et al 2008 the orientation is influenced by the particle shape and porous structure masoud et al 2013 but could also be influenced by a nonhomogeneous mass distribution within the particle producing an additional gravitational torque acting on the particle croze et al 2013 in the case of sludge flocs since the floc agglomeration process is a stochastic one a nonhomogeneous mass distribution is likely to occur vahedi and gorczyca 2014 although the majority of cfd codes include such two phase models the particle force models available are only applicable to solid spheres in recent years a lot of research was devoted to the development and implementation of nonspherical particle two phase cfd models zhang et al 2001 mortensen et al 2008 soldati and marchioli 2009 liu et al 2009 marchioli et al 2010 where the ellipsoidal shape was used predominantly as a generic shape applicable to a wide range of practical two phase problems mando and rosendahl 2010 kleinstreuer and feng 2013 the lagrangian model in its simplified form is also the model of choice when determination of the floc properties based on experimental sedimentation studies is performed as reported in the experimental analysis of sludge floc sedimentation characteristics žajdela et al 2008 and the consequent determination of the floc properties based on the free settling model of porous and permeable sludge flocs lee et al 1996 hriberšek et al 2011 in order to account for the nonspherical floc shape and its porous internal structure that influences its hydraulic resistance in the flow field a dedicated lagrangian particle model for the sludge floc case could prove beneficial in increasing the accuracy of dispersed two phase flow cfd computational models especially if it would also be applicable as a computational framework for the derivation of sludge floc properties based on experimental sedimentation data the present work reports on the development of such a model the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the key sedimentation characteristics of sludge flocs followed by section 3 where the development of a lagrangian computational sedimentation model is elaborated based on the developed lagrangian model two computational algorithms are proposed the first one suitable for use as a computational tool for the determination of floc porosities and corresponding parameters and the second one for studying the effects of nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the sludge floc sedimentation dynamics section 5 reports on the results of the implementation of both computational algorithms which are based on available experimental data on 306 sludge flocs originating from a municipal wastewater plant in slovenia section 6 compares the performance of the developed models with several established hard sphere models to understand what and how much is improved by the present model by comparing it with other models 2 sedimentation characteristics of activated sludge flocs activated sludge flocs are formed as aggregates of suspended solids micro flocs and primary particles in wastewater and as such they are not solid bodies but exhibit an open porous internal structure allowing the fluid phase to flow through the floc although the complex internal structure of a floc presents a significant resistance to the fluid flow the flow through the floc alters the flow field in the wake effectively reducing the drag force this in turn allows the floc to reach higher settling velocities as in the case of solid particles of the same shape size and density the free settling test is used frequently for the determination of the porous particle density porosity and hydraulic permeability which is done through a simple force balance equation in žajdela et al 2008 a free settling model was designed based on the stokes model of sedimentation where the chien s model chien 1994 was used for the drag coefficient of irregularly shaped particles although the applied chien s drag model is easy to use with the only additional parameter being the particle sphericity ψ the model could be improved for the case of a sludge floc with more detailed particle shape cases in general settling velocities of porous sludge flocs are relatively low resulting in low particle reynolds number values this is especially true in the case of smaller porous flocs approx below 1 mm where particle reynolds number values are below 1 in such a case the stokes flow regime is valid and the stokes drag model could be applied for the case of 306 flocs žajdela et al 2008 originating from a primarily municipal wastewater plant experimental analysis of the settling velocities was carried out with the results of the settling velocities depicted in fig 1 from the same data presented in the form of the particle reynolds number values r e k ψ d k v k ν with d k the equivalent spherical diameter v k the settling velocity and ν the fluid kinematic viscosity in fig 2 it is evident that the vast majority of particles exhibited reynolds number values lower than 1 therefore the stokes drag model can be applied in the derivation of the floc sedimentation model a more realistic drag force model should also include the main geometric parameters of the floc shape whereas larger flocs have a typical fractal structure gorczyca and ganczarczyk 2002 the structure of the smaller flocs resembles more geometrically regular shapes in the works of žajdela et al 2008 and hriberšek et al 2011 geometric analysis of stationary flocs as well as settling flocs led to the conclusion that the sludge flocs could be described approximately as cuboids with two shorter axes of almost the same size for the cited case the sphericity defined as the ratio of a sphere surface area to the surface area of a floc with the same volume was determined to be 0 796 the cuboidal approximation could be improved further by considering the ellipsoidal shape of the studied porous flocs as shown in fig 3 originating from experiments of žajdela et al 2008 of the same volume the general shape of the smallest flocs could therefore be described as a prolate spheroid a schematic diagram of a prolate spheroidal particle or axisymmetric ellipsoidal particle with semi minor axis a and semi major axis b and thus with aspect ratio λ b a 1 and the associated reference frame used in the computational model are illustrated in fig 4 the observed axis ratio λ b a of the ellipsoids ranged between 1 29 and 1 47 for the sake of simplicity the average value of λ 1 38 was adopted in our case but the sensitivity of the results on the lower and upper limit values of the aspect ratio was also checked low settling velocities of sludge flocs resulting in low values of the stokes number defined as s t k ρ k v k d k 18 ρ f ν with ρ f the fluid density and in the range of 0 004 0 18 hriberšek et al 2011 also indicate that the velocity of such a particle would not differ much from the fluid flow velocity in a settling tank the flow field is governed by the inflow and outflow rates and positions or in the case of a closed system from buoyancy driven currents and although flow velocities in these systems are low and settling is facilitated the particles still interact with the local fluid flow therefore accurate prediction of floc trajectories could be very beneficial when designing the sedimentation process in a settling tank 3 computational model of ellipsoidal porous floc sedimentation in general the trajectory of a particle is the result of its interaction with the fluid flow local values of velocity vorticity and pressure in the fluid phase and their difference to the state of the particle determine the transport phenomena between the dispersed and the fluid phases when the exact particle trajectories are of major importance as is the case in sedimentation analysis particle transport in the framework of cfd is computed by applying lagrangian based particle tracking in the following the computational model of sedimentation is derived based on the stokes drag model for an axisymmetric ellipsoid case i e prolate spheroidal porous flocs taking into account the translational as well as rotational dynamics of the floc as the floc is ellipsoidal its orientation regarding the flow velocity is important for the accurate computation of the hydrodynamic force a case that is not important when dealing with the spherical approximation of the floc shape the sedimentation model used for the calculation of the porous floc properties can be derived from the general model of lagrangian particle tracking which consists of the translational kinematics relation 1 d r d t v the translational momentum conservation equation 2 m p d v d t f d f g and the angular momentum conservation equation 3 d d t i p ω i p d ω d t ω i p ω t where m p is the mass of the particle r v ω i p are the barycentre position vector the translational velocity the angular velocity and the inertia tensor respectively of the particle and f d f g t are the drag force the gravity force reduced by buoyancy and the applied torque respectively acting on the particle the angular kinematics relation is accounted for by the time evolution of the euler parameters cui et al 2018a b in order to close the system of equations models for forces and torques acting on a porous floc have to be specified 3 1 drag and buoyancy models for prolate spheroidal porous flocs dedicated models of forces have to be selected in order to account for the prolate spheroidal floc shape brenner 1964 derived the hydrodynamic drag force acting on an axisymmetric ellipsoidal particle with semi minor axis a in the stokes flow regime 4 f d π a ρ f ν k u v where u v f d k are the corresponding coefficient matrices of the fluid velocity u the floc velocity v the drag force acting on the floc f d and the geometric resistance tensor k of the floc respectively only the diagonal components of the coefficient matrix of the resistance tensor in the particle frame of reference x y z i e k are non zero these are functions of the floc aspect ratio λ and can be written as 5 k x x k y y 16 λ 2 1 3 2 2 λ 2 3 ln λ λ 2 1 λ λ 2 1 6 k z z 8 λ 2 1 3 2 2 λ 2 1 ln λ λ 2 1 λ λ 2 1 the spherical particle limit renders lim λ 1 k 6 i where i is the identity matrix in order to build the relationship between k and k the rotation matrix v between the inertia and the particle frame of reference is used 7 k v t k v the rotation matrix is written in terms of the euler parameters and can be found in cui et al 2018a in order to account for the porosity of the floc the ratio of the hydrodynamic drag between a permeable and an impermeable flocs i e ω is introduced by using the brinkman extension of darcy s law huang 1993 with ω defined as 8 ω 2 β 2 1 tanh β β 2 β 2 3 1 tanh β β with the permeability factor 9 β d k 2 k and the hydraulic permeability of the floc accounted for by the brinkman model 10 k d p 72 3 4 1 ε 3 8 1 ε 3 where ε and d p are the porosity of the floc and the primary particle diameter the density of the floc ρ k is related to the density of primary particles ρ p constituting the floc and the density of the fluid ρ f by the relation 11 ρ k 1 ε ρ p ρ f ρ f the values of ρ p 1059 k g m 3 and ρ f 998 k g m 3 are used in the present study hriberšek et al 2011 the final form of the drag model for the prolate spheroidal porous floc is 12 f d π a ρ f ν ω k u v and the gravity force reduced by buoyancy is 13 f g g v p 1 ε ρ p ρ f where v p 4 π λ a 3 3 is the volume of the prolate spheroid f g and g are the corresponding coefficient matrices of the gravity force reduced by buoyancy f g and the gravity acceleration g respectively 3 2 sedimentation of a floc with nonhomogeneous density distribution during the floc agglomeration process a variety of primary particles having different sizes and also different densities aggregate into flocculi micro flocs and finally floc aggregates leading to nonhomogeneous mass distribution vahedi and gorczyca 2014 the nonhomogeneous mass distribution gives rise to gravitational torque acting on the particle that additionally influences the floc rotational dynamics and hence its orientation regarding the flow direction in the following the computational framework is described by taking into account the nonhomogenous mass distribution the applied torques acting on a prolate spheroidal porous floc eq 3 can be decomposed into the gravitational torque t g and jeffery s torque t j jeffery 1922 i e 14 t t g t j in order to calculate the inertia tensor and the gravitational torque a separate computational analysis is needed in the case of a general density distribution within the particle volume this analysis could be interpreted as a particle pre processor which needs to be applied before the sedimentation analysis is performed giving as a result the barycentre location and the inertia tensor of the particle in the analysis the floc is decomposed into many cubic grid cells where within a grid cell the density is assumed to be homogeneous therefore the inertia tensor can be calculated by summing up the local inertia tensors for all grid cells i e 15 i p i 1 n m i y i 2 z i 2 x i y i x i z i x i y i z i 2 x i 2 y i z i x i z i y i z i x i 2 y i 2 where n is the total number of grid cells m i is the mass of each grid cell x i y i z i are the coordinates of the centre of the i t h grid cell in the particle frame of reference and i p is the coefficient matrix of the inertia tensor of the particle in the particle frame of reference in the case of a general density distribution within the floc the floc volume must be discretised by a suitable number of grid cells with variable local mass values leading to 16 b c i 1 n m i x i y i z i t i 1 n m i where b c is the coefficient column matrix of the barycentre b c in the particle frame of reference since the calculation of particle inertia tensor and barycentre position is only performed at the beginning of the simulation it could be separated from the actual execution of computational steps of the proposed algorithms in such a case even at a high number of elements used for discretising the particle interior it would not present a considerable computational expense as these two parameters eq 15 16 are calculated only once in the present study we use a simplied slug floc formulation i e a small heavy sphere sits inside a large light prolate spheroid as depicted in fig 5 in order to analyse the influence of nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the settling characteristics in this simplied case the analytical solution to calculate the barycenter is 17 b c 1 1 λ a 3 r i n 3 ρ i n ρ o u t 1 p o s i n o u t where r i n and ρ i n are the radius and the density of the inner spherical particle ρ o u t is the density of the outer prolate spheroid and p o s i n o u t is the corresponding coefficient column matrix of the position vector of the inner spherical particle with respect to the geometric centre of the outer prolate spheroid at the particle frame of reference similarly the coefficient matrix of the inertia tensor in the particle frame of reference reads as 18 i p 1 5 m o u t a 2 1 λ 2 2 5 m i n r i n 2 0 0 0 1 5 m o u t a 2 1 λ 2 2 5 m i n r i n 2 0 0 0 2 5 m o u t a 2 2 5 m i n r i n 2 m i n p o s i n o u t p o s i n o u t t with m i n 4 π r i n 3 ρ i n ρ o u t 3 and m o u t 4 π λ a 3 ρ o u t 3 finally the gravitational torque with regard to the origin of the particle frame of reference can be expressed as 19 t g b c f g since the jeffery torque is defined in the particle frame of reference jeffery 1922 cui et al 2018a it is necessary to transform the coefficient column matrix of the gravity force reduced by the buoyancy from the inertia frame of reference to the particle frame of reference by using the rotation matrix v 20 f g v f g where f g and f g are the coefficient column matrices of the gravity force reduced by the buoyancy in the inertia frame of reference and in the particle frame of reference respectively 4 computational algorithms for the determination of sludge floc characteristics algorithm 1 summarizes the computational steps needed for the determination of the unknown floc parameters ε ρ k k and ω as the latter three all depend on the porosity value we are basically dealing with a nonlinear system of equations for the unknown porosity of the floc which can be solved by using an iterative method in our case derivation of the sludge floc porosity is based on the known free settling velocities of flocs of different sizes see fig 1 as well as on the pre defined floc orientation which is the orientation of the maximum drag force where the floc has its major axis b pointing in the z direction i e perpendicular to the settling velocity direction this orientation is chosen according to findings of feng et al 1994 and ardekani et al 2016 who showed that a spheroidal particle eventually falls with its major axis perpendicular to the gravity direction independent of its initial orientation algorithm 1 1 set eq 2 for the case of terminal velocity d

parameters ε ρ k k and ω algorithm 1 is directly applicable to flocs with homogeneous mass distribution which is also the assumption used in the free settling experiment of hriberšek et al 2011 in order to determine the impact of the nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the floc settling characteristics additional computational cases were performed with nonhomogeneous mass distribution to simplify the mass distribution description a model with two homogeneous zones of different densities was set up the smaller inner zone has a higher density than the surrounding larger zone as shown in fig 5 the inner zone locates in the z axis of the ellipsoid the distance between the inner zone centre and the ellipsoid centre is 0 2 b the inner zone radius is half of the ellipsoid short radius i e 0 5 a if the density ratio ρ i n ρ o u t 1 the floc has a homogeneous density distribution if ρ i n ρ o u t 1 the floc has a nonhomogeneous density distribution it is important to note that in the latter case the overall mass of the floc remains unchanged with regard to the homogeneous mass distribution case different barycentre locations of the particle can be produced by varying the density ratio for the case of the particle in fig 5 the position vector of the inner spherical particle at the particle frame of reference is p o s i n o u t 0 0 0 2 b t and the r i n 0 5 a as mentioned above the floc porosity values were adopted from the computational results of algorithm 1 the algorithm 2 was designed in order to establish the sensitivity of the settling characteristics of a floc with nonhomogeneous mass distribution the main aim of the algorithm 2 is to compute the time evolution of the positions and translational and rotational velocities of the prolate spheroidal porous floc which would then serve as a basis for comparison with the sedimentation characteristics of homogeneous flocs algorithm 2 1 set the floc properties d k λ ε ω ρ i n ρ o u t and the offset distance 2

time step and perform another iteration go to step 6 5 simulation results 5 1 sedimentation characteristics of a floc with homogeneous density distribution in the first part of this section the computed porous floc porosities obtained by applying algorithm 1 on all of the 306 flocs are depicted in fig 6 for easier viewing two thirds of data points in figs 6 9 were removed from the plots from the results it is evident that the porosity varies in the range of 0 6 for the smallest flocs to 0 96 for the largest flocs in order to gain additional insights and a comparison with the results of the previous study hriberšek et al 2011 the calculated floc porosities are also presented as a function of the particle reynolds number as in the present case the particles are porous flocs with ellipsoidal shape the following form of the particle reynolds number denoted by r e m is used 21 r e m d k ε 3 v k ω ν from the relation between the porosity and r e m as shown in fig 7 it is evident that the vast majority of flocs have r e m values well below 1 and the maximum values do not exceed 3 this indicates that the applied drag force model of brenner 1964 see eq 12 which is based on the same assumptions as the stokes drag is valid for the considered case when comparing the present results with the results of hriberšek et al 2011 as shown in figs 6 and 7 the results indicate qualitatively a good agreement between both studies however the present results show an increase in the computed porosity values which is more evident around 7 in the lower r e m range than in the upper r e m range around 1 this also leads to higher values of computed permeabilities as can be concluded from fig 8 although the permeability still remains roughly in the same order of magnitude which is comparable to studies of other authors lee et al 1996 chu et al 2005 the calculated values of hydraulic permeabilities and the corresponding values of the parameter ω see fig 9 indicate the fact that the fluid flow through the floc is very weak and hence the overall drag force on a floc does not differ much from the non porous case nevertheless when numerically tracking a particle floc in a flow field for a long computational time small differences can alter the computed trajectories significantly also the obtained data on floc porosities are important as the flocs do not only exchange momentum with the fluid but also exchange mass due to biological reactions where the internal surface area of a floc which correlates with the value of the porosity plays a major role in order to build a model that could be used in the cfd context a polynomial data fitting of results was performed derived under the assumption of a homogeneous density distribution for all particles as is evident from the results in fig 6 there are two distinct dependencies of ε d k one for the larger floc equivalent diameters and the other for the smaller equivalent floc diameters therefore a two part polynomial fitting was derived based on the form 22 ε d k c 0 c 1 d k c 2 d k 2 c 3 d k 3 c 4 d k 4 c 5 d k 5 c 6 d k 6 for the range of d k 1 m m a polynomial of the 6th order and for the range of d k 1 m m a polynomial of the 2nd order were fitted with corresponding values of coefficients for all the cases listed in appendix table 2 as the application of the algorithm 1 was based on the assumption of a fixed ellipsoidal semi axis ratio λ a sensitivity study was performed of the results regarding the change of λ here the lower and upper limits of the established experimental data on the floc dimensions were used namely λ 1 3 and λ 1 5 evidently as shown in fig 10 the computed values of porosities for different aspect ratios of ellipsoidal flocs show that the change in the aspect ratio does not lead to different values of porosities at least not for the targeted range of aspect ratios finally as in the derivation of the sludge floc porosity the orientation of a floc was with its major axis b pointing in the z direction i e perpendicular to the settling velocity direction which is the stable floc orientation with maximum flow resistance the effect of the other significant orientation with the long axis pointing in the direction of the gravity on the sedimentation velocity was studied with results depicted in fig 11 although in all the considered floc cases i e 306 flocs each floc had its own distinct porosity value the ratios of the computed sedimentation velocities for the two distinct orientation cases are in a very narrow range between 1 064 and 1 068 the difference of approx 6 in sedimentation velocity between different orientations for the selected model floc with λ 1 38 can be due to the very long retention times of several hours in a sedimentation tank leading to a larger difference in computational results for particle trajectories with respect to spherical porous particles and hence to differences in results of calculated separation efficiency of a secondary clarifier 5 2 sedimentation characteristics of a floc with nonhomogeneous density distribution nonhomogeneous mass distribution is an inherent result of the floc forming process vahedi and gorczyca 2014 and a closer look at the different intensities of the grey areas in the porous flocs in fig 3 confirms this fact as the floc images of fig 3 were taken using an axiocam mrc d high resolution microscopic camera offering a good spatial resolution in the experimental sedimentation study of hriberšek et al 2011 a nikon hi sence camera was used with a much lower resolution it allowed estimation of the basic floc shapes but from these results one could not obtain the data that could facilitate detailed information on the mass nonhomogeneity of each sedimenting floc nevertheless in order to validate the effect of nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the sedimentation behaviour of a floc based on available floc images a simplified model of the floc nonhomogeneous mass distribution was given as depicted in fig 5 the modelled floc consists of a dense spherical zone ρ i n and a sparse zone ρ o u t of the remaining part of the floc the distance between the centre of the dense zone and the floc geometrical centre i e offset as well as the density ratio between the dense and the sparse zones are now the parameters which have influence on the sedimentation characteristics as reported in this section with the known local mass distribution within the floc the corresponding barycentre offset and inertia tensor could be calculated easily using eqs 15 and 16 however this distribution is very difficult to determine experimentally therefore the following approximation was applied as the floc formation is a stochastic process one cannot expect that the barycentre offset should be very large and only an estimation of this value could be made at this stage of the research the position of the denser zone was therefore shifted from the centre of the ellipsoid in the z by the distance of 20 of the longer half axis which resulted in an additional action of the gravitational torque that would otherwise not act on the particle with this set up the study of the additional gravitational torque on the particle translational and rotational dynamics could be made as a modelled floc a floc was selected with d k 0 29 m m and the corresponding settling velocity of v k 0 58 m m s the calculated porosity of the modelled floc is uniform and has a value of ε 0 7843 if not reported otherwise the default offset is 0 2 b the application of the particle preprocessor described in section 3 2 gives data on the inertia tensor and on the position of the barycentre of the floc which is shown in fig 12 in all simulations the floc was initially at rest with its major axis b pointing in the z direction as shown in fig 5 in figs 13 and 14 the effect is presented of different density ratios on the free settling behaviour of the floc as can be observed from fig 13 the shift in the barycentre and the additional gravitational torque gives rise to the floc rotation which is stronger with increasing density ratio the rotation changes the orientation of the floc and hence the drag force the floc tends to align its long axis with the direction of the settling velocity whereby the gravitational torque damps to zero at this orientation angle the frontal area of the floc is the minimum leading to an increase of the free settling velocity see fig 14 which has the same value for both nonhomogeneous test cases in all free settling tests the fluid is considered at rest condition which may violate experimental conditions e g dosing of particles buoyancy driven natural circulation also flocs that interact with the fluid flow are always exposed to locally varying fluid shear rates giving rise to additional torque on the floc i e the jeffery torque t j jeffery 1922 in order to study the influence of the local shear rate on the floc dynamics different linear shear rates g u x z are applied resulting in different values of the shear reynolds number r e g d k 2 g ν shear rate values used in the numerical examples are typical for the sedimentation tank see velocity profiles in tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 and range from 0 0012 s 1 to 0 006 s 1 in figs 15 and 16 the effect of different shear rates on the free settling behaviour of the floc with ρ i n ρ o u t 1 05 is presented the action of jeffery s torque as a consequence of the shear rate leads to much stronger interaction between the floc and the fluid cui et al 2018a 2019 the shear rate forces the floc to rotate constantly in a clockwise direction around the y axis while the gravitational torque acts in the clockwise or counterclockwise directions around the y axis depending on the signum of the cross product between the position vector of the barycentre and the direction of the gravity vector the end effect is either almost equilibrium of both torques case of r e g 0 0001 or a larger difference of both torques producing stronger oscillations in the rotation rate case of r e g 0 0005 in the case of r e g 0 0005 the free settling velocity condition is never met and the tumbling motion is induced 6 comparison of the developed models with hard sphere models although sludge flocs are clearly porous objects the hard sphere models are currently used predominantly in computational studies of sedimentation the case of the dispersed solid phase in the form of sludge flocs is often treated as a pseudo solid phase whose influence on the fluid flow is accounted for by introduction of the sludge viscosity as well as additional interaction forces between the liquid and solid phases on the other hand lagrangian particle tracking was applied in the cfd study of the sedimentation tank performance goula et al 2008 where the particle structure effect was accounted for by the ratio of the resistance experienced by a floc to that of an equivalent solid sphere set to 0 9 and setting the apparent density at 1066 kg m3 regardless of the particle size in spelman and sansalone 2017 a hard sphere based unsteady cfd simulation with lagrangian particle tracking was used for computing particle sequestration with interesting results that the simulation results showed consistently an over prediction of particles sequestration compared with measured results since a hydrated sludge floc is essentially a gelatinous coagulated material lei and ni 2014 its hydrodynamic properties that govern interaction with the liquid phase are different than that of a solid sphere which is a standard representation of a sludge floc using hard sphere models that are available in all vendor cfd codes inevitably leads to modelling errors especially if the density of flocs of various sizes are set as a constant value as an example in table 1 a root mean square deviation rmsd and its normalised form nrmsd are presented produced by implementing the different models for calculation of the free settling velocity for the flocs from our experiment selected models include the model of morsi and alexander 1972 and clift et al 1978 which are a standard quadratic hard sphere model with reynolds number dependent drag coefficient effectively linking the linear drag dependence with quadratic drag dependence region the model used in goula et al 2008 builds on the cfd code fluent based stokes particle drag model by applying a fixed value of the ratio of the resistance experienced by a floc to that of an equivalent solid sphere set at 0 9 the model of chien 1994 is another example of a hard sphere model which additionally takes into account the sphericity of the floc in order to amplify the need to take into account the variation of the density values of a floc with regard to its size two additional calculations were performed the first with a fixed floc density value of 1066 kg m3 and the second with the floc density value calculated by eq 11 by using the porosity values of eq 22 results depicted in fig 17 from the results it is evident that using a constant value of floc density leads to large errors in calculating free settling velocity especially for larger values of floc diameters if such parameters are used in combination with standard cfd drag models in the cfd simulation to compute sludge floc trajectories there is a danger of overestimating the separation efficiency of a tested clarifier design when the size dependent porosity value and consequently the density value of the floc are used the results are significantly better nevertheless if floc permeability and shape are not taken into account hard sphere models the rmsd and nrmsd are still significantly larger compared with the results obtained by using the model developed in this work this is also evident from the comparison of the model results for the variable density case and the measured values of the velocities shown in fig 18 as can be observed the hard sphere models led to increased errors with increasing floc size even in the case of variable density whereas the results of the present model show a very good agreement in the entire range of floc sizes it is not only important to have an accurate model for the calculation of the free settling velocities and hence an accurate prediction of the sludge floc trajectories the present model can also be used instead of the hard sphere models as a model for a more accurate specification of the interaction force between the phases in the two way coupling regime with implementation of the models eq 12 and eq 13 as the main contributions to the interaction force in the liquid phase 7 discussion the computational models developed in this work allow a direct implementation in the cfd with lagrangian model for tracking the dispersed phase particles sludge flocs through the flow field of the continuous liquid phase which is a relevant topic in sedimentation tanks design tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 al sammarraee et al 2009 the sludge floc trajectories are computed evaluating the kinematics relation 1 translational momentum relation 2 as well as angular momentum relation 3 which together with models 12 13 and 14 allow computation of trajectories for the case of porous permeable sludge flocs of nonspherical shape computing particle trajectories their rotational rates as well as the influence of fluid velocity gradients are important in cfd modelling of flocculation in water treatment plants bridgeman et al 2009 the advanced particle tracking model can also be used in assessing the residence time distribution rtd of the porous flocs in a sedimentation tank allowing us to obtain rtds for a wide range of the sludge floc parameters therefore for assessing rtds of the smaller particles that typically interact with the liquid phase in the dilute flow regime the developed lagrangian sludge floc model together with an les based flow simulation would be a method of choice as stated in karpinska and bridgeman 2016 the most critical issue in modelling of clarifiers is linked to the unpredictability of activated sludge settlability presenting a challenge for the cfd models as the sedimentation tanks are considered as a bottle neck limiting the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant and the cfd based design with its scale up capabilities is becoming more and more a method of choice for the designers one has to be careful in sedimentation modelling when using the standard particle models within the multiphase cfd codes within the classical solid sphere settling models a danger of overestimating the settling velocity of flocs when floc size independent density values are used can lead to computation of unrealistic floc trajectories and overestimation of settling effectiveness under chosen tank operating conditions the modelling strategy presented in this work can help improve the accuracy of particle fluid interaction models by considering the size dependent density particle shape as well as nonhomogeneous mass distribution and can therefore improve the engineering design of clarifiers by means of cfd the presented particle models are by no means applicable only to modelling of sludge floc sedimentation processes an interesting case arises in treatment of low strength wastewaters in expanded sludge bed reactors egsb where active biomass in the form of granules is used to reduce the polluting powers of wastewaters mchugh et al 2003 in such systems determination of settling characteristics of granules consisting of a permeable solid part as well as a gas phase pan et al 2016 which can also lead to nonhomogeneous mass distribution is cruical for design and operation especially for setting the higher superficial velocities required in an egsb reactor while still preventing the granule floatation chen et al 2010 another examples include floatation of sludge flocs in pressurised floatation tanks where the sludge flocs merge with micro bubbles from the oversatured wastewater to form particles with possible nonhomogeneous mass distribution and the problem of washout of floating sludge particles in aerobic granular sludge reactors due to degasification of nitrogen gas van dijk et al 2018 in the latter cases the simplified nonhomogeneous mass distribution model eqs 17 and 18 could easily be implemented additionally the presented model is by no means limited to nonhomogeneous porous particles it can also be applied in the case of transport of bottom heavy cells like algae that are affected by shear flow and viscous and gravitational torques croze et al 2013 one of the main limitations in practical use of the lagrangian models is in its computational cost as the particle dynamics is an ideally parallelizable computational step within a cfd framework with the wide availability of desktop multiprocessor computers the particle tracking algorithm can be run extremely efficiently in parallel especially when used with cpu gpu processing systems sweet et al 2018 with regard to the developed models in this work the computational cost would be roughly the same as with the standard hard sphere models if rotational dynamics would not be included and with rotational dynamics this would then include evaluating six additional algebraic expressions for advancing the solutions of the ordinary differential equations per each particle which is computationally not expensive 8 conclusions one of the critical parts in the design of the settling tank in waste water treatment is to prevent the sludge flocs from exiting the tank along with the clean liquid a detailed determination of parameters influencing the settling characteristics of sludge flocs is typically achieved from data analysis from the free settling experiments the results of such analysis can be used in a cfd based modelling of the fluid phase and the accompanying particle tracking of the sludge flocs within the fluid flow which can give a valuable insight into the performance of the settling tank in this respect the main findings are the settling characteristics of sludge flocs depend on sludge floc properties with the main influences the floc density hydraulic permeability and shape density and permeability values of the sludge floc depend on the size of the floc and should not be taken as constant values in computational procedures the velocity of a floc in a settling process depends also on flocs orientation a consequence of its nonspherical shape as well as nonhomogeneous mass distribution therefore rotational dynamics of the floc should be taken into account the derived lagrangian model is applicable both as the lagrangian particle solver in the cfd framework and in a simplified form as the computational model for the determination of sludge floc porosity and related hydrodynamic properties based on data from the free settling tests acknowledgement the authors thank the deutsche

18816,the paper reports on the development of an advanced lagrangian particle tracking model of sludge flocs that takes into account its nonspherical shape the internal porosity and permeability as well as the nonhomogenous mass distribution the floc shapes sizes and free settling velocities are determined based on the experimental measurement of settling sludge flocs originating from a wastewater treatment plant based on the floc shape characterization a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid is selected as the modelled sludge particle in order to determine the main particle characteristics e g the internal porosity the density and the flow permeability a lagrangian particle tracking model is developed based on brenner s drag model for a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid and a buoyancy force model for a porous particle the model is implemented for numerical simulations of the free settling process the obtained floc characteristics are presented in the form of a two part polynomial fitting curve which can be used to model floc characteristics the values of settling velocities of flocs computed by the model show very good agreement with experimental results futhermore as the internal structure of a floc is seldom uniform the nonhomogeneous mass distribution is considered influencing the rotational and translational motions of the settling flocs the nonhomogeneous mass distribution is introduced into the floc settling model the parametric analyses of different barycentre offsets and shear rates are performed and their influences on the free settling velocity are evaluated the presented modelling approach can also be applied to flocculent settling of alum and other flocs in drinking water treatment plants the developed lagrangian model is suitable for use as a point source within the framework of eulerian flow computations and is solved as a two phase flow model with a suitable computational fluid dynamics code graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge floc settling velocity prolate spheroidal floc non homogenous porous floc lagrangian particle tracking model 1 introduction in a wastewater treatment plant the final stage consists of the sedimentation process performed in a sedimentation tank droste and gehr 2019 due to the intense mixing in the aerobic phase of the plant operation the sludge flocs are predominantly well distributed within the volume of the liquid phase entering the sedimentation tank after entering the sedimentation starts in the settling zone where the process is characterised by the unhindered settling of the sludge flocs i e without interaction with other flocs in a dilute liquid particle flow regime the flocs then accumulate in the sludge zone where the sludge floc concentration increases and particle particle interactions start to influence the settling velocities of the flocs with intermediate and dense liquid particle flow regimes crowe et al 2011 in general the sludge flocs having a settling velocity larger than the critical particle are removed from the liquid entering the outlet zone of the sedimentation tank as the settling behaviour of the flocs is influenced by the floc s physical properties and its interaction with the liquid flow it is extremely important to determine these parameters correctly the sedimentation velocity of a floc is influenced significantly by its diameter and density as predicted by the stokes settling model but can also depend on the floc shape and porous internal structure as flocs are agglomerates of many primary particles vahedi and gorczyca 2014 the floc properties determine the magnitude of interaction forces with the liquid phase where the drag force and the buoyancy force are the most important contributions determination of the floc properties is frequently done by using a combined experimental and computational approach where the experiments provide information on the floc sizes and settling velocities in a free settling environment while computational models serve as the basis for calculation of hydrodynamic properties as well as the floc densities since the sludge particles are typically smaller than the smallest flow structures the point particle approximation can be used when developing computational sedimentation models crowe et al 2011 the majority of computational force models assume a spherical floc shape which thus hydrodynamically is also the most studied one the sphere models can be extended to nonspherical shapes by introducing a shape factor e g the sphericity of a particle hölzer and sommerfeld 2009 mando and rosendahl 2010 while such an approach is easy to implement and can lead to simple to use computational models for the point particle approximation zastawny et al 2012 it does not provide much improvement in terms of a more detailed particle fluid flow interaction model as the floc shape is a result of an agglomeration process in the active phase of the wastewater treatment its volume is composed of numerous smaller primary particles forming a larger porous volume consisting of primary particles and the fluid due to the porous structure the fluid can penetrate and the flow through the floc alters the floc hydrodynamic properties hsu and hsieh 2003 in order to establish a computationally lean model the porosity and the permeability of flocs are applied further in the floc forces and properties models furthermore a floc force model that takes into account more details of the floc shape can further improve the accuracy of sludge floc fluid flow interaction models the use of advanced computational techniques in the modelling of activated sludge systems is still one of the major challenges in the wastewater sector and the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd to model different stages in activated sludge systems is becoming one of the most advanced wastewater engineering tools karpinska and bridgeman 2016 the cfd tool must incorporate a multiphase flow model where the building blocks are either a eulerian or a lagrangian two phase flow model karpinska and bridgeman 2016 xu et al 2017 gao and stenstrom 2018 with regard to the secondary settling which is one of the most sensitive processes in activated sludge plants the lagrangian model is the most accurate option for numerical simulation of floc trajectories as the dimensions of a typical settling tank are very large and the corresponding computational grid for the cfd typically consists of elements much larger than the size of a sludge floc the point particle approximation in combination with the lagrangian particle tracking provides an accurate computational tool for studying such systems also detailed flow field computations by implementing the large eddy simulations les al sammarraee et al 2009 showed that the smaller particles typically below 250 μ m are the critical ones with the tendency to exit the system with the effluent a consequence of long sedimentation times influenced by the turbulent regions at the inflow and outflow of a sedimentation basin when dealing with nonspherical particles tracking the orientation of a nonspherical particle in a flow field is an important aspect of an accurate two phase flow computational model as it determines the orientation of the force vector acting on the particle gunes et al 2008 the orientation is influenced by the particle shape and porous structure masoud et al 2013 but could also be influenced by a nonhomogeneous mass distribution within the particle producing an additional gravitational torque acting on the particle croze et al 2013 in the case of sludge flocs since the floc agglomeration process is a stochastic one a nonhomogeneous mass distribution is likely to occur vahedi and gorczyca 2014 although the majority of cfd codes include such two phase models the particle force models available are only applicable to solid spheres in recent years a lot of research was devoted to the development and implementation of nonspherical particle two phase cfd models zhang et al 2001 mortensen et al 2008 soldati and marchioli 2009 liu et al 2009 marchioli et al 2010 where the ellipsoidal shape was used predominantly as a generic shape applicable to a wide range of practical two phase problems mando and rosendahl 2010 kleinstreuer and feng 2013 the lagrangian model in its simplified form is also the model of choice when determination of the floc properties based on experimental sedimentation studies is performed as reported in the experimental analysis of sludge floc sedimentation characteristics žajdela et al 2008 and the consequent determination of the floc properties based on the free settling model of porous and permeable sludge flocs lee et al 1996 hriberšek et al 2011 in order to account for the nonspherical floc shape and its porous internal structure that influences its hydraulic resistance in the flow field a dedicated lagrangian particle model for the sludge floc case could prove beneficial in increasing the accuracy of dispersed two phase flow cfd computational models especially if it would also be applicable as a computational framework for the derivation of sludge floc properties based on experimental sedimentation data the present work reports on the development of such a model the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the key sedimentation characteristics of sludge flocs followed by section 3 where the development of a lagrangian computational sedimentation model is elaborated based on the developed lagrangian model two computational algorithms are proposed the first one suitable for use as a computational tool for the determination of floc porosities and corresponding parameters and the second one for studying the effects of nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the sludge floc sedimentation dynamics section 5 reports on the results of the implementation of both computational algorithms which are based on available experimental data on 306 sludge flocs originating from a municipal wastewater plant in slovenia section 6 compares the performance of the developed models with several established hard sphere models to understand what and how much is improved by the present model by comparing it with other models 2 sedimentation characteristics of activated sludge flocs activated sludge flocs are formed as aggregates of suspended solids micro flocs and primary particles in wastewater and as such they are not solid bodies but exhibit an open porous internal structure allowing the fluid phase to flow through the floc although the complex internal structure of a floc presents a significant resistance to the fluid flow the flow through the floc alters the flow field in the wake effectively reducing the drag force this in turn allows the floc to reach higher settling velocities as in the case of solid particles of the same shape size and density the free settling test is used frequently for the determination of the porous particle density porosity and hydraulic permeability which is done through a simple force balance equation in žajdela et al 2008 a free settling model was designed based on the stokes model of sedimentation where the chien s model chien 1994 was used for the drag coefficient of irregularly shaped particles although the applied chien s drag model is easy to use with the only additional parameter being the particle sphericity ψ the model could be improved for the case of a sludge floc with more detailed particle shape cases in general settling velocities of porous sludge flocs are relatively low resulting in low particle reynolds number values this is especially true in the case of smaller porous flocs approx below 1 mm where particle reynolds number values are below 1 in such a case the stokes flow regime is valid and the stokes drag model could be applied for the case of 306 flocs žajdela et al 2008 originating from a primarily municipal wastewater plant experimental analysis of the settling velocities was carried out with the results of the settling velocities depicted in fig 1 from the same data presented in the form of the particle reynolds number values r e k ψ d k v k ν with d k the equivalent spherical diameter v k the settling velocity and ν the fluid kinematic viscosity in fig 2 it is evident that the vast majority of particles exhibited reynolds number values lower than 1 therefore the stokes drag model can be applied in the derivation of the floc sedimentation model a more realistic drag force model should also include the main geometric parameters of the floc shape whereas larger flocs have a typical fractal structure gorczyca and ganczarczyk 2002 the structure of the smaller flocs resembles more geometrically regular shapes in the works of žajdela et al 2008 and hriberšek et al 2011 geometric analysis of stationary flocs as well as settling flocs led to the conclusion that the sludge flocs could be described approximately as cuboids with two shorter axes of almost the same size for the cited case the sphericity defined as the ratio of a sphere surface area to the surface area of a floc with the same volume was determined to be 0 796 the cuboidal approximation could be improved further by considering the ellipsoidal shape of the studied porous flocs as shown in fig 3 originating from experiments of žajdela et al 2008 of the same volume the general shape of the smallest flocs could therefore be described as a prolate spheroid a schematic diagram of a prolate spheroidal particle or axisymmetric ellipsoidal particle with semi minor axis a and semi major axis b and thus with aspect ratio λ b a 1 and the associated reference frame used in the computational model are illustrated in fig 4 the observed axis ratio λ b a of the ellipsoids ranged between 1 29 and 1 47 for the sake of simplicity the average value of λ 1 38 was adopted in our case but the sensitivity of the results on the lower and upper limit values of the aspect ratio was also checked low settling velocities of sludge flocs resulting in low values of the stokes number defined as s t k ρ k v k d k 18 ρ f ν with ρ f the fluid density and in the range of 0 004 0 18 hriberšek et al 2011 also indicate that the velocity of such a particle would not differ much from the fluid flow velocity in a settling tank the flow field is governed by the inflow and outflow rates and positions or in the case of a closed system from buoyancy driven currents and although flow velocities in these systems are low and settling is facilitated the particles still interact with the local fluid flow therefore accurate prediction of floc trajectories could be very beneficial when designing the sedimentation process in a settling tank 3 computational model of ellipsoidal porous floc sedimentation in general the trajectory of a particle is the result of its interaction with the fluid flow local values of velocity vorticity and pressure in the fluid phase and their difference to the state of the particle determine the transport phenomena between the dispersed and the fluid phases when the exact particle trajectories are of major importance as is the case in sedimentation analysis particle transport in the framework of cfd is computed by applying lagrangian based particle tracking in the following the computational model of sedimentation is derived based on the stokes drag model for an axisymmetric ellipsoid case i e prolate spheroidal porous flocs taking into account the translational as well as rotational dynamics of the floc as the floc is ellipsoidal its orientation regarding the flow velocity is important for the accurate computation of the hydrodynamic force a case that is not important when dealing with the spherical approximation of the floc shape the sedimentation model used for the calculation of the porous floc properties can be derived from the general model of lagrangian particle tracking which consists of the translational kinematics relation 1 d r d t v the translational momentum conservation equation 2 m p d v d t f d f g and the angular momentum conservation equation 3 d d t i p ω i p d ω d t ω i p ω t where m p is the mass of the particle r v ω i p are the barycentre position vector the translational velocity the angular velocity and the inertia tensor respectively of the particle and f d f g t are the drag force the gravity force reduced by buoyancy and the applied torque respectively acting on the particle the angular kinematics relation is accounted for by the time evolution of the euler parameters cui et al 2018a b in order to close the system of equations models for forces and torques acting on a porous floc have to be specified 3 1 drag and buoyancy models for prolate spheroidal porous flocs dedicated models of forces have to be selected in order to account for the prolate spheroidal floc shape brenner 1964 derived the hydrodynamic drag force acting on an axisymmetric ellipsoidal particle with semi minor axis a in the stokes flow regime 4 f d π a ρ f ν k u v where u v f d k are the corresponding coefficient matrices of the fluid velocity u the floc velocity v the drag force acting on the floc f d and the geometric resistance tensor k of the floc respectively only the diagonal components of the coefficient matrix of the resistance tensor in the particle frame of reference x y z i e k are non zero these are functions of the floc aspect ratio λ and can be written as 5 k x x k y y 16 λ 2 1 3 2 2 λ 2 3 ln λ λ 2 1 λ λ 2 1 6 k z z 8 λ 2 1 3 2 2 λ 2 1 ln λ λ 2 1 λ λ 2 1 the spherical particle limit renders lim λ 1 k 6 i where i is the identity matrix in order to build the relationship between k and k the rotation matrix v between the inertia and the particle frame of reference is used 7 k v t k v the rotation matrix is written in terms of the euler parameters and can be found in cui et al 2018a in order to account for the porosity of the floc the ratio of the hydrodynamic drag between a permeable and an impermeable flocs i e ω is introduced by using the brinkman extension of darcy s law huang 1993 with ω defined as 8 ω 2 β 2 1 tanh β β 2 β 2 3 1 tanh β β with the permeability factor 9 β d k 2 k and the hydraulic permeability of the floc accounted for by the brinkman model 10 k d p 72 3 4 1 ε 3 8 1 ε 3 where ε and d p are the porosity of the floc and the primary particle diameter the density of the floc ρ k is related to the density of primary particles ρ p constituting the floc and the density of the fluid ρ f by the relation 11 ρ k 1 ε ρ p ρ f ρ f the values of ρ p 1059 k g m 3 and ρ f 998 k g m 3 are used in the present study hriberšek et al 2011 the final form of the drag model for the prolate spheroidal porous floc is 12 f d π a ρ f ν ω k u v and the gravity force reduced by buoyancy is 13 f g g v p 1 ε ρ p ρ f where v p 4 π λ a 3 3 is the volume of the prolate spheroid f g and g are the corresponding coefficient matrices of the gravity force reduced by buoyancy f g and the gravity acceleration g respectively 3 2 sedimentation of a floc with nonhomogeneous density distribution during the floc agglomeration process a variety of primary particles having different sizes and also different densities aggregate into flocculi micro flocs and finally floc aggregates leading to nonhomogeneous mass distribution vahedi and gorczyca 2014 the nonhomogeneous mass distribution gives rise to gravitational torque acting on the particle that additionally influences the floc rotational dynamics and hence its orientation regarding the flow direction in the following the computational framework is described by taking into account the nonhomogenous mass distribution the applied torques acting on a prolate spheroidal porous floc eq 3 can be decomposed into the gravitational torque t g and jeffery s torque t j jeffery 1922 i e 14 t t g t j in order to calculate the inertia tensor and the gravitational torque a separate computational analysis is needed in the case of a general density distribution within the particle volume this analysis could be interpreted as a particle pre processor which needs to be applied before the sedimentation analysis is performed giving as a result the barycentre location and the inertia tensor of the particle in the analysis the floc is decomposed into many cubic grid cells where within a grid cell the density is assumed to be homogeneous therefore the inertia tensor can be calculated by summing up the local inertia tensors for all grid cells i e 15 i p i 1 n m i y i 2 z i 2 x i y i x i z i x i y i z i 2 x i 2 y i z i x i z i y i z i x i 2 y i 2 where n is the total number of grid cells m i is the mass of each grid cell x i y i z i are the coordinates of the centre of the i t h grid cell in the particle frame of reference and i p is the coefficient matrix of the inertia tensor of the particle in the particle frame of reference in the case of a general density distribution within the floc the floc volume must be discretised by a suitable number of grid cells with variable local mass values leading to 16 b c i 1 n m i x i y i z i t i 1 n m i where b c is the coefficient column matrix of the barycentre b c in the particle frame of reference since the calculation of particle inertia tensor and barycentre position is only performed at the beginning of the simulation it could be separated from the actual execution of computational steps of the proposed algorithms in such a case even at a high number of elements used for discretising the particle interior it would not present a considerable computational expense as these two parameters eq 15 16 are calculated only once in the present study we use a simplied slug floc formulation i e a small heavy sphere sits inside a large light prolate spheroid as depicted in fig 5 in order to analyse the influence of nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the settling characteristics in this simplied case the analytical solution to calculate the barycenter is 17 b c 1 1 λ a 3 r i n 3 ρ i n ρ o u t 1 p o s i n o u t where r i n and ρ i n are the radius and the density of the inner spherical particle ρ o u t is the density of the outer prolate spheroid and p o s i n o u t is the corresponding coefficient column matrix of the position vector of the inner spherical particle with respect to the geometric centre of the outer prolate spheroid at the particle frame of reference similarly the coefficient matrix of the inertia tensor in the particle frame of reference reads as 18 i p 1 5 m o u t a 2 1 λ 2 2 5 m i n r i n 2 0 0 0 1 5 m o u t a 2 1 λ 2 2 5 m i n r i n 2 0 0 0 2 5 m o u t a 2 2 5 m i n r i n 2 m i n p o s i n o u t p o s i n o u t t with m i n 4 π r i n 3 ρ i n ρ o u t 3 and m o u t 4 π λ a 3 ρ o u t 3 finally the gravitational torque with regard to the origin of the particle frame of reference can be expressed as 19 t g b c f g since the jeffery torque is defined in the particle frame of reference jeffery 1922 cui et al 2018a it is necessary to transform the coefficient column matrix of the gravity force reduced by the buoyancy from the inertia frame of reference to the particle frame of reference by using the rotation matrix v 20 f g v f g where f g and f g are the coefficient column matrices of the gravity force reduced by the buoyancy in the inertia frame of reference and in the particle frame of reference respectively 4 computational algorithms for the determination of sludge floc characteristics algorithm 1 summarizes the computational steps needed for the determination of the unknown floc parameters ε ρ k k and ω as the latter three all depend on the porosity value we are basically dealing with a nonlinear system of equations for the unknown porosity of the floc which can be solved by using an iterative method in our case derivation of the sludge floc porosity is based on the known free settling velocities of flocs of different sizes see fig 1 as well as on the pre defined floc orientation which is the orientation of the maximum drag force where the floc has its major axis b pointing in the z direction i e perpendicular to the settling velocity direction this orientation is chosen according to findings of feng et al 1994 and ardekani et al 2016 who showed that a spheroidal particle eventually falls with its major axis perpendicular to the gravity direction independent of its initial orientation algorithm 1 1 set eq 2 for the case of terminal velocity d

parameters ε ρ k k and ω algorithm 1 is directly applicable to flocs with homogeneous mass distribution which is also the assumption used in the free settling experiment of hriberšek et al 2011 in order to determine the impact of the nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the floc settling characteristics additional computational cases were performed with nonhomogeneous mass distribution to simplify the mass distribution description a model with two homogeneous zones of different densities was set up the smaller inner zone has a higher density than the surrounding larger zone as shown in fig 5 the inner zone locates in the z axis of the ellipsoid the distance between the inner zone centre and the ellipsoid centre is 0 2 b the inner zone radius is half of the ellipsoid short radius i e 0 5 a if the density ratio ρ i n ρ o u t 1 the floc has a homogeneous density distribution if ρ i n ρ o u t 1 the floc has a nonhomogeneous density distribution it is important to note that in the latter case the overall mass of the floc remains unchanged with regard to the homogeneous mass distribution case different barycentre locations of the particle can be produced by varying the density ratio for the case of the particle in fig 5 the position vector of the inner spherical particle at the particle frame of reference is p o s i n o u t 0 0 0 2 b t and the r i n 0 5 a as mentioned above the floc porosity values were adopted from the computational results of algorithm 1 the algorithm 2 was designed in order to establish the sensitivity of the settling characteristics of a floc with nonhomogeneous mass distribution the main aim of the algorithm 2 is to compute the time evolution of the positions and translational and rotational velocities of the prolate spheroidal porous floc which would then serve as a basis for comparison with the sedimentation characteristics of homogeneous flocs algorithm 2 1 set the floc properties d k λ ε ω ρ i n ρ o u t and the offset distance 2

conservation eq 3 and angular kinematics relation cui et al 2018a 7 update the particle velocity angular velocity position and angular position 8 end if the target time was reached 9 add additional time step and perform another iteration go to step 6 5 simulation results 5 1 sedimentation characteristics of a floc with homogeneous density distribution in the first part of this section the computed porous floc porosities obtained by applying algorithm 1 on all of the 306 flocs are depicted in fig 6 for easier viewing two thirds of data points in figs 6 9 were removed from the plots from the results it is evident that the porosity varies in the range of 0 6 for the smallest flocs to 0 96 for the largest flocs in order to gain additional insights and a comparison with the results of the previous study hriberšek et al 2011 the calculated floc porosities are also presented as a function of the particle reynolds number as in the present case the particles are porous flocs with ellipsoidal shape the following form of the particle reynolds number denoted by r e m is used 21 r e m d k ε 3 v k ω ν from the relation between the porosity and r e m as shown in fig 7 it is evident that the vast majority of flocs have r e m values well below 1 and the maximum values do not exceed 3 this indicates that the applied drag force model of brenner 1964 see eq 12 which is based on the same assumptions as the stokes drag is valid for the considered case when comparing the present results with the results of hriberšek et al 2011 as shown in figs 6 and 7 the results indicate qualitatively a good agreement between both studies however the present results show an increase in the computed porosity values which is more evident around 7 in the lower r e m range than in the upper r e m range around 1 this also leads to higher values of computed permeabilities as can be concluded from fig 8 although the permeability still remains roughly in the same order of magnitude which is comparable to studies of other authors lee et al 1996 chu et al 2005 the calculated values of hydraulic permeabilities and the corresponding values of the parameter ω see fig 9 indicate the fact that the fluid flow through the floc is very weak and hence the overall drag force on a floc does not differ much from the non porous case nevertheless when numerically tracking a particle floc in a flow field for a long computational time small differences can alter the computed trajectories significantly also the obtained data on floc porosities are important as the flocs do not only exchange momentum with the fluid but also exchange mass due to biological reactions where the internal surface area of a floc which correlates with the value of the porosity plays a major role in order to build a model that could be used in the cfd context a polynomial data fitting of results was performed derived under the assumption of a homogeneous density distribution for all particles as is evident from the results in fig 6 there are two distinct dependencies of ε d k one for the larger floc equivalent diameters and the other for the smaller equivalent floc diameters therefore a two part polynomial fitting was derived based on the form 22 ε d k c 0 c 1 d k c 2 d k 2 c 3 d k 3 c 4 d k 4 c 5 d k 5 c 6 d k 6 for the range of d k 1 m m a polynomial of the 6th order and for the range of d k 1 m m a polynomial of the 2nd order were fitted with corresponding values of coefficients for all the cases listed in appendix table 2 as the application of the algorithm 1 was based on the assumption of a fixed ellipsoidal semi axis ratio λ a sensitivity study was performed of the results regarding the change of λ here the lower and upper limits of the established experimental data on the floc dimensions were used namely λ 1 3 and λ 1 5 evidently as shown in fig 10 the computed values of porosities for different aspect ratios of ellipsoidal flocs show that the change in the aspect ratio does not lead to different values of porosities at least not for the targeted range of aspect ratios finally as in the derivation of the sludge floc porosity the orientation of a floc was with its major axis b pointing in the z direction i e perpendicular to the settling velocity direction which is the stable floc orientation with maximum flow resistance the effect of the other significant orientation with the long axis pointing in the direction of the gravity on the sedimentation velocity was studied with results depicted in fig 11 although in all the considered floc cases i e 306 flocs each floc had its own distinct porosity value the ratios of the computed sedimentation velocities for the two distinct orientation cases are in a very narrow range between 1 064 and 1 068 the difference of approx 6 in sedimentation velocity between different orientations for the selected model floc with λ 1 38 can be due to the very long retention times of several hours in a sedimentation tank leading to a larger difference in computational results for particle trajectories with respect to spherical porous particles and hence to differences in results of calculated separation efficiency of a secondary clarifier 5 2 sedimentation characteristics of a floc with nonhomogeneous density distribution nonhomogeneous mass distribution is an inherent result of the floc forming process vahedi and gorczyca 2014 and a closer look at the different intensities of the grey areas in the porous flocs in fig 3 confirms this fact as the floc images of fig 3 were taken using an axiocam mrc d high resolution microscopic camera offering a good spatial resolution in the experimental sedimentation study of hriberšek et al 2011 a nikon hi sence camera was used with a much lower resolution it allowed estimation of the basic floc shapes but from these results one could not obtain the data that could facilitate detailed information on the mass nonhomogeneity of each sedimenting floc nevertheless in order to validate the effect of nonhomogeneous mass distribution on the sedimentation behaviour of a floc based on available floc images a simplified model of the floc nonhomogeneous mass distribution was given as depicted in fig 5 the modelled floc consists of a dense spherical zone ρ i n and a sparse zone ρ o u t of the remaining part of the floc the distance between the centre of the dense zone and the floc geometrical centre i e offset as well as the density ratio between the dense and the sparse zones are now the parameters which have influence on the sedimentation characteristics as reported in this section with the known local mass distribution within the floc the corresponding barycentre offset and inertia tensor could be calculated easily using eqs 15 and 16 however this distribution is very difficult to determine experimentally therefore the following approximation was applied as the floc formation is a stochastic process one cannot expect that the barycentre offset should be very large and only an estimation of this value could be made at this stage of the research the position of the denser zone was therefore shifted from the centre of the ellipsoid in the z by the distance of 20 of the longer half axis which resulted in an additional action of the gravitational torque that would otherwise not act on the particle with this set up the study of the additional gravitational torque on the particle translational and rotational dynamics could be made as a modelled floc a floc was selected with d k 0 29 m m and the corresponding settling velocity of v k 0 58 m m s the calculated porosity of the modelled floc is uniform and has a value of ε 0 7843 if not reported otherwise the default offset is 0 2 b the application of the particle preprocessor described in section 3 2 gives data on the inertia tensor and on the position of the barycentre of the floc which is shown in fig 12 in all simulations the floc was initially at rest with its major axis b pointing in the z direction as shown in fig 5 in figs 13 and 14 the effect is presented of different density ratios on the free settling behaviour of the floc as can be observed from fig 13 the shift in the barycentre and the additional gravitational torque gives rise to the floc rotation which is stronger with increasing density ratio the rotation changes the orientation of the floc and hence the drag force the floc tends to align its long axis with the direction of the settling velocity whereby the gravitational torque damps to zero at this orientation angle the frontal area of the floc is the minimum leading to an increase of the free settling velocity see fig 14 which has the same value for both nonhomogeneous test cases in all free settling tests the fluid is considered at rest condition which may violate experimental conditions e g dosing of particles buoyancy driven natural circulation also flocs that interact with the fluid flow are always exposed to locally varying fluid shear rates giving rise to additional torque on the floc i e the jeffery torque t j jeffery 1922 in order to study the influence of the local shear rate on the floc dynamics different linear shear rates g u x z are applied resulting in different values of the shear reynolds number r e g d k 2 g ν shear rate values used in the numerical examples are typical for the sedimentation tank see velocity profiles in tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 and range from 0 0012 s 1 to 0 006 s 1 in figs 15 and 16 the effect of different shear rates on the free settling behaviour of the floc with ρ i n ρ o u t 1 05 is presented the action of jeffery s torque as a consequence of the shear rate leads to much stronger interaction between the floc and the fluid cui et al 2018a 2019 the shear rate forces the floc to rotate constantly in a clockwise direction around the y axis while the gravitational torque acts in the clockwise or counterclockwise directions around the y axis depending on the signum of the cross product between the position vector of the barycentre and the direction of the gravity vector the end effect is either almost equilibrium of both torques case of r e g 0 0001 or a larger difference of both torques producing stronger oscillations in the rotation rate case of r e g 0 0005 in the case of r e g 0 0005 the free settling velocity condition is never met and the tumbling motion is induced 6 comparison of the developed models with hard sphere models although sludge flocs are clearly porous objects the hard sphere models are currently used predominantly in computational studies of sedimentation the case of the dispersed solid phase in the form of sludge flocs is often treated as a pseudo solid phase whose influence on the fluid flow is accounted for by introduction of the sludge viscosity as well as additional interaction forces between the liquid and solid phases on the other hand lagrangian particle tracking was applied in the cfd study of the sedimentation tank performance goula et al 2008 where the particle structure effect was accounted for by the ratio of the resistance experienced by a floc to that of an equivalent solid sphere set to 0 9 and setting the apparent density at 1066 kg m3 regardless of the particle size in spelman and sansalone 2017 a hard sphere based unsteady cfd simulation with lagrangian particle tracking was used for computing particle sequestration with interesting results that the simulation results showed consistently an over prediction of particles sequestration compared with measured results since a hydrated sludge floc is essentially a gelatinous coagulated material lei and ni 2014 its hydrodynamic properties that govern interaction with the liquid phase are different than that of a solid sphere which is a standard representation of a sludge floc using hard sphere models that are available in all vendor cfd codes inevitably leads to modelling errors especially if the density of flocs of various sizes are set as a constant value as an example in table 1 a root mean square deviation rmsd and its normalised form nrmsd are presented produced by implementing the different models for calculation of the free settling velocity for the flocs from our experiment selected models include the model of morsi and alexander 1972 and clift et al 1978 which are a standard quadratic hard sphere model with reynolds number dependent drag coefficient effectively linking the linear drag dependence with quadratic drag dependence region the model used in goula et al 2008 builds on the cfd code fluent based stokes particle drag model by applying a fixed value of the ratio of the resistance experienced by a floc to that of an equivalent solid sphere set at 0 9 the model of chien 1994 is another example of a hard sphere model which additionally takes into account the sphericity of the floc in order to amplify the need to take into account the variation of the density values of a floc with regard to its size two additional calculations were performed the first with a fixed floc density value of 1066 kg m3 and the second with the floc density value calculated by eq 11 by using the porosity values of eq 22 results depicted in fig 17 from the results it is evident that using a constant value of floc density leads to large errors in calculating free settling velocity especially for larger values of floc diameters if such parameters are used in combination with standard cfd drag models in the cfd simulation to compute sludge floc trajectories there is a danger of overestimating the separation efficiency of a tested clarifier design when the size dependent porosity value and consequently the density value of the floc are used the results are significantly better nevertheless if floc permeability and shape are not taken into account hard sphere models the rmsd and nrmsd are still significantly larger compared with the results obtained by using the model developed in this work this is also evident from the comparison of the model results for the variable density case and the measured values of the velocities shown in fig 18 as can be observed the hard sphere models led to increased errors with increasing floc size even in the case of variable density whereas the results of the present model show a very good agreement in the entire range of floc sizes it is not only important to have an accurate model for the calculation of the free settling velocities and hence an accurate prediction of the sludge floc trajectories the present model can also be used instead of the hard sphere models as a model for a more accurate specification of the interaction force between the phases in the two way coupling regime with implementation of the models eq 12 and eq 13 as the main contributions to the interaction force in the liquid phase 7 discussion the computational models developed in this work allow a direct implementation in the cfd with lagrangian model for tracking the dispersed phase particles sludge flocs through the flow field of the continuous liquid phase which is a relevant topic in sedimentation tanks design tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 al sammarraee et al 2009 the sludge floc trajectories are computed evaluating the kinematics relation 1 translational momentum relation 2 as well as angular momentum relation 3 which together with models 12 13 and 14 allow computation of trajectories for the case of porous permeable sludge flocs of nonspherical shape computing particle trajectories their rotational rates as well as the influence of fluid velocity gradients are important in cfd modelling of flocculation in water treatment plants bridgeman et al 2009 the advanced particle tracking model can also be used in assessing the residence time distribution rtd of the porous flocs in a sedimentation tank allowing us to obtain rtds for a wide range of the sludge floc parameters therefore for assessing rtds of the smaller particles that typically interact with the liquid phase in the dilute flow regime the developed lagrangian sludge floc model together with an les based flow simulation would be a method of choice as stated in karpinska and bridgeman 2016 the most critical issue in modelling of clarifiers is linked to the unpredictability of activated sludge settlability presenting a challenge for the cfd models as the sedimentation tanks are considered as a bottle neck limiting the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant and the cfd based design with its scale up capabilities is becoming more and more a method of choice for the designers one has to be careful in sedimentation modelling when using the standard particle models within the multiphase cfd codes within the classical solid sphere settling models a danger of overestimating the settling velocity of flocs when floc size independent density values are used can lead to computation of unrealistic floc trajectories and overestimation of settling effectiveness under chosen tank operating conditions the modelling strategy presented in this work can help improve the accuracy of particle fluid interaction models by considering the size dependent density particle shape as well as nonhomogeneous mass distribution and can therefore improve the engineering design of clarifiers by means of cfd the presented particle models are by no means applicable only to modelling of sludge floc sedimentation processes an interesting case arises in treatment of low strength wastewaters in expanded sludge bed reactors egsb where active biomass in the form of granules is used to reduce the polluting powers of wastewaters mchugh et al 2003 in such systems determination of settling characteristics of granules consisting of a permeable solid part as well as a gas phase pan et al 2016 which can also lead to nonhomogeneous mass distribution is cruical for design and operation especially for setting the higher superficial velocities required in an egsb reactor while still preventing the granule floatation chen et al 2010 another examples include floatation of sludge flocs in pressurised floatation tanks where the sludge flocs merge with micro bubbles from the oversatured wastewater to form particles with possible nonhomogeneous mass distribution and the problem of washout of floating sludge particles in aerobic granular sludge reactors due to degasification of nitrogen gas van dijk et al 2018 in the latter cases the simplified nonhomogeneous mass distribution model eqs 17 and 18 could easily be implemented additionally the presented model is by no means limited to nonhomogeneous porous particles it can also be applied in the case of transport of bottom heavy cells like algae that are affected by shear flow and viscous and gravitational torques croze et al 2013 one of the main limitations in practical use of the lagrangian models is in its computational cost as the particle dynamics is an ideally parallelizable computational step within a cfd framework with the wide availability of desktop multiprocessor computers the particle tracking algorithm can be run extremely efficiently in parallel especially when used with cpu gpu processing systems sweet et al 2018 with regard to the developed models in this work the computational cost would be roughly the same as with the standard hard sphere models if rotational dynamics would not be included and with rotational dynamics this would then include evaluating six additional algebraic expressions for advancing the solutions of the ordinary differential equations per each particle which is computationally not expensive 8 conclusions one of the critical parts in the design of the settling tank in waste water treatment is to prevent the sludge flocs from exiting the tank along with the clean liquid a detailed determination of parameters influencing the settling characteristics of sludge flocs is typically achieved from data analysis from the free settling experiments the results of such analysis can be used in a cfd based modelling of the fluid phase and the accompanying particle tracking of the sludge flocs within the fluid flow which can give a valuable insight into the performance of the settling tank in this respect the main findings are the settling characteristics of sludge flocs depend on sludge floc properties with the main influences the floc density hydraulic permeability and shape density and permeability values of the sludge floc depend on the size of the floc and should not be taken as constant values in computational procedures the velocity of a floc in a settling process depends also on flocs orientation a consequence of its nonspherical shape as well as nonhomogeneous mass distribution therefore rotational dynamics of the floc should be taken into account the derived lagrangian model is applicable both as the lagrangian particle solver in the cfd framework and in a simplified form as the computational model for the determination of sludge floc porosity and related hydrodynamic properties based on data from the free settling tests acknowledgement the authors thank the deutsche

18817,high concentration of cu2 in swine wastewater raises concerns about its potential adverse effects on nutrient removal by aquatic plants like duckweed in this work the effects of copper ions on nutrient removal and release of dissolved organic matter dom were investigated in duckweed systems results showed that the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp increased at 0 1 1 0 mg l of cu2 while dropped at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 a novel kinetic model in which cu2 was taken into account was then developed which was used to optimize cu2 concentration at 0 96 mg l for nutrient removal in duckweed systems nadh detected in dom by the parallel factor parafac analysis exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions so it played an important role on the decrease of cu2 concentrations in duckweed systems the principle component analysis pca showed that the dominant dom were lower molecular weight compounds at 1 0 mg l of cu2 and higher molecular weight compounds at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 the bonds of ch humic like no no3 and arh tyrosine in dom were responsible for not only the fastest binding with cu2 from the result of the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir cos but also the variations of dom conformations at a critical concentration of 0 5 mg l cu2 from the perturbation correlation moving window two dimensional pcmw2d analysis these findings lead to a better understanding on the environmental behaviors and mechanisms of cu2 in duckweed systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords copper dissolved organic matter duckweed nutrient swine wastewater 1 introduction heavy metals including copper and zinc in swine wastewater have been paid close attention due to their potential to inhibit the growth of various aquatic plants and microorganisms du et al 2018 tandon et al 2013 and pose severe challenges to traditional treatment processes including microbiological treatment and phytoremediation for swine wastewater therefore various methods and processes have been proposed and been reported to address this pollution wang and chen 2009 wen et al 2016 duckweed used in phytoremediation for swine wastewater treatment has shown high potential for removing nutrients maximizing biomass yield and easily harvesting cheng and stomp 2009 li et al 2017 it was reported that the major pathways for nutrient removal were through duckweed uptake and nitrification denitrification by bacteria in a duckweed pond luo et al 2016 pant and adholeya 2009 xu and shen 2011 although trace of certain heavy metals such as copper is essential for living cell functions it would be deleterious to many organisms via the destruction of anti oxidative defense system when its concentration is high chen et al 2015a obermeier et al 2015 wu et al 2017 consequently high metal loads could inhibit the duckweed growth thereby reduce the capacity of nutrient removal by duckweed and even cause the complete failure of nutrient removal in phytoremediation li et al 2018 for instance the removal rate of nh3 n decreased from 85 to 25 when the zn2 concentration increased from 0 to 15 mg l in swine wastewater zhou et al 2018 several mathematic models were developed to take into account of the influence of heavy metals on nutrient removal from wastewater treatment which include the first order model vermaat and hanif 1998 michaelis menten model vermaat and hanif 1998 and logistic model zhang et al 2014 in these models the removal rate represented the comprehensive effects of a series of biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature photoperiod and phosphorus nitrogen concentrations chen et al 2018 cheng et al 2016 however these models are still not sufficient because they can only indirectly reflect the real effect of heavy metals via the decrease or increase of removal rate yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 to our knowledge few kinetic models incorporating the concentration of heavy metals were available for the description of the influence of heavy metals on duckweed systems thus more investigations are needed to develop better mathematical models in which heavy metal concentration can be taken into account to alleviate the stress of heavy metals on nutrient uptake aquatic plants can produce various antioxidants through the anti oxidative defense system cakmak 2010 dissolved organic matter dom naturally occurring antioxidant is a heterogeneous mixture derived from metabolic excretion or autolysis of cells in aquatic plants and rhizosphere microorganisms senga et al 2018 dom fractions may contain labile low molecular weight lmw substances and more stable high molecular weight hmw substances rengel 2002 lmw materials refer to carbohydrates small proteins peptides organic acids oa amino acids vitamins hormones etc rengel 2002 hmw compounds mainly contain humics mucilage polysaccharides secretory proteins and ectoenzymes matthias et al 2007 so there are abundant organic functional groups e g amide carboxyl phenol and hydroxyl with high active sites in dom and these functional groups can efficiently combine heavy metals via chelation or complexation peng et al 2018 for example lmw oa concentration in root exudates was positively correlated with the amount of cd accumulated in millet roots chiang et al 2011 it implied that dom could reduce the concentration of heavy metals so the toxicity of heavy metals to aquatic systems could be relieved however the interaction mechanisms between dom and heavy metals are still not clear in duckweed systems the interactions of heavy metal ions with dom can be revealed as the change on composition and structure of dom the composition of dom could be detected by the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy combined with parallel factor parafac analysis which can reduce the interferences due to overlapping fluorophores among various compounds and determine the individual fluorescent components in dom yamashita and jaffe 2008 however the effect of the interactions between heavy metals and dom on change of fluorescent components remains unclear for example the relation between each fluorescent component and each heavy metal concentration yamashita and jaffe 2008 principal components analysis pca has become an efficient statistical tool on the identification of differences and similarities between components and external factors in a data set by analyzing the loading plots and score plots abdulla et al 2013 in activated sludge process the joint application of pca and eem parafac can provide overall assessment on the modifications of dissolved organic nitrogen don components at different solids retention time hu et al 2018 while the joint application of pca and eem parafac used in duckweed systems has not been reported in addition the variation of the molecular structure in dom also needs further investigation fortunately the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir cos has the potential to provide a comprehensive insight into the features of functional groups on dom which included fluorescent and non fluorescent components under the heavy metal perturbation lumsdon and fraser 2005 the binding sites and binding orders of dom to heavy metals can be probed by the synchronous and asynchronous spectra of 2d ftir cos abdulla et al 2010 furtherly perturbation correlation moving window two dimensional pcmw2d proposed recently based on 2d ftir cos has become a powerful tool to explore the conformational variation of dom with perturbation e g temperature concentration etc morita et al 2006 in pcmw2d analysis the perturbation induced spectral transition points can be obtained from the correlation intensity along the perturbation variables direction noda 2014 however few studies have been reported to use the above combined techniques to analyze the variation on composition and molecular structure of dom affected by various concentrations of cu2 therefore in depth examination on the mechanisms of the interactions between heavy metals and duckweed on nutrient removal and dom release is necessary which would provide valuable information on the optimum condition and maximum capacity of phytoremediation technology in swine wastewater contaminated by heavy metals and the microcosmic transport of heavy metals in natural and engineered environments in this work we have developed a comprehensive mathematical kinetic model in which cu2 concentration was taking into account to describe the effect of cu2 on nutrient removal in duckweed systems for swine wastewater treatment in addition the joint application of eem parafac pca 2d ftir cos and pcmw2d was proposed to better understand the mechanisms of the interactions between dom to copper ions at the molecular scale which include dom compositions binding sites binding orders and dom conformations the objective of this research is to elucidate the influence mechanisms of cu2 on nutrient removal by duckweed via the novel kinetic model and explore cu dom interactions by using the 3d fluorescence maps and 2d ftir cos technologies in duckweed systems it is expected to lead to a better understanding of the transport and fate of cu and providing an improved approach to design and manage duckweed systems for the treatment of swine wastewater contaminated by heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedure the initial media was prepared as synthetic swine wastewater and its ionic concentrations were listed in table s1 for the batch tests according to our previous works different volumes cuso4 5h2o solution was added into the initial media to simulate different cu2 concentrations 0 1 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l and the initial synthetic wastewater did not have a fluorescence signature through the measurement of fluorescence eem fig s6 the ph value of media was adjusted at 6 30 0 40 by using 0 10 mol l hcl solution then the initial media was sterilized in an autoclave for 30 min at 121 c before duckweed was added into the media eighty four beakers 500 ml 6 4 cm 6 4 cm 12 5 cm including 2 7 control beakers without extra copper ions and 2 5 7 duplicate sample beakers with extra copper ions were used in five batch tests each beaker contained 140 ml 3 4 cm deep in the beaker of media and it was initially seeded with the same amount 0 4 0 1 g fresh weight of duckweed to cover the 80 surface area of 6 4 cm 6 4 cm prior to culture initiation the duckweed had been pre cultured in our previous works zhou et al 2018 and then the healthy duckweed was selected and cleaned by distilled water all beakers were placed into a light growth chamber with 16 h photoperiod at 25 c and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 70 10 μmol m 2 s 1 provided by wide spectrum fluorescent tubes due to the decrease of ph as the duckweed grew 0 10 mol l naoh solution was added to maintain the ph around 6 30 0 40 destructive sampling was used to monitor the nutrient level dom concentrations and duckweed growth by taking a whole beaker as a sample for analysis duplicate samples and control samples were collected and analyzed every 4 8 days for 38 days 2 2 spectral determination and analysis in this study dom was designated as dissolved organic carbon doc passing through a 0 45 μm membrane filter its concentration was measured by a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan fig s5 before the measurement of eem spectra the doc concentrations of all of the samples were diluted 10 mg l and thereby the samples have an absorbance at λ 254 nm abs254 0 2 to minimize inner filter effects during fluorescence analysis poulin et al 2014 see details in the supporting information fig s7 dom fluorescent components were analyzed by 3d fluorescence maps which were measured by using a f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 150w xenon lamp hitachi japan scanning emission em spectra from 200 to 600 nm were obtained in 2 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 200 to 500 nm in 10 nm increments at room temperature the eem spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 12000 nm min and the slit widths of both the excitation and emission were set as 10 nm and the parafac analysis was presented in the supporting information for collecting fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis the solid state dom was extracted by a freeze drier biobase china from water samples and then the mixtures of 1 0 mg freeze dried dom sample and 100 mg potassium bromide kbr ir grade were ground and homogenized to reduce light scatter and then compressed to form a disk under 15 mpa for 2 min finally the disk were measured to obtain ftir spectra by using an ir affinity 1 spectrometer shimadzu japan at a resolution of 4 cm 1 with 20 scans over 4000 400 cm 1 at room temperature and the two dimensional correlation analysis was presented in the supporting information 2 3 wastewater analysis duckweed was harvested from each beaker by using a strainer with 0 5 mm pore size then the fresh weight of duckweed was measured using a balance immediately after the duckweed harvested was placed on paper towels for 5 min fig s2 after duckweed harvested the wastewater were analyzed for nh3 n tp cu nh3 n was determined by the nessler s reagent colorimetric method and tp was used in the potassium persulfate digestion colorimetric method according to the standard methods epa of china 2002 the cu2 concentration was measured by an atomic absorption spectrometer aas agilent 3510 usa 2 4 statistical analysis the results calculated were expressed as mean se standard error of three replicates in water and duckweed samples for each treatment one way anova was performed to compare all data statistical analyses were conducted using spss 17 0 spss chicago il usa with significance level p 0 05 obtained models followed by tukey s hsd tests were used to identify any significant differences between treatments pca was performed by using the paleontological statistics software past version 3 0 which based on the data of the maximum fluorescence intensity from parafac results 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nutrient removal by duckweed at various cu2 concentrations in this study removal curves of nutrients were fitted by using first order kinetic model michaelis menten kinetic model and modified logistic kinetic model see details in the supporting information the important parameters of fitting results for the ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp removal by the three models under different cu2 concentrations were integrated in table s2 the modified logistic kinetic model had a higher r2 value than that of other two models at each concentration of cu2 it was suggested that modified logistic kinetic model could describe better the nutrient removal by duckweed exposed to various cu2 concentration levels and the fitting plots were showed in fig 1 and fig s1 as seen in fig 1 judging from the results of the control groups the removal rate of nh3 n and tp were 85 and 99 respectively when the test came to the end it suggested that duckweed had a good removal rate of nh3 n and tp from adsw that was not contaminated by cu2 which was in agreement with the results of our previous study zhou et al 2018 besides the performance of nutrient removal also exhibited different trends at various cu2 concentrations as seen in fig 1 and table s2a compared with the control 0 mg l cu2 the removal rate rm of nh3 n and tp was larger at 0 1 1 0 mg l cu2 while that was lower at 2 0 5 0 cu2 mg l interestingly the removal performance of nh3 n could be improved at lower cu2 concentrations but that was inhibited at higher cu2 concentrations this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that excess cu2 2 0 mg l would do harm to direct assimilation of duckweed and biodegradation of rhizosphere microorganisms which were two major pathways for nutrient removal by duckweed cheng et al 2002 xu and shen 2011 for instance high cu2 concentrations could result in the disintegration of antioxidant systems by producing a large amount of reactive oxygen species ros in duckweed cells wu et al 2018 and cause the inhibition activity such as the nitrification denitrification in rhizosphere microorganisms obermeier et al 2015 on the contrary low cu2 concentrations could be beneficial to the removal of nh3 n this was in good agreement with findings by obermeier et al 2015 who found the decrease of peroxidase activity pox in low cu2 concentrations the low cu2 dosage may reduce the eutrophic stress from high initial concentrations of nh3 n and tp on duckweed through stimulating the ros scavenging systems to function asada 1987 similar trends were observed on the removal of tp by fitting modified logistic kinetic model table s2b therefore further work was needed to elucidate the relation between eutrophic stress and cu2 stress and find out the real inflection point of cu2 concentration 3 2 modeling of nutrient removal under different cu2 concentrations in the modified logistic kinetic model the parameter q represents external environmental stress and there mainly exists external pressure caused by cu2 in duckweed systems it meant that the relation between q value and cu2 concentration may be described by a mathematical formula and thereby the scatter diagram was plotted by cu2 concentrations on the horizontal axis and q values on the vertical as shown interestingly in fig 2 the connected curve by point was close to the quadratic curve so the curves were fitted iteratively by least squares method and then the equations were obtained by 1 q n 0 0843 c u 2 0 2678 c u 0 8905 2 q p 0 9327 c u 2 1 7931 c u 1 3059 here the correlation coefficient r2 of equations 1 and 2 was 0 9996 and 0 9958 respectively implying that equations 1 and 2 could commendably describe the relationship between the cu2 concentration and q value it meant that the external environmental stress could be adjusted by various cu2 concentrations moreover it was found that the inflection point of cu2 concentration for removal of nh3 n and tp were 0 96 mg l and 1 57 mg l respectively fig 2 which suggested that they can be applied for estimating the degree of environmental stress induced by copper ions in duckweed systems apart from that the inflection point of cu2 concentration on removal of total phosphorus tp was lower than on removal of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n showing that removal of tp was more susceptive to cu2 concentration it was concluded that the inhibiting effect on removal of tp at a given cu2 concentration was stronger than that on removal of nh3 n by duckweed this finding might be ascribed to the different removal mechanisms of nh3 n and tp in a duckweed system duckweed uptake was the dominant pathway for tp removal while ammonia volatilization and nitrification were also the major pathways except duckweed uptake in a duckweed pond xu and shen 2011 thus according to the liebigs law of minimum the optimal cu2 concentrations might be chosen as 0 96 mg l in order to minimize environmental pressure for better nutrient removal by duckweed moreover the modified logistic kinetic model could be simplified by equations 3 and 4 3 d c n d t r c n 0 0843 c u 2 0 2678 c u 0 8905 4 d c p d t r c p 0 9327 c u 2 1 7931 c u 1 3059 as shown in equations 3 and 4 the novel kinetic model named cu effect kinetic model was clear because there were no complicated parameters it was suggested that the cu effect kinetic model could contribute to adjust the actual removal rate of duckweed by modifying cu2 concentration in duckweed systems although the novel kinetic model was limited to the hypothesis that there was only the eutrophic stress and copper stress in duckweed systems it creatively introduced the cu2 concentrations into the kinetic model to describe the effect of cu2 on nutrient removal in duckweed systems for swine wastewater treatment it was meaningful to provide a tool for the quantification of the influence caused by heavy metals on phytoremediation processes and to advance modeling of nutrient removal in biogeochemical cycling of aquatic ecosystems 3 3 dom characterization analyzed by using eem parafac the eem spectra of samples at different cu2 concentrations were analyzed by parafac the results revealed that the appropriate number of components was four based on the results of split half analysis as well as residuals and loadings analysis fig 3 additionally to further clarify fluorescence dom spectra the additional experiment with duckweed at various cu2 concentrations which repeated previous batch experiments except the destructive sampling and sampling interval has been performed within 15 days culture time see details in the supporting information and the eem spectra of additional experiment were presented in fig s8 as shown in fig s8 it can be demonstrated that there actually were four components in the dom released from the duckweed system thus combining with fig 3 and fig s8 the positions of peaks should have a broad range for better understanding and the positions of peaks of these four components have been illustrated in table 1 as summarized in table 1 four components identified by the parafac model including one microbial humic like substances c1 one tyrosine like substance c2 nadh c3 and humic like substances c4 c1 ex em 280 350 370 which was similar to microbial humic like found by murphy et al 2011 was considered to be produced and altered by microbial reprocessing from the biodegradation of the leaves and roots wei et al 2009 c2 ex em 270 280 310 320 which resembled tyrosine like substance found by zhu et al 2017 belonged to the type of protein like materials and was also observed in other aquatic environments kowalczuk et al 2009 additionally c2 missed the 220 240 nm excitation peaks comparing with typical peak of tyrosine like one explanation was the effect of shadow components induced by the interactions with metal ions and higher sensitivity of tyrosine like murphy et al 2011 c3 ex em 340 370 440 450 which was related to nadh arunachalam et al 2005 li et al 2008 2011 teixeira et al 2011 the nadh a kind of coenzymes existed in all living cells are the major intermediate electron and hydrogen carriers that couple the substrate catabolism with respiration and anabolism arunachalam et al 2005 however the fluorophores of c3 need further clarification by spiking experiments because other fluorophores such as humic like and fulvic like fluorescence will be also likely to fluoresce in this region c4 ex em 260 270 420 540 which corresponded to humic like substances found by zhu et al 2014 they stated a component with one excitation emission around 250 260 nm and two emission peaks centered around 250 nm and 500 nm but that component was not identified while according to the report of rosario ortiz et al 2007 peaks at excitation wavelengths 250 470 nm and emission wavelengths 380 580 nm were related to humic acid like organics therefore the component c4 was classified as humic like substance and because the peaks occurred in the boundary of forbidden regions em 2ex thus it remains to be elucidated whether the peak in the boundary of the forbidden regions actually existed or its existence is due to the different constraints or criteria imposed during modeling or due to an interaction between each fluorescence component more discussion on the peaks of c4 was illustrated in supporting information to further verify the fluorophore species of component c3 the spiking experiments with the water samples dosed with nadh was carried out specific procedure of spiking experiment was seen in the supporting information the fluorescence maps of component c3 in the water samples dosed with nadh at 0 cu2 concentrations were shown in fig s9b the fluorescence peak locations were similar to those of fig s9a while the corresponding fluorescence peak intensity was strengthened significantly indicating that the dosed analytes were in accordance with the fluorophores in the water samples from duckweed system it was demonstrated that the component c3 was nadh which provided a strong evidence in general the nadh fluorescence would typically exhibit an immediate step increase when the system was switched from aerobic to anoxic anaerobic conditions arunachalam et al 2005 so the dissolved oxygen do of duckweed system in the additional experiment was also monitored by using dissolved oxygen meter jpb 607a qiwei co china as the duckweed grew the do values of duckweed system in various culture times were presented in fig s10 which suggested that the do values of duckweed system were unstable and the duckweed system experienced the aerobic process and anoxic process conditions do 1 3 mg l as duckweed grown on the water surface thus the nadh could be accumulated and detected under the aerobic and anoxic condition which provided another evidence for that the component c3 was nadh probably other fluorophores compounds such as typical humic like and fulvic like substances could emit fluorescence in the broad region ex em 370 440 nm while this observation usually occurred in the stable aerobic process li et al 2011 therefore it was confirmed that the main peaks of this broad region belonged to the nadh and other inert products in this region such as humic or fulvic acids like substances were so weak that they might be concealed in the fluorescence of nadh due to the aerobic and anoxic conditions additionally the excitation and emission characteristics of traditional peaks and their description were displayed in table s3 compared with the location of traditional peaks components c1 c2 c3 and c4 appeared to have unusual fluorescence spectra and their positions shifted towards the longer wavelengths red shifted or the shorter wavelengths blue shifted besides the environment of the fluorophore such as temperature solvent hydrogen bonding ph metal ions and the presence of other solutes can also influence the positions of peaks red shifted or blue shifted senesi 1990 so to verify the effect of these factors on the position and shape of peaks the ph spiking experiment and metal spiking experiment were also carried out figure s11 s12 and s13 which confirmed that the high concentrations of proton and copper ions as well as the presence of other components could cause the variation of fluorescence spectra see detail in the supporting information on the whole the shifts towards longer or shorter wavelengths in this study which exhibited unusual fluorescence spectra were acceptable to reflect the characteristics of duckweed system however due to the complexity of duckweed system the combined effect caused by ph copper ions and other component in dom remained to be elucidated in duckweed system clearly parafac spectra from dom data sets describe the probabilistic distribution of an ensemble of individual spectra belonging to a range of spectrally similar chemical moieties from a range of sources rather than the exact chemical spectra murphy et al 2011 therefore many unidentified components and their impacts on water treatment process have not been investigated in the treatment process by duckweed to study the variations of unknown components and to create a classification of dom fractions which are contributive to the design and selection of duckweed systems 3 4 effect of cu2 concentration on the fluorescent components of dom the fluorescent components of dom released from the duckweed systems at different cu2 concentrations were conducted by eem parafac parafac modeling of these water samples produced four component models c1c4 fig 3 at various initial cu2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 4 0 mg l but there was only three component models c1 c2 and c4 at initial cu2 concentration of 5 0 mg l it was indicated that c3 nadh was significantly influenced by cu2 concentrations generally the nadh a kind of intracellular fluorophores was originated from the metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms during their growth and substrate degradation process he et al 2017 li et al 2011 the disappear of c3 at 5 mg l cu2 could be explained that nadh was predicted to have high binding affinity for heavy metals due to the abundant carboxylic and phenolic groups which were generally considered as strong binding sites with copper ions in dom additionally with the concentration of cu2 increased the more binding sites were occupied by copper ions so the non fluorescent chelate compound cu nadh was formed and thereby the fluorescence of nadh disappeared at higher cu2 concentration 5 mg l cu2 on the other hand the copper ions could also bond with nadh to develop a new electron transfer chain and promote the conversion of nadh to nad which had no fluorescence at higher cu2 concentrations li et al 2011 sun et al 2011 moreover the quenching curves of each fluorescence component at various cu2 concentrations were shown in fig s4 c3 component nadh also showed an obvious fluorescence quenching with exhibiting a clear downward trend while other components c1 c2 and c4 showed larger fluctuations with the increase of cu2 concentrations indicating that nadh played a vital role on the binding of dom to heavy metals the key components distributed within various fractions of dom were the main influence on the impact of metal binding recognizing the different roles of various components played in heavy metal binding several strategies could be adopted for risk control of heavy metal migration wu et al 2012 for instance treatment processes with high ratios of nadh should be encouraged in addition larger fluctuations in the quenching curves were also observed in a study conducted by yamashita and jaffe 2008 who employed parafac eem quenching to explore the interactions between surface water borne dom and cu yamashita and jaffe 2008 found that protein like components increased slightly with the initial addition of cu and then decreased with increasing the initial cu additions there were three reasons for the increases in fluorescence intensity including 1 the changes in quantum yields of protein fluorescence by three dimensional structural change of protein molecules might have occurred due to the high concentrations of cu2 2 the fluorescence intensity of such quenched protein like components might be enhanced through the replacement of the original quencher with cu2 3 the fluorescence intensity might also be enhanced due to the replacement of the protein in the dom protein complexes through the interaction with cu whereby the formation of more stable dom cu complexes result in the release of protein like components based on the above explanations in the duckweed system the larger fluctuations of c1 c2 and c4 component in quenching curves might be a result of the stable complexes in molecular environments of microbial humic like tyrosine like and humic like substances with metals and as shown in fig s3 the cu2 concentrations had a slight decrease as the cultivated time increased which was likely to be caused by the combined effect of c1 c2 c3 and c4 component with copper ions often interactions with dom and metals are characterized by just one quenching constant which is an oversimplification of the complexation process ohno et al 2008 in fact the interactions between organic matter and metal were complex which could exhibit not only quenching but also enhancement in fluorescence intensity so a non monotonic change in quenching curves should be possible additionally these results suggested that the method of fluorescence quenching may not be appropriate for the evaluation of the binding characteristics of c1 c2 and c4 components released from duckweed system and metal ions therefore further studies are needed to clarify such changes in molecular environments of these components and assess their environmental significance therefore in the next section of this paper we combined principal components analysis pca with eem parafac to further identify and classify the behaviors of the four fluorescence components at various cu2 concentrations furtherly to determine the binding capability for nadh the log km value was calculated by using the modified stern volmer model see details in supporting information which was widely applied in monotonic change of quenching curves the stability constant log km value was 5 65 which was a relatively high value for cu dom reported in lake sediment derived and landfill leachate derived wu et al 2012 xu et al 2013 it was indicated that nadh in dom exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions and was also an important metal chelator in duckweed systems baken et al 2011 thus the nadh observed in this study a kind of enzymatic antioxidant could delay or prevent heavy metals from reaching duckweed cells by diffusion limitation or chemical reactions due to the high log km value however the traits of other three fluorescence components at various cu2 concentrations were still unclear in duckweed systems 3 5 pca for dom components under different cu2 concentrations based on the data of the maximum fluorescence intensity from parafac results the pca can be used to further identify and classify the behaviors of the four fluorescence component at various cu2 concentrations wilson et al 2000 as shown in fig 4 a the eigenvalues of the two principal components pc1 63 33 pc2 22 67 represented up to 86 of the observations it was indicated that the pc1 and pc2 could reflect most of the information of the all original variable abdulla et al 2013 thus it was decided to plot factor loadings and scores on a pc1 pc2 axes plane fig 4b as shown in fig 4b the loading plot showed that the four variables exhibited a positive correlation with the pc1 and the low molecular weight lmw c2 tyrosine like with a high value contributed to the construction of pc1 while the high molecular weight hmw including c1 microbial humic like c3 nadh and c4 humic like showed a small value on the axis of pc1 luo et al 2013 it was suggested that the pc1 favored the lhw thus the pc1 can be regarded as the nature of the dom where the lmw occupied the dominant position for the construction of pc2 it was found that the c1 and c3 microbial by products exhibited a positive correlation with pc2 but the c2 and c4 acidic substances displayed a negative correlation it indicated that the positive values of pc2 meant that the duckweed systems contain microbial by products eg protein like substance which were in favor of the growth of aquatic plants for the negative values of pc2 it showed that there were much acidic substances in duckweed systems resulting in the aquatic plants adversely growing thus the pc2 could be used to describe the nutrient level of duckweed systems fig 4b also showed the scores of each cu2 concentration during the period of the study as shown in scores plot in relation to pc1 nature of dom it was found that the values of 0 0 5 mg l cu2 were negative while that of 1 0 5 0 mg l cu2 were positive it showed that few dom released from duckweed systems at 0 0 5 mg l of cu2 but released in large quantities at higher cu2 concentrations as shown in scores plot in relation to pc1 nature of dom it was found that the values of 0 0 5 mg l cu2 were negative while the values of 1 0 5 0 mg l cu2 were positive it showed that few dom released from duckweed systems at 0 0 5 mg l of cu2 but released in large quantities at higher cu2 concentrations the anti oxidative defense system of aquatic plants played a major role in overcoming stress imposed by heavy metals it would not function to produce antioxidants for protecting the plant cells from harm by heavy metals until the concentrations of heavy metals reached to a certain value thus the release of dom at the higher cu2 concentrations 0 5 mg l indicated that dom belonged to the anti oxidative defense system of aquatic plants and were naturally occurring antioxidants under heavy metal stress which was consistent with the report of janssen and mcneill 2014 besides the large value of pc1 indicated that the released dom were mainly of low molecular weight lmw at 1 0 mg l of cu2 while the small value of pc1 indicated that they were mainly of high molecular weight hmw at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 in duckweed systems in relation to pc2 nutrient level of duckweed systems lower cu2 concentrations 0 0 1 mg l cu2 were to be found in the positive part of pc2 while 0 5 5 0 mg l cu2 were in the negative part it was implied that the low cu2 concentrations were beneficial to the growth of duckweed through producing much protein rich substances into the water on the contrary high cu2 concentrations would inhibit duckweed growth where acidic substances dominant the nutrient level of duckweed systems this explanation was in agreement with observations in fig s2 therefore as a statistical tool pca can be applied to further illustrate the characteristics of dom components and nutrient levels of duckweed systems at various cu2 concentrations 3 6 effect of cu2 concentrations on the molecular characteristics of dom combining ftir with 2d cos or pcmw2d would provide a clear insight into the molecular characteristics of dom with copper ions perturbation abdulla et al 2013 lumsdon and fraser 2005 the 2400 800 cm 1 regions of 2d ftir cos were analyzed and the results were displayed in fig 5 and table 2 fig 5 showed the synchronous and asynchronous ftir maps of dom with cu2 concentration as the perturbation the synchronous maps fig 5a exhibited seven prominent auto peaks on the diagonal at 2334 2217 1912 1560 1162 1104 and 887 cm 1 considering the four fluorescence components in dom the cellulose and hemi cellulose in plant the extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by rhizosphere microorganisms and the no3 in solution the bands at 2334 cm 1was attributed to saturated ch stretching of humic like substances chew et al 2013 the band at 2217 cm 1 was assigned to tyrosine nh stretching vibration ulrici 2004 the bands at 1912 cm 1was generated by the no of deprotonated nitric acid no3 xiang et al 2015 the band at 1560 cm 1 correspond to the coo symmetric stretching of tyrosine chen et al 2014 the band at 1162 cm 1 was assigned to anti symmetric bridge stretching of coc in cellulose and hemi cellulose ibrahim and alfifi 2010 the bands at 1104 cm 1 was attributed to co stretching of polysaccharides soong et al 2014 and the band at 887 to cm 1 to aromatic ch deformation in tyrosine chen et al 2015b in addition the change in band intensity followed the order 887 1912 2217 1162 1560 1104 2334 cm 1 meanwhile all the cross peaks off the diagonal exhibited positive signs in the synchronous map indicating that these peaks exhibited the same responses of spectral intensities to copper ions perturbation additionally the asynchronous spectra can help to judge the sequential order of specific events along external perturbations the cross peaks of every two bands were shown in fig 5b and the detailed assignments of bands and signs of their cross peaks in the asynchronous map were summarized in table 2 in the asynchronous map the red represents a positive sign while the blue represents a negative sign according to noda s rule noda 2014 the sequence of bond variation with copper ions followed the order 2334 1912 887 2217 1536 1162 1104 cm 1 thus as stimulated by copper ion stress the binding order of dom to copper ions followed the order ch humic like substances no no3 arh tyrosine tyrosine nh tyrosine coo coc cellulose polysaccharides co clearly according this order the bonding of nh and coo to copper ions occurred at the same time which indirectly demonstrated that the nh and coo both belonged to the functional groups of tyrosine in brief these observations indicated that dom could interact with copper ions through multiple mechanisms due to its diverse functional moieties which also exhibited the complexity and difficulty in the bonding process analysis chen et al 2014 lin et al 2018 as to the change of dom conformations the pcmw2d synchronous spectra of dom were presented in fig 6 three dominant correlation peaks at coordinates around 887 cm 1 0 5 mg l 1912 cm 1 0 5 mg l and 2334 cm 1 0 5 mg l were observed suggesting that the variation of dom conformations occurred at a critical concentration of 0 5 mg l cu2 on the pressure of cu2 concentrations it also demonstrated that the functional groups of ch humic like substances no no3 arh tyrosine would simultaneously give the fastest binding with cu2 in the duckweed systems as stated above moreover these three functional groups were also most likely for the variation of dom conformations with copper ions fluctuation with respect to the conformation change of arh in tyrosine it might be induced by the unfolding of the secondary structure in tyrosine the similar change in the protein like substances with aromatic structure was observed by chen et al 2017 who demonstrated that copper ions could destroy the original hydrogen bonding network of the backbone and make the secondary structure to unfold as for the conformation change of ch in humic like substances it was possible that the spheroidal humic like substances were surrounded by copper ions so that the molecular volume increased and thereby the resistance to rotation and the rotation rate decreased in the solution lakshman et al 1996 therefore humic like substances began to exist in the form of planar expansion when exposed to a given cu2 concentration lakshman et al 1996 for the conformation change of no in no3 isolated no3 has high symmetry with plane triangle structure meaning that the nitrogen atom is located in the center of the regular triangle the bond length is 1 26 å and the bond angle is 120 c however kameda et al 2006 found that due to the effect of sodium ions the no3 would turn into spatial structure with 170 7 of plane degree the bond length was 1 28 å and the bond angle was 119 8 via the calculation of density functional theory dft but the no3 was still highly symmetric kameda et al 2006 thus it can be inferred that no3 would present in similar conformational change with the copper ions perturbation it meant conformation change of no in no3 from plane triangle structure into spatial structure with the increase of cu2 concentrations to make the conformation change process of dom with copper ions more intuitive a comprehensive picture was established based on the above conjecture at a molecular level fig s14 therefore the fluorescent components such as the tyrosine and humic like substances and the non fluorescent group such as no3 played a vital role in conformational changes of dom with copper ions perturbation they were more sensitive to copper ions than other functional groups in dom released from duckweed systems 4 conclusions the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp could be improved at 0 1 1 0 mg l of cu2 while was inhibited at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 in duckweed systems for the treatment of swine wastewater the kinetic model reached an optimal cu2 concentration of 0 96 mg l for the removal of nh3 n and tp in swine wastewater the eem parafac analysis showed that there were four components including microbial humic like substance tyrosine nadh and humic like substance in dom released from the duckweed systems moreover nadh exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions due to the high stability constant log km 5 65 which indicated that nadh was an important metal chelator in duckweed systems on the pca assessment the large value of pc1 revealed that the released dom was mainly consisted of low molecular weight lmw substance at 1 0 mg l of cu2 while the small value of pc1 indicated that most of dom were high molecular weight hmw substance at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 in duckweed systems the stress of cu2 on the binding order between the function groups of dom and copper ions followed the order as ch no arh nh coo coc co according to the results of the 2d ftir cos analysis there existed a critical copper ion concentration of 0 5 mg l for the variation of dom conformations via the pcmw2d analysis and ch no and arh were most likely responsible for the variation this study might provide an alternative approach for the exploration of both the interaction mechanisms of heavy metals on nutrient uptake and the role of dom on

18817,high concentration of cu2 in swine wastewater raises concerns about its potential adverse effects on nutrient removal by aquatic plants like duckweed in this work the effects of copper ions on nutrient removal and release of dissolved organic matter dom were investigated in duckweed systems results showed that the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp increased at 0 1 1 0 mg l of cu2 while dropped at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 a novel kinetic model in which cu2 was taken into account was then developed which was used to optimize cu2 concentration at 0 96 mg l for nutrient removal in duckweed systems nadh detected in dom by the parallel factor parafac analysis exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions so it played an important role on the decrease of cu2 concentrations in duckweed systems the principle component analysis pca showed that the dominant dom were lower molecular weight compounds at 1 0 mg l of cu2 and higher molecular weight compounds at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 the bonds of ch humic like no no3 and arh tyrosine in dom were responsible for not only the fastest binding with cu2 from the result of the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir cos but also the variations of dom conformations at a critical concentration of 0 5 mg l cu2 from the perturbation correlation moving window two dimensional pcmw2d analysis these findings lead to a better understanding on the environmental behaviors and mechanisms of cu2 in duckweed systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords copper dissolved organic matter duckweed nutrient swine wastewater 1 introduction heavy metals including copper and zinc in swine wastewater have been paid close attention due to their potential to inhibit the growth of various aquatic plants and microorganisms du et al 2018 tandon et al 2013 and pose severe challenges to traditional treatment processes including microbiological treatment and phytoremediation for swine wastewater therefore various methods and processes have been proposed and been reported to address this pollution wang and chen 2009 wen et al 2016 duckweed used in phytoremediation for swine wastewater treatment has shown high potential for removing nutrients maximizing biomass yield and easily harvesting cheng and stomp 2009 li et al 2017 it was reported that the major pathways for nutrient removal were through duckweed uptake and nitrification denitrification by bacteria in a duckweed pond luo et al 2016 pant and adholeya 2009 xu and shen 2011 although trace of certain heavy metals such as copper is essential for living cell functions it would be deleterious to many organisms via the destruction of anti oxidative defense system when its concentration is high chen et al 2015a obermeier et al 2015 wu et al 2017 consequently high metal loads could inhibit the duckweed growth thereby reduce the capacity of nutrient removal by duckweed and even cause the complete failure of nutrient removal in phytoremediation li et al 2018 for instance the removal rate of nh3 n decreased from 85 to 25 when the zn2 concentration increased from 0 to 15 mg l in swine wastewater zhou et al 2018 several mathematic models were developed to take into account of the influence of heavy metals on nutrient removal from wastewater treatment which include the first order model vermaat and hanif 1998 michaelis menten model vermaat and hanif 1998 and logistic model zhang et al 2014 in these models the removal rate represented the comprehensive effects of a series of biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature photoperiod and phosphorus nitrogen concentrations chen et al 2018 cheng et al 2016 however these models are still not sufficient because they can only indirectly reflect the real effect of heavy metals via the decrease or increase of removal rate yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 to our knowledge few kinetic models incorporating the concentration of heavy metals were available for the description of the influence of heavy metals on duckweed systems thus more investigations are needed to develop better mathematical models in which heavy metal concentration can be taken into account to alleviate the stress of heavy metals on nutrient uptake aquatic plants can produce various antioxidants through the anti oxidative defense system cakmak 2010 dissolved organic matter dom naturally occurring antioxidant is a heterogeneous mixture derived from metabolic excretion or autolysis of cells in aquatic plants and rhizosphere microorganisms senga et al 2018 dom fractions may contain labile low molecular weight lmw substances and more stable high molecular weight hmw substances rengel 2002 lmw materials refer to carbohydrates small proteins peptides organic acids oa amino acids vitamins hormones etc rengel 2002 hmw compounds mainly contain humics mucilage polysaccharides secretory proteins and ectoenzymes matthias et al 2007 so there are abundant organic functional groups e g amide carboxyl phenol and hydroxyl with high active sites in dom and these functional groups can efficiently combine heavy metals via chelation or complexation peng et al 2018 for example lmw oa concentration in root exudates was positively correlated with the amount of cd accumulated in millet roots chiang et al 2011 it implied that dom could reduce the concentration of heavy metals so the toxicity of heavy metals to aquatic systems could be relieved however the interaction mechanisms between dom and heavy metals are still not clear in duckweed systems the interactions of heavy metal ions with dom can be revealed as the change on composition and structure of dom the composition of dom could be detected by the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy combined with parallel factor parafac analysis which can reduce the interferences due to overlapping fluorophores among various compounds and determine the individual fluorescent components in dom yamashita and jaffe 2008 however the effect of the interactions between heavy metals and dom on change of fluorescent components remains unclear for example the relation between each fluorescent component and each heavy metal concentration yamashita and jaffe 2008 principal components analysis pca has become an efficient statistical tool on the identification of differences and similarities between components and external factors in a data set by analyzing the loading plots and score plots abdulla et al 2013 in activated sludge process the joint application of pca and eem parafac can provide overall assessment on the modifications of dissolved organic nitrogen don components at different solids retention time hu et al 2018 while the joint application of pca and eem parafac used in duckweed systems has not been reported in addition the variation of the molecular structure in dom also needs further investigation fortunately the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy 2d ftir cos has the potential to provide a comprehensive insight into the features of functional groups on dom which included fluorescent and non fluorescent components under the heavy metal perturbation lumsdon and fraser 2005 the binding sites and binding orders of dom to heavy metals can be probed by the synchronous and asynchronous spectra of 2d ftir cos abdulla et al 2010 furtherly perturbation correlation moving window two dimensional pcmw2d proposed recently based on 2d ftir cos has become a powerful tool to explore the conformational variation of dom with perturbation e g temperature concentration etc morita et al 2006 in pcmw2d analysis the perturbation induced spectral transition points can be obtained from the correlation intensity along the perturbation variables direction noda 2014 however few studies have been reported to use the above combined techniques to analyze the variation on composition and molecular structure of dom affected by various concentrations of cu2 therefore in depth examination on the mechanisms of the interactions between heavy metals and duckweed on nutrient removal and dom release is necessary which would provide valuable information on the optimum condition and maximum capacity of phytoremediation technology in swine wastewater contaminated by heavy metals and the microcosmic transport of heavy metals in natural and engineered environments in this work we have developed a comprehensive mathematical kinetic model in which cu2 concentration was taking into account to describe the effect of cu2 on nutrient removal in duckweed systems for swine wastewater treatment in addition the joint application of eem parafac pca 2d ftir cos and pcmw2d was proposed to better understand the mechanisms of the interactions between dom to copper ions at the molecular scale which include dom compositions binding sites binding orders and dom conformations the objective of this research is to elucidate the influence mechanisms of cu2 on nutrient removal by duckweed via the novel kinetic model and explore cu dom interactions by using the 3d fluorescence maps and 2d ftir cos technologies in duckweed systems it is expected to lead to a better understanding of the transport and fate of cu and providing an improved approach to design and manage duckweed systems for the treatment of swine wastewater contaminated by heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental procedure the initial media was prepared as synthetic swine wastewater and its ionic concentrations were listed in table s1 for the batch tests according to our previous works different volumes cuso4 5h2o solution was added into the initial media to simulate different cu2 concentrations 0 1 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l and the initial synthetic wastewater did not have a fluorescence signature through the measurement of fluorescence eem fig s6 the ph value of media was adjusted at 6 30 0 40 by using 0 10 mol l hcl solution then the initial media was sterilized in an autoclave for 30 min at 121 c before duckweed was added into the media eighty four beakers 500 ml 6 4 cm 6 4 cm 12 5 cm including 2 7 control beakers without extra copper ions and 2 5 7 duplicate sample beakers with extra copper ions were used in five batch tests each beaker contained 140 ml 3 4 cm deep in the beaker of media and it was initially seeded with the same amount 0 4 0 1 g fresh weight of duckweed to cover the 80 surface area of 6 4 cm 6 4 cm prior to culture initiation the duckweed had been pre cultured in our previous works zhou et al 2018 and then the healthy duckweed was selected and cleaned by distilled water all beakers were placed into a light growth chamber with 16 h photoperiod at 25 c and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 70 10 μmol m 2 s 1 provided by wide spectrum fluorescent tubes due to the decrease of ph as the duckweed grew 0 10 mol l naoh solution was added to maintain the ph around 6 30 0 40 destructive sampling was used to monitor the nutrient level dom concentrations and duckweed growth by taking a whole beaker as a sample for analysis duplicate samples and control samples were collected and analyzed every 4 8 days for 38 days 2 2 spectral determination and analysis in this study dom was designated as dissolved organic carbon doc passing through a 0 45 μm membrane filter its concentration was measured by a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan fig s5 before the measurement of eem spectra the doc concentrations of all of the samples were diluted 10 mg l and thereby the samples have an absorbance at λ 254 nm abs254 0 2 to minimize inner filter effects during fluorescence analysis poulin et al 2014 see details in the supporting information fig s7 dom fluorescent components were analyzed by 3d fluorescence maps which were measured by using a f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 150w xenon lamp hitachi japan scanning emission em spectra from 200 to 600 nm were obtained in 2 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 200 to 500 nm in 10 nm increments at room temperature the eem spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 12000 nm min and the slit widths of both the excitation and emission were set as 10 nm and the parafac analysis was presented in the supporting information for collecting fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis the solid state dom was extracted by a freeze drier biobase china from water samples and then the mixtures of 1 0 mg freeze dried dom sample and 100 mg potassium bromide kbr ir grade were ground and homogenized to reduce light scatter and then compressed to form a disk under 15 mpa for 2 min finally the disk were measured to obtain ftir spectra by using an ir affinity 1 spectrometer shimadzu japan at a resolution of 4 cm 1 with 20 scans over 4000 400 cm 1 at room temperature and the two dimensional correlation analysis was presented in the supporting information 2 3 wastewater analysis duckweed was harvested from each beaker by using a strainer with 0 5 mm pore size then the fresh weight of duckweed was measured using a balance immediately after the duckweed harvested was placed on paper towels for 5 min fig s2 after duckweed harvested the wastewater were analyzed for nh3 n tp cu nh3 n was determined by the nessler s reagent colorimetric method and tp was used in the potassium persulfate digestion colorimetric method according to the standard methods epa of china 2002 the cu2 concentration was measured by an atomic absorption spectrometer aas agilent 3510 usa 2 4 statistical analysis the results calculated were expressed as mean se standard error of three replicates in water and duckweed samples for each treatment one way anova was performed to compare all data statistical analyses were conducted using spss 17 0 spss chicago il usa with significance level p 0 05 obtained models followed by tukey s hsd tests were used to identify any significant differences between treatments pca was performed by using the paleontological statistics software past version 3 0 which based on the data of the maximum fluorescence intensity from parafac results 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of nutrient removal by duckweed at various cu2 concentrations in this study removal curves of nutrients were fitted by using first order kinetic model michaelis menten kinetic model and modified logistic kinetic model see details in the supporting information the important parameters of fitting results for the ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp removal by the three models under different cu2 concentrations were integrated in table s2 the modified logistic kinetic model had a higher r2 value than that of other two models at each concentration of cu2 it was suggested that modified logistic kinetic model could describe better the nutrient removal by duckweed exposed to various cu2 concentration levels and the fitting plots were showed in fig 1 and fig s1 as seen in fig 1 judging from the results of the control groups the removal rate of nh3 n and tp were 85 and 99 respectively when the test came to the end it suggested that duckweed had a good removal rate of nh3 n and tp from adsw that was not contaminated by cu2 which was in agreement with the results of our previous study zhou et al 2018 besides the performance of nutrient removal also exhibited different trends at various cu2 concentrations as seen in fig 1 and table s2a compared with the control 0 mg l cu2 the removal rate rm of nh3 n and tp was larger at 0 1 1 0 mg l cu2 while that was lower at 2 0 5 0 cu2 mg l interestingly the removal performance of nh3 n could be improved at lower cu2 concentrations but that was inhibited at higher cu2 concentrations this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that excess cu2 2 0 mg l would do harm to direct assimilation of duckweed and biodegradation of rhizosphere microorganisms which were two major pathways for nutrient removal by duckweed cheng et al 2002 xu and shen 2011 for instance high cu2 concentrations could result in the disintegration of antioxidant systems by producing a large amount of reactive oxygen species ros in duckweed cells wu et al 2018 and cause the inhibition activity such as the nitrification denitrification in rhizosphere microorganisms obermeier et al 2015 on the contrary low cu2 concentrations could be beneficial to the removal of nh3 n this was in good agreement with findings by obermeier et al 2015 who found the decrease of peroxidase activity pox in low cu2 concentrations the low cu2 dosage may reduce the eutrophic stress from high initial concentrations of nh3 n and tp on duckweed through stimulating the ros scavenging systems to function asada 1987 similar trends were observed on the removal of tp by fitting modified logistic kinetic model table s2b therefore further work was needed to elucidate the relation between eutrophic stress and cu2 stress and find out the real inflection point of cu2 concentration 3 2 modeling of nutrient removal under different cu2 concentrations in the modified logistic kinetic model the parameter q represents external environmental stress and there mainly exists external pressure caused by cu2 in duckweed systems it meant that the relation between q value and cu2 concentration may be described by a mathematical formula and thereby the scatter diagram was plotted by cu2 concentrations on the horizontal axis and q values on the vertical as shown interestingly in fig 2 the connected curve by point was close to the quadratic curve so the curves were fitted iteratively by least squares method and then the equations were obtained by 1 q n 0 0843 c u 2 0 2678 c u 0 8905 2 q p 0 9327 c u 2 1 7931 c u 1 3059 here the correlation coefficient r2 of equations 1 and 2 was 0 9996 and 0 9958 respectively implying that equations 1 and 2 could commendably describe the relationship between the cu2 concentration and q value it meant that the external environmental stress could be adjusted by various cu2 concentrations moreover it was found that the inflection point of cu2 concentration for removal of nh3 n and tp were 0 96 mg l and 1 57 mg l respectively fig 2 which suggested that they can be applied for estimating the degree of environmental stress induced by copper ions in duckweed systems apart from that the inflection point of cu2 concentration on removal of total phosphorus tp was lower than on removal of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n showing that removal of tp was more susceptive to cu2 concentration it was concluded that the inhibiting effect on removal of tp at a given cu2 concentration was stronger than that on removal of nh3 n by duckweed this finding might be ascribed to the different removal mechanisms of nh3 n and tp in a duckweed system duckweed uptake was the dominant pathway for tp removal while ammonia volatilization and nitrification were also the major pathways except duckweed uptake in a duckweed pond xu and shen 2011 thus according to the liebigs law of minimum the optimal cu2 concentrations might be chosen as 0 96 mg l in order to minimize environmental pressure for better nutrient removal by duckweed moreover the modified logistic kinetic model could be simplified by equations 3 and 4 3 d c n d t r c n 0 0843 c u 2 0 2678 c u 0 8905 4 d c p d t r c p 0 9327 c u 2 1 7931 c u 1 3059 as shown in equations 3 and 4 the novel kinetic model named cu effect kinetic model was clear because there were no complicated parameters it was suggested that the cu effect kinetic model could contribute to adjust the actual removal rate of duckweed by modifying cu2 concentration in duckweed systems although the novel kinetic model was limited to the hypothesis that there was only the eutrophic stress and copper stress in duckweed systems it creatively introduced the cu2 concentrations into the kinetic model to describe the effect of cu2 on nutrient removal in duckweed systems for swine wastewater treatment it was meaningful to provide a tool for the quantification of the influence caused by heavy metals on phytoremediation processes and to advance modeling of nutrient removal in biogeochemical cycling of aquatic ecosystems 3 3 dom characterization analyzed by using eem parafac the eem spectra of samples at different cu2 concentrations were analyzed by parafac the results revealed that the appropriate number of components was four based on the results of split half analysis as well as residuals and loadings analysis fig 3 additionally to further clarify fluorescence dom spectra the additional experiment with duckweed at various cu2 concentrations which repeated previous batch experiments except the destructive sampling and sampling interval has been performed within 15 days culture time see details in the supporting information and the eem spectra of additional experiment were presented in fig s8 as shown in fig s8 it can be demonstrated that there actually were four components in the dom released from the duckweed system thus combining with fig 3 and fig s8 the positions of peaks should have a broad range for better understanding and the positions of peaks of these four components have been illustrated in table 1 as summarized in table 1 four components identified by the parafac model including one microbial humic like substances c1 one tyrosine like substance c2 nadh c3 and humic like substances c4 c1 ex em 280 350 370 which was similar to microbial humic like found by murphy et al 2011 was considered to be produced and altered by microbial reprocessing from the biodegradation of the leaves and roots wei et al 2009 c2 ex em 270 280 310 320 which resembled tyrosine like substance found by zhu et al 2017 belonged to the type of protein like materials and was also observed in other aquatic environments kowalczuk et al 2009 additionally c2 missed the 220 240 nm excitation peaks comparing with typical peak of tyrosine like one explanation was the effect of shadow components induced by the interactions with metal ions and higher sensitivity of tyrosine like murphy et al 2011 c3 ex em 340 370 440 450 which was related to nadh arunachalam et al 2005 li et al 2008 2011 teixeira et al 2011 the nadh a kind of coenzymes existed in all living cells are the major intermediate electron and hydrogen carriers that couple the substrate catabolism with respiration and anabolism arunachalam et al 2005 however the fluorophores of c3 need further clarification by spiking experiments because other fluorophores such as humic like and fulvic like fluorescence will be also likely to fluoresce in this region c4 ex em 260 270 420 540 which corresponded to humic like substances found by zhu et al 2014 they stated a component with one excitation emission around 250 260 nm and two emission peaks centered around 250 nm and 500 nm but that component was not identified while according to the report of rosario ortiz et al 2007 peaks at excitation wavelengths 250 470 nm and emission wavelengths 380 580 nm were related to humic acid like organics therefore the component c4 was classified as humic like substance and because the peaks occurred in the boundary of forbidden regions em 2ex thus it remains to be elucidated whether the peak in the boundary of the forbidden regions actually existed or its existence is due to the different constraints or criteria imposed during modeling or due to an interaction between each fluorescence component more discussion on the peaks of c4 was illustrated in supporting information to further verify the fluorophore species of component c3 the spiking experiments with the water samples dosed with nadh was carried out specific procedure of spiking experiment was seen in the supporting information the fluorescence maps of component c3 in the water samples dosed with nadh at 0 cu2 concentrations were shown in fig s9b the fluorescence peak locations were similar to those of fig s9a while the corresponding fluorescence peak intensity was strengthened significantly indicating that the dosed analytes were in accordance with the fluorophores in the water samples from duckweed system it was demonstrated that the component c3 was nadh which provided a strong evidence in general the nadh fluorescence would typically exhibit an immediate step increase when the system was switched from aerobic to anoxic anaerobic conditions arunachalam et al 2005 so the dissolved oxygen do of duckweed system in the additional experiment was also monitored by using dissolved oxygen meter jpb 607a qiwei co china as the duckweed grew the do values of duckweed system in various culture times were presented in fig s10 which suggested that the do values of duckweed system were unstable and the duckweed system experienced the aerobic process and anoxic process conditions do 1 3 mg l as duckweed grown on the water surface thus the nadh could be accumulated and detected under the aerobic and anoxic condition which provided another evidence for that the component c3 was nadh probably other fluorophores compounds such as typical humic like and fulvic like substances could emit fluorescence in the broad region ex em 370 440 nm while this observation usually occurred in the stable aerobic process li et al 2011 therefore it was confirmed that the main peaks of this broad region belonged to the nadh and other inert products in this region such as humic or fulvic acids like substances were so weak that they might be concealed in the fluorescence of nadh due to the aerobic and anoxic conditions additionally the excitation and emission characteristics of traditional peaks and their description were displayed in table s3 compared with the location of traditional peaks components c1 c2 c3 and c4 appeared to have unusual fluorescence spectra and their positions shifted towards the longer wavelengths red shifted or the shorter wavelengths blue shifted besides the environment of the fluorophore such as temperature solvent hydrogen bonding ph metal ions and the presence of other solutes can also influence the positions of peaks red shifted or blue shifted senesi 1990 so to verify the effect of these factors on the position and shape of peaks the ph spiking experiment and metal spiking experiment were also carried out figure s11 s12 and s13 which confirmed that the high concentrations of proton and copper ions as well as the presence of other components could cause the variation of fluorescence spectra see detail in the supporting information on the whole the shifts towards longer or shorter wavelengths in this study which exhibited unusual fluorescence spectra were acceptable to reflect the characteristics of duckweed system however due to the complexity of duckweed system the combined effect caused by ph copper ions and other component in dom remained to be elucidated in duckweed system clearly parafac spectra from dom data sets describe the probabilistic distribution of an ensemble of individual spectra belonging to a range of spectrally similar chemical moieties from a range of sources rather than the exact chemical spectra murphy et al 2011 therefore many unidentified components and their impacts on water treatment process have not been investigated in the treatment process by duckweed to study the variations of unknown components and to create a classification of dom fractions which are contributive to the design and selection of duckweed systems 3 4 effect of cu2 concentration on the fluorescent components of dom the fluorescent components of dom released from the duckweed systems at different cu2 concentrations were conducted by eem parafac parafac modeling of these water samples produced four component models c1c4 fig 3 at various initial cu2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 4 0 mg l but there was only three component models c1 c2 and c4 at initial cu2 concentration of 5 0 mg l it was indicated that c3 nadh was significantly influenced by cu2 concentrations generally the nadh a kind of intracellular fluorophores was originated from the metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms during their growth and substrate degradation process he et al 2017 li et al 2011 the disappear of c3 at 5 mg l cu2 could be explained that nadh was predicted to have high binding affinity for heavy metals due to the abundant carboxylic and phenolic groups which were generally considered as strong binding sites with copper ions in dom additionally with the concentration of cu2 increased the more binding sites were occupied by copper ions so the non fluorescent chelate compound cu nadh was formed and thereby the fluorescence of nadh disappeared at higher cu2 concentration 5 mg l cu2 on the other hand the copper ions could also bond with nadh to develop a new electron transfer chain and promote the conversion of nadh to nad which had no fluorescence at higher cu2 concentrations li et al 2011 sun et al 2011 moreover the quenching curves of each fluorescence component at various cu2 concentrations were shown in fig s4 c3 component nadh also showed an obvious fluorescence quenching with exhibiting a clear downward trend while other components c1 c2 and c4 showed larger fluctuations with the increase of cu2 concentrations indicating that nadh played a vital role on the binding of dom to heavy metals the key components distributed within various fractions of dom were the main influence on the impact of metal binding recognizing the different roles of various components played in heavy metal binding several strategies could be adopted for risk control of heavy metal migration wu et al 2012 for instance treatment processes with high ratios of nadh should be encouraged in addition larger fluctuations in the quenching curves were also observed in a study conducted by yamashita and jaffe 2008 who employed parafac eem quenching to explore the interactions between surface water borne dom and cu yamashita and jaffe 2008 found that protein like components increased slightly with the initial addition of cu and then decreased with increasing the initial cu additions there were three reasons for the increases in fluorescence intensity including 1 the changes in quantum yields of protein fluorescence by three dimensional structural change of protein molecules might have occurred due to the high concentrations of cu2 2 the fluorescence intensity of such quenched protein like components might be enhanced through the replacement of the original quencher with cu2 3 the fluorescence intensity might also be enhanced due to the replacement of the protein in the dom protein complexes through the interaction with cu whereby the formation of more stable dom cu complexes result in the release of protein like components based on the above explanations in the duckweed system the larger fluctuations of c1 c2 and c4 component in quenching curves might be a result of the stable complexes in molecular environments of microbial humic like tyrosine like and humic like substances with metals and as shown in fig s3 the cu2 concentrations had a slight decrease as the cultivated time increased which was likely to be caused by the combined effect of c1 c2 c3 and c4 component with copper ions often interactions with dom and metals are characterized by just one quenching constant which is an oversimplification of the complexation process ohno et al 2008 in fact the interactions between organic matter and metal were complex which could exhibit not only quenching but also enhancement in fluorescence intensity so a non monotonic change in quenching curves should be possible additionally these results suggested that the method of fluorescence quenching may not be appropriate for the evaluation of the binding characteristics of c1 c2 and c4 components released from duckweed system and metal ions therefore further studies are needed to clarify such changes in molecular environments of these components and assess their environmental significance therefore in the next section of this paper we combined principal components analysis pca with eem parafac to further identify and classify the behaviors of the four fluorescence components at various cu2 concentrations furtherly to determine the binding capability for nadh the log km value was calculated by using the modified stern volmer model see details in supporting information which was widely applied in monotonic change of quenching curves the stability constant log km value was 5 65 which was a relatively high value for cu dom reported in lake sediment derived and landfill leachate derived wu et al 2012 xu et al 2013 it was indicated that nadh in dom exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions and was also an important metal chelator in duckweed systems baken et al 2011 thus the nadh observed in this study a kind of enzymatic antioxidant could delay or prevent heavy metals from reaching duckweed cells by diffusion limitation or chemical reactions due to the high log km value however the traits of other three fluorescence components at various cu2 concentrations were still unclear in duckweed systems 3 5 pca for dom components under different cu2 concentrations based on the data of the maximum fluorescence intensity from parafac results the pca can be used to further identify and classify the behaviors of the four fluorescence component at various cu2 concentrations wilson et al 2000 as shown in fig 4 a the eigenvalues of the two principal components pc1 63 33 pc2 22 67 represented up to 86 of the observations it was indicated that the pc1 and pc2 could reflect most of the information of the all original variable abdulla et al 2013 thus it was decided to plot factor loadings and scores on a pc1 pc2 axes plane fig 4b as shown in fig 4b the loading plot showed that the four variables exhibited a positive correlation with the pc1 and the low molecular weight lmw c2 tyrosine like with a high value contributed to the construction of pc1 while the high molecular weight hmw including c1 microbial humic like c3 nadh and c4 humic like showed a small value on the axis of pc1 luo et al 2013 it was suggested that the pc1 favored the lhw thus the pc1 can be regarded as the nature of the dom where the lmw occupied the dominant position for the construction of pc2 it was found that the c1 and c3 microbial by products exhibited a positive correlation with pc2 but the c2 and c4 acidic substances displayed a negative correlation it indicated that the positive values of pc2 meant that the duckweed systems contain microbial by products eg protein like substance which were in favor of the growth of aquatic plants for the negative values of pc2 it showed that there were much acidic substances in duckweed systems resulting in the aquatic plants adversely growing thus the pc2 could be used to describe the nutrient level of duckweed systems fig 4b also showed the scores of each cu2 concentration during the period of the study as shown in scores plot in relation to pc1 nature of dom it was found that the values of 0 0 5 mg l cu2 were negative while that of 1 0 5 0 mg l cu2 were positive it showed that few dom released from duckweed systems at 0 0 5 mg l of cu2 but released in large quantities at higher cu2 concentrations as shown in scores plot in relation to pc1 nature of dom it was found that the values of 0 0 5 mg l cu2 were negative while the values of 1 0 5 0 mg l cu2 were positive it showed that few dom released from duckweed systems at 0 0 5 mg l of cu2 but released in large quantities at higher cu2 concentrations the anti oxidative defense system of aquatic plants played a major role in overcoming stress imposed by heavy metals it would not function to produce antioxidants for protecting the plant cells from harm by heavy metals until the concentrations of heavy metals reached to a certain value thus the release of dom at the higher cu2 concentrations 0 5 mg l indicated that dom belonged to the anti oxidative defense system of aquatic plants and were naturally occurring antioxidants under heavy metal stress which was consistent with the report of janssen and mcneill 2014 besides the large value of pc1 indicated that the released dom were mainly of low molecular weight lmw at 1 0 mg l of cu2 while the small value of pc1 indicated that they were mainly of high molecular weight hmw at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 in duckweed systems in relation to pc2 nutrient level of duckweed systems lower cu2 concentrations 0 0 1 mg l cu2 were to be found in the positive part of pc2 while 0 5 5 0 mg l cu2 were in the negative part it was implied that the low cu2 concentrations were beneficial to the growth of duckweed through producing much protein rich substances into the water on the contrary high cu2 concentrations would inhibit duckweed growth where acidic substances dominant the nutrient level of duckweed systems this explanation was in agreement with observations in fig s2 therefore as a statistical tool pca can be applied to further illustrate the characteristics of dom components and nutrient levels of duckweed systems at various cu2 concentrations 3 6 effect of cu2 concentrations on the molecular characteristics of dom combining ftir with 2d cos or pcmw2d would provide a clear insight into the molecular characteristics of dom with copper ions perturbation abdulla et al 2013 lumsdon and fraser 2005 the 2400 800 cm 1 regions of 2d ftir cos were analyzed and the results were displayed in fig 5 and table 2 fig 5 showed the synchronous and asynchronous ftir maps of dom with cu2 concentration as the perturbation the synchronous maps fig 5a exhibited seven prominent auto peaks on the diagonal at 2334 2217 1912 1560 1162 1104 and 887 cm 1 considering the four fluorescence components in dom the cellulose and hemi cellulose in plant the extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by rhizosphere microorganisms and the no3 in solution the bands at 2334 cm 1was attributed to saturated ch stretching of humic like substances chew et al 2013 the band at 2217 cm 1 was assigned to tyrosine nh stretching vibration ulrici 2004 the bands at 1912 cm 1was generated by the no of deprotonated nitric acid no3 xiang et al 2015 the band at 1560 cm 1 correspond to the coo symmetric stretching of tyrosine chen et al 2014 the band at 1162 cm 1 was assigned to anti symmetric bridge stretching of coc in cellulose and hemi cellulose ibrahim and alfifi 2010 the bands at 1104 cm 1 was attributed to co stretching of polysaccharides soong et al 2014 and the band at 887 to cm 1 to aromatic ch deformation in tyrosine chen et al 2015b in addition the change in band intensity followed the order 887 1912 2217 1162 1560 1104 2334 cm 1 meanwhile all the cross peaks off the diagonal exhibited positive signs in the synchronous map indicating that these peaks exhibited the same responses of spectral intensities to copper ions perturbation additionally the asynchronous spectra can help to judge the sequential order of specific events along external perturbations the cross peaks of every two bands were shown in fig 5b and the detailed assignments of bands and signs of their cross peaks in the asynchronous map were summarized in table 2 in the asynchronous map the red represents a positive sign while the blue represents a negative sign according to noda s rule noda 2014 the sequence of bond variation with copper ions followed the order 2334 1912 887 2217 1536 1162 1104 cm 1 thus as stimulated by copper ion stress the binding order of dom to copper ions followed the order ch humic like substances no no3 arh tyrosine tyrosine nh tyrosine coo coc cellulose polysaccharides co clearly according this order the bonding of nh and coo to copper ions occurred at the same time which indirectly demonstrated that the nh and coo both belonged to the functional groups of tyrosine in brief these observations indicated that dom could interact with copper ions through multiple mechanisms due to its diverse functional moieties which also exhibited the complexity and difficulty in the bonding process analysis chen et al 2014 lin et al 2018 as to the change of dom conformations the pcmw2d synchronous spectra of dom were presented in fig 6 three dominant correlation peaks at coordinates around 887 cm 1 0 5 mg l 1912 cm 1 0 5 mg l and 2334 cm 1 0 5 mg l were observed suggesting that the variation of dom conformations occurred at a critical concentration of 0 5 mg l cu2 on the pressure of cu2 concentrations it also demonstrated that the functional groups of ch humic like substances no no3 arh tyrosine would simultaneously give the fastest binding with cu2 in the duckweed systems as stated above moreover these three functional groups were also most likely for the variation of dom conformations with copper ions fluctuation with respect to the conformation change of arh in tyrosine it might be induced by the unfolding of the secondary structure in tyrosine the similar change in the protein like substances with aromatic structure was observed by chen et al 2017 who demonstrated that copper ions could destroy the original hydrogen bonding network of the backbone and make the secondary structure to unfold as for the conformation change of ch in humic like substances it was possible that the spheroidal humic like substances were surrounded by copper ions so that the molecular volume increased and thereby the resistance to rotation and the rotation rate decreased in the solution lakshman et al 1996 therefore humic like substances began to exist in the form of planar expansion when exposed to a given cu2 concentration lakshman et al 1996 for the conformation change of no in no3 isolated no3 has high symmetry with plane triangle structure meaning that the nitrogen atom is located in the center of the regular triangle the bond length is 1 26 å and the bond angle is 120 c however kameda et al 2006 found that due to the effect of sodium ions the no3 would turn into spatial structure with 170 7 of plane degree the bond length was 1 28 å and the bond angle was 119 8 via the calculation of density functional theory dft but the no3 was still highly symmetric kameda et al 2006 thus it can be inferred that no3 would present in similar conformational change with the copper ions perturbation it meant conformation change of no in no3 from plane triangle structure into spatial structure with the increase of cu2 concentrations to make the conformation change process of dom with copper ions more intuitive a comprehensive picture was established based on the above conjecture at a molecular level fig s14 therefore the fluorescent components such as the tyrosine and humic like substances and the non fluorescent group such as no3 played a vital role in conformational changes of dom with copper ions perturbation they were more sensitive to copper ions than other functional groups in dom released from duckweed systems 4 conclusions the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp could be improved at 0 1 1 0 mg l of cu2 while was inhibited at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 in duckweed systems for the treatment of swine wastewater the kinetic model reached an optimal cu2 concentration of 0 96 mg l for the removal of nh3 n and tp in swine wastewater the eem parafac analysis showed that there were four components including microbial humic like substance tyrosine nadh and humic like substance in dom released from the duckweed systems moreover nadh exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions due to the high stability constant log km 5 65 which indicated that nadh was an important metal chelator in duckweed systems on the pca assessment the large value of pc1 revealed that the released dom was mainly consisted of low molecular weight lmw substance at 1 0 mg l of cu2 while the small value of pc1 indicated that most of dom were high molecular weight hmw substance at 2 0 5 0 mg l of cu2 in duckweed systems the stress of cu2 on the binding order between the function groups of dom and copper ions followed the order as ch no arh nh coo coc co according to the results of the 2d ftir cos analysis there existed a critical copper ion concentration of 0 5 mg l for the variation of dom conformations via the pcmw2d analysis and ch no and arh were most likely responsible for the variation this study might provide an alternative approach for the exploration of both the interaction mechanisms of heavy metals on nutrient uptake and the role of dom on microcosmic migration of heavy metals in duckweed systems for swine wastewater treatment conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18818,infections with staphylococcus aureus are being spread through contact with the community environment but the role of wastewater treatment plants in the transmission routes is not defined this study investigated the prevalence types genetic elements and potential for transmission of s aureus by these engineered systems synchronized sampling events at two wastewater treatment plants were conducted with isolates of s aureus obtained by a selective enrichment method using acriflavine that suppressed staphylococcus epidermidis growth dna was extracted from a subset of the s aureus isolates checked by pcr to assure the absence of s epidermidis and sequenced to determine the multilocus sequence type spa type and carriage of the methicillin resistance and panton valentine leukocidin genetic elements sequences were analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphism differences in pairwise comparison of isolates there were two dominant s aureus clonal complexes identified in the isolates one commonly identified as hospital related cc5 and one community related cc8 both types of isolates were found at both treatment facilities even though only one facility had significant hospital sewage inputs the presence of s aureus persisted through treatment with some isolates recovered from the final processes showing genetic diversity the presence of the panton valentine leukocidin genetic element was greater than the 1 5 expected from global reports our results suggest that treatment provides an opportunity for genetic shift while the persistence and release of

wastewater treatment 1 introduction staphylococcus aureus is one of a group of bacteria that has been shown to colonize the nose of approximately 30 of the human population chambers and deleo 2009 but infections by community acquired antibiotic resistant s aureus are an emerging global epidemic grundmann et al 2006 in the united states methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa infections occurred at a rate of 18 8 per 100 000 people in 2015 were associated with serious complications like infective endocarditis osteomyelitis and sepsis and a retrospective study of hospital costs resulting from mrsa infections averaged 34 657 per patient in the minneapolis area and 113 852 per patient in rhode island ortwine and bhavan 2018 s aureus has developed rapid resistance to almost every antibiotic in use by acquiring mobile genetic elements from its surroundings and less frequently by gene mutation penicillin resistant s aureus was first isolated in the 1940s and by the 1960s s aureus had acquired the meca gene and broad spectrum resistance to all beta lactam antibiotics including penicillins cabapenems and methicillin these methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa strains initially originated in the hospital setting hospital acquired mrsa or ha mrsa but increasingly community acquired mrsa ca mrsa strains have emerged as the cause of skin and soft tissue infections early methods for the classification of mrsa identified strains by their country usa uk sweden etc or setting of origin ca mrsa or ha mrsa further development in genetic analyses has allowed for classification based on distinct regions of the s aureus chromosome multilocus sequence typing mlst compares partial sequences of seven housekeeping genes and is useful for measuring long term evolution of mrsa s aureus strains having identical sequences at all seven genes are grouped into the same sequence type st while strains differing by a single nucleotide polymorphism snp in less than three of the seven genes

which likely enables ca mrsa infections in otherwise healthy individuals kazakova et al 2005 the continual evolution of s aureus makes the identification of clones and their lineage essential for categorizing isolated mrsa and mssa strains to date the study of antibiotic resistant s aureus has focused largely on the hospital setting although the presence of antibiotic resistance elements in wastewaters and their transfer between environmental reservoirs and human pathogens has been observed and reported baquero et al 2008 miller et al 2016 munck et al 2015 schmieder and edwards 2012 the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize s aureus strains by whole genomic sequencing from two wastewater treatment plants wwtps one urban and one suburban in order to better understand the impacts of sewershed sources on the types and distribution of s aureus determine if sewage treatment processes have an effect on the adaptation of s aureus and assess the potential for release of viable s aureus in treated effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites sewage samples were collected from two activated sludge based wwtps in lexington kentucky town branch tb wwtp collects urban sewage from high density apartments several hospitals a prison an airport the university of kentucky and multiple industrial companies located centrally and to the north of the city tb has an average daily flow of 19 8 million gallons per day mgd and design capacity of 30 mgd the total resident population feeding to tb is about 121 836 but due to the multiple major hospitals in this

capacity of 33 9 mgd with an average daily flow of 20 4 mgd from the expanding suburban sprawl in south part of the city the total residential population supplying wh is about 164 940 with an

laboratories ertl at the university of kentucky and processed within 12 h of collection samples were passed through sterile stainless steel tea strainers to remove large particles then 200 ml of the strained sample was centrifuged at 3 700 g for 10 min to sediment bacteria the supernatant was discarded and the pellet enriched with an equal volume of 2 mannitol salt broth msb that had been augmented to a final strength of 0 0165 mg ml acriflavine acros organics 75 iu ml polymyxin b oxoid and 3 5 potassium tellurite oxoid acriflavine was added to suppress co growing staphylococcus epidermidis davis et al 2006 polymyxin b was added to suppress the growth of gram negative bacteria potassium tellurite was added to enhance s aureus respiration and provide a visual growth signal black precipitant the pellet broth mixture was vortexed and incubated at 37 c for 48 h cultures with a black color were centrifuged at 3 700 g for 10 min the bulk of the supernatant discarded and the pellet spread onto petri dishes containing mannitol salt agar msa augmented with 0 0165 mg ml acriflavine these pellet spread plates were transferred back to the incubator 37 c and incubated for 48 h yellow colonies were considered to be presumptive s aureus and at least 10 colonies or up to 10 of all presumptive colonies were re streaked onto new acriflavine augmented msa petri dishes to create single colony clones for further testing the coagulase cryo hardy diagnostics test was used to verify colonies as coagulase positive coagulase positive colonies were subjected to elisa testing mrsa latex test denka seiken japan to verify the presence of the penicillin binding protein responsible for beta lactamines resistance a positive elisa confirmed the selected s aureus isolate as presumptive mrsa while a negative elisa result was classified as presumptive mssa a subset of isolates from different days and from different processes was selected for regrowth prior to pcr and whole genomic sequencing all selected s aureus isolates were inoculated into acriflavine augmented msb incubated at 37 c for 48 h and frozen at 80 c until dna extraction genomic dna obtained from broth cultured colony isolates was purified using the dneasy kit qiagen courtaboeuf france dna content of 50 μl extract aliquots was measured by nano drop then extracts were shipped on ice to the university of geneva genomic research laboratory in switzerland for whole genome sequencing 2 3 bacterial isolate strain characterization a molecular assay previously developed and validated was used to complete the characterization of collected s aureus isolates a triplex quantitative pcr assay targeting species specific genes allowed for the detection of s epidermidis or s aureus as well as the presence of the meca gene francois et al 2003 in extracts and was used to confirm the in silico determination obtained from whole genome sequencing information the genetic information was used to type the isolates by application of two standardized methods both methods relied upon identification of specific dna sequences for specified gene fragments two typing approaches were applied mlst and spa sub typing to the s aureus isolate dna mlst consisted of amplification and sequencing parts of 7 essential house keeping genes with known mutation frequencies each sequence was compared to a widely available sequence database containing all known alleles that correspond to a specific number the resulting 7 digits number was then reduced to a single number that represents a sequence type strains with similar mlst sequence types are considered to share general genetic content of the conserved genome enright et al 2000 single locus spa typing used the sequence of the repeated region of the gene coding for staphylococcal protein a spa the sequence and order of specific repeats in this region of the spa gene were matched with unique numeric codes and used to classify the spa type of all s aureus strains strommenger et al 2008 presence of pvl was confirmed using a pcr assay already validated francois et al 2004 multilocus sequence typing analysis was performed using annotated genomes and submitted to the center for genomic epidemiology database available at http cge cbs dtu dk services mlst 2 4 genome sequencing and analysis dna was subjected to whole genome sequencing on the illumina hiseq 2500 illumina san diego ca usa using 100 bases reads with paired ends according to the truseq protocol illumina following the manufacturer s recommendations the quality of sequence reads was assessed with the fastqc program http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc and reads were quality filtered using the fastq mcf program ea utils https github com expressionanalysis ea utils blob wiki fastqmcf md genome assembly was performed using the edena v3 assembler hernandez et al 2013 with parameters as follows minimum read overlapping of 60 bp and minimum contig size retained of 500 bp assembled genomes were annotated using the prokka v1 10 program seemann 2014 with default values for blastp analysis and the e value threshold set to 10e 6 for accurate blastp analysis the get homologues pl script was used for core proteome comparisons contreras moreira and vinuesa 2013 the cvtree3 web server was used to perform the phylogenetic analysis xu and hao 2009 prokka annotation and blastp analysis were performed to identify specific genes involved in the phenotype evolution and virulence of the strain after a first attempt a minority of strains showed poor assembly results typically 1000 contigs with genome size of 4 megabases instead of 2 6 2 9 mb due to the presence of contaminating dna from proteus mirabilis a gram negative bacteria frequently identified in environmental samples this observation followed blast results of resulting contigs for samples showing unusual number of contigs after de novo assembly the genome of 4 p mirabilis strains identified from different locations and publicly available were used ensuring a sufficient representability of the species accession numbers cp021694 1 cp015347 1 cp004022 1 and cp017085 1 to subtract reads from the contaminant organisms by using clark v 1 2 3 2 using default parameters ounit et al 2015 resulting cleaned datasets were then subjected to a new analytical assembly attempts that showed improvement of results and a decrease in the number of contigs the phylogenetic relationship of isolates was investigated by genomic snp based analysis using s aureus core genome in the parsnp v1 0 program treangen et al 2014 briefly all snps identified in the common core genome of our strain collection were considered the blastp analysis was used to investigate the presence of specific genes involved in the phenotype evolution and virulence of the isolates additionally all published sets of sequencing reads from s aureus st8 isolates von dach et al 2015 were retrieved from a previous study enriched with some genomes of s aureus usa300 from american origin planet et al 2013 and included in the genome comparisons a cutoff value of 23 snps from 2 5 nucleotides was used for establishing an epidemiological link between the isolates as previously established von dach et al 2015 isolate genomes have been deposited at ena https www ebi ac uk ena under the following name prjeb29126 2 5 naming protocol for selected isolates the 18 selected isolates were sent for genomic analysis to a research lab in switzerland with only a number as an identifier in order to provide blind samples without reference to place date or sample type the genetic results were reported back with sa added to the original number sa1 to identify them as s aureus isolate 1 for the creation of easily interpretable spreadsheets and tables tables 4 6 the sa was followed by initials for the wwtp tb wh and sampling site in st eff for influent sedimentation tank and effluent respectively 3 results 3 1 enrichment and isolation of clean colonies of s aureus from sewage samples key to the goals of this research was the ability to effectively recover clean colonies of methicillin susceptible s aureus mssa and methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa from environmental samples without the presence of the commonly co cultured bacteria s epidermidis acriflavine acted as a growth suppressant for all laboratory strains of staphylococcus when added to mannitol salt agar but was markedly more effective on reducing growth of s epidermidis atcc29887 than the strains of mssa atcc25923 and mrsa baa2420 tested results from replicate bacterial stock titers plated on msa with and without acriflavine showed a significant reduction in the average number of colonies cultured for s epidermidis titer 65 with smaller reductions in methicillin susceptible s aureus mssa and methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa of 46 and 17 respectively pairwise multiple comparison between the strains by tukey testing showed significant differences only in the growth suppression of s epidermidis versus p 0 05 the mrsa strain table 1 the effectiveness of acriflavine suppression was further demonstrated in the absence of s epidermidis fema genes in dna extracts from the 18 selected s aureus isolates sent for sequencing quantitative pcr results produced on the isolates were negative for the fema gene in all 18 selected clones francois et al 2003 the absence of co growing s epidermidis in the isolates supports the use of acriflavine augmented enrichment media for selective enrichment and isolation of s aureus from complex sewage matrices however as was seen upon sequencing of the dna extracts obtained suppression was not complete as some bacteria were still capable of co growth with s aureus in suppressive media proteus mirabilis grew in the acriflavine augmented media appearing in 6 of the 18 selected isolates the genetic information for proteus mirabilis was removed in silico and a new assembly was performed however the sequence for one dna extract sa17 could not be reassembled leaving only 17 of the 18 isolates for typing and comparison as shown in table 2 proteus was detected in isolates obtained from both sewage treatment plants and suggests the need for further refinement of salt based suppressive media for isolation of s aureus from environmental samples 3 2 typing of s aureus sewage isolates there were three different clonal complexes cc and several mlst sequence types st identified for the sewage isolates obtained from the local wwtps based on the results of blastp analyses of whole genome sequencing for specific sequences and mlst of 7 housekeeping genes fig 1 and table 3 fig 1 shows only one isolate sa2 was typed as mlst cc59 st59 related to asian strains li et al 2016 and was found at the more urban town branch wwtp whose sewershed includes an airport multiple hospitals and a large university while the other 16 isolates had very close similarity and fell into two major mlst ccs cc5 and cc8 the mlst cc59 st59 varied in its core genome sequence greatly from all other isolates 14 000 snp and was not found to carry antibiotic resistance meca and panton valentine leukocidin pvl mobile genetic elements table 3 fig 2 the mlst cc59 st59 mssa isolate type was not found at the more suburban west hickman wwtp sewershed or at any other site during the time of study the other isolates were classified into two clonal complexes mlst cc8 usa 300 and usa700 lineage and mlst cc5 usa 100 lineage the length of the genomes from the isolates varied from 2 730 977 to 3 044 920 base pairs table 3 there were large differences 7 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the core genome sequence between cc5 and cc8 isolates however when comparing isolates within a single clonal complex against each other the snp differences were less than 1 000 with the exception of isolate sa10 whose mlst designation was cc8 st72 usa700 lineage this st72 mrsa isolate core genome sequence was at least 7 000 snp different from any other isolate even within the cc8 group fig 2 this isolate was also a singular event only occurring once during the period of sampling in west hickman wwtp influent the two mlst cc groupings cc8 and cc5 were found at both wwtps and some isolates carried the staphylococcal cassette chromosome associated with antibiotic resistance meca and pvl mobile genetic elements tables 4 and 5 in both cc5 and cc8 there were methicillin resistant isolates mrsa and methicillin susceptible isolates mssa based upon the carriage or lack of the meca gene however the cc8 isolates had greater meca and pvl carriage than cc5 the number of s aureus isolates recoverable from sewage from the suburban community sewershed of west hickman wwtp was greater than the urban hospital dominated sewershed of town branch wwtp the prevalence of the mobile genetic elements that encode for pvl in influent isolates was higher 41 than the reported prevalence in the global population of s aureus strains 1 5 tristan et al 2007 3 3 comparisons of s aureus sewage isolates to illuminate differences and similarities in presence persistence and genetic diversity differences in the prevalence for recoverable s aureus sewage isolates in the wwtps influent was observed as can be seen in tables 4 and 5 only a few isolates were found in the inlet to the urban town branch wwtp 3 of 17 recoverable over the 4 month sampling period and on only 2 of the 4 sampling days were any presumptive s aureus isolates enriched from this urban wwtp in contrast the suburban west hickman wwtp always yielded isolates and from multiple points across the process isolates of the cc5 and cc8 lineage appeared at both wwtps tables 4 and 5 with little difference in their core genetic sequences fig 2 and housekeeping genes table 3 but with some diversity in their spa types and the carriage of the mobile genetic elements meca and pvl tables 4 and 5 select comparisons of isolate characteristics are presented in table 6 three characteristics are compared between isolates similarity in sources persistence of a source over the time of study persistence of an isolate type through the treatment process and diversity of isolates with respect to spa type meca carriage and type and pvl carriage to determine if the sources impacting the two wwtps were similar 5 isolate pair comparisons were considered table 6 all pairings included an isolate from town branch wwtp compared against an isolate from west hickman wwtp that were collected on the same day of study all 5 isolate pairs had 610 snp differences between their core genomes and one pairing sa13 and sa18 had no snp differences suggesting that this pair of isolates were strictly clonal or may have an epidemiological link as defined by prior study snps below 23 of 2 5 million nucleotides von dach et al 2015 this is indicative of an identical source that is spread across the city and collected in the separate sewersheds all 5 pairs of isolates had the same mlst type all identifiable spa types were the same for the 5 paired isolates with the same results for meca presence and the type of cassette present the only differences seen in 3 of the 5 pairings was the additional carriage of the pvl gene from these results it appears that similar sources are feeding into both sewersheds and are spread across the city regardless of land use population density or hospital placement persistence of the isolate types can be noted in the city over time and through the water treatment processes at one wwtp west hickman table 6 presents a comparison between two mrsa isolates sa6 and sa16 found on different days over 4 months apart in time at the same treatment plant west hickman there is only 1 snp difference between the core genomes of sa6 and sa16 and their mlst classification meca presence and type and pvl carriage are the same these two isolates are homologous and are considered to have originated from the same progenitor cell type although separated by 4 months of time in the same sewershed and present at different points in the wwtp process one from the influent and one from the final sedimentation tank effluent this finding suggests that the original progenitor cell type persists either circulating in the population of the sewershed or in the treatment plant processes table 6 also shows a comparison between isolates found on the same day but before and after treatment sa15 and sa18 while the mlst allelic profile spa and absence of meca and pvl are consistent between these isolates found at the influent and final effluent of the west hickman wwtp there is a difference in the core genome of 598 snps so these mssa isolates would not be considered cloned from the same progenitor cell however the presence of such a similar cc5 st5 isolate in only 200 mls of both the influent raw untreated sewage and in the fully treated final effluent after chlorination at point of release into natural waters is suggestive of the ability of this type of s aureus to resist treatment even chlorination and persist outside of its original host it is possible that the isolates came from different hosts within the community and the relative point of isolation in the wwtp is not indicative of growth and change by passage through the treatment process however persistence in either the community hosts or the wwtp sludges would allow for related but diverging strains to circulate through the sewersheds wwtps and upon release the environment table 6 also presents comparisons that highlight the diversity in the carriage of mobile genetic elements spa types or snp differences between s aureus isolates found in the sewersheds and wwtps two mssa cc5 st5 isolates were detected in west hickman influent samples on the same day sa14 and sa15 with the same spa type protein t002 these two isolates had only 9 snp differences in their core genome and they were considered to be cloned from the same progenitor cell and typed as mlst cc5 st5 one isolate sa14 contained the mobile genetic element pvl while the other isolate sa15 did not the presence of these two homologous isolates from the same sample point isolated at the same time on the same day with differences in pvl presence suggests a potential for transference of mobile genetic elements in the population or in the collection systems of the sewershed where they come in contact with other bacteria carrying these elements another isolate comparison sa9 and sa12 with even less difference between the two core genomes 2 snp shows a different type of genetic diversity the two isolates classified as cc8 st2642 were found in west hickman influent on the same day contained pvl and meca but had different types of spa proteins t024 and t008 again in the influent on two separate days homologous clones were isolated that had differences in spa protein type denoting diversity in genetic makeup another comparison of less closely related cc5 st5 isolates sa4 and sa7 584 snp difference obtained from the same day of sampling but from two different wwtp sites displays even greater genetic diversity with differences in the spa protein type and meca presence supporting that diversity can be found clearly there is the potential for both mrsa and mssa to evolve either in the population hosts upon passage through the sewershed or passage through wwtp processes there were two occurrences where the meca presence in isolates coming off of the west hickman sedimentation tank was inconsistent with that of the majority of other influent isolates of that mlst cc group sa7 was the only member of the mlst cc5 st5 group of isolates obtained across the february to june sampling period that contained meca and was classified as mrsa instead of mssa all other mlst cc5 st5 isolates were mssa from the usa100 lineage sa7 had more than 584 snp difference when compared against any other mlst cc5 st5 isolate the mlst cc5 isolate group was very consistent in meca absence and t002 spa type with the exception of the single sa7 isolate obtained from sampling after the activated sludge treatment processes the mlst cc8 group of isolates in general was more diverse than the cc5 group and while most of the cc8 group carried meca the sa8 isolate from the sedimentation tank effluent did not contain meca and was the only cc8 isolate classified as mssa the sa8 isolate had more differences in the core genome when compared against the other cc8 isolates varying from 869 to 1051 snp and spa type t6671 both of these isolates sa7 and sa8 from the varying cc groups had unique spa types when compared to the other group members adding to the genetic diversity that was seen for these s aureus isolates from sewage that had undergone treatment in the west hickman plant the difference in carriage of mobile genetic elements could potentially have happened while passing through the treatment plant especially in conventional activated sludge processes where the mean cell residence time can range from 3 to 15 days and the microbial mass is dense replete with bacteriophage and contains multiple species of bacteria 4 discussion the consistent presence of s aureus in sewage samples from two local wastewater treatment plants in lexington kentucky confirmed the presence of mssa and mrsa in sewage and effluents from treatment processes in agreement with findings reported by prior studies börjesson et al 2009 2010 goldstein et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 however methicillin resistant s aureus prevalence was lower than expected from direct pcr results of prior study where 68 of pellets from sewage samples across a treatment plant were positive for meca börjesson et al 2009 of the clones isolated in this study from the 32 200 ml sewage samples collected at multiple sites across both wwtps and enriched prior to pelleting streaking and coagulase and elisa typing only 7 were positive for presumptive mrsa 22 and the majority of these were in the influent samples utilizing only influent samples where 5 of 12 200 ml volumes were positive for presumptive mrsa growth a most probable number mpn of viable presumptive mrsa was estimated by thomas s formula as 3 organisms l the prevalence of mssa in our study was greater 20 positive of 32 prevalence rate of 62 utilizing only influent samples where 8 of 12 200 ml volumes were positive for growth the estimated mpn of viable presumptive mssa in influent was 6 organisms l for the chlorinated effluent samples the estimated mpn of viable presumptive mssa was 0 4 organisms l there was a 93 3 removal of mssa across the wwtp in part this difference in prevalence was likely due to our method of isolation and enrichment of viable s aureus from liquid sewage samples prior to genetic probing the suppression of s epidermidis during enrichment and our use of whole genomic sequencing in combination with pcr for the identification of potential mges originating from the co growth of s epidermidis and other bacteria others have investigated bacteria in natural waters with multiplex pcr and found the meca gene present in p vulgaris m morganii and e faecalis and all of these organisms had been grown on selective baird parker agar and had presented appropriate colony phenotypes kassem et al 2008 our initial evaluation of commercially available selective broths and agars agreed with this study most of the bacteria that grew in baird parker broth and agar presenting appropriate colony phenotype were not coagulase positive and were not presumptive s aureus the addition of acriflavine to mannitol salt agar and broth was an improvement resulting in many fewer total isolates from sewage samples but more that were presumptive s aureus the presence of s epidermidis was suppressed in the acriflavine modified broths and agars which is critical for sequencing although p mirabilis was still able to co grow with s aureus in some of the isolates with suppression of s epidermidis the presence of the meca gene was more reliably able to differentiate mrsa from mssa in environmental samples our study showed a need to evaluate reported densities of mrsa with respect to the potential of the methods applied to generate false positives to avoid overestimation of mrsa prevalence recent investigations into hundreds of isolates have documented that s aureus and s epidermidis not only grow together in the same niches on the body they share over 1 400 genes an amount that corresponds to over 50 of the average genome complement for either bacteria méric et al 2015 due to this overlap and the rapidity with which s aureus evolves and adapts to environmental pressures it is critical to design genetic detection and classification strategies that avoid utilizing mobile and highly variable regions of the genome like meca francois and schrenzel 2008 and to utilize more of the genome to corroborate pcr findings it has been recommended that presumptive s aureus isolate extracts be scanned for the presence of the fema gene from s epidermidis to allow accurate discrimination between the two species of bacteria francois et al 2003 von dach et al 2015 it is our advice to other researchers to screen by pcr for fema or another s epidermidis specific marker prior to further genomic investigation of environmental isolates in this way one can preclude misclassification and false positive mrsa prevalence that would be associated when classifying an isolate where mssa is co growing with s epidermidis containing meca the predominant s aureus types isolated were related to the reported types known to circulate in the usa and were related to the usa300 mlst cc 8 and usa100 mlst cc5 lineages isolate types with very similar genomic makeup were detected in influent throughout the time of study simultaneously at both wwtps this is suggestive of an endemic presence of similar sources of s aureus across the whole city feeding into the wwtps influent the presence of the mobile genetic element pvl was only found in influent samples and its prevalence was greater in the usa300 lineage mlst cc8 than the usa100 lineage mlst cc5 which is the same as reported for 366 clinical isolates by others o hara et al 2016 the pvl prevalence in our usa100 lineage mlst cc5 influent isolates was greater than reported for clinical samples 25 vs 0 and less in our influent isolates for the usa300 lineage mlst cc8 50 vs 95 o hara et al 2016 this is suggestive of the continuing evolution of these bacteria there did not appear to be any positive correlation between the number of hospitals in the sewersheds and s aureus prevalence indeed there appeared to be a negative correlation with the town branch sewershed reporting 10 times the number of inpatient days year yet having the lowest prevalence of s aureus isolation it is unknown why wwtps of similar size but with dissimilar amounts of waste input from hospital sources would have a difference in s aureus prevalence but it is speculated that hospital cleaning products and protocols may be reducing the presence of sewage microbes more effectively than in residential business areas of the city the even distribution of the strain types between the sewersheds may be correlated with the large number of hospital associated employees in lexington a city of 318 449 people with a reported ratio of 2 7 acute care hospital beds for every 1000 people which is above the national average for a regional health center in a sparsely populated regions 2 0 beds for every 1000 people healthcare tda 2016 for our area of study with large numbers of hospital workers travelling between the two sewersheds presumably carrying different strains of s aureus on or in their person there appears to be no meaning to the terms hospital or community acquired s aureus carriage with respect to the presence of the cc5 and cc8 clonal types of s aureus in sewage based on our findings it is suggested that researchers utilize more of the s aureus genome and multiple typing methods to fully capture the changes that occur to s aureus when it is transported through the environment especially for the purpose of investigating potential evolution in engineered systems like a wwtp many typing methods like pcr use a small fraction of the genome yet a more robust characterization can be obtained by looking at the entire genome and combining spa typing with mlst typing snp changes of a core genome and the presence and types of mobile genetic elements in comparing isolates with high similarity in their core genomes snp we observed diversity in the types of protein a and mobile genetic elements meca pvl present in contrast to o hara et al 2016 who proposed replacing mlst with spa typing due to their overlapping cc typing results we found spa typing combined with mlst and snp analysis of the core genome useful in highlighting genetic divergence in some cases the core genome had limited snp differences 0 600 and the mlst cc was the same but changes in spa type and carriage of mobile genetic elements outside of the focus regions of mlst and core genome analysis revealed genetic diversity in strain types this robust approach may be useful to track evolution in the population sewershed and wwtp environments based on our results we propose the use of a combined scheme that incorporates core genome comparison mlst spa typing and identification of select mobile genetic elements to investigate environmental evolution in wwtps the system we envision applying would consider isolates of s aureus from the inlet of the wwtp and across bioactive processes like activated sludge where biological and bacteriophage density is high to evaluate genomic changes with an understanding of the relative rates of change for the selected elements in s aureus changes in the s aureus core genome and resultant mlst type should change slowly while spa and other mges will change more quickly in response to environmental pressures if comparison of s aureus isolates sharing similarity in their core genome and mlst type repeatedly demonstrates changes in the faster evolving genomic elements of these isolates after biological treatment support for s aureus evolution in the wwtp can be garnered utilizing the most commonly isolated mlst cc type from the influent and obtaining isolates after biological treatment with similar core genome and mlst types will enable comparison of the change in pathogenic state reflected in changes in spa type and mges such as meca and pvl detecting alteration in these evolving mges among s aureus isolates of the same mlst type could assess if co culture with other organisms in the wwtp environs results in altered virulence of s aureus ramsey et al 2016 found that co culture of s aureus with corynebacterium species reduced s aureus virulence we found two isolates sa7 and sa8 of the dominant clonal complexes mlst cc5 and mlst cc8 after treatment in activated sludge that exhibited atypical spa types t888 and t6671 respectively and had more than 500 snp difference in core genome when compared to the predominant influent isolates which suggests the evolution of these isolate through biological treatment however much more research needs to be done to determine if genetic changes in isolates trend towards a gain or loss of virulence as they move through the treatment process in our data isolates recovered after activated sludge treatment differed in their carriage of virulent mges when compared to influent isolates of the same clonal colony isolate sa7 cc5 was different from the predominant influent cc5 isolates in meca carriage isolate sa8 cc8 no longer carried meca and pvl mges when compared to wwtp cc8 influent isolates there is ample reason to continue to evaluate the impact of biological treatment processes for potential changes in the virulence of pathogenic organisms input into sewersheds wwtps and the role these facilities play in the transmission of evolved pathogens in the environment wastewater effluent has allowable numbers of gram negative coliforms established by permitting processes and chlorine based disinfection processes that are designed to reduce coliforms in wastewater effluents are not as effective against gram positive bacteria like s aureus therefore wwtps can be an anticipated source of s aureus in the environment the presence of viable s aureus in a small volume 200 ml of effluent could be extrapolated to the release of 5 5 108 organisms each day into the receiving stream assuming a consistent concentration and a single bacterium in the sample volume in the environment s aureus has been shown to persist in waters and sediments longer than coliforms levin edens et al 2012 so their presence in the environment could be undetected in the sediments of the receiving streams where conditions enhance survival contact could provide transmission to new hosts 5 conclusions it is paramount that we understand the true prevalence fate and transport of s aureus through our sewersheds treatment processes and streams so that treatment strategies are optimized to protect people and other potential hosts from needless infection and disease with current information it is difficult to evaluate the exact dimensions of the potential health risks related to engineered sewer systems especially with methods that do not prevent the growth of closely related bacteria that share the mges used to identify mrsa our results support the need for more coordinated investigations based on analyses that provide a robust degree of resolution prevent false positives and utilize more of the epidemiological approaches and genetic typing methods than have been applied to these systems in the past this study has provided new methodology for the enrichment and isolation of s aureus from complex environmental samples that resulted in the identification of two dominant clonal complexes cc5 hospital related and cc8 community related in the sewersheds and wwtps of lexington ky the presence of multiple hospitals feeding into one of the wwtps did not have an impact on the presence or type of isolate recovered as both clonal lineages were isolated from both wwtps the presence of both isolates persisted across treatment although greater than one log removal was observed between the influent and sedimentation tank effluent for two isolates obtained after treatment there was genetic diversity observed in the spa type and carriage of mges suggesting that treatment provides an opportunity for evolution and genetic shifts the isolation of viable s aureus at all sites across a treatment plant and in fully treated effluent suggests that wwtps may well serve as reservoirs and continuous sources for the introduction of potentially pathogenic s aureus into our environment declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18818,infections with staphylococcus aureus are being spread through contact with the community environment but the role of wastewater treatment plants in the transmission routes is not defined this study investigated the prevalence types genetic elements and potential for transmission of s aureus by these engineered systems synchronized sampling events at two wastewater treatment plants were conducted with isolates of s aureus obtained by a selective enrichment method using acriflavine that suppressed staphylococcus epidermidis growth dna was extracted from a subset of the s aureus isolates checked by pcr to assure the absence of s epidermidis and sequenced to determine the multilocus sequence type spa type and carriage of the methicillin resistance and panton valentine leukocidin genetic elements sequences were analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphism differences in pairwise comparison of isolates there were two dominant s aureus clonal complexes identified in the isolates one commonly identified as hospital related cc5 and one community related cc8 both types of isolates were found at both treatment facilities even though only one facility had significant hospital sewage inputs the presence of s aureus persisted through treatment with some isolates recovered from the final processes showing genetic diversity the presence of the panton valentine leukocidin genetic element was greater than the 1 5 expected from global reports our results suggest that treatment provides an opportunity for genetic shift while the persistence and release of evolved strains of s aureus may provide an environmentally relevant pathway to new hosts in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage mrsa typing mobile genetic elements nucleotides wastewater treatment 1 introduction staphylococcus aureus is one of a group of bacteria that has been shown to colonize the nose of approximately 30 of the human population chambers and deleo 2009 but infections by community acquired antibiotic resistant s aureus are an emerging global epidemic grundmann et al 2006 in the united states methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa infections occurred at a rate of 18 8 per 100 000 people in 2015 were associated with serious complications like infective endocarditis osteomyelitis and sepsis and a retrospective study of hospital costs resulting from mrsa infections averaged 34 657 per patient in the minneapolis area and 113 852 per patient in rhode island ortwine and bhavan 2018 s aureus has developed rapid resistance to almost every antibiotic in use by acquiring mobile genetic elements from its surroundings and less frequently by gene mutation penicillin resistant s aureus was first isolated in the 1940s and by the 1960s s aureus had acquired the meca gene and broad spectrum resistance to all beta lactam antibiotics including penicillins cabapenems and methicillin these methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa strains initially originated in the hospital setting hospital acquired mrsa or ha mrsa but increasingly community acquired mrsa ca mrsa strains have emerged as the cause of skin and soft tissue infections early methods for the classification of mrsa identified strains by their country usa uk sweden etc or setting of origin ca mrsa or ha mrsa further development in genetic analyses has allowed for classification based on distinct regions of the s aureus chromosome multilocus sequence typing mlst compares partial sequences of seven housekeeping genes and is useful for measuring long term evolution of mrsa s aureus strains having identical sequences at all seven genes are grouped into the same sequence type st while strains differing by a single nucleotide polymorphism snp in less than three of the seven genes are grouped into a clonal complex cc enright et al 2000 strains can be further classified based on the presence absence of the beta lactam resistance gene meca in mrsa or methicillin sensitive s aureus mssa respectively spa typing is an inexpensive way to categorize s aureus based on the number of tandem repeats and point mutations in a single locus of the s aureus genome the staphylococcal protein a or spa gene fenner et al 2008 discriminatory power of spa type is quite high and the method is adapted to the short term evolution of clinical isolates of s aureus epidemics of s aureus infection have been described as waves of increasing resistance to antibiotics and the presence of virulence factors as a result of the uptake of mobile genetic elements mges from the environment chambers and deleo 2009 current mrsa epidemics evolved from six different ccs cc1 cc5 cc8 cc22 cc30 and cc45 cockfield et al 2007 in the united states the most common ha mrsa infections are caused by usa100 cc5 st5 whereas usa300 cc8 st8 causes the most ca mrsa infections diep et al 2004 miller and diep 2008 usa300 strains frequently contain the virulence factor panton valentine leukocidin pvl which likely enables ca mrsa infections in otherwise healthy individuals kazakova et al 2005 the continual evolution of s aureus makes the identification of clones and their lineage essential for categorizing isolated mrsa and mssa strains to date the study of antibiotic resistant s aureus has focused largely on the hospital setting although the presence of antibiotic resistance elements in wastewaters and their transfer between environmental reservoirs and human pathogens has been observed and reported baquero et al 2008 miller et al 2016 munck et al 2015 schmieder and edwards 2012 the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize s aureus strains by whole genomic sequencing from two wastewater treatment plants wwtps one urban and one suburban in order to better understand the impacts of sewershed sources on the types and distribution of s aureus determine if sewage treatment processes have an effect on the adaptation of s aureus and assess the potential for release of viable s aureus in treated effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites sewage samples were collected from two activated sludge based wwtps in lexington kentucky town branch tb wwtp collects urban sewage from high density apartments several hospitals a prison an airport the university of kentucky and multiple industrial companies located centrally and to the north of the city tb has an average daily flow of 19 8 million gallons per day mgd and design capacity of 30 mgd the total resident population feeding to tb is about 121 836 but due to the multiple major hospitals in this sewershed sewage is also generated from a transitory population inhabiting 1 646 beds for a total of 363 837 inpatient days per year kentucky health facts 2011 west hickman wh wwtp has a design capacity of 33 9 mgd with an average daily flow of 20 4 mgd from the expanding suburban sprawl in south part of the city the total residential population supplying wh is about 164 940 with an additional transitory population inhabiting 152 beds for a total of 30 576 inpatient days per year kentucky health facts 2011 grab samples were collected from these two wwtps from the untreated influents the effluents of the sedimentation tank final clarifier after activated sludge treatment and the final chlorinated effluents samples were taken in the morning 9 00 10 00 a m on the same days to provide a snapshot in time samples were taken on 6 days between february and june but 2 sampling events did not produce presumptive s aureus isolates from any of the samples collected 2 2 selective enrichment and isolation of staphylococcus aureus one liter of samples from three different sample sites within the wwtps were transferred on ice to the environmental research and training laboratories ertl at the university of kentucky and processed within 12 h of collection samples were passed through sterile stainless steel tea strainers to remove large particles then 200 ml of the strained sample was centrifuged at 3 700 g for 10 min to sediment bacteria the supernatant was discarded and the pellet enriched with an equal volume of 2 mannitol salt broth msb that had been augmented to a final strength of 0 0165 mg ml acriflavine acros organics 75 iu ml polymyxin b oxoid and 3 5 potassium tellurite oxoid acriflavine was added to suppress co growing staphylococcus epidermidis davis et al 2006 polymyxin b was added to suppress the growth of gram negative bacteria potassium tellurite was added to enhance s aureus respiration and provide a visual growth signal black precipitant the pellet broth mixture was vortexed and incubated at 37 c for 48 h cultures with a black color were centrifuged at 3 700 g for 10 min the bulk of the supernatant discarded and the pellet spread onto petri dishes containing mannitol salt agar msa augmented with 0 0165 mg ml acriflavine these pellet spread plates were transferred back to the incubator 37 c and incubated for 48 h yellow colonies were considered to be presumptive s aureus and at least 10 colonies or up to 10 of all presumptive colonies were re streaked onto new acriflavine augmented msa petri dishes to create single colony clones for further testing the coagulase cryo hardy diagnostics test was used to verify colonies as coagulase positive coagulase positive colonies were subjected to elisa testing mrsa latex test denka seiken japan to verify the presence of the penicillin binding protein responsible for beta lactamines resistance a positive elisa confirmed the selected s aureus isolate as presumptive mrsa while a negative elisa result was classified as presumptive mssa a subset of isolates from different days and from different processes was selected for regrowth prior to pcr and whole genomic sequencing all selected s aureus isolates were inoculated into acriflavine augmented msb incubated at 37 c for 48 h and frozen at 80 c until dna extraction genomic dna obtained from broth cultured colony isolates was purified using the dneasy kit qiagen courtaboeuf france dna content of 50 μl extract aliquots was measured by nano drop then extracts were shipped on ice to the university of geneva genomic research laboratory in switzerland for whole genome sequencing 2 3 bacterial isolate strain characterization a molecular assay previously developed and validated was used to complete the characterization of collected s aureus isolates a triplex quantitative pcr assay targeting species specific genes allowed for the detection of s epidermidis or s aureus as well as the presence of the meca gene francois et al 2003 in extracts and was used to confirm the in silico determination obtained from whole genome sequencing information the genetic information was used to type the isolates by application of two standardized methods both methods relied upon identification of specific dna sequences for specified gene fragments two typing approaches were applied mlst and spa sub typing to the s aureus isolate dna mlst consisted of amplification and sequencing parts of 7 essential house keeping genes with known mutation frequencies each sequence was compared to a widely available sequence database containing all known alleles that correspond to a specific number the resulting 7 digits number was then reduced to a single number that represents a sequence type strains with similar mlst sequence types are considered to share general genetic content of the conserved genome enright et al 2000 single locus spa typing used the sequence of the repeated region of the gene coding for staphylococcal protein a spa the sequence and order of specific repeats in this region of the spa gene were matched with unique numeric codes and used to classify the spa type of all s aureus strains strommenger et al 2008 presence of pvl was confirmed using a pcr assay already validated francois et al 2004 multilocus sequence typing analysis was performed using annotated genomes and submitted to the center for genomic epidemiology database available at http cge cbs dtu dk services mlst 2 4 genome sequencing and analysis dna was subjected to whole genome sequencing on the illumina hiseq 2500 illumina san diego ca usa using 100 bases reads with paired ends according to the truseq protocol illumina following the manufacturer s recommendations the quality of sequence reads was assessed with the fastqc program http www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc and reads were quality filtered using the fastq mcf program ea utils https github com expressionanalysis ea utils blob wiki fastqmcf md genome assembly was performed using the edena v3 assembler hernandez et al 2013 with parameters as follows minimum read overlapping of 60 bp and minimum contig size retained of 500 bp assembled genomes were annotated using the prokka v1 10 program seemann 2014 with default values for blastp analysis and the e value threshold set to 10e 6 for accurate blastp analysis the get homologues pl script was used for core proteome comparisons contreras moreira and vinuesa 2013 the cvtree3 web server was used to perform the phylogenetic analysis xu and hao 2009 prokka annotation and blastp analysis were performed to identify specific genes involved in the phenotype evolution and virulence of the strain after a first attempt a minority of strains showed poor assembly results typically 1000 contigs with genome size of 4 megabases instead of 2 6 2 9 mb due to the presence of contaminating dna from proteus mirabilis a gram negative bacteria frequently identified in environmental samples this observation followed blast results of resulting contigs for samples showing unusual number of contigs after de novo assembly the genome of 4 p mirabilis strains identified from different locations and publicly available were used ensuring a sufficient representability of the species accession numbers cp021694 1 cp015347 1 cp004022 1 and cp017085 1 to subtract reads from the contaminant organisms by using clark v 1 2 3 2 using default parameters ounit et al 2015 resulting cleaned datasets were then subjected to a new analytical assembly attempts that showed improvement of results and a decrease in the number of contigs the phylogenetic relationship of isolates was investigated by genomic snp based analysis using s aureus core genome in the parsnp v1 0 program treangen et al 2014 briefly all snps identified in the common core genome of our strain collection were considered the blastp analysis was used to investigate the presence of specific genes involved in the phenotype evolution and virulence of the isolates additionally all published sets of sequencing reads from s aureus st8 isolates von dach et al 2015 were retrieved from a previous study enriched with some genomes of s aureus usa300 from american origin planet et al 2013 and included in the genome comparisons a cutoff value of 23 snps from 2 5 nucleotides was used for establishing an epidemiological link between the isolates as previously established von dach et al 2015 isolate genomes have been deposited at ena https www ebi ac uk ena under the following name prjeb29126 2 5 naming protocol for selected isolates the 18 selected isolates were sent for genomic analysis to a research lab in switzerland with only a number as an identifier in order to provide blind samples without reference to place date or sample type the genetic results were reported back with sa added to the original number sa1 to identify them as s aureus isolate 1 for the creation of easily interpretable spreadsheets and tables tables 4 6 the sa was followed by initials for the wwtp tb wh and sampling site in st eff for influent sedimentation tank and effluent respectively 3 results 3 1 enrichment and isolation of clean colonies of s aureus from sewage samples key to the goals of this research was the ability to effectively recover clean colonies of methicillin susceptible s aureus mssa and methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa from environmental samples without the presence of the commonly co cultured bacteria s epidermidis acriflavine acted as a growth suppressant for all laboratory strains of staphylococcus when added to mannitol salt agar but was markedly more effective on reducing growth of s epidermidis atcc29887 than the strains of mssa atcc25923 and mrsa baa2420 tested results from replicate bacterial stock titers plated on msa with and without acriflavine showed a significant reduction in the average number of colonies cultured for s epidermidis titer 65 with smaller reductions in methicillin susceptible s aureus mssa and methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa of 46 and 17 respectively pairwise multiple comparison between the strains by tukey testing showed significant differences only in the growth suppression of s epidermidis versus p 0 05 the mrsa strain table 1 the effectiveness of acriflavine suppression was further demonstrated in the absence of s epidermidis fema genes in dna extracts from the 18 selected s aureus isolates sent for sequencing quantitative pcr results produced on the isolates were negative for the fema gene in all 18 selected clones francois et al 2003 the absence of co growing s epidermidis in the isolates supports the use of acriflavine augmented enrichment media for selective enrichment and isolation of s aureus from complex sewage matrices however as was seen upon sequencing of the dna extracts obtained suppression was not complete as some bacteria were still capable of co growth with s aureus in suppressive media proteus mirabilis grew in the acriflavine augmented media appearing in 6 of the 18 selected isolates the genetic information for proteus mirabilis was removed in silico and a new assembly was performed however the sequence for one dna extract sa17 could not be reassembled leaving only 17 of the 18 isolates for typing and comparison as shown in table 2 proteus was detected in isolates obtained from both sewage treatment plants and suggests the need for further refinement of salt based suppressive media for isolation of s aureus from environmental samples 3 2 typing of s aureus sewage isolates there were three different clonal complexes cc and several mlst sequence types st identified for the sewage isolates obtained from the local wwtps based on the results of blastp analyses of whole genome sequencing for specific sequences and mlst of 7 housekeeping genes fig 1 and table 3 fig 1 shows only one isolate sa2 was typed as mlst cc59 st59 related to asian strains li et al 2016 and was found at the more urban town branch wwtp whose sewershed includes an airport multiple hospitals and a large university while the other 16 isolates had very close similarity and fell into two major mlst ccs cc5 and cc8 the mlst cc59 st59 varied in its core genome sequence greatly from all other isolates 14 000 snp and was not found to carry antibiotic resistance meca and panton valentine leukocidin pvl mobile genetic elements table 3 fig 2 the mlst cc59 st59 mssa isolate type was not found at the more suburban west hickman wwtp sewershed or at any other site during the time of study the other isolates were classified into two clonal complexes mlst cc8 usa 300 and usa700 lineage and mlst cc5 usa 100 lineage the length of the genomes from the isolates varied from 2 730 977 to 3 044 920 base pairs table 3 there were large differences 7 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the core genome sequence between cc5 and cc8 isolates however when comparing isolates within a single clonal complex against each other the snp differences were less than 1 000 with the exception of isolate sa10 whose mlst designation was cc8 st72 usa700 lineage this st72 mrsa isolate core genome sequence was at least 7 000 snp different from any other isolate even within the cc8 group fig 2 this isolate was also a singular event only occurring once during the period of sampling in west hickman wwtp influent the two mlst cc groupings cc8 and cc5 were found at both wwtps and some isolates carried the staphylococcal cassette chromosome associated with antibiotic resistance meca and pvl mobile genetic elements tables 4 and 5 in both cc5 and cc8 there were methicillin resistant isolates mrsa and methicillin susceptible isolates mssa based upon the carriage or lack of the meca gene however the cc8 isolates had greater meca and pvl carriage than cc5 the number of s aureus isolates recoverable from sewage from the suburban community sewershed of west hickman wwtp was greater than the urban hospital dominated sewershed of town branch wwtp the prevalence of the mobile genetic elements that encode for pvl in influent isolates was higher 41 than the reported prevalence in the global population of s aureus strains 1 5 tristan et al 2007 3 3 comparisons of s aureus sewage isolates to illuminate differences and similarities in presence persistence and genetic diversity differences in the prevalence for recoverable s aureus sewage isolates in the wwtps influent was observed as can be seen in tables 4 and 5 only a few isolates were found in the inlet to the urban town branch wwtp 3 of 17 recoverable over the 4 month sampling period and on only 2 of the 4 sampling days were any presumptive s aureus isolates enriched from this urban wwtp in contrast the suburban west hickman wwtp always yielded isolates and from multiple points across the process isolates of the cc5 and cc8 lineage appeared at both wwtps tables 4 and 5 with little difference in their core genetic sequences fig 2 and housekeeping genes table 3 but with some diversity in their spa types and the carriage of the mobile genetic elements meca and pvl tables 4 and 5 select comparisons of isolate characteristics are presented in table 6 three characteristics are compared between isolates similarity in sources persistence of a source over the time of study persistence of an isolate type through the treatment process and diversity of isolates with respect to spa type meca carriage and type and pvl carriage to determine if the sources impacting the two wwtps were similar 5 isolate pair comparisons were considered table 6 all pairings included an isolate from town branch wwtp compared against an isolate from west hickman wwtp that were collected on the same day of study all 5 isolate pairs had 610 snp differences between their core genomes and one pairing sa13 and sa18 had no snp differences suggesting that this pair of isolates were strictly clonal or may have an epidemiological link as defined by prior study snps below 23 of 2 5 million nucleotides von dach et al 2015 this is indicative of an identical source that is spread across the city and collected in the separate sewersheds all 5 pairs of isolates had the same mlst type all identifiable spa types were the same for the 5 paired isolates with the same results for meca presence and the type of cassette present the only differences seen in 3 of the 5 pairings was the additional carriage of the pvl gene from these results it appears that similar sources are feeding into both sewersheds and are spread across the city regardless of land use population density or hospital placement persistence of the isolate types can be noted in the city over time and through the water treatment processes at one wwtp west hickman table 6 presents a comparison between two mrsa isolates sa6 and sa16 found on different days over 4 months apart in time at the same treatment plant west hickman there is only 1 snp difference between the core genomes of sa6 and sa16 and their mlst classification meca presence and type and pvl carriage are the same these two isolates are homologous and are considered to have originated from the same progenitor cell type although separated by 4 months of time in the same sewershed and present at different points in the wwtp process one from the influent and one from the final sedimentation tank effluent this finding suggests that the original progenitor cell type persists either circulating in the population of the sewershed or in the treatment plant processes table 6 also shows a comparison between isolates found on the same day but before and after treatment sa15 and sa18 while the mlst allelic profile spa and absence of meca and pvl are consistent between these isolates found at the influent and final effluent of the west hickman wwtp there is a difference in the core genome of 598 snps so these mssa isolates would not be considered cloned from the same progenitor cell however the presence of such a similar cc5 st5 isolate in only 200 mls of both the influent raw untreated sewage and in the fully treated final effluent after chlorination at point of release into natural waters is suggestive of the ability of this type of s aureus to resist treatment even chlorination and persist outside of its original host it is possible that the isolates came from different hosts within the community and the relative point of isolation in the wwtp is not indicative of growth and change by passage through the treatment process however persistence in either the community hosts or the wwtp sludges would allow for related but diverging strains to circulate through the sewersheds wwtps and upon release the environment table 6 also presents comparisons that highlight the diversity in the carriage of mobile genetic elements spa types or snp differences between s aureus isolates found in the sewersheds and wwtps two mssa cc5 st5 isolates were detected in west hickman influent samples on the same day sa14 and sa15 with the same spa type protein t002 these two isolates had only 9 snp differences in their core genome and they were considered to be cloned from the same progenitor cell and typed as mlst cc5 st5 one isolate sa14 contained the mobile genetic element pvl while the other isolate sa15 did not the presence of these two homologous isolates from the same sample point isolated at the same time on the same day with differences in pvl presence suggests a potential for transference of mobile genetic elements in the population or in the collection systems of the sewershed where they come in contact with other bacteria carrying these elements another isolate comparison sa9 and sa12 with even less difference between the two core genomes 2 snp shows a different type of genetic diversity the two isolates classified as cc8 st2642 were found in west hickman influent on the same day contained pvl and meca but had different types of spa proteins t024 and t008 again in the influent on two separate days homologous clones were isolated that had differences in spa protein type denoting diversity in genetic makeup another comparison of less closely related cc5 st5 isolates sa4 and sa7 584 snp difference obtained from the same day of sampling but from two different wwtp sites displays even greater genetic diversity with differences in the spa protein type and meca presence supporting that diversity can be found clearly there is the potential for both mrsa and mssa to evolve either in the population hosts upon passage through the sewershed or passage through wwtp processes there were two occurrences where the meca presence in isolates coming off of the west hickman sedimentation tank was inconsistent with that of the majority of other influent isolates of that mlst cc group sa7 was the only member of the mlst cc5 st5 group of isolates obtained across the february to june sampling period that contained meca and was classified as mrsa instead of mssa all other mlst cc5 st5 isolates were mssa from the usa100 lineage sa7 had more than 584 snp difference when compared against any other mlst cc5 st5 isolate the mlst cc5 isolate group was very consistent in meca absence and t002 spa type with the exception of the single sa7 isolate obtained from sampling after the activated sludge treatment processes the mlst cc8 group of isolates in general was more diverse than the cc5 group and while most of the cc8 group carried meca the sa8 isolate from the sedimentation tank effluent did not contain meca and was the only cc8 isolate classified as mssa the sa8 isolate had more differences in the core genome when compared against the other cc8 isolates varying from 869 to 1051 snp and spa type t6671 both of these isolates sa7 and sa8 from the varying cc groups had unique spa types when compared to the other group members adding to the genetic diversity that was seen for these s aureus isolates from sewage that had undergone treatment in the west hickman plant the difference in carriage of mobile genetic elements could potentially have happened while passing through the treatment plant especially in conventional activated sludge processes where the mean cell residence time can range from 3 to 15 days and the microbial mass is dense replete with bacteriophage and contains multiple species of bacteria 4 discussion the consistent presence of s aureus in sewage samples from two local wastewater treatment plants in lexington kentucky confirmed the presence of mssa and mrsa in sewage and effluents from treatment processes in agreement with findings reported by prior studies börjesson et al 2009 2010 goldstein et al 2012 thompson et al 2013 however methicillin resistant s aureus prevalence was lower than expected from direct pcr results of prior study where 68 of pellets from sewage samples across a treatment plant were positive for meca börjesson et al 2009 of the clones isolated in this study from the 32 200 ml sewage samples collected at multiple sites across both wwtps and enriched prior to pelleting streaking and coagulase and elisa typing only 7 were positive for presumptive mrsa 22 and the majority of these were in the influent samples utilizing only influent samples where 5 of 12 200 ml volumes were positive for presumptive mrsa growth a most probable number mpn of viable presumptive mrsa was estimated by thomas s formula as 3 organisms l the prevalence of mssa in our study was greater 20 positive of 32 prevalence rate of 62 utilizing only influent samples where 8 of 12 200 ml volumes were positive for growth the estimated mpn of viable presumptive mssa in influent was 6 organisms l for the chlorinated effluent samples the estimated mpn of viable presumptive mssa was 0 4 organisms l there was a 93 3 removal of mssa across the wwtp in part this difference in prevalence was likely due to our method of isolation and enrichment of viable s aureus from liquid sewage samples prior to genetic probing the suppression of s epidermidis during enrichment and our use of whole genomic sequencing in combination with pcr for the identification of potential mges originating from the co growth of s epidermidis and other bacteria others have investigated bacteria in natural waters with multiplex pcr and found the meca gene present in p vulgaris m morganii and e faecalis and all of these organisms had been grown on selective baird parker agar and had presented appropriate colony phenotypes kassem et al 2008 our initial evaluation of commercially available selective broths and agars agreed with this study most of the bacteria that grew in baird parker broth and agar presenting appropriate colony phenotype were not coagulase positive and were not presumptive s aureus the addition of acriflavine to mannitol salt agar and broth was an improvement resulting in many fewer total isolates from sewage samples but more that were presumptive s aureus the presence of s epidermidis was suppressed in the acriflavine modified broths and agars which is critical for sequencing although p mirabilis was still able to co grow with s aureus in some of the isolates with suppression of s epidermidis the presence of the meca gene was more reliably able to differentiate mrsa from mssa in environmental samples our study showed a need to evaluate reported densities of mrsa with respect to the potential of the methods applied to generate false positives to avoid overestimation of mrsa prevalence recent investigations into hundreds of isolates have documented that s aureus and s epidermidis not only grow together in the same niches on the body they share over 1 400 genes an amount that corresponds to over 50 of the average genome complement for either bacteria méric et al 2015 due to this overlap and the rapidity with which s aureus evolves and adapts to environmental pressures it is critical to design genetic detection and classification strategies that avoid utilizing mobile and highly variable regions of the genome like meca francois and schrenzel 2008 and to utilize more of the genome to corroborate pcr findings it has been recommended that presumptive s aureus isolate extracts be scanned for the presence of the fema gene from s epidermidis to allow accurate discrimination between the two species of bacteria francois et al 2003 von dach et al 2015 it is our advice to other researchers to screen by pcr for fema or another s epidermidis specific marker prior to further genomic investigation of environmental isolates in this way one can preclude misclassification and false positive mrsa prevalence that would be associated when classifying an isolate where mssa is co growing with s epidermidis containing meca the predominant s aureus types isolated were related to the reported types known to circulate in the usa and were related to the usa300 mlst cc 8 and usa100 mlst cc5 lineages isolate types with very similar genomic makeup were detected in influent throughout the time of study simultaneously at both wwtps this is suggestive of an endemic presence of similar sources of s aureus across the whole city feeding into the wwtps influent the presence of the mobile genetic element pvl was only found in influent samples and its prevalence was greater in the usa300 lineage mlst cc8 than the usa100 lineage mlst cc5 which is the same as reported for 366 clinical isolates by others o hara et al 2016 the pvl prevalence in our usa100 lineage mlst cc5 influent isolates was greater than reported for clinical samples 25 vs 0 and less in our influent isolates for the usa300 lineage mlst cc8 50 vs 95 o hara et al 2016 this is suggestive of the continuing evolution of these bacteria there did not appear to be any positive correlation between the number of hospitals in the sewersheds and s aureus prevalence indeed there appeared to be a negative correlation with the town branch sewershed reporting 10 times the number of inpatient days year yet having the lowest prevalence of s aureus isolation it is unknown why wwtps of similar size but with dissimilar amounts of waste input from hospital sources would have a difference in s aureus prevalence but it is speculated that hospital cleaning products and protocols may be reducing the presence of sewage microbes more effectively than in residential business areas of the city the even distribution of the strain types between the sewersheds may be correlated with the large number of hospital associated employees in lexington a city of 318 449 people with a reported ratio of 2 7 acute care hospital beds for every 1000 people which is above the national average for a regional health center in a sparsely populated regions 2 0 beds for every 1000 people healthcare tda 2016 for our area of study with large numbers of hospital workers travelling between the two sewersheds presumably carrying different strains of s aureus on or in their person there appears to be no meaning to the terms hospital or community acquired s aureus carriage with respect to the presence of the cc5 and cc8 clonal types of s aureus in sewage based on our findings it is suggested that researchers utilize more of the s aureus genome and multiple typing methods to fully capture the changes that occur to s aureus when it is transported through the environment especially for the purpose of investigating potential evolution in engineered systems like a wwtp many typing methods like pcr use a small fraction of the genome yet a more robust characterization can be obtained by looking at the entire genome and combining spa typing with mlst typing snp changes of a core genome and the presence and types of mobile genetic elements in comparing isolates with high similarity in their core genomes snp we observed diversity in the types of protein a and mobile genetic elements meca pvl present in contrast to o hara et al 2016 who proposed replacing mlst with spa typing due to their overlapping cc typing results we found spa typing combined with mlst and snp analysis of the core genome useful in highlighting genetic divergence in some cases the core genome had limited snp differences 0 600 and the mlst cc was the same but changes in spa type and carriage of mobile genetic elements outside of the focus regions of mlst and core genome analysis revealed genetic diversity in strain types this robust approach may be useful to track evolution in the population sewershed and wwtp environments based on our results we propose the use of a combined scheme that incorporates core genome comparison mlst spa typing and identification of select mobile genetic elements to investigate environmental evolution in wwtps the system we envision applying would consider isolates of s aureus from the inlet of the wwtp and across bioactive processes like activated sludge where biological and bacteriophage density is high to evaluate genomic changes with an understanding of the relative rates of change for the selected elements in s aureus changes in the s aureus core genome and resultant mlst type should change slowly while spa and other mges will change more quickly in response to environmental pressures if comparison of s aureus isolates sharing similarity in their core genome and mlst type repeatedly demonstrates changes in the faster evolving genomic elements of these isolates after biological treatment support for s aureus evolution in the wwtp can be garnered utilizing the most commonly isolated mlst cc type from the influent and obtaining isolates after biological treatment with similar core genome and mlst types will enable comparison of the change in pathogenic state reflected in changes in spa type and mges such as meca and pvl detecting alteration in these evolving mges among s aureus isolates of the same mlst type could assess if co culture with other organisms in the wwtp environs results in altered virulence of s aureus ramsey et al 2016 found that co culture of s aureus with corynebacterium species reduced s aureus virulence we found two isolates sa7 and sa8 of the dominant clonal complexes mlst cc5 and mlst cc8 after treatment in activated sludge that exhibited atypical spa types t888 and t6671 respectively and had more than 500 snp difference in core genome when compared to the predominant influent isolates which suggests the evolution of these isolate through biological treatment however much more research needs to be done to determine if genetic changes in isolates trend towards a gain or loss of virulence as they move through the treatment process in our data isolates recovered after activated sludge treatment differed in their carriage of virulent mges when compared to influent isolates of the same clonal colony isolate sa7 cc5 was different from the predominant influent cc5 isolates in meca carriage isolate sa8 cc8 no longer carried meca and pvl mges when compared to wwtp cc8 influent isolates there is ample reason to continue to evaluate the impact of biological treatment processes for potential changes in the virulence of pathogenic organisms input into sewersheds wwtps and the role these facilities play in the transmission of evolved pathogens in the environment wastewater effluent has allowable numbers of gram negative coliforms established by permitting processes and chlorine based disinfection processes that are designed to reduce coliforms in wastewater effluents are not as effective against gram positive bacteria like s aureus therefore wwtps can be an anticipated source of s aureus in the environment the presence of viable s aureus in a small volume 200 ml of effluent could be extrapolated to the release of 5 5 108 organisms each day into the receiving stream assuming a consistent concentration and a single bacterium in the sample volume in the environment s aureus has been shown to persist in waters and sediments longer than coliforms levin edens et al 2012 so their presence in the environment could be undetected in the sediments of the receiving streams where conditions enhance survival contact could provide transmission to new hosts 5 conclusions it is paramount that we understand the true prevalence fate and transport of s aureus through our sewersheds treatment processes and streams so that treatment strategies are optimized to protect people and other potential hosts from needless infection and disease with current information it is difficult to evaluate the exact dimensions of the potential health risks related to engineered sewer systems especially with methods that do not prevent the growth of closely related bacteria that share the mges used to identify mrsa our results support the need for more coordinated investigations based on analyses that provide a robust degree of resolution prevent false positives and utilize more of the epidemiological approaches and genetic typing methods than have been applied to these systems in the past this study has provided new methodology for the enrichment and isolation of s aureus from complex environmental samples that resulted in the identification of two dominant clonal complexes cc5 hospital related and cc8 community related in the sewersheds and wwtps of lexington ky the presence of multiple hospitals feeding into one of the wwtps did not have an impact on the presence or type of isolate recovered as both clonal lineages were isolated from both wwtps the presence of both isolates persisted across treatment although greater than one log removal was observed between the influent and sedimentation tank effluent for two isolates obtained after treatment there was genetic diversity observed in the spa type and carriage of mges suggesting that treatment provides an opportunity for evolution and genetic shifts the isolation of viable s aureus at all sites across a treatment plant and in fully treated effluent suggests that wwtps may well serve as reservoirs and continuous sources for the introduction of potentially pathogenic s aureus into our environment declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18819,gallium ga is a critical element in developing renewable energy generation and energy efficient systems the supply of ga is at risk and needed recycling technologies for its availability in future this study demonstrated the recovery of ga3 from low gallium concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewaters using the siderophores desferrioxamine b dfob and desferrioxamine e dfoe the complexation of ga3 by dfob and dfoe was through hydroxamate group as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations the high selectivity of dfob e towards ga3 was observed due to the formation of highly stable complex indeed due to the formation of such high stability complex the dfob and dfoe were able to successfully complex 100 ga in the two different process water from wafer fabrication industry for the recovery of the siderophores a high rate of decomplexation of ga 90 was achieved upon addition of 6 times excess of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta at ph of 3 5 more than 95 of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex were recovered with purity of ga moles in comparison to total moles of metals of 69 8 and 92 9 respectively by application of a c18 reversed phase chromatography column this study for the first time demonstrated a technical solution to the recovery of ga3 from the low concentrated wastewater based on siderophores and reversed phase chromatography a german patent application had been filed for this technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal recovery recycling circular economy siderophores wastewater 1 introduction in light of the worldwide excessive consumption of fossil fuels the development of effective mitigating processes have become ambitious challenges in environmental sciences the european union eu has targeted their member states to reduce greenhouse emissions to 40 of those of the year 1990 increase the renewable energy consumption share to 27 and improve the energy efficiency to at least 27 of the forecasted power consumption in 2030 european commission 2014 to achieve these goals low carbon energy technologies are required which are dependent on the supply of critical metals pavel et al 2016 gallium ga is one of such metals it is used in solar photovoltaic cells copper indium gallium di selenide gaas kornblum et al 2017 moskalyk 2003 ramanujam and singh 2017 and light emitting diodes gan gap ingan gaas moskalyk 2003 pavel et al 2016 that improve the performance and the energy efficiency of these devices thus the global demand of ga is forecasted to 650 tons in 2020 directorate general enterprise and industry 2015 there is ample capacity of the primary ga production løvik et al 2015 however the assured future supply is at risk due to export restrictions high growth in demand and stockpiling by different countries directorate general enterprise and industry 2015 hence the eu has identified ga as a highly critical raw material european commission 2016 apart from improving conventional mining activities recycling of ga is a promising option to assure the future availability of this critical raw material and meet eu targets løvik et al 2015 considering the annual loss of 120 tons of ga during the production of gaas substrate integrated circuits neodymium iron boron magnets gan gap based light emitting diodes and other intermediary ga compounds highly efficient recycling processes has become of environmental and economic interest løvik et al 2015 a major drawback of the economic recovery of ga is the general low ga concentration less than 100 mg l 1 in the industrial wastewaters along with larger concentration of other contaminants conventional solvent extraction processes nusen et al 2016 precipitation xu et al 2007 or ion exchangers zhao et al 2012 and references therein have not been economically successful for the ga recovery from these low concentrated wastewaters typically less than 100 mg l 1 in fact the recovery of ga from end of life ga products containing a few of ga is 0 further emphasizing the lack of technology directorate general enterprise and industry 2015 mathieux et al 2017 sorption followed by desorption is a cost effective technology for removal of contaminants from low concentrated metal wastewaters gupta et al 2012 however a highly specific and sensitive sorbent at reasonable cost is required for selective adsorption of ga3 from these wastewaters further desorption of ga3 from the sorbent should be possible and finally the sorbent should be regenerated to meet cost effectiveness of the developed technology siderophores such as desferrioxamine b dfob and desferrioxamine e dfoe can potentially meet these requirements due to the similar ionic radii of fe3 0 65 å and ga3 0 62 å siderophores are known to complex ga3 at concentrations as low as 0 1 mg l 1 borgias et al 1989 fadeev et al 2004 jain et al 2017 however the effect of contaminants and ph on ga3 complexation and recovery of ga3 from real or synthetic wastewaters by dfob and dfoe has not been demonstrated further de complexation of ga3 from siderophores and their subsequent regeneration have never been reported a particular challenge in the application of dfob e based ga3 recovery technology is the separation of ga dfob e complexes from the wastewater dfob immobilization through free nh3 tail on a substrate has been partially successful for selective metal recovery from synthetic solutions takagai et al 2007 however the immobilization technique through free functional groups is limited to siderophores that have those groups that once immobilized do not impact ga3 complexing ability for instance the immobilization will not be possible with the cyclic dfoe as it lacks any free functional group reversed phase chromatography in principle can be applied for the separation and quantification of metal siderophores complexes of any type of metal or siderophores schwabe et al 2018 however this technique has never been exploited neither for the recovery of ga dfob e complexes from real or synthetic wastewater nor for the recovery of free dfob e siderophores upon regeneration this study demonstrated the selectivity and sensitivity of dfob and dfoe towards ga3 in industrially relevant conditions and in principle recovery of ga through dfob and dfoe from real wastewater in this study the complexation of ga3 with dfob and dfoe at different ph presence of various contaminants anionic and cationic and different ionic strengths was studied for the technology development in industrially relevant conditions ga3 complexation with dfob and dfoe was also performed using low ga3 concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewaters molecular aspects of the binding of ga3 with dfob and dfoe were studied using infrared absorption ir nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations ga3 decomplexation from ga dfob and ga dfoe complex and regeneration of dfob e was attempted by replacing dfob e with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta the separation of ga dfob e complexes from wastewater and regeneration of dfob e was accomplished by reversed phase chromatography 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dfob and dfoe were purchased from sigma aldrich and asa spezialenzyme gmbh respectively ga3 was added as ga no3 3 xh2o sigma aldrich and a 5 mm ga3 stock solution was prepared with 0 5 hno3 all other chemicals including edta were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 complexation of ga3 by dfob and dfoe in synthetic wastewater all complexation studies were carried out in 2 ml total volume with 24 h mixing time at 30 c the effect of ph was studied by varying the equilibrium ph from 2 5 to 9 5 at ga3 and dfob e concentrations of 0 8 mm to investigate the effect of ionic strength the kcl concentration was varied from 10 to 200 mm while the equilibrium ph and ga3 and dfob e concentrations were set to 5 0 0 1 and 0 8 mm respectively to study the effect of anions sodium salts of chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphate with concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mm at ga3 and dfob e concentration of 0 8 mm and equilibrium ph was 5 0 0 1 were added the effect of arsenite and arsenate was studied separately by adding 0 8 mm of sodium arsenite or sodium arsenate in 0 8 mm of ga3 and dfob e mixture the equilibrium ph varied between 2 2 and 2 8 5 3 5 4 and 9 3 9 5 the ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes were analyzed using hplc as described in detail elsewhere jain et al 2017 the ga dfob e complexation results are presented as a percentage of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex formed in control conditions for ph variation the control was taken as ph 4 5 and 5 5 for ga dfoe and ga dfob complex respectively as these ph values are natural ph of the dfoe and dfob solutions for kcl anions and arsenic effect on ga dfob e complex formation the ga dfob e complex formed in their absence was taken as reference for the recovery of ga dfob e complexes ga 0 25 mm dfob e 0 25 mm and contaminants 0 25 mm each of as ca cu mg and zn was incubated for 24 h at 30 c and ph 3 0 100 μl of this mixture was injected in a c 18 reversed phase chromatography and fractions were collected from 10 7 to 15 7 and 13 2 20 2 min for ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes respectively the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for ga dfob e complex and icp ms for metal concentrations control experiments of kcl arsenite arsenate and anions with dfob or dfoe but without ga3 were carried out to ensure the lack of binding of dfob dfoe with other contaminants all the experiments were carried out in duplicates and if there was more than 10 difference the experiments were repeated the average values and errors of duplicate measurements are presented 2 3 process wastewater from wafer manufacturer the wastewater from the wafer fabrication company was procured and characterized for ph and total metal concentration table 1 as ca and mg were the main contaminant in the process wastewater 2 4 complexation of ga3 by dfob and dfoe in the process wastewater for the complexation experiments two different process wastewaters p1 and p2 were used containing 4 0 mg l 1 60 μm ga3 at ph 9 3 and 34 6 mg l 1 500 μm ga3 at ph 3 8 respectively table 1 1 95 ml of p1 was mixed with 0 05 ml of 2 mm dfob or dfoe while 1 6 ml of p2 was mixed with 0 4 ml of 2 mm dfob or dfoe the reaction mixture was allowed to shake for 24 h at 30 c no ph adjustment prior to experiments or after experiments was carried out the ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes were analyzed using hplc as described in detail elsewhere jain et al 2017 100 μl of p1 dfob e and p2 dfob e were separated by hplc and various fractions were collected at 10 7 15 7 and 13 2 20 2 min for ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes respectively the ga dfob e complexation results are presented as a percentage of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex formed in control conditions for ph variation the control was taken as ph 4 5 and 5 5 for ga dfoe and ga dfob complex respectively as these ph values are natural ph of the dfoe and dfob solutions for kcl anions and arsenic effect on ga dfob e complex formation the ga dfob e complex formed in their absence was taken as reference the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for ga dfob e complex and icp ms for metal concentrations again all experiments were carried out in duplicates using similar criteria as used for synthetic wastewater experiments 2 5 loading experiments for the loading experiments synthetic solution was used as it was more challenging for ga3 recovery compared to wafer fabrication industry wastewater the metal solutions containing 0 25 mm of each ga as ca cu mg and zn were mixed with 0 25 mm of dfob e and incubated for 24 h at 30 c and ph 3 0 5 ml of ga metal dfob e complex was separated by hplc and the fractions were collected the ga dfob and ga dfoe complex were collected from 10 7 to 15 7 and 13 2 20 2 min respectively the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for ga dfob e complex and icp ms for metal concentrations all experiments were carried out in duplicates using similar criteria as used for synthetic wastewater experiments 2 6 de complexation of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex 0 5 mm of ga dfob or ga dfoe complex was mixed with 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mm of edta the reaction was performed for 24 h at 30 c and ph of 3 5 the total reaction volume was varied between 2 ml and 6 ml free dfob and dfoe were detected using hplc 100 μl and 5 ml of these samples were separated by hplc and the fractions were collected the free dfob and dfoe was collected between 13 9 19 9 and 20 8 27 8 min respectively the ga edta complexes were recovered at 1 9 13 9 min respectively the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for free dfob e complex and icp ms for ga concentration all experiments were carried out in duplicates using similar criteria as used for synthetic wastewater experiments 2 7 ga dfob or ga dfoe complex characterization ga dfob or ga dfoe complexes were analyzed by means of nmr ir spectroscopies and dft calculations 2 0 mm ga dfoe samples were prepared in d2o for nmr at ph 4 5 0 5 2 0 mm ga dfob and ga dfoe samples were prepared for ir at ph 5 0 and 4 0 respectively the 2 0 mm dfob and dfoe were additionally prepared for ir measurements at ph 5 0 and 4 0 respectively serving as reference samples 2 8 quantum chemical calculations all calculations were performed using gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 at the b3lyp level becke 1993 lee et al 1988 using triple zeta basis sets small core effective core potentials were used for the metal centers ga zn ca geometry optimization as well as harmonic vibrational frequency calculations were performed in aqueous phase using the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm solvation model barone and cossi 1998 cossi et al 2003 the initial dfob dfoe and edta structures and their metal bound starting structures were taken from the crystal structures and their analogous reported earlier dhungana et al 2001 neu et al 2000 stezowski et al 1973 tirler and hofer 2015 van der helm and poling 1976 2 9 analytics hplc system was an agilent 1200 and columns used was zorbax eclipse xdb c18 4 6 150 mm 5 μm column and diode array detector g1315b 1200 10 mm kh2po4 at ph 3 0 and acetonitrile gradient was used for elution of analyte more details are reported in jain et al 2017 the column was washed with 100 acetonitrile for 20 min after each loading experiments nmr spectra were recorded on an agilent 600 dd2 nmr spectrometer equipped more details are reported in jain et al 2017 ir spectra were measured on a bruker vertex 80 v vacuum fourier spectrometer equipped with an atr accessory dura samplir ii smiths inc a horizontal diamond crystal a 12 57 mm2 with nine internal reflections on the upper surface and a mercury cadmium telluride mct detector cut off 580 cm 1 each single beam spectrum was averaged over 256 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 for suppression of background fluctuations the measurements of the liquid samples were accomplished by using a flow cell that allows the subsequent acquisition of the spectra of the sample and reference solutions containing the ga3 complexes and the siderophores respectively gückel et al 2013 3 results 3 1 ga3 binding with dfob and dfoe studied by spectroscopy and quantum chemistry the ir spectra of the dfob e were characterized by two broad bands around 1610 and 1450 cm 1 mainly representing modes of the c n and ch2 functional groups respectively fig 1 a from the high congruence of the spectra it became obvious that the linear or cyclic structure of the siderophore is not reflected in the ir spectra however similar molecular environmental conditions are suggested for the functional groups of both siderophores dfob and dfoe irrespective to their overall molecular configurations upon complexation with ga3 the ir spectra did not significantly change data not shown hence for clarity difference spectra were calculated from spectra of the solutions containing the corresponding siderophore in the presence and absence of ga3 fig 1b again the shape of the spectra are very similar irrespective of the siderophore suggesting that both ligands show the same binding motif of the ga complexes the bands at 1587 cm 1 representing the ga3 complexes clearly reflect the interaction of the metal ion with the hydroxylamine functional groups in analogy the band at 1450 cm 1 represents the adaption of the basic c c framework of the siderophore molecules upon complexation with ga3 the spectral region below 1420 cm 1 of the difference spectra cannot be evaluated with respect to residual nitrate that could not be removed completely further nmr spectra also confirmed the complexation of ga3 with three hydroxamate groups fig s1 in si the analysis of ir and nmr spectra suggest that the binding motif of ga3 by dfob and dfoe is similar to fe3 further the structures of ga dfob e complexes were optimized by dft calculations and the final optimized structures are presented in fig 2 the dft calculations were carried out to estimate the binding energy of different complexes table 2 shows that formation of ga dfoe complex is thermodynamically more stable than formation of ga dfob or ga edta complexes the binding of dfob e towards ca2 and zn2 were also evaluated as ca is present in wastewater table 1 while zn was used a model divalent cation a similar trend of dfoe forming more stable complexes was observed when zn2 or ca2 complexed with dfoe dfob and edta the differences in binding energy of ga dfoe and zn dfoe was 66 6 kcal mol 1 the differences in binding energy of ga dfob and zn dfob and ga edta and zn edta complex were 62 8 and 42 8 kcal mol 1 respectively 3 2 ga3 complexation in synthetic wastewater with dfob e and decomplexation of ga dfob e complexes by addition of edta ga3 complexation with dfob e was studied as a function of ph ionic strength as well as anionic and arsenic contaminants as these factors are important constituent of the real wastewater the variation of ph from 2 5 0 1 to 9 5 0 1 did not affect the ga dfob and ga dfoe complexation fig 3 a there is a slight drop in the ga dfoe complex 91 largely due to dilution effects and measurements error the absence of a downward trend from ph 7 5 91 6 of ga dfoe complexation at ph 4 5 to 10 4 90 7 of ga dfoe complexation at ph 4 5 suggests absence of ga dfoe degradation with ph in case of ga dfob there is a large drop in the stability of the complex at ph greater than 10 0 the increase of the ionic strength from 10 mm to 200 mm kcl had no effect on complexation of ga3 with dfob and dfoe fig 3b similarly the presence 20 mm each of chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphate as compared to 0 8 mm of ga3 had little effect on the ga3 binding capability of dfob and dfoe fig 3c finally the presence of equimolar arsenite or arsenate and ga3 0 8 mm each at equilibrium ph between 2 3 and 9 5 did not affect the dfob or dfoe complexing ability towards ga3 fig 3d the effect of divalent cations on the formation of ga dfob e complexes from synthetic solution was evaluated by collecting fractions in a reversed phase chromatography for the dfob more than 93 of ga dfob complex was recovered while for ga dfoe the recovery is greater than 95 fig 3e the maximum contaminant in ga dfob and ga dfoe was zn with 6 7 and 4 1 respectively of the initial zn2 present in the synthetic wastewater fig 3e the regeneration of free dfob e from ga dfob e complex is important for the development of a process thus de complexation of the ga dfob e complexes using edta was carried out the de complexation of ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes increased with increasing concentration of edta from 0 5 mm to 3 0 mm when the edta dfob e ratio is 2 93 9 0 1 and 24 8 0 2 of the dfob and dfoe respectively were released from their ga dfob e complexes fig 3f when the edta ga dfob e ratio was 6 more than 95 of dfob and dfoe was released from their respective ga complexes fig 3f 3 3 ga3 complexation with dfob and dfoe in process wastewater of the wafer manufacturer ga3 complexation with dfob and dfoe in wafer fabrication wastewater was assessed to validate the applicability of dfob e for gallium recovery from the real wastewater the complexation of ga3 in p1 and p2 real process wastewaters was close to 100 when dfob or dfoe was added so that concentration of ga and dfob e is in 1 1 ratio mm mm fig 4ma 100 μl of formed ga dfob or ga dfoe complexes in p1 and p2 was injected in a c 18 reversed phase chromatography for separation of ga dfob e complexes from wastewater for the dfob more than 90 of ga dfob complex was recovered while for dfoe the recovery was greater than 96 in both p1 and p2 fig 4b and c in p1 and p2 as was major contaminant for ga dfob with fractions of 8 8 and 1 1 respectively fig 4b and c no contamination of as was observed in ga dfoe fractions fig 4b and c in both dfob e no contamination of al fe co ni and pb was found 3 4 recovery of regenerated dfob e and ga edta complex after de complexation of ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes using edta recovery of ga edta complex and free dfob e is necessary for recycling of free dfob e and purification of ga for its further application 100 μl of de complexed ga dfob e complexes and edta was injected in a c 18 reversed phase chromatography column and the fractions were collected the recovery rates for free dfob e and ga edta complex were higher than 90 fig 5 3 5 loading experiments the loading experiments on the column are important for a chromatographic scale up roadmap 5 ml of 0 25 mm ga dfob e complexes formed in synthetic wastewater containing 0 25 mm each of as ca cu mg and zn was injected into the a c 18 reverse chromatography column the synthetic solution was used as the ga recovery from synthetic wastewater was more challenging compared to process wastewaters due to higher divalent metal content in the synthetic wastewater in the case of ga dfob and contaminant injection the recovery rates of the ga dfob complex measured by hplc uv detector and of ga from the ga dfob complex measured by icp ms were 92 7 1 8 and 101 5 7 5 respectively fig 6 a and 8 6 of the total contaminant present in the synthetic wastewater as ca cu mg and zn were found fig 6a the ga3 purity moles of ga present compared with total moles of ga as ca cu mg and zn present in collected fraction increased from 16 7 in the synthetic wastewater to 69 8 in the ga dfob collected fractions in the case of ga dfoe and contaminant injection the recovery rates of ga dfoe complex measured by hplc uv detector and of ga from the ga dfoe complex measured by icp ms were 101 4 3 6 and 102 1 0 1 respectively fig 6a only 1 5 of the total contaminant present in synthetic wastewater as ca cu mg and zn were found in collected fraction fig 6a the ga3 purity in the ga dfoe fraction increased from 16 7 in the synthetic wastewater to 92 9 in collected ga dfoe fractions for the regeneration of dfob e and recovery of ga from ga dfob e complex 5 ml of the 0 5 mm ga3 dfob e and 3 mm of edta decomplexation reaction mixture was injected into a reversed phase chromatography column the free dfob e and ga3 in the ga edta complex recovery was greater than 98 fig 6b a complete dfob and dfoe based ga3 recovery technology using a c 18 reversed phase chromatographic approach is presented in fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 recovery of ga3 from the real wastewater using the developed technology based on complexation with dfob e and reversed phase chromatography the technology presented in this work provided a recovery rate 90 for ga3 from its low concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewater and as well from synthetic wastewater which was more demanding with respect to its composition than real wastewater figs 4 and 6 further the high performance of this technology becomes apparent from the separation efficiency of ga from other contaminants e g as ca cu mg zn present in the wastewaters the purity moles of ga in ga dfob e fractions compared to total moles of ga as ca cu mg and zn for ga dfob and ga dfoe fractions were 69 8 and 92 9 respectively for 5 ml and 0 25 mm loading experiments the high purity is due to the combination of selective complexing ability of the dfob e towards ga3 and separation capability of reversed phase chromatography the high selectivity of the siderophores dfob and dfoe towards ga3 is due to the high binding energies of the ga dfob e complexes table 2 compared to other potentially competing cations such as ca2 and model divalent cation zn2 table 2 anderegg g l eplattenier f schwarzenbach 1963 borgias et al 1989 haris 2015 and references therein similarly the complex formation constants of dfob complexes of ga3 and ca2 showed larger differences when compared to respective complexes of edta suggesting that dfob shows higher selectivity towards ga3 in comparison to edta table 3 lists the differences in the complexation constants of the metal complexes with dfob and other common extraction ligands higher values represent a higher selectivity of the respective ligand towards ga3 as it can be seen in table 3 dfob shows highest selectivity towards ga3 when compared to common ligands like edta with respect to lacking data the selectivity of the dfoe towards ga3 cannot be demonstrated in table 3 nevertheless the selectivity of dfoe towards ga3 is expected to be close to that of dfob this is deduced from a comparison of the differences in the binding energies of the respective zn and ga complexes of dfoe which are quite similar for both ligands dfoe 66 6 kcal mol 1 dfob 62 8 kcal mol 1 table 2 however the affinity of dfoe to bind ga3 was obviously higher than those of dfob due to its higher binding energy table 2 this was corroborated by the finding that the decomplexation of ga3 from dfoe required two times higher concentration of edta than for dfob fig 3f ga3 present in the ga dfoe fraction 92 9 had higher purity compared to ga dfob 69 8 fraction the higher selectivity of dfoe is also due to a higher separation efficiency of the c 18 reversed phase chromatography which is ascribed to the increased hydrophobicity of the cyclic structured dfoe fig 2 dhungana et al 2001 and references therein a decrease of the injection volume or concentration of complexes would improve the purity of ga in ga dfob fractions indeed when the injection volume of ga3 complexed in synthetic solution was decreased from 5 ml to 100 μl ga purity in the ga dfob fraction increased from 69 8 to 87 8 however this step will increase the operating cost of the technology as the amount of wastewater treated in each cycle is decreased thus a fine balance is needed to achieve the lowest cost with an acceptable purity of the ga dfob e complexes 4 2 technological implications this is the first technology that can recover ga3 from low concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewater containing 4 0 mg l 1 ga3 in comparison solvent extraction processes nusen et al 2016 and precipitation xu et al 2007 typically can work at minimum ga3 concentration of 30 and 100 1000 mg l 1 respectively as the wastewater from the wafer manufacture can vary in ph and concentration of as and other contaminants a robust technology is essential unlike other adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes zhang et al 2010 waste biomass dutta et al 2015 jain et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 or biogenic nanomaterial jain et al 2016a 2015a the recovery of the target metal by dfob e is hardly affected by ph kcl or competing ions fig 3 this is a significant advantage in comparison to conventional technologies where a stringent control of operational parameter is needed for the selective recovery of target metals that is usually required by other adsorbents e g biogenic selenium nanoparticles jain et al 2016b for the other adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes zhang et al 2010 iminodiacetic acid modified corn stalk zhang et al 2018 or goethite nore and persson 2010 ga3 adsorption capacity decreases when ph decreases from 5 0 to 2 5 whereas dfob e complexation towards ga3 was unaffected fig 3a this is because no protonation or deprotonation take place for dfob e in this ph range in general the pka of siderophores varies between 7 3 and 13 ahmed and holmström 2014 while for dfob it varies from 8 51 to 10 01 borgias et al 1989 thus in the tested ph range hdfob 2 dominates leading to the formation of ga hdfob species which has the complexation constant of 27 56 borgias et al 1989 further due to this high stability of the ga dfob complex table 2 the ga3 which generally tends to precipitate in the ph range from 3 5 to 7 0 remains in solution hagvall et al 2014 similar reasons can be attributed for ga dfoe complexation in contrast protonation of the carboxyl phosphodiester groups present on other adsorbents has pka in ph range of 2 0 5 0 resulting in lesser sites for the adsorption jain et al 2016b 2015b spataru et al 2016 thus decreasing the adsorption with decrease in ph additionally ga3 complexation by dfob e was not affected by the increase in ionic strength anion concentration or presence of arsenic fig 3b c and 3d this is due to the high stability of ga dfob e complexes table 2 and the reaction is driven towards ga dfob e complexes formation decomplexation reactions induced by edta release ga3 and are necessary for the regeneration of the dfob e ligands this study demonstrated the decomplexation with high rate of ga and free dfob e recovery figs 5 and 6 although the ga dfoe complex is more stable than the ga edta complex table 2 it can be decomplexed by excessive edta figs 3f and 5 the ga recovery from the ga edta complex is feasible by techniques such as electrochemistry cheung et al 2018 huang et al 2000 substitution by metal ions followed by precipitation and electrolysis gyliene et al 2004 or addition of complex destabilizing agents ferric ions sodium phosphate ferrous sulphate dithiocarbamates di palma et al 2003 schmelter and standish 2019 the optimization of the technique for the recovery of ga3 from ga edta complex is a task of future studies as the decomplexation of ga dfob e complexes may also be carried out by other ga3 complexing agents such as nota log β 29 63 trap h oh pr log β 21 91 23 30 26 24 šimeček et al 2012 or amino diphosphonic acids log β 25 8 bollinger and roundhill 1993 the selection of the most efficient agent depends on the capital and operational costs 4 3 roadmap for the developed technology reversed phase chromatography has been known for quantification of iron siderophore complexes based on their hydrophobicity for more than three decades konetschny rapp et al 1988 in this work it is explicitly demonstrated that the reversed phase chromatography system can be successfully applied for the recovery of ga3 from the real process wastewater using dfob e the two major cost inputs for this technology are costs of dfob e and organic mobile phase the cost of dfob e can be lowered by increasing the production order and accepting lower purity dfob e for instance in this study dfoe with 70 90 purity provided by asa spezialenzyme gmbh was used the current prices of dfob e varies between 3200 and 10 000 per kg however when the production order of dfoe is 500 kg or 5 000 kg the cost of production is 300 and 270 per kg respectively as quoted by asa spezialenzyme gmbh the galiophore technology has been presented at 1 l per day per scale for the scale up of the technology maximum loading of the ga dfob e complexes and free dfob e onto different reversed phase columns needs to be determined another aspect that needs to be tested is the use of other organic green eluents like ethanol or methanol for decreasing the cost and environmental footprint an optimum selection for hydrophobic c 18 stationary phase where minimization of the organic eluent consumption per millimoles of ga dfob e complex or free dfob e is required further the application of simulated moving bed chromatography technique in the recovery of ga dfob e and ga and free dfob e can reduce eluent consumption and packing material required by 80 90 francotte and richert 1997 juza et al 2000 nagamatsu et al 1999 after optimizing the stationary phase organic eluent and minimizing organic eluent consumption the use of chromatographic column with 10 15 μm particle size needs to be tested in a column of 4 6 mm inner diameter and 250 mm length the next steps are standard steps in scale up of chromatographic operation by simply increasing the inner diameter of column while maintaining similar performance at higher loading the most important aspect in the galiophore technology is to achieve an acceptable quality and cost reduction while carrying out scale up another challenge is the low concentration of ga in the recovered ga edta complexes solid phase extraction spe method using reversed phase column can be used to increase the ga concentrations as spe is known to increase concentration of organics as well as chelated metals hasegawa et al 2011 he et al 2013 further use of spe would decrease the organic mobile phase consumption due to the requirement of organic mobile phase only during elution 5 conclusions dfob and dfoe can selectively and sensitively complex ga3 from the process wastewater of wafer fabrication industry while 6 time excess edta at ph 3 5 can regenerate free dfob and dfoe selectivity of dfob and dfoe towards ga3 was comparably high however reversed phase chromatography separation showed a higher efficiency for dfoe resulting in a higher ga purity cost of siderophores and organic mobile phase can be reduced by larger production order of siderophores and application of substitution smb spe for organic mobile phase the combination of dfob e complexation and reversed phase chromatography can be applied for the recovery of ga3 and open doors for the siderophores based recovery of other critical metals acknowledgements the marie curie

18819,gallium ga is a critical element in developing renewable energy generation and energy efficient systems the supply of ga is at risk and needed recycling technologies for its availability in future this study demonstrated the recovery of ga3 from low gallium concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewaters using the siderophores desferrioxamine b dfob and desferrioxamine e dfoe the complexation of ga3 by dfob and dfoe was through hydroxamate group as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations the high selectivity of dfob e towards ga3 was observed due to the formation of highly stable complex indeed due to the formation of such high stability complex the dfob and dfoe were able to successfully complex 100 ga in the two different process water from wafer fabrication industry for the recovery of the siderophores a high rate of decomplexation of ga 90 was achieved upon addition of 6 times excess of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta at ph of 3 5 more than 95 of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex were recovered with purity of ga moles in comparison to total moles of metals of 69 8 and 92 9 respectively by application of a c18 reversed phase chromatography column this study for the first time demonstrated a technical solution to the recovery of ga3 from the low concentrated wastewater based on siderophores and reversed phase chromatography a german patent application had been filed for this technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords metal recovery recycling circular economy siderophores wastewater 1 introduction in light of the worldwide excessive consumption of fossil fuels the development of effective mitigating processes have become ambitious challenges in environmental sciences the european union eu has targeted their member states to reduce greenhouse emissions to 40 of those of the year 1990 increase the renewable energy consumption share to 27 and improve the energy efficiency to at least 27 of the forecasted power consumption in 2030 european commission 2014 to achieve these goals low carbon energy technologies are required which are dependent on the supply of critical metals pavel et al 2016 gallium ga is one of such metals it is used in solar photovoltaic cells copper indium gallium di selenide gaas kornblum et al 2017 moskalyk 2003 ramanujam and singh 2017 and light emitting diodes gan gap ingan gaas moskalyk 2003 pavel et al 2016 that improve the performance and the energy efficiency of these devices thus the global demand of ga is forecasted to 650 tons in 2020 directorate general enterprise and industry 2015 there is ample capacity of the primary ga production løvik et al 2015 however the assured future supply is at risk due to export restrictions high growth in demand and stockpiling by different countries directorate general enterprise and industry 2015 hence the eu has identified ga as a highly critical raw material european commission 2016 apart from improving conventional mining activities recycling of ga is a promising option to assure the future availability of this critical raw material and meet eu targets løvik et al 2015 considering the annual loss of 120 tons of ga during the production of gaas substrate integrated circuits neodymium iron boron magnets gan gap based light emitting diodes and other intermediary ga compounds highly efficient recycling processes has become of environmental and economic interest løvik et al 2015 a major drawback of the economic recovery of ga is the general low ga concentration less than 100 mg l 1 in the industrial wastewaters along with larger concentration of other contaminants conventional solvent extraction processes nusen et al 2016 precipitation xu et al 2007 or ion exchangers zhao et al 2012 and references therein have not been economically successful for the ga recovery from these low concentrated wastewaters typically less than 100 mg l 1 in fact the recovery of ga from end of life ga products containing a few of ga is 0 further emphasizing the lack of technology directorate general enterprise and industry 2015 mathieux et al 2017 sorption followed by desorption is a cost effective technology for removal of contaminants from low concentrated metal wastewaters gupta et al 2012 however a highly specific and sensitive sorbent at reasonable cost is required for selective adsorption of ga3 from these wastewaters further desorption of ga3 from the sorbent should be possible and finally the sorbent should be regenerated to meet cost effectiveness of the developed technology siderophores such as desferrioxamine b dfob and desferrioxamine e dfoe can potentially meet these requirements due to the similar ionic radii of fe3 0 65 å and ga3 0 62 å siderophores are known to complex ga3 at concentrations as low as 0 1 mg l 1 borgias et al 1989 fadeev et al 2004 jain et al 2017 however the effect of contaminants and ph on ga3 complexation and recovery of ga3 from real or synthetic wastewaters by dfob and dfoe has not been demonstrated further de complexation of ga3 from siderophores and their subsequent regeneration have never been reported a particular challenge in the application of dfob e based ga3 recovery technology is the separation of ga dfob e complexes from the wastewater dfob immobilization through free nh3 tail on a substrate has been partially successful for selective metal recovery from synthetic solutions takagai et al 2007 however the immobilization technique through free functional groups is limited to siderophores that have those groups that once immobilized do not impact ga3 complexing ability for instance the immobilization will not be possible with the cyclic dfoe as it lacks any free functional group reversed phase chromatography in principle can be applied for the separation and quantification of metal siderophores complexes of any type of metal or siderophores schwabe et al 2018 however this technique has never been exploited neither for the recovery of ga dfob e complexes from real or synthetic wastewater nor for the recovery of free dfob e siderophores upon regeneration this study demonstrated the selectivity and sensitivity of dfob and dfoe towards ga3 in industrially relevant conditions and in principle recovery of ga through dfob and dfoe from real wastewater in this study the complexation of ga3 with dfob and dfoe at different ph presence of various contaminants anionic and cationic and different ionic strengths was studied for the technology development in industrially relevant conditions ga3 complexation with dfob and dfoe was also performed using low ga3 concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewaters molecular aspects of the binding of ga3 with dfob and dfoe were studied using infrared absorption ir nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations ga3 decomplexation from ga dfob and ga dfoe complex and regeneration of dfob e was attempted by replacing dfob e with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta the separation of ga dfob e complexes from wastewater and regeneration of dfob e was accomplished by reversed phase chromatography 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals dfob and dfoe were purchased from sigma aldrich and asa spezialenzyme gmbh respectively ga3 was added as ga no3 3 xh2o sigma aldrich and a 5 mm ga3 stock solution was prepared with 0 5 hno3 all other chemicals including edta were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 complexation of ga3 by dfob and dfoe in synthetic wastewater all complexation studies were carried out in 2 ml total volume with 24 h mixing time at 30 c the effect of ph was studied by varying the equilibrium ph from 2 5 to 9 5 at ga3 and dfob e concentrations of 0 8 mm to investigate the effect of ionic strength the kcl concentration was varied from 10 to 200 mm while the equilibrium ph and ga3 and dfob e concentrations were set to 5 0 0 1 and 0 8 mm respectively to study the effect of anions sodium salts of chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphate with concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 mm at ga3 and dfob e concentration of 0 8 mm and equilibrium ph was 5 0 0 1 were added the effect of arsenite and arsenate was studied separately by adding 0 8 mm of sodium arsenite or sodium arsenate in 0 8 mm of ga3 and dfob e mixture the equilibrium ph varied between 2 2 and 2 8 5 3 5 4 and 9 3 9 5 the ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes were analyzed using hplc as described in detail elsewhere jain et al 2017 the ga dfob e complexation results are presented as a percentage of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex formed in control conditions for ph variation the control was taken as ph 4 5 and 5 5 for ga dfoe and ga dfob complex respectively as these ph values are natural ph of the dfoe and dfob solutions for kcl anions and arsenic effect on ga dfob e complex formation the ga dfob e complex formed in their absence was taken as reference for the recovery of ga dfob e complexes ga 0 25 mm dfob e 0 25 mm and contaminants 0 25 mm each of as ca cu mg and zn was incubated for 24 h at 30 c and ph 3 0 100 μl of this mixture was injected in a c 18 reversed phase chromatography and fractions were collected from 10 7 to 15 7 and 13 2 20 2 min for ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes respectively the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for ga dfob e complex and icp ms for metal concentrations control experiments of kcl arsenite arsenate and anions with dfob or dfoe but without ga3 were carried out to ensure the lack of binding of dfob dfoe with other contaminants all the experiments were carried out in duplicates and if there was more than 10 difference the experiments were repeated the average values and errors of duplicate measurements are presented 2 3 process wastewater from wafer manufacturer the wastewater from the wafer fabrication company was procured and characterized for ph and total metal concentration table 1 as ca and mg were the main contaminant in the process wastewater 2 4 complexation of ga3 by dfob and dfoe in the process wastewater for the complexation experiments two different process wastewaters p1 and p2 were used containing 4 0 mg l 1 60 μm ga3 at ph 9 3 and 34 6 mg l 1 500 μm ga3 at ph 3 8 respectively table 1 1 95 ml of p1 was mixed with 0 05 ml of 2 mm dfob or dfoe while 1 6 ml of p2 was mixed with 0 4 ml of 2 mm dfob or dfoe the reaction mixture was allowed to shake for 24 h at 30 c no ph adjustment prior to experiments or after experiments was carried out the ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes were analyzed using hplc as described in detail elsewhere jain et al 2017 100 μl of p1 dfob e and p2 dfob e were separated by hplc and various fractions were collected at 10 7 15 7 and 13 2 20 2 min for ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes respectively the ga dfob e complexation results are presented as a percentage of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex formed in control conditions for ph variation the control was taken as ph 4 5 and 5 5 for ga dfoe and ga dfob complex respectively as these ph values are natural ph of the dfoe and dfob solutions for kcl anions and arsenic effect on ga dfob e complex formation the ga dfob e complex formed in their absence was taken as reference the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for ga dfob e complex and icp ms for metal concentrations again all experiments were carried out in duplicates using similar criteria as used for synthetic wastewater experiments 2 5 loading experiments for the loading experiments synthetic solution was used as it was more challenging for ga3 recovery compared to wafer fabrication industry wastewater the metal solutions containing 0 25 mm of each ga as ca cu mg and zn were mixed with 0 25 mm of dfob e and incubated for 24 h at 30 c and ph 3 0 5 ml of ga metal dfob e complex was separated by hplc and the fractions were collected the ga dfob and ga dfoe complex were collected from 10 7 to 15 7 and 13 2 20 2 min respectively the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for ga dfob e complex and icp ms for metal concentrations all experiments were carried out in duplicates using similar criteria as used for synthetic wastewater experiments 2 6 de complexation of ga dfob and ga dfoe complex 0 5 mm of ga dfob or ga dfoe complex was mixed with 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mm of edta the reaction was performed for 24 h at 30 c and ph of 3 5 the total reaction volume was varied between 2 ml and 6 ml free dfob and dfoe were detected using hplc 100 μl and 5 ml of these samples were separated by hplc and the fractions were collected the free dfob and dfoe was collected between 13 9 19 9 and 20 8 27 8 min respectively the ga edta complexes were recovered at 1 9 13 9 min respectively the collected fractions were analyzed using hplc for free dfob e complex and icp ms for ga concentration all experiments were carried out in duplicates using similar criteria as used for synthetic wastewater experiments 2 7 ga dfob or ga dfoe complex characterization ga dfob or ga dfoe complexes were analyzed by means of nmr ir spectroscopies and dft calculations 2 0 mm ga dfoe samples were prepared in d2o for nmr at ph 4 5 0 5 2 0 mm ga dfob and ga dfoe samples were prepared for ir at ph 5 0 and 4 0 respectively the 2 0 mm dfob and dfoe were additionally prepared for ir measurements at ph 5 0 and 4 0 respectively serving as reference samples 2 8 quantum chemical calculations all calculations were performed using gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 at the b3lyp level becke 1993 lee et al 1988 using triple zeta basis sets small core effective core potentials were used for the metal centers ga zn ca geometry optimization as well as harmonic vibrational frequency calculations were performed in aqueous phase using the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm solvation model barone and cossi 1998 cossi et al 2003 the initial dfob dfoe and edta structures and their metal bound starting structures were taken from the crystal structures and their analogous reported earlier dhungana et al 2001 neu et al 2000 stezowski et al 1973 tirler and hofer 2015 van der helm and poling 1976 2 9 analytics hplc system was an agilent 1200 and columns used was zorbax eclipse xdb c18 4 6 150 mm 5 μm column and diode array detector g1315b 1200 10 mm kh2po4 at ph 3 0 and acetonitrile gradient was used for elution of analyte more details are reported in jain et al 2017 the column was washed with 100 acetonitrile for 20 min after each loading experiments nmr spectra were recorded on an agilent 600 dd2 nmr spectrometer equipped more details are reported in jain et al 2017 ir spectra were measured on a bruker vertex 80 v vacuum fourier spectrometer equipped with an atr accessory dura samplir ii smiths inc a horizontal diamond crystal a 12 57 mm2 with nine internal reflections on the upper surface and a mercury cadmium telluride mct detector cut off 580 cm 1 each single beam spectrum was averaged over 256 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 for suppression of background fluctuations the measurements of the liquid samples were accomplished by using a flow cell that allows the subsequent acquisition of the spectra of the sample and reference solutions containing the ga3 complexes and the siderophores respectively gückel et al 2013 3 results 3 1 ga3 binding with dfob and dfoe studied by spectroscopy and quantum chemistry the ir spectra of the dfob e were characterized by two broad bands around 1610 and 1450 cm 1 mainly representing modes of the c n and ch2 functional groups respectively fig 1 a from the high congruence of the spectra it became obvious that the linear or cyclic structure of the siderophore is not reflected in the ir spectra however similar molecular environmental conditions are suggested for the functional groups of both siderophores dfob and dfoe irrespective to their overall molecular configurations upon complexation with ga3 the ir spectra did not significantly change data not shown hence for clarity difference spectra were calculated from spectra of the solutions containing the corresponding siderophore in the presence and absence of ga3 fig 1b again the shape of the spectra are very similar irrespective of the siderophore suggesting that both ligands show the same binding motif of the ga complexes the bands at 1587 cm 1 representing the ga3 complexes clearly reflect the interaction of the metal ion with the hydroxylamine functional groups in analogy the band at 1450 cm 1 represents the adaption of the basic c c framework of the siderophore molecules upon complexation with ga3 the spectral region below 1420 cm 1 of the difference spectra cannot be evaluated with respect to residual nitrate that could not be removed completely further nmr spectra also confirmed the complexation of ga3 with three hydroxamate groups fig s1 in si the analysis of ir and nmr spectra suggest that the binding motif of ga3 by dfob and dfoe is similar to fe3 further the structures of ga dfob e complexes were optimized by dft calculations and the final optimized structures are presented in fig 2 the dft calculations were carried out to estimate the binding energy of different complexes table 2 shows that formation of ga dfoe complex is thermodynamically more stable than formation of ga dfob or ga edta complexes the binding of dfob e towards ca2 and zn2 were also evaluated as ca is present in wastewater table 1 while zn was used a model divalent cation a similar trend of dfoe forming more stable complexes was observed when zn2 or ca2 complexed with dfoe dfob and edta the differences in binding energy of ga dfoe and zn dfoe was 66 6 kcal mol 1 the differences in binding energy of ga dfob and zn dfob and ga edta and zn edta complex were 62 8 and 42 8 kcal mol 1 respectively 3 2 ga3 complexation in synthetic wastewater with dfob e and decomplexation of ga dfob e complexes by addition of edta ga3 complexation with dfob e was studied as a function of ph ionic strength as well as anionic and arsenic contaminants as these factors are important constituent of the real wastewater the variation of ph from 2 5 0 1 to 9 5 0 1 did not affect the ga dfob and ga dfoe complexation fig 3 a there is a slight drop in the ga dfoe complex 91 largely due to dilution effects and measurements error the absence of a downward trend from ph 7 5 91 6 of ga dfoe complexation at ph 4 5 to 10 4 90 7 of ga dfoe complexation at ph 4 5 suggests absence of ga dfoe degradation with ph in case of ga dfob there is a large drop in the stability of the complex at ph greater than 10 0 the increase of the ionic strength from 10 mm to 200 mm kcl had no effect on complexation of ga3 with dfob and dfoe fig 3b similarly the presence 20 mm each of chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphate as compared to 0 8 mm of ga3 had little effect on the ga3 binding capability of dfob and dfoe fig 3c finally the presence of equimolar arsenite or arsenate and ga3 0 8 mm each at equilibrium ph between 2 3 and 9 5 did not affect the dfob or dfoe complexing ability towards ga3 fig 3d the effect of divalent cations on the formation of ga dfob e complexes from synthetic solution was evaluated by collecting fractions in a reversed phase chromatography for the dfob more than 93 of ga dfob complex was recovered while for ga dfoe the recovery is greater than 95 fig 3e the maximum contaminant in ga dfob and ga dfoe was zn with 6 7 and 4 1 respectively of the initial zn2 present in the synthetic wastewater fig 3e the regeneration of free dfob e from ga dfob e complex is important for the development of a process thus de complexation of the ga dfob e complexes using edta was carried out the de complexation of ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes increased with increasing concentration of edta from 0 5 mm to 3 0 mm when the edta dfob e ratio is 2 93 9 0 1 and 24 8 0 2 of the dfob and dfoe respectively were released from their ga dfob e complexes fig 3f when the edta ga dfob e ratio was 6 more than 95 of dfob and dfoe was released from their respective ga complexes fig 3f 3 3 ga3 complexation with dfob and dfoe in process wastewater of the wafer manufacturer ga3 complexation with dfob and dfoe in wafer fabrication wastewater was assessed to validate the applicability of dfob e for gallium recovery from the real wastewater the complexation of ga3 in p1 and p2 real process wastewaters was close to 100 when dfob or dfoe was added so that concentration of ga and dfob e is in 1 1 ratio mm mm fig 4ma 100 μl of formed ga dfob or ga dfoe complexes in p1 and p2 was injected in a c 18 reversed phase chromatography for separation of ga dfob e complexes from wastewater for the dfob more than 90 of ga dfob complex was recovered while for dfoe the recovery was greater than 96 in both p1 and p2 fig 4b and c in p1 and p2 as was major contaminant for ga dfob with fractions of 8 8 and 1 1 respectively fig 4b and c no contamination of as was observed in ga dfoe fractions fig 4b and c in both dfob e no contamination of al fe co ni and pb was found 3 4 recovery of regenerated dfob e and ga edta complex after de complexation of ga dfob and ga dfoe complexes using edta recovery of ga edta complex and free dfob e is necessary for recycling of free dfob e and purification of ga for its further application 100 μl of de complexed ga dfob e complexes and edta was injected in a c 18 reversed phase chromatography column and the fractions were collected the recovery rates for free dfob e and ga edta complex were higher than 90 fig 5 3 5 loading experiments the loading experiments on the column are important for a chromatographic scale up roadmap 5 ml of 0 25 mm ga dfob e complexes formed in synthetic wastewater containing 0 25 mm each of as ca cu mg and zn was injected into the a c 18 reverse chromatography column the synthetic solution was used as the ga recovery from synthetic wastewater was more challenging compared to process wastewaters due to higher divalent metal content in the synthetic wastewater in the case of ga dfob and contaminant injection the recovery rates of the ga dfob complex measured by hplc uv detector and of ga from the ga dfob complex measured by icp ms were 92 7 1 8 and 101 5 7 5 respectively fig 6 a and 8 6 of the total contaminant present in the synthetic wastewater as ca cu mg and zn were found fig 6a the ga3 purity moles of ga present compared with total moles of ga as ca cu mg and zn present in collected fraction increased from 16 7 in the synthetic wastewater to 69 8 in the ga dfob collected fractions in the case of ga dfoe and contaminant injection the recovery rates of ga dfoe complex measured by hplc uv detector and of ga from the ga dfoe complex measured by icp ms were 101 4 3 6 and 102 1 0 1 respectively fig 6a only 1 5 of the total contaminant present in synthetic wastewater as ca cu mg and zn were found in collected fraction fig 6a the ga3 purity in the ga dfoe fraction increased from 16 7 in the synthetic wastewater to 92 9 in collected ga dfoe fractions for the regeneration of dfob e and recovery of ga from ga dfob e complex 5 ml of the 0 5 mm ga3 dfob e and 3 mm of edta decomplexation reaction mixture was injected into a reversed phase chromatography column the free dfob e and ga3 in the ga edta complex recovery was greater than 98 fig 6b a complete dfob and dfoe based ga3 recovery technology using a c 18 reversed phase chromatographic approach is presented in fig 6c 4 discussion 4 1 recovery of ga3 from the real wastewater using the developed technology based on complexation with dfob e and reversed phase chromatography the technology presented in this work provided a recovery rate 90 for ga3 from its low concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewater and as well from synthetic wastewater which was more demanding with respect to its composition than real wastewater figs 4 and 6 further the high performance of this technology becomes apparent from the separation efficiency of ga from other contaminants e g as ca cu mg zn present in the wastewaters the purity moles of ga in ga dfob e fractions compared to total moles of ga as ca cu mg and zn for ga dfob and ga dfoe fractions were 69 8 and 92 9 respectively for 5 ml and 0 25 mm loading experiments the high purity is due to the combination of selective complexing ability of the dfob e towards ga3 and separation capability of reversed phase chromatography the high selectivity of the siderophores dfob and dfoe towards ga3 is due to the high binding energies of the ga dfob e complexes table 2 compared to other potentially competing cations such as ca2 and model divalent cation zn2 table 2 anderegg g l eplattenier f schwarzenbach 1963 borgias et al 1989 haris 2015 and references therein similarly the complex formation constants of dfob complexes of ga3 and ca2 showed larger differences when compared to respective complexes of edta suggesting that dfob shows higher selectivity towards ga3 in comparison to edta table 3 lists the differences in the complexation constants of the metal complexes with dfob and other common extraction ligands higher values represent a higher selectivity of the respective ligand towards ga3 as it can be seen in table 3 dfob shows highest selectivity towards ga3 when compared to common ligands like edta with respect to lacking data the selectivity of the dfoe towards ga3 cannot be demonstrated in table 3 nevertheless the selectivity of dfoe towards ga3 is expected to be close to that of dfob this is deduced from a comparison of the differences in the binding energies of the respective zn and ga complexes of dfoe which are quite similar for both ligands dfoe 66 6 kcal mol 1 dfob 62 8 kcal mol 1 table 2 however the affinity of dfoe to bind ga3 was obviously higher than those of dfob due to its higher binding energy table 2 this was corroborated by the finding that the decomplexation of ga3 from dfoe required two times higher concentration of edta than for dfob fig 3f ga3 present in the ga dfoe fraction 92 9 had higher purity compared to ga dfob 69 8 fraction the higher selectivity of dfoe is also due to a higher separation efficiency of the c 18 reversed phase chromatography which is ascribed to the increased hydrophobicity of the cyclic structured dfoe fig 2 dhungana et al 2001 and references therein a decrease of the injection volume or concentration of complexes would improve the purity of ga in ga dfob fractions indeed when the injection volume of ga3 complexed in synthetic solution was decreased from 5 ml to 100 μl ga purity in the ga dfob fraction increased from 69 8 to 87 8 however this step will increase the operating cost of the technology as the amount of wastewater treated in each cycle is decreased thus a fine balance is needed to achieve the lowest cost with an acceptable purity of the ga dfob e complexes 4 2 technological implications this is the first technology that can recover ga3 from low concentrated wafer fabrication industry wastewater containing 4 0 mg l 1 ga3 in comparison solvent extraction processes nusen et al 2016 and precipitation xu et al 2007 typically can work at minimum ga3 concentration of 30 and 100 1000 mg l 1 respectively as the wastewater from the wafer manufacture can vary in ph and concentration of as and other contaminants a robust technology is essential unlike other adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes zhang et al 2010 waste biomass dutta et al 2015 jain et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 or biogenic nanomaterial jain et al 2016a 2015a the recovery of the target metal by dfob e is hardly affected by ph kcl or competing ions fig 3 this is a significant advantage in comparison to conventional technologies where a stringent control of operational parameter is needed for the selective recovery of target metals that is usually required by other adsorbents e g biogenic selenium nanoparticles jain et al 2016b for the other adsorbents such as carbon nanotubes zhang et al 2010 iminodiacetic acid modified corn stalk zhang et al 2018 or goethite nore and persson 2010 ga3 adsorption capacity decreases when ph decreases from 5 0 to 2 5 whereas dfob e complexation towards ga3 was unaffected fig 3a this is because no protonation or deprotonation take place for dfob e in this ph range in general the pka of siderophores varies between 7 3 and 13 ahmed and holmström 2014 while for dfob it varies from 8 51 to 10 01 borgias et al 1989 thus in the tested ph range hdfob 2 dominates leading to the formation of ga hdfob species which has the complexation constant of 27 56 borgias et al 1989 further due to this high stability of the ga dfob complex table 2 the ga3 which generally tends to precipitate in the ph range from 3 5 to 7 0 remains in solution hagvall et al 2014 similar reasons can be attributed for ga dfoe complexation in contrast protonation of the carboxyl phosphodiester groups present on other adsorbents has pka in ph range of 2 0 5 0 resulting in lesser sites for the adsorption jain et al 2016b 2015b spataru et al 2016 thus decreasing the adsorption with decrease in ph additionally ga3 complexation by dfob e was not affected by the increase in ionic strength anion concentration or presence of arsenic fig 3b c and 3d this is due to the high stability of ga dfob e complexes table 2 and the reaction is driven towards ga dfob e complexes formation decomplexation reactions induced by edta release ga3 and are necessary for the regeneration of the dfob e ligands this study demonstrated the decomplexation with high rate of ga and free dfob e recovery figs 5 and 6 although the ga dfoe complex is more stable than the ga edta complex table 2 it can be decomplexed by excessive edta figs 3f and 5 the ga recovery from the ga edta complex is feasible by techniques such as electrochemistry cheung et al 2018 huang et al 2000 substitution by metal ions followed by precipitation and electrolysis gyliene et al 2004 or addition of complex destabilizing agents ferric ions sodium phosphate ferrous sulphate dithiocarbamates di palma et al 2003 schmelter and standish 2019 the optimization of the technique for the recovery of ga3 from ga edta complex is a task of future studies as the decomplexation of ga dfob e complexes may also be carried out by other ga3 complexing agents such as nota log β 29 63 trap h oh pr log β 21 91 23 30 26 24 šimeček et al 2012 or amino diphosphonic acids log β 25 8 bollinger and roundhill 1993 the selection of the most efficient agent depends on the capital and operational costs 4 3 roadmap for the developed technology reversed phase chromatography has been known for quantification of iron siderophore complexes based on their hydrophobicity for more than three decades konetschny rapp et al 1988 in this work it is explicitly demonstrated that the reversed phase chromatography system can be successfully applied for the recovery of ga3 from the real process wastewater using dfob e the two major cost inputs for this technology are costs of dfob e and organic mobile phase the cost of dfob e can be lowered by increasing the production order and accepting lower purity dfob e for instance in this study dfoe with 70 90 purity provided by asa spezialenzyme gmbh was used the current prices of dfob e varies between 3200 and 10 000 per kg however when the production order of dfoe is 500 kg or 5 000 kg the cost of production is 300 and 270 per kg respectively as quoted by asa spezialenzyme gmbh the galiophore technology has been presented at 1 l per day per scale for the scale up of the technology maximum loading of the ga dfob e complexes and free dfob e onto different reversed phase columns needs to be determined another aspect that needs to be tested is the use of other organic green eluents like ethanol or methanol for decreasing the cost and environmental footprint an optimum selection for hydrophobic c 18 stationary phase where minimization of the organic eluent consumption per millimoles of ga dfob e complex or free dfob e is required further the application of simulated moving bed chromatography technique in the recovery of ga dfob e and ga and free dfob e can reduce eluent consumption and packing material required by 80 90 francotte and richert 1997 juza et al 2000 nagamatsu et al 1999 after optimizing the stationary phase organic eluent and minimizing organic eluent consumption the use of chromatographic column with 10 15 μm particle size needs to be tested in a column of 4 6 mm inner diameter and 250 mm length the next steps are standard steps in scale up of chromatographic operation by simply increasing the inner diameter of column while maintaining similar performance at higher loading the most important aspect in the galiophore technology is to achieve an acceptable quality and cost reduction while carrying out scale up another challenge is the low concentration of ga in the recovered ga edta complexes solid phase extraction spe method using reversed phase column can be used to increase the ga concentrations as spe is known to increase concentration of organics as well as chelated metals hasegawa et al 2011 he et al 2013 further use of spe would decrease the organic mobile phase consumption due to the requirement of organic mobile phase only during elution 5 conclusions dfob and dfoe can selectively and sensitively complex ga3 from the process wastewater of wafer fabrication industry while 6 time excess edta at ph 3 5 can regenerate free dfob and dfoe selectivity of dfob and dfoe towards ga3 was comparably high however reversed phase chromatography separation showed a higher efficiency for dfoe resulting in a higher ga purity cost of siderophores and organic mobile phase can be reduced by larger production order of siderophores and application of substitution smb spe for organic mobile phase the combination of dfob e complexation and reversed phase chromatography can be applied for the recovery of ga3 and open doors for the siderophores based recovery of other critical metals acknowledgements the marie curie
