16865,aerucyclamide a aca is an emerging cyanopeptide toxin produced by cyanobacteria and its transformation pathway has rarely been reported in the present study aca was purified from cyanobacterial extracts and photodegradation processes were investigated in dissolved organic matter dom solutions under simulated solar irradiation the photodegradation of aca was dominated by oh oxidation accounting for 72 of the indirect photodegradation the bimolecular reaction rate constant of aca with oh was 6 4 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 our results indicated that the major reactive sites of aca toward oh are thiazoline and thiazole moieties product analysis via high resolution mass spectrometry suggested that hydrogen abstraction and gradual hydroxylation are the main photodegradation pathways the acute toxicity assessment indicate that the products generated in photolysis process did not show any measurable toxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus photodegradation experiments with various dom phycocyanin mixtures demonstrated that the half life of aca is much longer than that of microcystin lr keywords aerucyclamide a cyanotoxins dissolved organic matter photodegradation hydroxyl radical 1 introduction cyanotoxins produced by blue green algae cause emerging concerns for environmental scientists and engineers he et al 2016 the presence of these toxins in surface waters poses a considerable threat to ecological systems and human health onstad et al 2007 paerl and otten 2013 a large group among the diverse cyanotoxins are oligopeptides termed cyanopeptides in the following previous studies classified cyanopeptides into six groups microcystins cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aerucyclamides aeruginosines and microginins christophoridis et al 2018 gkelis et al 2019 janssen 2019 among those cyanopeptides only microcystins have been intensively investigated he et al 2015 pestana et al 2020 while little attention has been given to the other incredibly diverse cyanopeptides beyond the class of microcystins however recent studies have suggested that the eco toxicological risk of these other cyanopeptides is not lower than that of microcystins beversdorf et al 2017 bober et al 2011 lenz et al 2019 tonk et al 2009 the concentrations of cyanopeptides in six eutrophic lakes in the us and europe are in the μg l 1 range and microcystins are not always dominant particularly in european lakes lenz et al 2019 thus the behaviors of cyanopeptides beyond microcystins should be investigated to achieve a better understanding of the fate of cyanotoxins in aquatic environments aerucyclamide a aca belonging to the class of aerucyclamides was reported to be the most abundant cyanotoxin followed by microcystin lr mc lr during microcystis aeruginosa blooms the toxicity of aca has been reported to be approximately one third of that of mc lr based on a comparison of lc50 values assayed by thamnocephalus platyurus blom and jüttner 2005 thus the toxicological risk of aca cannot be ignored however the cumulative number of publications on aca is less than 20 compared to more than 5000 papers on microcystin over the past decades janssen 2019 thus this naturally derived emerging toxin is worth further investigation essack et al 2014 the unique structure in aerucyclamides is the combination of three groups of five membered heterocycles oxazoline thiazoline and thiazole which are not found in the other five groups of cyanopeptides the thiazole group is an important component that possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities alneyadi and ashraf 2016 thiazoline and oxazoline are widely employed in the synthesis of organic substances due to their excellent antitubercular potency moraski et al 2012 in this regard the toxicity of aerucyclamide derivatives and their transformation pathways in aquatic environments should be further investigated cyanotoxins can usually be eliminated from aquatic environments by three processes biodegradation adsorption by sediments and photochemical degradation christoffersen and kaas 2000 teng et al 2013 sunlight driven photochemical degradation has been considered a major pathway for cyanotoxin attenuation in sunlit surface waters parker and mitch 2016 in general photodegradation includes direct and indirect photodegradation chen et al 2017 direct photodegradation requires the overlap of the uv absorption spectra of cyanotoxins with the solar irradiation spectrum indirect photodegradation can be promoted by dissolved organic matter dom senga et al 2018 present in aquatic environments by absorbing sunlight dom reaches excited states and further forms a series of photoproduced reactive intermediates ppris including triplet excited states 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh zeng and arnold 2012 these ppris can oxidize a range of organic contaminants through electron energy or hydrogen transfer reactions yang et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge there is no report regarding the photochemical transformation of aca in aquatic environments hence the objectives of this study are to explore the photodegradation kinetics and to elucidate the products of aca induced by model dom under simulated solar irradiation aca was isolated and purified from microcystis aeruginosa by using semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography hplc and further verified by using hplc quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry qtof ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy a series of experiments were conducted to determine the roles of 1o2 oh and 3dom in the photodegradation process of aca in dom enriched solutions in addition the phototransformation products of aca were identified through qtof ms and a plausible degradation pathway was proposed moreover a toxicity test was performed by using crustaceans thamnocephalus platyurus which are commonly applied in toxicity assessments and are particularly sensitive to cyanobacterial toxins blinova et al 2013 bober and bialczyk 2017 toxicity assays were conducted before and after photodegradation to determine whether the phototransformation products of aca are toxic the photodegradation behaviors of aca were further compared with mc lr in dom algae organic matter aom or dom phycocyanin solutions similar to actual water environments 2 experimental section 2

cartridge was then eluted with 20 ml meoh to obtain the crude aca extracts a semipreparative hplc equipped with a c18 column 250 10 mm 5 0 μm phenomenex us was employed for further purification the 900 μl samples were flushed by a mobile phase containing 70 meoh and 30 h2o containing 20 mm ch3coonh4 at a flow rate of 4 0 ml min 1 the retention time of aca was observed from 21 17 to 22 93 min in order to ensure the purity of the aca the collection time was set as 21 60 22 51 min figure s1 of the si the aca fraction was rotary evaporated to remove meoh and then subjected to the c18 spe process again to remove salts finally the purified aca was lyophilized by a freeze dryer a small portion of dry aca 10 mg was dissolved in meoh d 4 for nmr analysis avance iii hd 500 mhz bruker us the nmr spectra of the purified aca were compared with the literature portmann et al 2008 2 3 simulated solar irradiation experiments the photochemical experiments were performed in a solar simulator suntest xls atlas us equipped with a 1700 w xenon lamp through a filter 290 nm at a chamber temperature of 25 1 c the emission spectrum of the solar simulator was recorded by a usb 4000 ocean optics us spectrometer as shown in figure s2 of the si the irradiance intensity was determined to be 1 4 10 8 mole photons cm 2 s 1 by chemical actinometers of p nitroanisole pyridine as described in our previous study zhou et al 2017 batch experiments were conducted in specially made quartz containers and a 0 5 ml sample was removed for hplc analysis after a certain irradiation time the working solution contained 1 0 μm aca and 5 0 mgc l 1 srnom and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 by 5 0 mm phosphate buffer the dissolved oxygen do under air saturated conditions was measured as 8 1 0 2 mg l 1 using a do meter wtw germany in addition isopropanol was employed to scavenge oh d2o was used to enhance the lifetime of 1o2 the effect of 3dom on aca degradation was studied by purging argon into the reaction solutions the steady state concentration of oh oh ss was determined by using ta text s2 of the si the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss was determined by using ffa text s3 of the si each measurement was carried out in triplicates 2 4 hplc uv and hplc qtof ms analyses hplc uv g1260 agilent us with a c18 column 250 4 6 mm 5 0 μm luna phenomenex us was employed to quantify the concentrations of aca in the irradiated solutions by monitoring the absorbance at λ 238 nm the injection volume of samples was 100 μl the mobile phase was 70 meoh and 30 h2o acidified with 0 05 trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 in the hplc qtof ms system an hplc g1290 agilent us was equipped with a c18 column 150 2 1 mm 3 0 μm waters us eluting with a gradient of acn and

constants of aca and model compounds were determined by competition kinetics in phosphate buffer solutions ph of 7 0 using pcba as a probe compound lian et al 2017 uv254nm h2o2 was employed to generate oh to obtain the 1o2 reaction rate constant of aca ffa was selected as a probe whose second order reaction rate constant with 1o2 was 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 lester et al 2013 rb was used as the photosensitizer for producing 1o2 burns et al 2012 eq 1 the second reaction rate constant of ppris oh and 1o2 was both calculated from the following equation 1 ln aca ac a 0 k ppri aca k ppri p ln p p 0 where aca0 and p0 are the initial concentrations of aca and the probe pcba for oh and ffa for 1o2 respectively aca and p are the concentrations at certain reaction times a plot of ln aca ac a 0 vs ln p p 0 showed a linear correlation with a slope of k ppri aca k ppri p 2 6 toxicity assays the toxicity of aca was tested in a 24 h acute toxicity assay performed with thamnocephalus platyurus provided by state university of ghent belgium cyst hatching was initiated 24 h prior to the toxicity test which was performed in diluted standard freshwater moderately hard water diluted 1 8 with di h2o the petri dish used was covered with parafilm and incubated at 25 for 24 h under continuous illumination then the larvae were transferred from the petri dish into the rinsing wells of a multi well plate five different concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μμ were tested in triplicate then ten larvae were transferred into each well and a parafilm strip was placed on the top of the plate covered tightly and incubated at 25 in darkness for 24 h finally the larvae were considered dead if they did not show any movement during 10 s of observation under a dissecting microscope nonlinear regression analysis and determination of the lc50 value were performed with graphpad prism 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of ppri in the photodegradation of aca the photochemical transformation of aca under simulated solar irradiation was investigated through a series of experiments fig 1 a demonstrates that the direct photodegradation of aca in the buffer solution was quite slow k 0 006 h 1 this is likely due to a trivial overlap of the uv absorption of aca with the solar irradiation spectrum as demonstrated in figure s5b of the si the photodegradation rate of aca was significantly higher in the 5 0 mgc l 1 dom solution k 0 065 h 1 indicating that indirect degradation played a critical role in the phototransformation of aca under environmentally relevant conditions to distinguish the roles of ppris in the photodegradation process a series of ppri inhibition enhancement studies were implemented to distinguish the effect of oh on the photodegradation of aca isopropanol 0 3 mm as a oh scavenger was spiked into the aca dom solutions as fig 1a demonstrated the photodegradation rate of aca in the presence of ipa decreased significantly suggesting that oh was critical in the indirect photodegradation process the second order rate constant of oh with aca was 6 4 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 and is shown in table 1 in addition oh ss in dom solution was determined to be 1 8 0 1 10 15 m therefore the contribution of oh accounted for 72 of the indirect photodegradation of aca in addition the pseudo first order degradation rates of aca in the six different dom solutions had a strong linear relationship with the oh ss present in the same solutions fig 1b further supporting the result that oh dominated the indirect photodegradation process of aca dissolved oxygen can rapidly react with 3dom to yield 1o2 1o2 presents a significantly slower decay rate in d2o than in h2o dalrymple et al 2010 therefore the solvent of the irradiated solution was replaced by d2o to explore the role of 1o2 fig 1a demonstrates that the photodegradation rate of aca slightly increased in the dom d2o solution 0 068 h 1 in comparison with the dom h2o solution suggesting that 1o2 plays a minor role during the photodegradation of aca the second order reaction rate constant of 1o2 with aca was determined by a competitive method the pseudo first order rates of aca and ffa are shown in figure s9 of the si which demonstrated that the pseudo first order degradation rate of ffa was much higher than that of aca thus it was speculated that the second order reaction rate constant of 1o2 with aca was lower than 104 m 1 s 1 which is consistent with a previous report manfrin et al 2019 with the use of 1o2 ss 1 3 10 13 m in air saturated solutions the contribution of 1o2 to the indirect photolysis of aca was estimated to be less than 1 in agreement with the d2o experiment to explore the role of 3dom do was reduced by purging argon into the solution considering that the quenching rate constant of 3dom by o2 is approximately 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 erickson et al 2018 the 3dom ss should increase 3 5 fold when do decreased from 8 0 mg l 1 air saturated to 0 1 mg l 1 argon saturated text s5 of the si however the apparent photodegradation rate of aca was slightly reduced under argon purging conditions compared to air saturated conditions this is likely because oh ss simultaneously decreased with decreasing do through the deduction of the contributions of direct photolysis and oh the remaining first order degradation rate of aca in argon saturated solutions 0 029 h 1 was approximately 3 6 fold higher than that under air saturated conditions 0 008 h 1 in agreement with the estimation of 3dom ss text s5 and text s6 of the si our results suggested that 3dom may accounted for approximately 28 of the indirect photodegradation of aca in air saturated dom solutions this value is indirectly calculated by subtracting the contribution of oh and 1o2 while the influence of other ppris such as o2 and phenoxyl radicals remke et al 2021 have not been considered which may lead to overestimation 3 2 reaction sites of aca with ppris as mentioned above oh and 3dom are two main reactive species for indirect photodegradation of aca contributing approximately 72 and 28 respectively of the elimination of aca therefore the reactive sites of aca toward both reactive species have been examined three model compounds 2 methyl 2 oxazoline 2 methylthiazole and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline as shown in figure s12 of the si were selected to represent the three main moieties of aca the direct photolysis rates of the three model compounds 2 methyl 2 oxazoline 2 methylthiazole and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline were negligible 0 0018 0 0004 and 0 0389 h 1 respectively compared with their indirect photolysis rates 0 0048 0 0161 and 0 2574 h 1 respectively figure s13 of the si in addition the oh reaction rate constants of 2 methylthiazole and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline were 6 5 0 1 109 and 7 4 0 3 109 m 1 s 1 similar to the observed oh reaction rate constant of aca 6 4 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 the results are also in accordance with the reported values of 4 9 7 1 109 m 1 s 1 for sulfur containing five membered heterocyclic substituents boreen et al 2004 the second order rate constant of 2 methyl 2 oxazoline with oh was only 3 2 0 1 108 m 1 s 1 which is one order of magnitude lower than the value of aca table 1 this result indicates that the reaction of the oxazoline group with oh was much slower than those of the thiazole and thiazoline moieties the oxazoline moiety reacts with oh through h abstraction which is generally slower than the rates of oh addition song et al 2012 therefore we suggest that the reactions between oh and aca mainly occurred at the thiazole and thiazoline rings moreover the oh reaction with five membered heterocyclic compounds unsaturated usually yields ho addition products by the addition of oh groups to the c c double bonds atkinson 1986 dogan et al 1990 to explore the contribution of 3dom to aca 3 map was employed as a model photosensitizer to generate the triplet excited states the pseudo first order degradation rates of the targets aca and model compounds and tmp as a competitor are illustrated in figure s14 of the si the pseudo first order decay rate of tmp 0 1542 min 1 was 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of aca 0 0001 min 1 indicating that 3dom cannot be a major reactive species for the photodegradation of aca the pseudo first order decay rates of the model compounds 2 methyl 2 oxazoline 0 0017 min 1 2 methylthiazole 0 0004 min 1 and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline 0 0011 min 1 were similar to that of aca this result is not frame with the result above the difference on the reactivity between model sensitizer 3 map and dom were proposed as the main reason 3dom is a mixture of different triple energies of organic molecules while 3 map may only model some of the triplet states in 3dom thus the result calculated by 3 map cannot represent the contribution of 3dom on the aca photodegradation nevertheless both the enhancing quenching experiment and the model sensitizer experiment indicated that the influence of 3dom on the photodegradation of aca is not significant furthermore the role of 3dom and other ppris such as o2 and phenoxyl radical on the aca photodegradation should be further considered 3 3 mechanistic consideration of aca photodegradation the oh induced oxidation processes are very complex and usually generate a series of products with low yields in general oh can rapidly react with organic contaminants through three major routes minakata et al 2015 i e h atom abstraction oh addition to the unsaturated carbons of aliphatic or aromatic compounds and electron transfer to separate and identify these byproducts a high concentration of aca 50 μm prepared in 5 mgc l 1 srnom solution was illuminated under simulated solar irradiation the photodegradation products of aca were identified by using a hplc qtof system and exact m z values corresponding to the chemical formulas were analyzed and are summarized in table 2 the reaction profiles of the products are shown in figure s15 of the si and the detailed definitions for the products were described in text s7 of the si from text s7 2 to text s7 11 the molecular formula could represent several isomeric structures different positions of hydroxyl groups due to the complicated radical chemistry hence the ms ms mode of qtof was applied to further analyze the chemical structures of the products by proofreading the mass fragments fig 2 the primary product observed from the analysis of the ms results was p533 which was assigned to aerucyclamide b acb as shown in text s7 2 of the si acb is accumulated with continued irradiation the same product was also identified in the mno2 oxidation of aca as they share the same ms2 spectra m z 515 1894 422 1673 and 197 0743 portmann et al 2008 in addition acb which is also an aerucyclamide toxin has a structure similar to that of aca and is usually found and can be isolated from natural algae with aca compared to the ms2 of aca figure s7 of the si the fragments m z 515 1894 and 422 1673 of acb suggested that the thiazoline moiety loses two h atoms to yield a thiazole moiety the product p551 text s7 3 of the si differed by 16 da from aca resulting from the hydroxylation of the c6 c7 double bond in the thiazole ring by oh attack the available kinetic and mechanistic data show that the reaction of oh with short chain aliphatic alkenes or heterocyclic rings proceeds predominantly via the addition of oh to the carbon carbon double bond leading to terminal ho adduct formation loison et al 2010 ho r ch ch2 r ch ch2 oh 2 in the presence of oxygen ho alkene adducts are converted to peroxyl radicals with rate constants of 108 m 1 s 1 atkinson and lloyd 1984 hazra and steenken 1983 consequently a thermodynamically stable conjugated product p551 was generated from the decomposition of peroxyl radicals eq 3 he et al 2014 r ch ch2 oh o2 r hco2 ch2 oh r ch2 c o h ho2 3 on the other hand the ms2 spectrum of the p551 product yielded the same fragments m z 424 185 252 0437 199 0897 184 0539 154 0687 141 0982 and 131 0304 as those from the parent compound the fragments with m z 533 1974 p551 18 da and m z 479 1508 differing by 18 da from fragment m z 461 1424 from the parent compound generated by the dehydration reaction supported this assignment the dihydroxylated product p569 m z 569 2211 from aca was observed in the current study text s7 7 of the si previous literature has suggested that ho2 o2 efficiently reacts with oh adducts on c c bonds to yield hydroperoxides von sonntag and schuchmann 1985 thus we propose that a similar dihydroxylation mechanism occurred at the c6 c7 double bond resulting in a byproduct of p569 which subsequently transformed into a stable byproduct of p567a m z 567 2054 text s7 5 of the si by losing two h groups the corresponding ms2 results of p569 showed the same fragments as aca including m z 154 0642 199 0870 and 226 1008 the existence of a fragment with m z 154 0662 from p567a supported our proposal the proceeding observations of the product 2 thiolactone were coupled with the thermodynamic result that oh was added to the two c atom positions of the thiophene ring saunders et al 1978 whereas oh addition onto the sulfur atom was found to be an endogenic process δg 0 shiroudi and deleuze 2015 therefore the direct hydroxylation of p551 at the thiazoline group led to the formation of p567b m z 567 2059 the ms2 fragments of p567b m z 549 1936 and 171 0203 support the rationality of the hydroxylation of the thiazoline ring text s7 6 of the si as it has the same fragment m z 154 0662 as the parent compound multiple hydroxylated byproducts p585 m z 585 2160 text s7 8 of the si and p601a m z 601 2109 text s7 9 of the si could also be generated by the same hydroxylation mechanism of sulfur containing heterocyclic rings fragments m z 226 1002 154 0606 and 141 0117 of p585 were observed with those of aca which also supported our proposed multiple hydroxylation of the parent compound further hydroxylation of p585 and p601a led to the formation of p601b m z 601 2109 text s7 10 of the si and p617 m z 617 2058 text s7 11 of the si respectively these compounds could be formed by the addition of oh to c5 directly bonded to ch3 of the oxazoline ring dogan et al 1990 the ms2 results of p617 presented fragments with several hydroxyl groups and supported the multiple hydroxylated reaction process overall the difference of 16 da among the intermediates p551 p569 p585 p601 and p617 and of 2 da among the products p532 implied that h abstraction and gradual hydroxylation were the main reaction pathways of the photodegradation of aca 3 4 the toxicity assessments of aca it is a daunting task to isolate single compounds from the complex mixtures of the byproducts implying the impossibility of exploring the acute toxicity of a single byproduct of aca hence the 24 h acute toxicity assay performed with thamnocephalus platyurus was applied to assess the acute toxicity of the treated solutions at various irradiation times 0 60 h before that a calibration curve for thamnocephalus platyurus mortality as a function of the concentration of aca and mc lr was constructed as presented in figure s16 of the si indicating that the acute aca toxicity lc50 45 5 μm was approximately one quarter of mc lr lc50 11 2 μm the concentration of aca was reduced from 95 μm to 5 7 μm during 60 h irradiation and the corresponding mortality decreased from 85 to 8 as illustrated in fig 3 the acute toxicity of photodegraded aca could be converted into the equivalent aca concentration through the aca standard calibration curve suggesting that the equivalent aca concentrations obtained from the standard curve matched well with the photolysis residual concentrations of aca in other words photodegradation products of aca did not exhibit any measurable cytotoxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus in addition it needs to notify that although acb exhibit toxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus the concentration of acb is much lower than that of aca residual text s7 2 during the aca photolysis process we suggested that the toxic of acb generated by aca photodegradation can be ignored in this experiment 3 5 photodegradation of mc lr and aca in various water matrices aom resulting from frequent cyanobacterial blooms is a major dom component in eutrophic lakes aom contains polysaccharides proteins lipids and a series of intracellular pigments phycocyanin accounting for the major proportion of pigments is a blue water soluble pigment that is a conjugated biliprotein with a structure similar to porphyrin under bloom conditions phycocyanin can be regarded as a type of photosensitizer equivalent to dom generating a series of ppris to promote the degradation of algal toxins li et al 2015 mc lr is the most studied algal toxin therefore it was selected as a reference compound in this study as illustrated in fig 4 with phycocyanin as a photosensitizer the degradation rate of mc lr increased as the concentration of phycocyanin increased furthermore the slope significantly decreased when the concentration of phycocyanin exceeded 500 mg l 1 however the degradation rates of aca remained constant in this wide range of phycocyanin concentrations to explain this phenomenon we proposed that the photodegradation mechanism of mc lr is different from that of aca the photodegradation of mc lr is dominated by triplets yan et al 2014 meanwhile the steady state concentrations of triplets increased with increasing phycocyanin concentration nevertheless the degradation of aca was dominated by oh and oh ss figure s17 of the si remained constant under various phycocyanin concentrations because phycocyanin is both a photosensitizer and quencher of oh to further investigate the role of phycocyanin in the photodegradation of cyanotoxins the combined application of dom and phycocyanin is shown in figure s18 of the si it was obvious that the addition of phycocyanin slowed down the degradation of both aca and mc lr in particular the addition of phycocyanin more significantly reduced the degradation rates of aca from 0 58 to 0 02 in comparison with the phycocyanin solution the extracted aom was more complex containing polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids etc hsiao et al 2021 compared to those in dom solutions the degradation rates of aca and mc lr were reduced by 75 and 50 in the dom aom coexisting solutions figure s19 of the si the competitive and synergetic effects of photosensitization and light screening in the presence of dom and aom are not yet fully understood and need further investigation but the inhibitory influence is apparent in addition the results also showed that the half life of aca was much longer than that of mc lr in different sunlit water matrices the contribution of oh oxidation to aca and mc lr attenuation in various water matrices was estimated by spiking 0 3 mm isopropanol figure s20 of the si the oh oxidation for aca attenuation ranged from 55 72 for phycocyanin solutions and 59 76 for dom phycocyanin mixtures the involvement of oh in the degradation of mc lr was significantly smaller accounting for only 10 29 which is consistent with our previous publication that oh reaction pathways account for 25 of the degradation of mc lr in dom solutions yan et al 2014 the difference in the photoreactivity of the two algal toxins can be rationalized the two sulfur containing heterocyclic rings present in aca are only reactive toward oh whereas the photosensitized isomerization of the adda side chain of mc lr is induced by direct energy transfer with 3dom in addition oh ss is expected to be much lower than 3dom ss in illuminated solutions page et al 2014 sulzberger et al 1997 the photodegradation rates of aca could be predicted by building a relationship with the concentrations of oh the photoinduced loss rates of mc lr are not comparable to those of aca and should be predicted by the steady state concentrations of triplets 4 conclusion in the present work the kinetics and mechanism of photodegradation of the emerging algal toxin aca were studied our results demonstrate that oh accounted for 72 of the indirect photolysis of aca other processes such as 1o2 and 3dom played minor roles oh mainly attacked the two sulfur containing heterocyclic rings of aca by h atom abstraction and gradual hydroxylation concomitant acb another type of algal toxin of aerucyclamides was observed during the hydroxyl dependent process and was also degraded following aca the photodegradation products of aca did not exhibit measurable toxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus considering the complicated natural environment different concentrations of phycocyanin were employed to explore the degradation of algal toxins the average oh concentrations in sunlit waters ranged from 10 17 to 10 16 m and the half life of aca corresponded to approximately 12 125 days which could be significantly longer than that of another important cyanotoxin mc lr supporting information additional text with experimental details is provided in the supporting information the support information includes 20 figures 7

16865,aerucyclamide a aca is an emerging cyanopeptide toxin produced by cyanobacteria and its transformation pathway has rarely been reported in the present study aca was purified from cyanobacterial extracts and photodegradation processes were investigated in dissolved organic matter dom solutions under simulated solar irradiation the photodegradation of aca was dominated by oh oxidation accounting for 72 of the indirect photodegradation the bimolecular reaction rate constant of aca with oh was 6 4 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 our results indicated that the major reactive sites of aca toward oh are thiazoline and thiazole moieties product analysis via high resolution mass spectrometry suggested that hydrogen abstraction and gradual hydroxylation are the main photodegradation pathways the acute toxicity assessment indicate that the products generated in photolysis process did not show any measurable toxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus photodegradation experiments with various dom phycocyanin mixtures demonstrated that the half life of aca is much longer than that of microcystin lr keywords aerucyclamide a cyanotoxins dissolved organic matter photodegradation hydroxyl radical 1 introduction cyanotoxins produced by blue green algae cause emerging concerns for environmental scientists and engineers he et al 2016 the presence of these toxins in surface waters poses a considerable threat to ecological systems and human health onstad et al 2007 paerl and otten 2013 a large group among the diverse cyanotoxins are oligopeptides termed cyanopeptides in the following previous studies classified cyanopeptides into six groups microcystins cyanopeptolins anabaenopeptins aerucyclamides aeruginosines and microginins christophoridis et al 2018 gkelis et al 2019 janssen 2019 among those cyanopeptides only microcystins have been intensively investigated he et al 2015 pestana et al 2020 while little attention has been given to the other incredibly diverse cyanopeptides beyond the class of microcystins however recent studies have suggested that the eco toxicological risk of these other cyanopeptides is not lower than that of microcystins beversdorf et al 2017 bober et al 2011 lenz et al 2019 tonk et al 2009 the concentrations of cyanopeptides in six eutrophic lakes in the us and europe are in the μg l 1 range and microcystins are not always dominant particularly in european lakes lenz et al 2019 thus the behaviors of cyanopeptides beyond microcystins should be investigated to achieve a better understanding of the fate of cyanotoxins in aquatic environments aerucyclamide a aca belonging to the class of aerucyclamides was reported to be the most abundant cyanotoxin followed by microcystin lr mc lr during microcystis aeruginosa blooms the toxicity of aca has been reported to be approximately one third of that of mc lr based on a comparison of lc50 values assayed by thamnocephalus platyurus blom and jüttner 2005 thus the toxicological risk of aca cannot be ignored however the cumulative number of publications on aca is less than 20 compared to more than 5000 papers on microcystin over the past decades janssen 2019 thus this naturally derived emerging toxin is worth further investigation essack et al 2014 the unique structure in aerucyclamides is the combination of three groups of five membered heterocycles oxazoline thiazoline and thiazole which are not found in the other five groups of cyanopeptides the thiazole group is an important component that possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities alneyadi and ashraf 2016 thiazoline and oxazoline are widely employed in the synthesis of organic substances due to their excellent antitubercular potency moraski et al 2012 in this regard the toxicity of aerucyclamide derivatives and their transformation pathways in aquatic environments should be further investigated cyanotoxins can usually be eliminated from aquatic environments by three processes biodegradation adsorption by sediments and photochemical degradation christoffersen and kaas 2000 teng et al 2013 sunlight driven photochemical degradation has been considered a major pathway for cyanotoxin attenuation in sunlit surface waters parker and mitch 2016 in general photodegradation includes direct and indirect photodegradation chen et al 2017 direct photodegradation requires the overlap of the uv absorption spectra of cyanotoxins with the solar irradiation spectrum indirect photodegradation can be promoted by dissolved organic matter dom senga et al 2018 present in aquatic environments by absorbing sunlight dom reaches excited states and further forms a series of photoproduced reactive intermediates ppris including triplet excited states 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radicals o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh zeng and arnold 2012 these ppris can oxidize a range of organic contaminants through electron energy or hydrogen transfer reactions yang et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge there is no report regarding the photochemical transformation of aca in aquatic environments hence the objectives of this study are to explore the photodegradation kinetics and to elucidate the products of aca induced by model dom under simulated solar irradiation aca was isolated and purified from microcystis aeruginosa by using semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography hplc and further verified by using hplc quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry qtof ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy a series of experiments were conducted to determine the roles of 1o2 oh and 3dom in the photodegradation process of aca in dom enriched solutions in addition the phototransformation products of aca were identified through qtof ms and a plausible degradation pathway was proposed moreover a toxicity test was performed by using crustaceans thamnocephalus platyurus which are commonly applied in toxicity assessments and are particularly sensitive to cyanobacterial toxins blinova et al 2013 bober and bialczyk 2017 toxicity assays were conducted before and after photodegradation to determine whether the phototransformation products of aca are toxic the photodegradation behaviors of aca were further compared with mc lr in dom algae organic matter aom or dom phycocyanin solutions similar to actual water environments 2 experimental section 2

cartridge was then eluted with 20 ml meoh to obtain the crude aca extracts a semipreparative hplc equipped with a c18 column 250 10 mm 5 0 μm phenomenex us was employed for further purification the 900 μl samples were flushed by a mobile phase containing 70 meoh and 30 h2o containing 20 mm ch3coonh4 at a flow rate of 4 0 ml min 1 the retention time of aca was observed from 21 17 to 22 93 min in order to ensure the purity of the aca the collection time was set as 21 60 22 51 min figure s1 of the si the aca fraction was rotary evaporated to remove meoh and then subjected to the c18 spe process again to remove salts finally the purified aca was lyophilized by a freeze dryer a small portion of dry aca 10 mg was dissolved in meoh d 4 for nmr analysis avance iii hd 500 mhz bruker us the nmr spectra of the purified aca were compared with the literature portmann et al 2008 2 3 simulated solar irradiation experiments the photochemical experiments were performed in a solar simulator suntest xls atlas us equipped with a 1700 w xenon lamp through a filter 290 nm at a chamber temperature of 25 1 c the emission spectrum of the solar simulator was recorded by a usb 4000 ocean optics us spectrometer as shown in figure s2 of the si the irradiance intensity was determined to be 1 4 10 8 mole photons cm 2 s 1 by chemical actinometers of p nitroanisole pyridine as described in our previous study zhou et al 2017 batch experiments were conducted in specially made quartz containers and a 0 5 ml sample was removed for hplc analysis after a certain irradiation time the working solution contained 1 0 μm aca and 5 0 mgc l 1 srnom and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 by 5 0 mm phosphate buffer the dissolved oxygen do under air saturated conditions was measured as 8 1 0 2 mg l 1 using a do meter wtw germany in addition isopropanol was employed to scavenge oh d2o was used to enhance the lifetime of 1o2 the effect of 3dom on aca degradation was studied by purging argon into the reaction solutions the steady state concentration of oh oh ss was determined by using ta text s2 of the si the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss was determined by using ffa text s3 of the si each measurement was carried out in triplicates 2 4 hplc uv and hplc qtof ms analyses hplc uv g1260 agilent us with a c18 column 250 4 6 mm 5 0 μm luna phenomenex us was employed to quantify the concentrations of aca in the irradiated solutions by monitoring the absorbance at λ 238 nm the injection volume of samples was 100 μl the mobile phase was 70 meoh and 30 h2o acidified with 0 05 trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 in the hplc qtof ms system an hplc g1290 agilent us was equipped with a c18 column 150 2 1 mm 3 0 μm waters us eluting with a gradient of acn and

the auto ms ms mode and targeted ms ms mode with different collision energies 20 30 and 40 v were used to identify the aca and its potential products the qtof ms parameters were as following sheath

constants of aca and model compounds were determined by competition kinetics in phosphate buffer solutions ph of 7 0 using pcba as a probe compound lian et al 2017 uv254nm h2o2 was employed to generate oh to obtain the 1o2 reaction rate constant of aca ffa was selected as a probe whose second order reaction rate constant with 1o2 was 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 lester et al 2013 rb was used as the photosensitizer for producing 1o2 burns et al 2012 eq 1 the second reaction rate constant of ppris oh and 1o2 was both calculated from the following equation 1 ln aca ac a 0 k ppri aca k ppri p ln p p 0 where aca0 and p0 are the initial concentrations of aca and the probe pcba for oh and ffa for 1o2 respectively aca and p are the concentrations at certain reaction times a plot of ln aca ac a 0 vs ln p p 0 showed a linear correlation with a slope of k ppri aca k ppri p 2 6 toxicity assays the toxicity of aca was tested in a 24 h acute toxicity assay performed with thamnocephalus platyurus provided by state university of ghent belgium cyst hatching was initiated 24 h prior to the toxicity test which was performed in diluted standard freshwater moderately hard water diluted 1 8 with di h2o the petri dish used was covered with parafilm and incubated at 25 for 24 h under continuous illumination then the larvae were transferred from the petri dish into the rinsing wells of a multi well plate five different concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μμ were tested in triplicate then ten larvae were transferred into each well and a parafilm strip was placed on the top of the plate covered tightly and incubated at 25 in darkness for 24 h finally the larvae were considered dead if they did not show any movement during 10 s of observation under a dissecting microscope nonlinear regression analysis and determination of the lc50 value were performed with graphpad prism 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of ppri in the photodegradation of aca the photochemical transformation of aca under simulated solar irradiation was investigated through a series of experiments fig 1 a demonstrates that the direct photodegradation of aca in the buffer solution was quite slow k 0 006 h 1 this is likely due to a trivial overlap of the uv absorption of aca with the solar irradiation spectrum as demonstrated in figure s5b of the si the photodegradation rate of aca was significantly higher in the 5 0 mgc l 1 dom solution k 0 065 h 1 indicating that indirect degradation played a critical role in the phototransformation of aca under environmentally relevant conditions to distinguish the roles of ppris in the photodegradation process a series of ppri inhibition enhancement studies were implemented to distinguish the effect of oh on the photodegradation of aca isopropanol 0 3 mm as a oh scavenger was spiked into the aca dom solutions as fig 1a demonstrated the photodegradation rate of aca in the presence of ipa decreased significantly suggesting that oh was critical in the indirect photodegradation process the second order rate constant of oh with aca was 6 4 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 and is shown in table 1 in addition oh ss in dom solution was determined to be 1 8 0 1 10 15 m therefore the contribution of oh accounted for 72 of the indirect photodegradation of aca in addition the pseudo first order degradation rates of aca in the six different dom solutions had a strong linear relationship with the oh ss present in the same solutions fig 1b further supporting the result that oh dominated the indirect photodegradation process of aca dissolved oxygen can rapidly react with 3dom to yield 1o2 1o2 presents a significantly slower decay rate in d2o than in h2o dalrymple et al 2010 therefore the solvent of the irradiated solution was replaced by d2o to explore the role of 1o2 fig 1a demonstrates that the photodegradation rate of aca slightly increased in the dom d2o solution 0 068 h 1 in comparison with the dom h2o solution suggesting that 1o2 plays a minor role during the photodegradation of aca the second order reaction rate constant of 1o2 with aca was determined by a competitive method the pseudo first order rates of aca and ffa are shown in figure s9 of the si which demonstrated that the pseudo first order degradation rate of ffa was much higher than that of aca thus it was speculated that the second order reaction rate constant of 1o2 with aca was lower than 104 m 1 s 1 which is consistent with a previous report manfrin et al 2019 with the use of 1o2 ss 1 3 10 13 m in air saturated solutions the contribution of 1o2 to the indirect photolysis of aca was estimated to be less than 1 in agreement with the d2o experiment to explore the role of 3dom do was reduced by purging argon into the solution considering that the quenching rate constant of 3dom by o2 is approximately 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 erickson et al 2018 the 3dom ss should increase 3 5 fold when do decreased from 8 0 mg l 1 air saturated to 0 1 mg l 1 argon saturated text s5 of the si however the apparent photodegradation rate of aca was slightly reduced under argon purging conditions compared to air saturated conditions this is likely because oh ss simultaneously decreased with decreasing do through the deduction of the contributions of direct photolysis and oh the remaining first order degradation rate of aca in argon saturated solutions 0 029 h 1 was approximately 3 6 fold higher than that under air saturated conditions 0 008 h 1 in agreement with the estimation of 3dom ss text s5 and text s6 of the si our results suggested that 3dom may accounted for approximately 28 of the indirect photodegradation of aca in air saturated dom solutions this value is indirectly calculated by subtracting the contribution of oh and 1o2 while the influence of other ppris such as o2 and phenoxyl radicals remke et al 2021 have not been considered which may lead to overestimation 3 2 reaction sites of aca with ppris as mentioned above oh and 3dom are two main reactive species for indirect photodegradation of aca contributing approximately 72 and 28 respectively of the elimination of aca therefore the reactive sites of aca toward both reactive species have been examined three model compounds 2 methyl 2 oxazoline 2 methylthiazole and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline as shown in figure s12 of the si were selected to represent the three main moieties of aca the direct photolysis rates of the three model compounds 2 methyl 2 oxazoline 2 methylthiazole and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline were negligible 0 0018 0 0004 and 0 0389 h 1 respectively compared with their indirect photolysis rates 0 0048 0 0161 and 0 2574 h 1 respectively figure s13 of the si in addition the oh reaction rate constants of 2 methylthiazole and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline were 6 5 0 1 109 and 7 4 0 3 109 m 1 s 1 similar to the observed oh reaction rate constant of aca 6 4 0 2 109 m 1 s 1 the results are also in accordance with the reported values of 4 9 7 1 109 m 1 s 1 for sulfur containing five membered heterocyclic substituents boreen et al 2004 the second order rate constant of 2 methyl 2 oxazoline with oh was only 3 2 0 1 108 m 1 s 1 which is one order of magnitude lower than the value of aca table 1 this result indicates that the reaction of the oxazoline group with oh was much slower than those of the thiazole and thiazoline moieties the oxazoline moiety reacts with oh through h abstraction which is generally slower than the rates of oh addition song et al 2012 therefore we suggest that the reactions between oh and aca mainly occurred at the thiazole and thiazoline rings moreover the oh reaction with five membered heterocyclic compounds unsaturated usually yields ho addition products by the addition of oh groups to the c c double bonds atkinson 1986 dogan et al 1990 to explore the contribution of 3dom to aca 3 map was employed as a model photosensitizer to generate the triplet excited states the pseudo first order degradation rates of the targets aca and model compounds and tmp as a competitor are illustrated in figure s14 of the si the pseudo first order decay rate of tmp 0 1542 min 1 was 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of aca 0 0001 min 1 indicating that 3dom cannot be a major reactive species for the photodegradation of aca the pseudo first order decay rates of the model compounds 2 methyl 2 oxazoline 0 0017 min 1 2 methylthiazole 0 0004 min 1 and 2 methyl 2 thiazoline 0 0011 min 1 were similar to that of aca this result is not frame with the result above the difference on the reactivity between model sensitizer 3 map and dom were proposed as the main reason 3dom is a mixture of different triple energies of organic molecules while 3 map may only model some of the triplet states in 3dom thus the result calculated by 3 map cannot represent the contribution of 3dom on the aca photodegradation nevertheless both the enhancing quenching experiment and the model sensitizer experiment indicated that the influence of 3dom on the photodegradation of aca is not significant furthermore the role of 3dom and other ppris such as o2 and phenoxyl radical on the aca photodegradation should be further considered 3 3 mechanistic consideration of aca photodegradation the oh induced oxidation processes are very complex and usually generate a series of products with low yields in general oh can rapidly react with organic contaminants through three major routes minakata et al 2015 i e h atom abstraction oh addition to the unsaturated carbons of aliphatic or aromatic compounds and electron transfer to separate and identify these byproducts a high concentration of aca 50 μm prepared in 5 mgc l 1 srnom solution was illuminated under simulated solar irradiation the photodegradation products of aca were identified by using a hplc qtof system and exact m z values corresponding to the chemical formulas were analyzed and are summarized in table 2 the reaction profiles of the products are shown in figure s15 of the si and the detailed definitions for the products were described in text s7 of the si from text s7 2 to text s7 11 the molecular formula could represent several isomeric structures different positions of hydroxyl groups due to the complicated radical chemistry hence the ms ms mode of qtof was applied to further analyze the chemical structures of the products by proofreading the mass fragments fig 2 the primary product observed from the analysis of the ms results was p533 which was assigned to aerucyclamide b acb as shown in text s7 2 of the si acb is accumulated with continued irradiation the same product was also identified in the mno2 oxidation of aca as they share the same ms2 spectra m z 515 1894 422 1673 and 197 0743 portmann et al 2008 in addition acb which is also an aerucyclamide toxin has a structure similar to that of aca and is usually found and can be isolated from natural algae with aca compared to the ms2 of aca figure s7 of the si the fragments m z 515 1894 and 422 1673 of acb suggested that the thiazoline moiety loses two h atoms to yield a thiazole moiety the product p551 text s7 3 of the si differed by 16 da from aca resulting from the hydroxylation of the c6 c7 double bond in the thiazole ring by oh attack the available kinetic and mechanistic data show that the reaction of oh with short chain aliphatic alkenes or heterocyclic rings proceeds predominantly via the addition of oh to the carbon carbon double bond leading to terminal ho adduct formation loison et al 2010 ho r ch ch2 r ch ch2 oh 2 in the presence of oxygen ho alkene adducts are converted to peroxyl radicals with rate constants of 108 m 1 s 1 atkinson and lloyd 1984 hazra and steenken 1983 consequently a thermodynamically stable conjugated product p551 was generated from the decomposition of peroxyl radicals eq 3 he et al 2014 r ch ch2 oh o2 r hco2 ch2 oh r ch2 c o h ho2 3 on the other hand the ms2 spectrum of the p551 product yielded the same fragments m z 424 185 252 0437 199 0897 184 0539 154 0687 141 0982 and 131 0304 as those from the parent compound the fragments with m z 533 1974 p551 18 da and m z 479 1508 differing by 18 da from fragment m z 461 1424 from the parent compound generated by the dehydration reaction supported this assignment the dihydroxylated product p569 m z 569 2211 from aca was observed in the current study text s7 7 of the si previous literature has suggested that ho2 o2 efficiently reacts with oh adducts on c c bonds to yield hydroperoxides von sonntag and schuchmann 1985 thus we propose that a similar dihydroxylation mechanism occurred at the c6 c7 double bond resulting in a byproduct of p569 which subsequently transformed into a stable byproduct of p567a m z 567 2054 text s7 5 of the si by losing two h groups the corresponding ms2 results of p569 showed the same fragments as aca including m z 154 0642 199 0870 and 226 1008 the existence of a fragment with m z 154 0662 from p567a supported our proposal the proceeding observations of the product 2 thiolactone were coupled with the thermodynamic result that oh was added to the two c atom positions of the thiophene ring saunders et al 1978 whereas oh addition onto the sulfur atom was found to be an endogenic process δg 0 shiroudi and deleuze 2015 therefore the direct hydroxylation of p551 at the thiazoline group led to the formation of p567b m z 567 2059 the ms2 fragments of p567b m z 549 1936 and 171 0203 support the rationality of the hydroxylation of the thiazoline ring text s7 6 of the si as it has the same fragment m z 154 0662 as the parent compound multiple hydroxylated byproducts p585 m z 585 2160 text s7 8 of the si and p601a m z 601 2109 text s7 9 of the si could also be generated by the same hydroxylation mechanism of sulfur containing heterocyclic rings fragments m z 226 1002 154 0606 and 141 0117 of p585 were observed with those of aca which also supported our proposed multiple hydroxylation of the parent compound further hydroxylation of p585 and p601a led to the formation of p601b m z 601 2109 text s7 10 of the si and p617 m z 617 2058 text s7 11 of the si respectively these compounds could be formed by the addition of oh to c5 directly bonded to ch3 of the oxazoline ring dogan et al 1990 the ms2 results of p617 presented fragments with several hydroxyl groups and supported the multiple hydroxylated reaction process overall the difference of 16 da among the intermediates p551 p569 p585 p601 and p617 and of 2 da among the products p532 implied that h abstraction and gradual hydroxylation were the main reaction pathways of the photodegradation of aca 3 4 the toxicity assessments of aca it is a daunting task to isolate single compounds from the complex mixtures of the byproducts implying the impossibility of exploring the acute toxicity of a single byproduct of aca hence the 24 h acute toxicity assay performed with thamnocephalus platyurus was applied to assess the acute toxicity of the treated solutions at various irradiation times 0 60 h before that a calibration curve for thamnocephalus platyurus mortality as a function of the concentration of aca and mc lr was constructed as presented in figure s16 of the si indicating that the acute aca toxicity lc50 45 5 μm was approximately one quarter of mc lr lc50 11 2 μm the concentration of aca was reduced from 95 μm to 5 7 μm during 60 h irradiation and the corresponding mortality decreased from 85 to 8 as illustrated in fig 3 the acute toxicity of photodegraded aca could be converted into the equivalent aca concentration through the aca standard calibration curve suggesting that the equivalent aca concentrations obtained from the standard curve matched well with the photolysis residual concentrations of aca in other words photodegradation products of aca did not exhibit any measurable cytotoxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus in addition it needs to notify that although acb exhibit toxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus the concentration of acb is much lower than that of aca residual text s7 2 during the aca photolysis process we suggested that the toxic of acb generated by aca photodegradation can be ignored in this experiment 3 5 photodegradation of mc lr and aca in various water matrices aom resulting from frequent cyanobacterial blooms is a major dom component in eutrophic lakes aom contains polysaccharides proteins lipids and a series of intracellular pigments phycocyanin accounting for the major proportion of pigments is a blue water soluble pigment that is a conjugated biliprotein with a structure similar to porphyrin under bloom conditions phycocyanin can be regarded as a type of photosensitizer equivalent to dom generating a series of ppris to promote the degradation of algal toxins li et al 2015 mc lr is the most studied algal toxin therefore it was selected as a reference compound in this study as illustrated in fig 4 with phycocyanin as a photosensitizer the degradation rate of mc lr increased as the concentration of phycocyanin increased furthermore the slope significantly decreased when the concentration of phycocyanin exceeded 500 mg l 1 however the degradation rates of aca remained constant in this wide range of phycocyanin concentrations to explain this phenomenon we proposed that the photodegradation mechanism of mc lr is different from that of aca the photodegradation of mc lr is dominated by triplets yan et al 2014 meanwhile the steady state concentrations of triplets increased with increasing phycocyanin concentration nevertheless the degradation of aca was dominated by oh and oh ss figure s17 of the si remained constant under various phycocyanin concentrations because phycocyanin is both a photosensitizer and quencher of oh to further investigate the role of phycocyanin in the photodegradation of cyanotoxins the combined application of dom and phycocyanin is shown in figure s18 of the si it was obvious that the addition of phycocyanin slowed down the degradation of both aca and mc lr in particular the addition of phycocyanin more significantly reduced the degradation rates of aca from 0 58 to 0 02 in comparison with the phycocyanin solution the extracted aom was more complex containing polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids etc hsiao et al 2021 compared to those in dom solutions the degradation rates of aca and mc lr were reduced by 75 and 50 in the dom aom coexisting solutions figure s19 of the si the competitive and synergetic effects of photosensitization and light screening in the presence of dom and aom are not yet fully understood and need further investigation but the inhibitory influence is apparent in addition the results also showed that the half life of aca was much longer than that of mc lr in different sunlit water matrices the contribution of oh oxidation to aca and mc lr attenuation in various water matrices was estimated by spiking 0 3 mm isopropanol figure s20 of the si the oh oxidation for aca attenuation ranged from 55 72 for phycocyanin solutions and 59 76 for dom phycocyanin mixtures the involvement of oh in the degradation of mc lr was significantly smaller accounting for only 10 29 which is consistent with our previous publication that oh reaction pathways account for 25 of the degradation of mc lr in dom solutions yan et al 2014 the difference in the photoreactivity of the two algal toxins can be rationalized the two sulfur containing heterocyclic rings present in aca are only reactive toward oh whereas the photosensitized isomerization of the adda side chain of mc lr is induced by direct energy transfer with 3dom in addition oh ss is expected to be much lower than 3dom ss in illuminated solutions page et al 2014 sulzberger et al 1997 the photodegradation rates of aca could be predicted by building a relationship with the concentrations of oh the photoinduced loss rates of mc lr are not comparable to those of aca and should be predicted by the steady state concentrations of triplets 4 conclusion in the present work the kinetics and mechanism of photodegradation of the emerging algal toxin aca were studied our results demonstrate that oh accounted for 72 of the indirect photolysis of aca other processes such as 1o2 and 3dom played minor roles oh mainly attacked the two sulfur containing heterocyclic rings of aca by h atom abstraction and gradual hydroxylation concomitant acb another type of algal toxin of aerucyclamides was observed during the hydroxyl dependent process and was also degraded following aca the photodegradation products of aca did not exhibit measurable toxicity to thamnocephalus platyurus considering the complicated natural environment different concentrations of phycocyanin were employed to explore the degradation of algal toxins the average oh concentrations in sunlit waters ranged from 10 17 to 10 16 m and the half life of aca corresponded to approximately 12 125 days which could be significantly longer than that of another important cyanotoxin mc lr supporting information additional text with experimental details is provided in the supporting information the support information includes 20 figures 7

16866,optimizing granules size distribution is critical for both reactor performance and stability in this research an optimal size range of 1800 to 3000 μm was proposed regarding mass transfer and granules stability based on granules developed at do around 8 0 mg l 1 with the feed cod n p at 100 5 1 a height adjustable influent strategy was applied to facilitate the nutrient storage of granules at optimum size range via microbial selective pressure results suggested insufficient hydraulic shear stress led to overgrowth of granules size high abundance of filamentous bacteria thiothrix sp was observed in oversized granules which detached and affected the remaining granules resulting in severe sludge bulking strong hydraulic shear stress suppressed uncontrolled growth of granules however fewer abundance of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd bacterium was acquired which led to unfavored snd effect and total nitrogen tn removal efficiency the height adjustable influent strategy facilitated the poly β hydroxybutyrate phb storage of granules at optimum size range while limiting the overgrowth of granules size additionally more than 87 51 of total granules situated in optimal sizes range which led to higher abundance of snd bacterium and higher tn removal efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords height adjustable influent strategy microbial selective pressure optimize size distribution mass transfer thiothrix sp 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is regarded as one of the most promising biological methods of wastewater treatment pishgar et al 2020 it is advantageous in compact microbial structure settling ability biomass retention allowing occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process in a single granule coma et al 2012 lochmatter et al 2013 however the overgrowth of large granules would weaken granule stability leading to reactor failure which limited the application of this method franca et al 2018 limited oxygen concentration in oversized granules has been a significant obstacle for stable operation li et al 2020 low oxygen concentration might stimulate the propagation of filamentous bacteria wu et al 2019 uncontrolled growth of filamentous bacteria decreases the structure intensity and turns the round shape granules into fluffy surface wan et al 2014 meanwhile the limited oxygen concentrations in granules favors formation of anaerobic microbes which reduces the ph by producing acidic products luo et al 2020 the framework responsible for granule formation and structural stability would then be dissolved causing decrease of granules strength moreover the acidic ph conditions might stimulate the growth of filamentous microbe which leads to an unexpected positive regeneration rollemberg et al 2019 consequently it is necessary to avoid overgrowth of large granules during the operation hydraulic shear stress has been proved to be an effective way on controlling overgrowth of granules by enhancing erosion and detachment on granules surface zhou et al 2019a the strength of hydraulic shear stress is conventionally achieved by a stronger aeration intensity or higher height to diameter ratio h d devlin et al 2017 zhou et al 2019a however high h d ratio is incapable on full scale plants while enhancing the aeration intensity resulted in extra operational costs rollemberg et al 2018 moreover strong hydraulic shear stress leads to smaller granule size distribution liu et al 2010 resulting in insufficient snd effects and tn removal efficiency strategies to optimizing granule size regarding both reactor performance and stability are worth studying long et al 2019 previous studies suggested microbial selective pressure could improve stability of aerobic granular sludge derlon et al 2016 reducing sludge retention time srt promotes the competitive advantage of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos over filamentous bacteria in sbrs moura et al 2018 li et al 2016 suppressed filamentous bulking via removing the biomass in upper part of sbr sodium acetate mixed with succinate was used to balance the competition of phosphorus glycogen accumulating organisms paos gaos he et al 2020 however a valid strategy to optimize granules size distribution is yet unknown in this study a height adjustable influent strategy was applied to optimize granule sizes distribution via microbial selective pressure the main purpose were to i determine granule optimal size range through oxygen mass transfer and granule strength analysis ii investigate the effect of height adjustable influent strategy on granule size distribution and microbial community structure and iii explore the selective pressure mechanism on size optimization and granule stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors set up and height adjustable influent strategy three parallel sbr reactors with working volume of 5 0 l were used in this study the h d ratio was 8 1 3 1 and 3 1 for r1 to r3 respectively the operation cycle for all reactors was 4 h consisting 30 min of feeding 190 min of aeration 5 10 min of settling 10 min for r1 5 min for r2 and r3 and 5 min of withdrawal the effluent of each reactor was set at the height of 2 5 l volume in reactor and the volume exchange ratio was 50 air was introduced from the bottom of sbr aeration intensity was 5 0 l min 1 in r1 2 5 l min 1 in r2 and r3 respectively sludge retention time srt in three reactors was controlled at 18 days by discharging sludge during aeration stage as for influent r1 and r2 were mixed using stirring paddle as conventional operation while r3 was operated using height adjustable influent strategy to optimize granule sizes distribution fig 1 the height adjustable influent strategy was intended to facilitate the nutrient storage in granules near inlet which would enhance the competitive advantage of granules in optimum size range and suppress the overgrowth of large granules the reactor configuration is showed as follow fig 1a and b a beam with a hole in its center was fixed at the top of reactor an influent plexiglass tube inserted into reactor through the hole and connected with the distribution component fig 1c the distribution component included a distribution chief pipe and a set of branch pipes six parallel branch pipes were distributed on both sides of chief pipe outlet holes with diameter of 2 0 mm were evenly distributed on the branch pipe at 5 0 mm intervals fig 1a influent plexiglass tube was calibrated with accuracy of millimeter to indicate the height of distributor component during operation two clamping rings were used to fix influent tube and distribution component from moving fig 1d the mean granules size at different heights of sludge bed was measured using a sampling component the sampling component had six parallel branch pipes and inlet holes with diameter of 12 0 mm were evenly distributed on the branch pipe fig s1 during measurement the sampling component was installed on influent tube instead of distribution component influent tube with calibration was then inserted into different heights of sludge bed by adjusting clamping rings a peristaltic pump connected with influent tube was used to withdraw granules at different height and mean granules size was measured by laser particle analyzer the height adjustable influent component was initially placed at the bottom and gradually raised according to granules size development the detailed adjusting methods of height adjustable influent strategy were as follows i the mean granules size at different heights of sludge bed was measured after settling ii if granules size near influent component was smaller than the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax influent component remained iii if granules size near influent component was larger than the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax influent component was raised to the height where minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin located 2 2 seed sludge and synthetic wastewater the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of influent was 1022 25 mg l 1 and nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp values were 43 43 0 67 mg l 1 55 57 3 21 mg l 1 and 13 23 0 85 mg l 1 respectively sodium acetate was used as carbon source in this study activated sludge was collected from the aeration tank of yu hang sewage treatment plant in hangzhou china the initial concentration of the seeding was around 4000 mg l 1 and mixed sludge volume index svi was 122 22 ml g 1 the seed sludge had mean diameter of 60 31 4 92 μm 2 3 measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration do in granules 2 3 1 do measured by micro electrode system the do concentration in aerobic granules was commonly measured using do micro electrode system the measuring system was composed by a micro electrodes with 20 μm tip diameter ox10 16 076 unisense denmark and a picoammeter microsensor multimater unisense demark granules used for do measurement were taken at the end of anaerobic feeding phase the detailed operation was presented in our previous study zhou et al 2019b 2 3 2 do measured by oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe a new measurement of oxygen concentration in organism was recently proposed based on fluorescence quenching theory studies revealed certain metal complexes emitted fluorescence after being excited while oxygen had effects on fluorescence quenching which could be used as indicators for oxygen concentration nan et al 2019 in this study oxygen sensitive fluorescent dye tris 2 2 bipyridyl ruthenium ii chloride hexahydrate tch coupled with carrier tio2 sio2 was used as oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe the preparation method of oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe was as follows 10 0 ml of butyl titanate 30 0 ml of tetraethoxysilane teos and 100 0 ml of isopropyl alcohol were completely mixed and burned at 800 c for 2 h to form tio2 sio2 dye carrier 20 0 mg of tio2 sio2 dye carrier and 50 0 ml of tch ethanol solution with a concentration of 4 0 10 4 mol l 1 was mixed in a vortex shaker at low speed for 10 h samples were washed 3 times with 100 ethanol solution to remove the remaining tch and finally dry at 85 c when measuring the do distribution granules were taken at the end of anaerobic feeding phase washed 3 times with deionized water mixed with a concentration of 3 0 mg l 1 oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe in a vortex shaker at low speed for 30 minutes granules were washed 3 times with deionized water to remove unattached dye bulk liquid with carbon source cod of 500 mg l 1 and without carbon source cod of 0 mg l 1 was then introduced into confocal culture dish the do concentration in culture dish was maintained saturated during micro electrode and fluorescent probe test do of 0 0 mg l 1 was introduced in culture dish only for fluorescent standard curve confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm710 nlo germany was used to characterize signal intensity of oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe with excitation wavelength at 468 nm and emission wavelength at 600 nm progressive scanning was applied to turn fluorescence image into signal intensity matrix python 3 74 the do distribution was determined by signal intensity matrix combined with stern volmere equlation stern volmere equlation was as follow lou et al 2014 1 i o i 1 k s v o 2 where o2 represents concentration of dissolved oxygen ksv represents stern volmer constant io represents fluorescence intensity when dissolved oxygen concentration was zero i represents fluorescence intensity when dissolved oxygen concentration was o2 2 4 granules strength test the granules strength affects the stability of reactors to determine granules strength granules were subjected to a increasing g value velocity gradient test in a stirred reactor and granule size variation was measured a column stirring reactor with working volume of 2 4 l h d ratio of 3 and 2 flat blades paddle was used in this study the g value increased from 280 s 1 to 2300 s 1 by adjusting rotate speed the conversion of rotate speed and g value was based on the formula in previous study wan et al 2011 granule strength was consequently determined by variation of size distribution 2 5 poly β hydroxybutyrate phb determination poly β hydroxybutyrate phb in aerobic granular sludge during influent period was analyzed by ultraviolet uv spectrophotometry which mainly included two steps sludge pre treatment and uv determination mannina et al 2019 procedures for determination of phb were as follows 30 0 ml aerobic granular sludge was taken from the reactor and washed with the redistilled water for 3 times the washed sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and then put into 25 0 ml 30 sodium hypochlorite solution the mixture was stirred for 20 min at 40 c with a magnetic stirrer and then dried at 60 c for 24 h thereafter 10 0 mg dried sludge was mixed with 10 0 ml chloroform and 5 0 ml dehydrated alcohol and then placed in water bath of 60 c for 1 h after filtration 0 5 ml of solution containing phb was placed in a water bath of 100 c for liquid phase evaporation finally 5 0 ml of h2so4 was added and solution was heated in a water bath 100 c for 10 min and its absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 235 nm 2 6 granule core separation and microbial community analysis granule core separation procedure was applied to separate granule core from outer part the steps were as follows sample granule was placed on a custom made glass slide two 0 22 mm needles were vertically inserted to fix the granule after the sample was fixed four capillary glass tubes with inside diameter of 0 90 mm were sequentially inserted along the needle the granule core around 1000 μm inside granules was then separated from outer part for further microbial community analysis fig s2 magbind soil dna kit omega usa was used to extract microbial dna from the samples above respectively according to the manufacturer s instruction after detecting the extracted dna by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantifying by uv spectrophotometer v3 v4 region of microbial 16s rdna gene sequence were amplified by the primers of 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 the pcr products were purified using ampure xp breads after confirmed with 2 agarose gel electrophoresis and then were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform based on the standard protocols sun et al 2020 the obtained sequencing data would be performed as following steps the operational taxonomic units otus were determined at 97 similarity and taxonomic classification was subjected to rdp ribosomal database project and microbial α diversity zhang et al 2019 heat map was constructed using r code and the bray curtis distance was employed to cluster the different samples correlation heat map was constructed by calculating the pearson product moment correlation coefficient cydzik kwiatkowska 2015 2 7 scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi model tm 1000 japan was applied to analyze the structure difference of granule specific steps of sample preparation were operated using the method described by zhou et al 2016 2 8 other analytical methods codcr nh4 n tn mlss and svi were quantified using apha standard methods apha 2012 snd efficiency was defined as the loss of nitrogen during aerobic phase which was calculated as follow ma et al 2017 2 s n d 1 δ n o 2 δ n o 3 δ n h 4 100 where δnh4 means nh4 n concentration change between the end of anaerobic and aerobic phase δno2 means no2 n concentration change between the end of anaerobic and aerobic phase δno3 means no3 n concentration change between the end of anaerobic and aerobic phase the calculation neglected the contribution of n assimilation to nh4 n or nox n removal granules size distribution was determined by a laser particle analyzer qicpic sympatec germany the span value was calculated as follows 3 span d 90 d 10 d 50 where d10 d50 and d90 was the diameter of granules larger than 10 50 and 90 of total particle volume respectively with similar mean diameter a higher span value indicated a sparse size distribution whereas a lower span value suggested granules concentrated in a smaller size range 3 results and discussion 3 1 determining minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin based on dissolved oxygen transfer determining the range of optimal granule size was crucial for height adjustable influent strategy in r3 the minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin was defined as the minimum diameter for persistent anoxic zone according to previous studies bian et al 2015 after 30 days of operation the distribution of do in small 700 1200 μm medium 1500 2000 μm and large 2300 2800 μm granules were analyzed to determining minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin in r3 typical do profiles in r3 revealed do maintained around saturated and do concentration in culture dish was thus maintained saturated during mass transfer test 3 1 1 do mass transfer measured by micro electrode probe the do mass transfer in granules of r3 with carbon source cod of 500 mg l 1 and without carbon source cod of 0 mg l 1 was measured by micro electrode probe after 30 days of operation residual do concentration in granules 0 3 mg l 1 was considered as aerobic zone according to previous studies cao et al 2017 ma et al 2017 results showed that do concentration decreased rapidly in granules with the existence of carbon source fig 2 a while do could penetrate deeper in granules without the existence of carbon source fig 2b previous study suggested that metabolism and respiration of microbes consumed do which increased the do gradient in granules wang et al 2019 consequently anoxic zone do 0 3 mg l 1 occurred around 408 61 29 43 μm in small granules 700 1200 μm with the existence of carbon source however do could fully penetrate small granules without the existence of carbon source suggesting anoxic area would disappear at the end of operation cycle as cod was completely degraded the metabolism of anoxic denitrifying bacteria in small granules was then inhibited ma et al 2017 persistent anoxic zone occurred in medium 1500 2000 μm and large granules 2300 2800 μm which favored reproduction of anoxic denitrifying bacteria and promoted the snd effect however do mass transfer depth in medium and large granules fluctuated widely to more than 181 7 the depth required for anoxic zone ranged from 555 12 to 1008 64 μm fig 2 previous studies revealed that larger granules had more internal tunnels and pore structures rahmanian et al 2009 as an intrusive detection micro electrode probe might connect several internal tunnels during insertion which created an external channel resulting in lower mass transfer resistance and deeper anoxic depth meanwhile due to the non isotropic structure of granules micro electrode probe might avoid tunnels during other insertion and anoxic depth would be much smaller consequently anoxic depth fluctuated with the use of micro electrode system making it impossible to determine the minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin 3 1 2 do mass transfer based on oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe an oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe combined with clsm was then used to determine the do distribution in granules of r3 after 30 days of operation the digital image of do concentration and anoxic area inside the granules were obtained through image processing results confirmed that due to the internal tunnels and pore structures do had an obvious non isotropic distribution in granules fig 3 the anoxic zones surrounded by pink curve presented an irregular shape inside granules which also explain the fluctuation of do penetration depth in micro electrode probe experiment results showed that anoxic zone proportion increased gradually with the granules diameter do could fully penetrate small granules 700 1200 μm and no anoxic zone was observed the anoxic zone proportion ranged up to 6 68 0 21 with carbon source and 2 39 0 09 without carbon source in medium granules 1500 2000 μm table 1 the proportion reached 20 65 2 23 with carbon source and 14 68 1 22 without carbon source in large granules 2300 2800 μm which favored metabolism of anoxic denitrifying bacteria ma et al 2017 the persistent anoxic zone exist in granules with diameter around 1800 μm and minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin was then defined as 1800 μm in r3 3 2 determining the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax basing on hydraulic shear stress test granule strength in r3 was analyzed after 30 days of operation to determining the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax granule strength was determined by its ability to withstand hydraulic shear wan et al 2011 using increasing hydraulic shear stress g 2300 s 1 size distribution variation of granules with different diameters 1500 2000 μm 2000 2500 μm 2500 3000 μm and 3000 3500 μm was analyzed results showed that after 2300 s 1 hydraulic shear stress the distribution peaks of granules with size of 1500 2000 μm 2000 2500 μm and 2500 3000 μm slightly shifted to the left and no obvious size distribution change was observed fig 4 a c the mean diameters slightly reduced from 1665 51 to 1430 48 μm 2161 62 to 1860 91 μm and 2674 21 to 2165 35 μm respectively results revealed that granules with diameter below 3000 μm remained intact under high hydraulic shear stress suggesting relatively strong granules strength however size distribution curve changed from a single peak around 3300 μm to two peaks peak a of 480 μm peak b of 1340 μm in granules with diameter of 3000 3500 μm after increasing hydraulic shear stress the mean diameter significantly reduced from 3281 38 to 1533 13 μm fig 4d variations of the granule size distribution curve indicated that granules over 3000 μm tended to disintegrate and break up under hydraulic shear stress suggesting relatively weak granules strength zhou et al 2019a multiple studies have reported that overgrowth of granules caused uncontrolled propagation of filamentous bacteria and core cavity wan et al 2014 in this study notable decrease of granules strength occurred in granules over 3000 μm consequently based on oxygen mass transfer and hydraulic shear stress test minimum dmin and maximum dmax diameter of optimal granules in r3 was defined as 1800 μm and 3000 μm respectively 3 3 reactor operation and nutrient removal performance during stable operation the sludge sedimentation and concentration gradually increased with the granulation progress after 24 days of operation the sludge volume index svi in 3 reactors gradually decreased from the initial 114 15 to 37 4 ml g 1 r1 48 3 ml g 1 r2 and 44 4 ml g 1 r3 mlss increased from 4000 mg l 1 to 7180 50 mg l 1 r1 6330 60 mg l 1 r2 and 7430 40 mg l 1 r3 the average srt in three reactors stabilized around 18 days fig s3 typical do profiles during cycles of three sbr showed do concentration increased rapidly in aeration phase and maintained at high level above 8 0 mg l 1 during the rest 170 min of operation fig s4 however after 73 days of operation filamentous bulking occurred in r2 which caused fluffy appearance of granules granules in r2 disintegrated gradually and svi rose to 231 1 ml g 1 significant biomass wash out occurred and mlss decreased rapidly to less than 2060 50 mg l 1 srt in r2 decreased rapidly to less than 1 day reactor then deteriorated and failed to recover meanwhile r1 and r3 remained stable during the following operation svi of r1 and r3 maintained around 38 1 ml g 1 and 42 4 ml g 1 and mlss maintained at 7670 110 mg l 1 and 7940 70 mg l 1 respectively the srt in r1 and r3 stabilized around 18 days cod and nh4 n removal efficiency in three reactors remained at a high level during stable operation the effluent cod was lower than 30 mg l 1 in three reactors corresponding to a removal efficiency above 97 the nh4 n removal efficiency in three reactors was over 95 however nh4 n removal efficiency in r2 decreased rapidly due to reactor deterioration effluent nh4 n reached 26 35 2 65 mg l 1 which significantly higher than r1 and r3 p 0 05 in follow up operation nh4 n removal efficiency in r1 and r3 stabilized and remained over 94 and 95 fig s5 a and b on day 60 tn removal efficiency varied in three reactors which were 66 59 2 61 in r1 63 98 4 11 in r2 and 83 57 4 38 in r3 respectively the snd ratio was 65 03 2 32 57 25 5 17 and 87 17 3 04 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively suggesting r3 had highest snd effect r2 then deteriorated after 73 days of operation and tn removal efficiency was only 50 49 3 71 however r1 and r3 remained stable in the follow up operation and tn removal efficiency maintained above 66 63 0 41 and 84 84 0 57 respectively fig s5c the snd ratio was 60 79 1 09 and 83 91 0 81 in r1 and r3 respectively after 153 days of operation it s worth noting the contribution of n assimilation was neglected in snd calculation in this study the cod n ratio was controlled around 20 according to previous studies which was intent to facility sludge granulation however higher cod n ratio favored nitrogen removal efficiency via biomass synthesis which might limit the short cut snd efficiency with lower cod n ratio around 3 5 or less the difference of snd effects between three reactors could be more obvious 3 4 characterization of granulation and size distribution sludge granulation started after 19 days of operation the granulation speed in three reactors were 40 91 4 83 μm d 1 r1 86 14 2 47 μm d 1 r2 and 74 04 2 57 μm d 1 r3 fig 5 a respectively r1 with stronger aeration intensity and higher h d ratio had a significantly higher hydraulic shear compared to r2 and r3 resulting in a slower granulation speed zhou et al 2016 on day 37 the granule size in the bottom of r3 reached 3031 16 103 87 μm after settling suggesting it reached the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax the height of influent component was then adjusted to 5 0 cm with mean diameter of 1851 74 49 63 μm which corresponded to minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin the detailed adjusting process of influent component was shown in table 2 in the first 36 days day 0 to 36 sufficient nutrient was observed in all granules in r3 aggregation effect in granules was stronger than the erosion effect of hydraulic shear stress and granule size increased rapidly after day 37 height of influent component was adjusted to 5 0 cm which restricted the growth of large granules in r3 the aggregation effects of large granules decreased which reduced the size development rate the influent component was raised by 1 5 cm after day 67 and then 0 5 cm after day 183 suggesting granules size reached a dynamic balance between sludge aggregation and erosion allowing the feeding bar to maintain in position for a long time after 63 days of operation mean diameter in r1 r3 stabilized around 1677 14 14 58 2876 24 19 68 and 1978 98 14 92 μm respectively the overgrowth of large granules in r1 and r3 was limited and d90 diameter greater than 90 of total granules stabilized at 3129 26 17 33 μm and 2981 21 17 26 μm respectively fig 5b however overgrowth of large granules occurred in r2 presenting fluffy granules structure the d90 reached 4031 57 23 19 μm after 63 days meanwhile the mean diameter slightly changed from 1677 14 14 58 to 1758 54 12 26 μm in r1 and 1978 98 14 92 to 2085 65 10 58 μm in r3 respectively after 226 days of operation fig 5c span value was used to express granules size distribution with similar mean diameter a higher span value indicated a sparse size distribution while a lower span value suggested a narrow particle size distribution result revealed span values in r1 and r3 was 0 94 0 04 and 0 47 0 03 respectively flocs co existed with large granules in r1 in contrast the lower span value in r3 suggested a concentrated size distribution granules in r3 presented a relatively uniform diameter and 87 51 granules situated in optimal size range in the follow up operation span value changed slightly from 0 94 0 04 to 0 99 0 03 in r1 and 0 47 0 03 to 0 54 0 01 in r3 respectively after 226 days of operation 3 5 granular characteristics sem results on 60 days fig 6 revealed that large granules in r1 had a complete spherical shape and filamentous structure was observed on large granules surface fig 6a d in r2 abundant filamentous structure intertwined with each other on granules surface filamentous structure was also observed in granules fragment suggesting that filamentous bacteria occupied the whole granules fig 6b e granules in r3 had a smooth and compact appearance coccus and bacilli dominated the surface and no evident filamentous structure was observed fig 6c f on day 60 do mass transfer and anoxic zone proportion in granules of different reactor was analyzed by using fluorescent probe fig s6 results showed that minimum diameter for persistent anoxic zone was 1476 68 41 89 μm r1 1356 23 63 96 μm r2 and 1728 97 21 52 μm r3 respectively combined with the granule size distribution results suggested 36 67 1 35 of the granules in r1 could not perform snd effectively while in r2 and r3 were only 5 18 0 11 and 4 17 0 09 respectively it s worth noting that do concentration in r1 r3 maintained around saturated during most of aeration phase which inhibit snd in some extent increasing the depth for persistent anoxic zone previous studies suggested lowering the do in reactors decreased the required depth for anoxic microenvironment which improve snd effects however reduce do by decreasing aeration intensity led to weak hydraulic shear stress resulting in unstable granular structures in this study while in other reactors with lower do during aeration phase the minimum diameter for persistent anoxic zone could be smaller li et al 2008 layer et al 2020 quoc et al 2021 3 6 performance of height adjustable influent strategy the kinetics of cod in sludge layers of r3 was analyzed after 60 days of operation during influent period cod concentration near inlet increased rapidly while cod concentration away from inlet increased slightly due to diffusion resistance and microbial activity fig 7 after 15 min influent the cod concentration of the inlet sludge layer reached 397 11 mg l 1 which was 4 74 0 33 times higher than that in bottom layer moreover poly β hydroxybutyrate phb as an internal carbon source in granules presented visible difference in sludge layers results showed granules near inlet had higher phb concentration than granules away from inlet which was in accordance with cod concentration distribution fig 7 phb concentration in granules near inlet stabilized at 42 62 1 69 mg gvss 1 volatile suspended solids vss after influent which was much higher than 23 04 2 24 mg gvss 1 and 19 45 1 35 mg gvss 1 of granules in top and bottom layer results revealed the height adjustable influent strategy facilitated the phb storage in granules near inlet which enhanced the growth of granules in optimum size range in addition the phb production of large granules at bottom was inhibited which limited the overgrowth of granules size 3 6 microbial community analysis 3 6 1 microbial structural and distribution analysis alpha diversity of granules was determined after 67 days of operation results showed that shannon and simpson values of granules in r2 were 3 09 and 0 53 respectively which were much lower than r1 4 25 and 0 86 and r3 5 10 and 0 91 respectively indicating that r2 had lower richness and evenness of the microbial community comparisons of microbial structure were conducted at genus level the core of large granules with diameter 3000 μm was separated from the outer part and microbial distribution was analyzed denitrifying bacteria comamonas sp thauera sp acinetobacter sp flavobacterium sp and dokdonella sp etc were observed in three reactors fig 8 a comamonas sp and acinetobacter sp were the dominant denitrifying bacterium in r1 and r2 after 67 days of operation which presented higher abundance in r1 13 24 and 5 58 and r2 12 64 and 5 19 while abundance in r3 6 03 and 1 52 was lower as complete anoxic denitrifying bacterium comamonas sp and acinetobacter sp had higher relative abundance in inner of large granules above 3000 μm than small granules below 800 μm in three reactors fig 8b previous studies suggested suppressing overgrowth of large granules in r3 led to an alternative aerobic anoxic condition in granules which restricted the growth of comamonas sp and acinetobacter sp pishgar et al 2019 thauera sp dokdonella sp and flavobacterium sp were the principal snd pathway for nitrogen removal in granular sludge ding et al 2015 pishgar et al 2019 thauera sp was determined as a potential incomplete nitrate denitrifying bacterium in both aerobic and anoxic condition pishgar et al 2019 the abundance of thauera sp in r1 16 76 and r3 13 78 was much higher than r2 4 28 fig 8a and thauera sp was mainly observed in outer part of large granules in r1 and r3 fig 8b previous studies suggested the filamentous bulking largely decrease the abundance of thauera sp which led to lower abundance of thauera sp in r2 he et al 2019 flavobacterium sp and dokdonella sp also performed total nitrogen removal in an alternate anaerobic aerobic condition pishgar et al 2019 liu et al 2020 which had much higher relative abundance in r3 9 98 and 8 46 than r1 0 41 and 1 11 and r2 0 29 and 0 25 dokdonella sp and flavobacterium sp were complete aerobic denitrifiers which situated in aerobic and anoxic region of granules pishgar et al 2019 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis showed flavobacterium sp mainly fixed in the interior of granules to resist erosion of hydraulic shearing szabó et al 2017 for r1 it was speculated that due to the strong shear stress the outer layer was eroded and let the flavobacterium sp to be exposed which decreased the relative abundance of flavobacterium sp consequently the total abundance of snd bacterium in r3 32 22 was higher than r1 18 28 in and r2 4 82 height adjustable influent strategy in r3 optimized the granules size distribution which led to higher abundance of snd bacterium and higher tn removal efficiency the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas sp and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrosospira sp were found dominant in r1 3 20 and 3 32 and r3 2 29 and 3 61 while encountered sharp decreases in r2 0 21 and 0 18 with filamentous bulking fig 8a previous studies suggested the appearance of filamentous bacteria hindered oxygen transfer which could suppress the propagation of aob and nob wu et al 2019 the abundance of thiothrix sp in r2 reached 44 58 after 67 days of operation which was much higher than r1 18 48 and r3 2 35 fig 8a thiothrix sp was regarded as the major cause to filamentous bulking a controllable growth of thiothrix sp linked microbe to each other de graaff et al 2020 which preformed as skeleton in keeping granule stability franca et al 2018 wu et al 2018 while overgrowth of thiothrix sp led to fluffy structure and granules disintegration wan et al 2014 previous studies revealed oxygen and substrate could fully penetrate small granules which suppressed the propagation of thiothrix sp wu et al 2019 however after 67 days of operation high abundance of thiothrix sp was observed in small granules of r2 67 74 which also formed a fluffy appearance with poor settling ability on the contrary small granules in r1 presented a relative lower thiothrix sp abundance of 26 93 and almost no thiothrix sp enrichment 1 98 was observed in small granules of r3 fig 8b further studies on dynamics of thiothrix sp were then conducted to understand the mechanism of height adjustable influent strategy on granule stability 3 6 2 filamentous population dynamics after 37 days of operation core of large granules above 3000 μm in three reactors presented higher relative abundance of thiothrix sp than outer layer while the abundance of thiothrix sp in small granules below 800 μm from three reactors were lower than 2 28 fig 8c the abundance of thiothrix sp in small granules of r1 and r2 increased after 67 days of operation while no obvious thiothrix sp enrichment was observed in small granules in r3 fig 8b correlation analysis revealed that small granules in r1 and r2 had low correlation with outer layer of large granules on 37 days and r values were 0 602 and 0 266 respectively fig 8d however after 67 days of operation a high correlation between small granules and outer layer of large granules was observed in r1 and r2 and r values reached 0 829 in r1 and 0 993 in r2 respectively fig 8e it s speculated the predominant of thiothrix sp in small granules of r1 and r2 was likely to be infected from large granules instead of the primary growing previous studies suggested complete anaerobic uptake of vfa is essential for stable granulation and filamentous growth was observed when carbon was not completely removed during the anaerobic feeding phase devlin et al 2017 de graaff et al 2020 during initial operation the substrate diffusion rate in large granules was slower than substrate consumption rate which caused the proliferation of thiothrix sp inside the granules however the abundance of free thiothrix sp in bulk liquid was low after day 37 thiothrix sp gradually occupied whole large granules and formed a filamentous structure on the surface the fluffy structure intensified the mass transfer resistance which further stimulated the growth of thiothrix sp rollemberg et al 2019 van den berg et al 2020 the detachment and disintegration of large granules with high abundance of thiothrix sp then infected small granules by spreading into bulk or forming new granules as seeds previous study suggested the substrate uptake rate of thiothrix sp was lower than floc forming bacteria martins et al 2004 and higher sludge age was identified as the major cause of overgrowth of thiothrix sp adonadaga et al 2016 in this study lower hydraulic shear stress in r2 led to insufficient erosion and long srt of large granules which favored the development of thiothrix sp resulting in significantly high abundance 67 74 of thiothrix sp in small granules strong hydraulic shear stress in r1 restrained the overgrowth of granules devlin et al 2017 which suppressed the proliferation of thiothrix sp inside the granules the abundance of thiothrix sp was 18 48 after 67 days of operation which limited the infection and sludge bulking moreover higher hydraulic shear stress in r1 increased the erosion on small granules surface which resulting in relative short srt of granules the present investigation suggested short srt suppressed the enrichment of thiothrix sp adonadaga et al 2016 however high aeration intensity and h d ratio were required in r1 meanwhile height adjustable influent strategy in r3 optimized the granules size distribution under lower aeration intensity and lower h d ratio the data illustrated 87 51 of total granules situated in optimal sizes range and oversized granules accounted for only 2 24 in total granules the proliferation of thiothrix sp in large granules was suppressed and relative abundance of thiothrix sp in sludge was only 2 35 after 67 days of operation and reactor maintained stable during operation 4 conclusions optimizing granules size distribution is critical for reactor operation uncontrolled growth of granules in r2 led to filamentous bulking and reactor deteriorated after 73 days of operation it was speculated that strong shear stress eroded the outer layer of granules and let flavobacterium sp to be exposed which decreased the relative abundance of flavobacterium sp resulting in unfavored snd effect and tn removal efficiency height adjustable influent strategy facilitated phb storage of granules in optimal size range which limited the overgrowth of granules size consequently 87 51 of total granules situated in optimal sizes range enhancing pollutant removal efficiency and reactor stability

16866,optimizing granules size distribution is critical for both reactor performance and stability in this research an optimal size range of 1800 to 3000 μm was proposed regarding mass transfer and granules stability based on granules developed at do around 8 0 mg l 1 with the feed cod n p at 100 5 1 a height adjustable influent strategy was applied to facilitate the nutrient storage of granules at optimum size range via microbial selective pressure results suggested insufficient hydraulic shear stress led to overgrowth of granules size high abundance of filamentous bacteria thiothrix sp was observed in oversized granules which detached and affected the remaining granules resulting in severe sludge bulking strong hydraulic shear stress suppressed uncontrolled growth of granules however fewer abundance of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd bacterium was acquired which led to unfavored snd effect and total nitrogen tn removal efficiency the height adjustable influent strategy facilitated the poly β hydroxybutyrate phb storage of granules at optimum size range while limiting the overgrowth of granules size additionally more than 87 51 of total granules situated in optimal sizes range which led to higher abundance of snd bacterium and higher tn removal efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords height adjustable influent strategy microbial selective pressure optimize size distribution mass transfer thiothrix sp 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is regarded as one of the most promising biological methods of wastewater treatment pishgar et al 2020 it is advantageous in compact microbial structure settling ability biomass retention allowing occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process in a single granule coma et al 2012 lochmatter et al 2013 however the overgrowth of large granules would weaken granule stability leading to reactor failure which limited the application of this method franca et al 2018 limited oxygen concentration in oversized granules has been a significant obstacle for stable operation li et al 2020 low oxygen concentration might stimulate the propagation of filamentous bacteria wu et al 2019 uncontrolled growth of filamentous bacteria decreases the structure intensity and turns the round shape granules into fluffy surface wan et al 2014 meanwhile the limited oxygen concentrations in granules favors formation of anaerobic microbes which reduces the ph by producing acidic products luo et al 2020 the framework responsible for granule formation and structural stability would then be dissolved causing decrease of granules strength moreover the acidic ph conditions might stimulate the growth of filamentous microbe which leads to an unexpected positive regeneration rollemberg et al 2019 consequently it is necessary to avoid overgrowth of large granules during the operation hydraulic shear stress has been proved to be an effective way on controlling overgrowth of granules by enhancing erosion and detachment on granules surface zhou et al 2019a the strength of hydraulic shear stress is conventionally achieved by a stronger aeration intensity or higher height to diameter ratio h d devlin et al 2017 zhou et al 2019a however high h d ratio is incapable on full scale plants while enhancing the aeration intensity resulted in extra operational costs rollemberg et al 2018 moreover strong hydraulic shear stress leads to smaller granule size distribution liu et al 2010 resulting in insufficient snd effects and tn removal efficiency strategies to optimizing granule size regarding both reactor performance and stability are worth studying long et al 2019 previous studies suggested microbial selective pressure could improve stability of aerobic granular sludge derlon et al 2016 reducing sludge retention time srt promotes the competitive advantage of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos over filamentous bacteria in sbrs moura et al 2018 li et al 2016 suppressed filamentous bulking via removing the biomass in upper part of sbr sodium acetate mixed with succinate was used to balance the competition of phosphorus glycogen accumulating organisms paos gaos he et al 2020 however a valid strategy to optimize granules size distribution is yet unknown in this study a height adjustable influent strategy was applied to optimize granule sizes distribution via microbial selective pressure the main purpose were to i determine granule optimal size range through oxygen mass transfer and granule strength analysis ii investigate the effect of height adjustable influent strategy on granule size distribution and microbial community structure and iii explore the selective pressure mechanism on size optimization and granule stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors set up and height adjustable influent strategy three parallel sbr reactors with working volume of 5 0 l were used in this study the h d ratio was 8 1 3 1 and 3 1 for r1 to r3 respectively the operation cycle for all reactors was 4 h consisting 30 min of feeding 190 min of aeration 5 10 min of settling 10 min for r1 5 min for r2 and r3 and 5 min of withdrawal the effluent of each reactor was set at the height of 2 5 l volume in reactor and the volume exchange ratio was 50 air was introduced from the bottom of sbr aeration intensity was 5 0 l min 1 in r1 2 5 l min 1 in r2 and r3 respectively sludge retention time srt in three reactors was controlled at 18 days by discharging sludge during aeration stage as for influent r1 and r2 were mixed using stirring paddle as conventional operation while r3 was operated using height adjustable influent strategy to optimize granule sizes distribution fig 1 the height adjustable influent strategy was intended to facilitate the nutrient storage in granules near inlet which would enhance the competitive advantage of granules in optimum size range and suppress the overgrowth of large granules the reactor configuration is showed as follow fig 1a and b a beam with a hole in its center was fixed at the top of reactor an influent plexiglass tube inserted into reactor through the hole and connected with the distribution component fig 1c the distribution component included a distribution chief pipe and a set of branch pipes six parallel branch pipes were distributed on both sides of chief pipe outlet holes with diameter of 2 0 mm were evenly distributed on the branch pipe at 5 0 mm intervals fig 1a influent plexiglass tube was calibrated with accuracy of millimeter to indicate the height of distributor component during operation two clamping rings were used to fix influent tube and distribution component from moving fig 1d the mean granules size at different heights of sludge bed was measured using a sampling component the sampling component had six parallel branch pipes and inlet holes with diameter of 12 0 mm were evenly distributed on the branch pipe fig s1 during measurement the sampling component was installed on influent tube instead of distribution component influent tube with calibration was then inserted into different heights of sludge bed by adjusting clamping rings a peristaltic pump connected with influent tube was used to withdraw granules at different height and mean granules size was measured by laser particle analyzer the height adjustable influent component was initially placed at the bottom and gradually raised according to granules size development the detailed adjusting methods of height adjustable influent strategy were as follows i the mean granules size at different heights of sludge bed was measured after settling ii if granules size near influent component was smaller than the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax influent component remained iii if granules size near influent component was larger than the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax influent component was raised to the height where minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin located 2 2 seed sludge and synthetic wastewater the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of influent was 1022 25 mg l 1 and nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp values were 43 43 0 67 mg l 1 55 57 3 21 mg l 1 and 13 23 0 85 mg l 1 respectively sodium acetate was used as carbon source in this study activated sludge was collected from the aeration tank of yu hang sewage treatment plant in hangzhou china the initial concentration of the seeding was around 4000 mg l 1 and mixed sludge volume index svi was 122 22 ml g 1 the seed sludge had mean diameter of 60 31 4 92 μm 2 3 measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration do in granules 2 3 1 do measured by micro electrode system the do concentration in aerobic granules was commonly measured using do micro electrode system the measuring system was composed by a micro electrodes with 20 μm tip diameter ox10 16 076 unisense denmark and a picoammeter microsensor multimater unisense demark granules used for do measurement were taken at the end of anaerobic feeding phase the detailed operation was presented in our previous study zhou et al 2019b 2 3 2 do measured by oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe a new measurement of oxygen concentration in organism was recently proposed based on fluorescence quenching theory studies revealed certain metal complexes emitted fluorescence after being excited while oxygen had effects on fluorescence quenching which could be used as indicators for oxygen concentration nan et al 2019 in this study oxygen sensitive fluorescent dye tris 2 2 bipyridyl ruthenium ii chloride hexahydrate tch coupled with carrier tio2 sio2 was used as oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe the preparation method of oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe was as follows 10 0 ml of butyl titanate 30 0 ml of tetraethoxysilane teos and 100 0 ml of isopropyl alcohol were completely mixed and burned at 800 c for 2 h to form tio2 sio2 dye carrier 20 0 mg of tio2 sio2 dye carrier and 50 0 ml of tch ethanol solution with a concentration of 4 0 10 4 mol l 1 was mixed in a vortex shaker at low speed for 10 h samples were washed 3 times with 100 ethanol solution to remove the remaining tch and finally dry at 85 c when measuring the do distribution granules were taken at the end of anaerobic feeding phase washed 3 times with deionized water mixed with a concentration of 3 0 mg l 1 oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe in a vortex shaker at low speed for 30 minutes granules were washed 3 times with deionized water to remove unattached dye bulk liquid with carbon source cod of 500 mg l 1 and without carbon source cod of 0 mg l 1 was then introduced into confocal culture dish the do concentration in culture dish was maintained saturated during micro electrode and fluorescent probe test do of 0 0 mg l 1 was introduced in culture dish only for fluorescent standard curve confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm710 nlo germany was used to characterize signal intensity of oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe with excitation wavelength at 468 nm and emission wavelength at 600 nm progressive scanning was applied to turn fluorescence image into signal intensity matrix python 3 74 the do distribution was determined by signal intensity matrix combined with stern volmere equlation stern volmere equlation was as follow lou et al 2014 1 i o i 1 k s v o 2 where o2 represents concentration of dissolved oxygen ksv represents stern volmer constant io represents fluorescence intensity when dissolved oxygen concentration was zero i represents fluorescence intensity when dissolved oxygen concentration was o2 2 4 granules strength test the granules strength affects the stability of reactors to determine granules strength granules were subjected to a increasing g value velocity gradient test in a stirred reactor and granule size variation was measured a column stirring reactor with working volume of 2 4 l h d ratio of 3 and 2 flat blades paddle was used in this study the g value increased from 280 s 1 to 2300 s 1 by adjusting rotate speed the conversion of rotate speed and g value was based on the formula in previous study wan et al 2011 granule strength was consequently determined by variation of size distribution 2 5 poly β hydroxybutyrate phb determination poly β hydroxybutyrate phb in aerobic granular sludge during influent period was analyzed by ultraviolet uv spectrophotometry which mainly included two steps sludge pre treatment and uv determination mannina et al 2019 procedures for determination of phb were as follows 30 0 ml aerobic granular sludge was taken from the reactor and washed with the redistilled water for 3 times the washed sludge was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min and then put into 25 0 ml 30 sodium hypochlorite solution the mixture was stirred for 20 min at 40 c with a magnetic stirrer and then dried at 60 c for 24 h thereafter 10 0 mg dried sludge was mixed with 10 0 ml chloroform and 5 0 ml dehydrated alcohol and then placed in water bath of 60 c for 1 h after filtration 0 5 ml of solution containing phb was placed in a water bath of 100 c for liquid phase evaporation finally 5 0 ml of h2so4 was added and solution was heated in a water bath 100 c for 10 min and its absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 235 nm 2 6 granule core separation and microbial community analysis granule core separation procedure was applied to separate granule core from outer part the steps were as follows sample granule was placed on a custom made glass slide two 0 22 mm needles were vertically inserted to fix the granule after the sample was fixed four capillary glass tubes with inside diameter of 0 90 mm were sequentially inserted along the needle the granule core around 1000 μm inside granules was then separated from outer part for further microbial community analysis fig s2 magbind soil dna kit omega usa was used to extract microbial dna from the samples above respectively according to the manufacturer s instruction after detecting the extracted dna by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantifying by uv spectrophotometer v3 v4 region of microbial 16s rdna gene sequence were amplified by the primers of 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 the pcr products were purified using ampure xp breads after confirmed with 2 agarose gel electrophoresis and then were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform based on the standard protocols sun et al 2020 the obtained sequencing data would be performed as following steps the operational taxonomic units otus were determined at 97 similarity and taxonomic classification was subjected to rdp ribosomal database project and microbial α diversity zhang et al 2019 heat map was constructed using r code and the bray curtis distance was employed to cluster the different samples correlation heat map was constructed by calculating the pearson product moment correlation coefficient cydzik kwiatkowska 2015 2 7 scanning electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi model tm 1000 japan was applied to analyze the structure difference of granule specific steps of sample preparation were operated using the method described by zhou et al 2016 2 8 other analytical methods codcr nh4 n tn mlss and svi were quantified using apha standard methods apha 2012 snd efficiency was defined as the loss of nitrogen during aerobic phase which was calculated as follow ma et al 2017 2 s n d 1 δ n o 2 δ n o 3 δ n h 4 100 where δnh4 means nh4 n concentration change between the end of anaerobic and aerobic phase δno2 means no2 n concentration change between the end of anaerobic and aerobic phase δno3 means no3 n concentration change between the end of anaerobic and aerobic phase the calculation neglected the contribution of n assimilation to nh4 n or nox n removal granules size distribution was determined by a laser particle analyzer qicpic sympatec germany the span value was calculated as follows 3 span d 90 d 10 d 50 where d10 d50 and d90 was the diameter of granules larger than 10 50 and 90 of total particle volume respectively with similar mean diameter a higher span value indicated a sparse size distribution whereas a lower span value suggested granules concentrated in a smaller size range 3 results and discussion 3 1 determining minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin based on dissolved oxygen transfer determining the range of optimal granule size was crucial for height adjustable influent strategy in r3 the minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin was defined as the minimum diameter for persistent anoxic zone according to previous studies bian et al 2015 after 30 days of operation the distribution of do in small 700 1200 μm medium 1500 2000 μm and large 2300 2800 μm granules were analyzed to determining minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin in r3 typical do profiles in r3 revealed do maintained around saturated and do concentration in culture dish was thus maintained saturated during mass transfer test 3 1 1 do mass transfer measured by micro electrode probe the do mass transfer in granules of r3 with carbon source cod of 500 mg l 1 and without carbon source cod of 0 mg l 1 was measured by micro electrode probe after 30 days of operation residual do concentration in granules 0 3 mg l 1 was considered as aerobic zone according to previous studies cao et al 2017 ma et al 2017 results showed that do concentration decreased rapidly in granules with the existence of carbon source fig 2 a while do could penetrate deeper in granules without the existence of carbon source fig 2b previous study suggested that metabolism and respiration of microbes consumed do which increased the do gradient in granules wang et al 2019 consequently anoxic zone do 0 3 mg l 1 occurred around 408 61 29 43 μm in small granules 700 1200 μm with the existence of carbon source however do could fully penetrate small granules without the existence of carbon source suggesting anoxic area would disappear at the end of operation cycle as cod was completely degraded the metabolism of anoxic denitrifying bacteria in small granules was then inhibited ma et al 2017 persistent anoxic zone occurred in medium 1500 2000 μm and large granules 2300 2800 μm which favored reproduction of anoxic denitrifying bacteria and promoted the snd effect however do mass transfer depth in medium and large granules fluctuated widely to more than 181 7 the depth required for anoxic zone ranged from 555 12 to 1008 64 μm fig 2 previous studies revealed that larger granules had more internal tunnels and pore structures rahmanian et al 2009 as an intrusive detection micro electrode probe might connect several internal tunnels during insertion which created an external channel resulting in lower mass transfer resistance and deeper anoxic depth meanwhile due to the non isotropic structure of granules micro electrode probe might avoid tunnels during other insertion and anoxic depth would be much smaller consequently anoxic depth fluctuated with the use of micro electrode system making it impossible to determine the minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin 3 1 2 do mass transfer based on oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe an oxygen sensitive fluorescent probe combined with clsm was then used to determine the do distribution in granules of r3 after 30 days of operation the digital image of do concentration and anoxic area inside the granules were obtained through image processing results confirmed that due to the internal tunnels and pore structures do had an obvious non isotropic distribution in granules fig 3 the anoxic zones surrounded by pink curve presented an irregular shape inside granules which also explain the fluctuation of do penetration depth in micro electrode probe experiment results showed that anoxic zone proportion increased gradually with the granules diameter do could fully penetrate small granules 700 1200 μm and no anoxic zone was observed the anoxic zone proportion ranged up to 6 68 0 21 with carbon source and 2 39 0 09 without carbon source in medium granules 1500 2000 μm table 1 the proportion reached 20 65 2 23 with carbon source and 14 68 1 22 without carbon source in large granules 2300 2800 μm which favored metabolism of anoxic denitrifying bacteria ma et al 2017 the persistent anoxic zone exist in granules with diameter around 1800 μm and minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin was then defined as 1800 μm in r3 3 2 determining the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax basing on hydraulic shear stress test granule strength in r3 was analyzed after 30 days of operation to determining the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax granule strength was determined by its ability to withstand hydraulic shear wan et al 2011 using increasing hydraulic shear stress g 2300 s 1 size distribution variation of granules with different diameters 1500 2000 μm 2000 2500 μm 2500 3000 μm and 3000 3500 μm was analyzed results showed that after 2300 s 1 hydraulic shear stress the distribution peaks of granules with size of 1500 2000 μm 2000 2500 μm and 2500 3000 μm slightly shifted to the left and no obvious size distribution change was observed fig 4 a c the mean diameters slightly reduced from 1665 51 to 1430 48 μm 2161 62 to 1860 91 μm and 2674 21 to 2165 35 μm respectively results revealed that granules with diameter below 3000 μm remained intact under high hydraulic shear stress suggesting relatively strong granules strength however size distribution curve changed from a single peak around 3300 μm to two peaks peak a of 480 μm peak b of 1340 μm in granules with diameter of 3000 3500 μm after increasing hydraulic shear stress the mean diameter significantly reduced from 3281 38 to 1533 13 μm fig 4d variations of the granule size distribution curve indicated that granules over 3000 μm tended to disintegrate and break up under hydraulic shear stress suggesting relatively weak granules strength zhou et al 2019a multiple studies have reported that overgrowth of granules caused uncontrolled propagation of filamentous bacteria and core cavity wan et al 2014 in this study notable decrease of granules strength occurred in granules over 3000 μm consequently based on oxygen mass transfer and hydraulic shear stress test minimum dmin and maximum dmax diameter of optimal granules in r3 was defined as 1800 μm and 3000 μm respectively 3 3 reactor operation and nutrient removal performance during stable operation the sludge sedimentation and concentration gradually increased with the granulation progress after 24 days of operation the sludge volume index svi in 3 reactors gradually decreased from the initial 114 15 to 37 4 ml g 1 r1 48 3 ml g 1 r2 and 44 4 ml g 1 r3 mlss increased from 4000 mg l 1 to 7180 50 mg l 1 r1 6330 60 mg l 1 r2 and 7430 40 mg l 1 r3 the average srt in three reactors stabilized around 18 days fig s3 typical do profiles during cycles of three sbr showed do concentration increased rapidly in aeration phase and maintained at high level above 8 0 mg l 1 during the rest 170 min of operation fig s4 however after 73 days of operation filamentous bulking occurred in r2 which caused fluffy appearance of granules granules in r2 disintegrated gradually and svi rose to 231 1 ml g 1 significant biomass wash out occurred and mlss decreased rapidly to less than 2060 50 mg l 1 srt in r2 decreased rapidly to less than 1 day reactor then deteriorated and failed to recover meanwhile r1 and r3 remained stable during the following operation svi of r1 and r3 maintained around 38 1 ml g 1 and 42 4 ml g 1 and mlss maintained at 7670 110 mg l 1 and 7940 70 mg l 1 respectively the srt in r1 and r3 stabilized around 18 days cod and nh4 n removal efficiency in three reactors remained at a high level during stable operation the effluent cod was lower than 30 mg l 1 in three reactors corresponding to a removal efficiency above 97 the nh4 n removal efficiency in three reactors was over 95 however nh4 n removal efficiency in r2 decreased rapidly due to reactor deterioration effluent nh4 n reached 26 35 2 65 mg l 1 which significantly higher than r1 and r3 p 0 05 in follow up operation nh4 n removal efficiency in r1 and r3 stabilized and remained over 94 and 95 fig s5 a and b on day 60 tn removal efficiency varied in three reactors which were 66 59 2 61 in r1 63 98 4 11 in r2 and 83 57 4 38 in r3 respectively the snd ratio was 65 03 2 32 57 25 5 17 and 87 17 3 04 in r1 r2 and r3 respectively suggesting r3 had highest snd effect r2 then deteriorated after 73 days of operation and tn removal efficiency was only 50 49 3 71 however r1 and r3 remained stable in the follow up operation and tn removal efficiency maintained above 66 63 0 41 and 84 84 0 57 respectively fig s5c the snd ratio was 60 79 1 09 and 83 91 0 81 in r1 and r3 respectively after 153 days of operation it s worth noting the contribution of n assimilation was neglected in snd calculation in this study the cod n ratio was controlled around 20 according to previous studies which was intent to facility sludge granulation however higher cod n ratio favored nitrogen removal efficiency via biomass synthesis which might limit the short cut snd efficiency with lower cod n ratio around 3 5 or less the difference of snd effects between three reactors could be more obvious 3 4 characterization of granulation and size distribution sludge granulation started after 19 days of operation the granulation speed in three reactors were 40 91 4 83 μm d 1 r1 86 14 2 47 μm d 1 r2 and 74 04 2 57 μm d 1 r3 fig 5 a respectively r1 with stronger aeration intensity and higher h d ratio had a significantly higher hydraulic shear compared to r2 and r3 resulting in a slower granulation speed zhou et al 2016 on day 37 the granule size in the bottom of r3 reached 3031 16 103 87 μm after settling suggesting it reached the maximum diameter of optimal granules dmax the height of influent component was then adjusted to 5 0 cm with mean diameter of 1851 74 49 63 μm which corresponded to minimum diameter of optimal granules dmin the detailed adjusting process of influent component was shown in table 2 in the first 36 days day 0 to 36 sufficient nutrient was observed in all granules in r3 aggregation effect in granules was stronger than the erosion effect of hydraulic shear stress and granule size increased rapidly after day 37 height of influent component was adjusted to 5 0 cm which restricted the growth of large granules in r3 the aggregation effects of large granules decreased which reduced the size development rate the influent component was raised by 1 5 cm after day 67 and then 0 5 cm after day 183 suggesting granules size reached a dynamic balance between sludge aggregation and erosion allowing the feeding bar to maintain in position for a long time after 63 days of operation mean diameter in r1 r3 stabilized around 1677 14 14 58 2876 24 19 68 and 1978 98 14 92 μm respectively the overgrowth of large granules in r1 and r3 was limited and d90 diameter greater than 90 of total granules stabilized at 3129 26 17 33 μm and 2981 21 17 26 μm respectively fig 5b however overgrowth of large granules occurred in r2 presenting fluffy granules structure the d90 reached 4031 57 23 19 μm after 63 days meanwhile the mean diameter slightly changed from 1677 14 14 58 to 1758 54 12 26 μm in r1 and 1978 98 14 92 to 2085 65 10 58 μm in r3 respectively after 226 days of operation fig 5c span value was used to express granules size distribution with similar mean diameter a higher span value indicated a sparse size distribution while a lower span value suggested a narrow particle size distribution result revealed span values in r1 and r3 was 0 94 0 04 and 0 47 0 03 respectively flocs co existed with large granules in r1 in contrast the lower span value in r3 suggested a concentrated size distribution granules in r3 presented a relatively uniform diameter and 87 51 granules situated in optimal size range in the follow up operation span value changed slightly from 0 94 0 04 to 0 99 0 03 in r1 and 0 47 0 03 to 0 54 0 01 in r3 respectively after 226 days of operation 3 5 granular characteristics sem results on 60 days fig 6 revealed that large granules in r1 had a complete spherical shape and filamentous structure was observed on large granules surface fig 6a d in r2 abundant filamentous structure intertwined with each other on granules surface filamentous structure was also observed in granules fragment suggesting that filamentous bacteria occupied the whole granules fig 6b e granules in r3 had a smooth and compact appearance coccus and bacilli dominated the surface and no evident filamentous structure was observed fig 6c f on day 60 do mass transfer and anoxic zone proportion in granules of different reactor was analyzed by using fluorescent probe fig s6 results showed that minimum diameter for persistent anoxic zone was 1476 68 41 89 μm r1 1356 23 63 96 μm r2 and 1728 97 21 52 μm r3 respectively combined with the granule size distribution results suggested 36 67 1 35 of the granules in r1 could not perform snd effectively while in r2 and r3 were only 5 18 0 11 and 4 17 0 09 respectively it s worth noting that do concentration in r1 r3 maintained around saturated during most of aeration phase which inhibit snd in some extent increasing the depth for persistent anoxic zone previous studies suggested lowering the do in reactors decreased the required depth for anoxic microenvironment which improve snd effects however reduce do by decreasing aeration intensity led to weak hydraulic shear stress resulting in unstable granular structures in this study while in other reactors with lower do during aeration phase the minimum diameter for persistent anoxic zone could be smaller li et al 2008 layer et al 2020 quoc et al 2021 3 6 performance of height adjustable influent strategy the kinetics of cod in sludge layers of r3 was analyzed after 60 days of operation during influent period cod concentration near inlet increased rapidly while cod concentration away from inlet increased slightly due to diffusion resistance and microbial activity fig 7 after 15 min influent the cod concentration of the inlet sludge layer reached 397 11 mg l 1 which was 4 74 0 33 times higher than that in bottom layer moreover poly β hydroxybutyrate phb as an internal carbon source in granules presented visible difference in sludge layers results showed granules near inlet had higher phb concentration than granules away from inlet which was in accordance with cod concentration distribution fig 7 phb concentration in granules near inlet stabilized at 42 62 1 69 mg gvss 1 volatile suspended solids vss after influent which was much higher than 23 04 2 24 mg gvss 1 and 19 45 1 35 mg gvss 1 of granules in top and bottom layer results revealed the height adjustable influent strategy facilitated the phb storage in granules near inlet which enhanced the growth of granules in optimum size range in addition the phb production of large granules at bottom was inhibited which limited the overgrowth of granules size 3 6 microbial community analysis 3 6 1 microbial structural and distribution analysis alpha diversity of granules was determined after 67 days of operation results showed that shannon and simpson values of granules in r2 were 3 09 and 0 53 respectively which were much lower than r1 4 25 and 0 86 and r3 5 10 and 0 91 respectively indicating that r2 had lower richness and evenness of the microbial community comparisons of microbial structure were conducted at genus level the core of large granules with diameter 3000 μm was separated from the outer part and microbial distribution was analyzed denitrifying bacteria comamonas sp thauera sp acinetobacter sp flavobacterium sp and dokdonella sp etc were observed in three reactors fig 8 a comamonas sp and acinetobacter sp were the dominant denitrifying bacterium in r1 and r2 after 67 days of operation which presented higher abundance in r1 13 24 and 5 58 and r2 12 64 and 5 19 while abundance in r3 6 03 and 1 52 was lower as complete anoxic denitrifying bacterium comamonas sp and acinetobacter sp had higher relative abundance in inner of large granules above 3000 μm than small granules below 800 μm in three reactors fig 8b previous studies suggested suppressing overgrowth of large granules in r3 led to an alternative aerobic anoxic condition in granules which restricted the growth of comamonas sp and acinetobacter sp pishgar et al 2019 thauera sp dokdonella sp and flavobacterium sp were the principal snd pathway for nitrogen removal in granular sludge ding et al 2015 pishgar et al 2019 thauera sp was determined as a potential incomplete nitrate denitrifying bacterium in both aerobic and anoxic condition pishgar et al 2019 the abundance of thauera sp in r1 16 76 and r3 13 78 was much higher than r2 4 28 fig 8a and thauera sp was mainly observed in outer part of large granules in r1 and r3 fig 8b previous studies suggested the filamentous bulking largely decrease the abundance of thauera sp which led to lower abundance of thauera sp in r2 he et al 2019 flavobacterium sp and dokdonella sp also performed total nitrogen removal in an alternate anaerobic aerobic condition pishgar et al 2019 liu et al 2020 which had much higher relative abundance in r3 9 98 and 8 46 than r1 0 41 and 1 11 and r2 0 29 and 0 25 dokdonella sp and flavobacterium sp were complete aerobic denitrifiers which situated in aerobic and anoxic region of granules pishgar et al 2019 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis showed flavobacterium sp mainly fixed in the interior of granules to resist erosion of hydraulic shearing szabó et al 2017 for r1 it was speculated that due to the strong shear stress the outer layer was eroded and let the flavobacterium sp to be exposed which decreased the relative abundance of flavobacterium sp consequently the total abundance of snd bacterium in r3 32 22 was higher than r1 18 28 in and r2 4 82 height adjustable influent strategy in r3 optimized the granules size distribution which led to higher abundance of snd bacterium and higher tn removal efficiency the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas sp and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrosospira sp were found dominant in r1 3 20 and 3 32 and r3 2 29 and 3 61 while encountered sharp decreases in r2 0 21 and 0 18 with filamentous bulking fig 8a previous studies suggested the appearance of filamentous bacteria hindered oxygen transfer which could suppress the propagation of aob and nob wu et al 2019 the abundance of thiothrix sp in r2 reached 44 58 after 67 days of operation which was much higher than r1 18 48 and r3 2 35 fig 8a thiothrix sp was regarded as the major cause to filamentous bulking a controllable growth of thiothrix sp linked microbe to each other de graaff et al 2020 which preformed as skeleton in keeping granule stability franca et al 2018 wu et al 2018 while overgrowth of thiothrix sp led to fluffy structure and granules disintegration wan et al 2014 previous studies revealed oxygen and substrate could fully penetrate small granules which suppressed the propagation of thiothrix sp wu et al 2019 however after 67 days of operation high abundance of thiothrix sp was observed in small granules of r2 67 74 which also formed a fluffy appearance with poor settling ability on the contrary small granules in r1 presented a relative lower thiothrix sp abundance of 26 93 and almost no thiothrix sp enrichment 1 98 was observed in small granules of r3 fig 8b further studies on dynamics of thiothrix sp were then conducted to understand the mechanism of height adjustable influent strategy on granule stability 3 6 2 filamentous population dynamics after 37 days of operation core of large granules above 3000 μm in three reactors presented higher relative abundance of thiothrix sp than outer layer while the abundance of thiothrix sp in small granules below 800 μm from three reactors were lower than 2 28 fig 8c the abundance of thiothrix sp in small granules of r1 and r2 increased after 67 days of operation while no obvious thiothrix sp enrichment was observed in small granules in r3 fig 8b correlation analysis revealed that small granules in r1 and r2 had low correlation with outer layer of large granules on 37 days and r values were 0 602 and 0 266 respectively fig 8d however after 67 days of operation a high correlation between small granules and outer layer of large granules was observed in r1 and r2 and r values reached 0 829 in r1 and 0 993 in r2 respectively fig 8e it s speculated the predominant of thiothrix sp in small granules of r1 and r2 was likely to be infected from large granules instead of the primary growing previous studies suggested complete anaerobic uptake of vfa is essential for stable granulation and filamentous growth was observed when carbon was not completely removed during the anaerobic feeding phase devlin et al 2017 de graaff et al 2020 during initial operation the substrate diffusion rate in large granules was slower than substrate consumption rate which caused the proliferation of thiothrix sp inside the granules however the abundance of free thiothrix sp in bulk liquid was low after day 37 thiothrix sp gradually occupied whole large granules and formed a filamentous structure on the surface the fluffy structure intensified the mass transfer resistance which further stimulated the growth of thiothrix sp rollemberg et al 2019 van den berg et al 2020 the detachment and disintegration of large granules with high abundance of thiothrix sp then infected small granules by spreading into bulk or forming new granules as seeds previous study suggested the substrate uptake rate of thiothrix sp was lower than floc forming bacteria martins et al 2004 and higher sludge age was identified as the major cause of overgrowth of thiothrix sp adonadaga et al 2016 in this study lower hydraulic shear stress in r2 led to insufficient erosion and long srt of large granules which favored the development of thiothrix sp resulting in significantly high abundance 67 74 of thiothrix sp in small granules strong hydraulic shear stress in r1 restrained the overgrowth of granules devlin et al 2017 which suppressed the proliferation of thiothrix sp inside the granules the abundance of thiothrix sp was 18 48 after 67 days of operation which limited the infection and sludge bulking moreover higher hydraulic shear stress in r1 increased the erosion on small granules surface which resulting in relative short srt of granules the present investigation suggested short srt suppressed the enrichment of thiothrix sp adonadaga et al 2016 however high aeration intensity and h d ratio were required in r1 meanwhile height adjustable influent strategy in r3 optimized the granules size distribution under lower aeration intensity and lower h d ratio the data illustrated 87 51 of total granules situated in optimal sizes range and oversized granules accounted for only 2 24 in total granules the proliferation of thiothrix sp in large granules was suppressed and relative abundance of thiothrix sp in sludge was only 2 35 after 67 days of operation and reactor maintained stable during operation 4 conclusions optimizing granules size distribution is critical for reactor operation uncontrolled growth of granules in r2 led to filamentous bulking and reactor deteriorated after 73 days of operation it was speculated that strong shear stress eroded the outer layer of granules and let flavobacterium sp to be exposed which decreased the relative abundance of flavobacterium sp resulting in unfavored snd effect and tn removal efficiency height adjustable influent strategy facilitated phb storage of granules in optimal size range which limited the overgrowth of granules size consequently 87 51 of total granules situated in optimal sizes range enhancing pollutant removal efficiency and reactor stability

16867,sea level rise has increased the frequency of tidal flooding even without accompanying precipitation in many coastal areas worldwide as the tide rises inundates the landscape and then recedes it can transport organic and inorganic matter between terrestrial systems and adjacent aquatic environments however the chemical and biological effects of tidal flooding on urban estuarine systems remain poorly constrained here we provide the first extensive quantification of floodwater nutrient concentrations during a tidal flooding event and estimate the nitrogen n loading to the lafayette river an urban tidal sub tributary of the lower chesapeake bay usa to enable the scale of synoptic sampling necessary to accomplish this we trained citizen scientist volunteers to collect 190 flood water samples during a perigean spring tide to measure total dissolved n tdn dissolved inorganic n din and phosphate concentrations and enterococcus abundance from the retreating ebb tide while using a phone application to measure the extent of tidal inundation almost 95 of enterococcus results had concentrations that exceeded the standard established for recreational waters 104 mpn 100 ml 1 floodwater dissolved nutrient concentrations were higher than concentrations measured in natural estuarine waters suggesting floodwater as a source of dissolved nutrients to the estuary however only din concentrations were statistically higher in floodwater samples than in the estuary using a hydrodynamic model to calculate the volume of water inundating the landscape and the differences between the median din concentrations in floodwaters and the estuary we estimate that 1 145 kg of din entered the lafayette river during this single blue sky tidal flooding event this amount exceeds the annual n load allocation for overland flow established by federal regulations for this segment of the chesapeake bay by 30 because tidal flooding is projected to increase in the future as sea levels continue to rise it is crucial we quantify nutrient loading from tidal flooding in order to set realistic water quality restoration targets for tidally influenced water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sea level rise tidal flooding nitrogen loading water quality enterococcus king tide 1 introduction sea level rise slr has severely impacted low elevation coastal areas world wide causing more frequent and severe inundations during tidal flooding events nicholls and cazenave 2010 coastal flooding in the lower chesapeake bay region has accelerated because rates of relative sea level rise along the u s east coast are about 30 higher than the global average ezer and atkinson 2014 due to the combination of long term anthropogenic sea level rise tebaldi et al 2012 local subsidence ezer and corlett 2012 natural climate variability ezer et al 2013 and changes in oceanic circulation affecting the adjacent gulf stream ezer et al 2013 as a result the hours per year with water levels 0 5 m above mean higher high water mhhw have increased dramatically ezer et al 2018 relative slr for the region also appears to be accelerating boon and mitchell 2015 boon et al 2018 suggesting that the severity of tidal flooding will continue to increase in the foreseeable future for example spanger siegfried et al 2014 reported that 30 of 52 cities along the northeast coast of the us are predicted to have more than 20 tidal flooding events each year that will cause considerable impact e g closure of roads and damage to infrastructure by the year 2030 and more than 50 events per year by 2045 including some extreme cases that are predicted to have more than 250 tidal flooding events per year by 2045 because of its gravitational forcing tidal flooding can occur at high tide in the absence of rain i e blue sky flooding and can be predicted with high precision loftis et al 2019 meteorological forcing e g wind speed and direction and ocean circulation e g strength of western boundary currents can exacerbate or ameliorate tidal height independent of gravitational forcing ezer et al 2013 ezer 2018 and this is predicted with less precision and on shorter timescales most studies examining impacts of tidal flooding have focused on threats to resources on land such as urban infrastructure and human health li et al 2013 ching pong et al 2018 akpinar elci et al 2018 and wetlands raposa et al 2016 however little is known about water quality impairments to adjacent aquatic ecosystems that result from recurrent tidal flooding in urban areas while estimates of stormwater inputs into coastal systems have been made e g hale et al 2015 exchanges of materials e g sediment nutrients and fecal matter between coastal lands and adjacent aquatic systems as a result of tidal flooding have not been quantified efforts to restore the chesapeake bay have been ongoing since 1985 however because voluntary restoration activities failed to achieve their goals by 2010 the restoration was placed under federal mandate to achieve restoration targets the u s environmental protection agency epa established segment specific total maximum daily loads tmdls for the entire chesapeake bay watershed wainger 2012 these load allocations were designed to be protective of water quality impairments that impede recreational and commercial use of its resources including low dissolved oxygen hypoxic suboxic zones accumulation of fecal contaminants low water clarity and excessive algal biomass wainger et al 2013 limits were established for nitrogen n and phosphorus p loads because these two elements have been recognized as essential nutrients for phytoplankton growth downing 1997 bristow et al 2017 and excess algal growth has been linked to reduced water clarity and the development of hypoxic anoxic waters through the creation of biological oxygen demand hagy et al 2004 the tmdls also allocate nutrient loads by sector establishing load allocations for wastewater treatment facilities industrial discharges atmospheric deposition and other point and non point land based sources e g runoff the land based load allocation is primarily from stormwater inputs and associated runoff nutrients delivered to the watershed during coastal flooding in the absence of rainfall are not currently accounted for in these allocations when areas are inundated as a result of coastal flooding materials that have accumulated on the landscape can be carried into waterways when floodwaters recede pandey et al 2014 köhler et al 2013 selbig 2016 further due to the amount of time tidal floodwaters remain on the landscape i e hours biogeochemical reactions may alter the composition of nutrient elements within the floodwaters or mobilize material on the landscapes or in soils facilitating its delivery to the estuary quantifying nutrient inputs from coastal flooding and including these inputs in the tmdl is of paramount importance for accurately calculating nutrient loads and their potential water quality impacts to low lying tidal regions of the chesapeake bay watershed if nutrient loads delivered during tidal flooding events are substantial this could jeopardize the realization of water quality restoration goals here we provide the results of a study in which the objective was to provide the first extensive spatial characterization of nutrient concentrations from tidal floodwaters and estimate nutrient loading during a blue sky tidal flooding event in the lafayette river a sub tributary of the lower chesapeake bay this was made possible by leveraging a citizen science project that enabled tributary wide intensive and synoptic sample collection during a tidal flooding event in 2017 associated with a perigean spring tide i e king tide we measured dissolved n and p concentrations in water samples collected from the receding high tide corrected these for concentrations already present in the estuarine water prior to its encroachment onto the land and combined these with modeled estimates of floodwater volume to calculate nutrient loading to the lafayette river from a tidal flooding event to test the hypothesis that floodwaters from an urban landscape are a net source of dissolved nutrients to the estuary 2 methods 2 1 study site the lafayette river watershed is a sub tributary of the lower chesapeake bay located completely within the city of norfolk va fig 1 most of its watershed is prone to flooding because elevations are less than 5 m above mean sea level fig 1 and kleinosky et al 2007 long term water level data indicate that tidal flooding will become more frequent and intense in the future spanger siegfried et al 2014 ezer 2018 2 2 floodwater sample collection and processing during the perigean spring tide i e king tide that occurred on november 5 2017 fig 1 public and private media outlets and a non profit group located in norfolk va organized a crowd sourced citizen science sampling event catch the king that set a guinness world record for most contributions to an environmental survey loftis et al 2019 this project was made possible by the development of a smartphone application sea level rise concursive corporation funded by the non profit group wetlands watch http wetlandswatch org the application allows users to report the extent of tidal flooding by walking along the water s edge and periodically e g every five steps pressing a button on their smart phone to drop pins that are data that include the geographic coordinates at the water s edge and the associated time and date of data collection the phone application also allows the user to save pictures and comments associated with data points in parallel with the inaugural catch the king event in 2017 we trained a subset of volunteers to collect water samples from the retreating floodwaters while also using the phone application to measure the extent of tidal inundation volunteers primarily included high school students taking advanced placement environmental science their teachers and parents and graduate and undergraduate students graduate and undergraduate faculty and staff from old dominion university these volunteers collected 190 floodwater samples within an hour of high tide teams of volunteers were trained to use the phone application before the king tide event on the day of the event sampling teams were provided with acid cleaned sample bottles gloves sample log sheets to record metadata coolers with ice packs to store samples and instructions for sample collection and data recording using the provided log sheets and the sea level rise phone application each team was then assigned to sample in a specific part of the watershed where flooding was expected based on output from the tidal inundation tracking application for norfolk titan model http gisapp1 norfolk gov titan home aspx samples were transported in the coolers to old dominion university norfolk va where salinity was measured immediately using refractometers and then water samples filtered through pre combusted glass fiber filters whatman gf75 nominal pore size of 0 3 μm and frozen for later analysis of nutrient concentrations see below pictures sample identifiers and location data and salinity results were used to confirm that samples were collected from floodwater from 40 sampling sites floodwater samples were collected in autoclave sterilized glass 250 ml bottles for enumeration of enterococcus abundance by the hampton roads sanitation district or the virginia department of health within 24 h of sample collection 2 3 estuarine sample collection surface 0 25 m water samples were collected almost daily between august 1 and september 10 2017 at a site near the mouth of the lafayette river fig 1 a total of 39 samples samples were collected directly into 15 ml falcon tubes using a peristaltic pump connected to a whatman 0 8 0 2 μm pore size filter transported in a cooler with ice to the laboratory at old dominion university frozen and stored until analysis see below sample analyses were conducted using the same methods described above for floodwater samples 2 4 sample analyses we analyzed total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 no2 nox and phosphate po4 3 concentrations using standard colorimetric methods all concentrations were express in mg l 1 of n or p nh4 samples were analyzed within a week and the rest of the dissolved constituents were analyzed within a month of their collection nh4 concentrations were analyzed using the phenol hypochlorite method with spectrophotometric detection solorzano 1969 po4 3 nox and no2 were analyzed on an astoria pacific nutrient autoanalyzer according to the manufacturer s specifications using standard colorimetric techniques grasshoff et al 1999 briefly po4 3 was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method nox was measured by first reducing no3 to no2 using a cadmium coil and then no2 was measured as an azo dye no2 was measured with the same technique but without the cadmium coil no3 was calculated as the difference between nox and no2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din was calculated as the sum of nox and nh4 total dissolved nitrogen tdn samples were pretreated with potassium persulfate for complete oxidation of dissolved nitrogen compounds to no3 valderrama 1981 oxidized samples were then analyzed to measure no3 concentrations as described above a glutamic acid c5h9no4 standard was used to corroborate that the efficiency of the oxidation step was above 95 dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between tdn and din for all the dissolved nutrients measured deionized water diw was used as an instrument blank and to determine a reagent blank reagent blanks were treated the same as samples standards with concentrations at the low end of the standard curve were run every 10 samples to ensure the stability of sample runs detection limits 3 σ n 3 were calculated for each instrumental run using repeat measurements of the lowest standard concentration samples with concentrations less than this were assigned the concentration of the calculated detection limit for the corresponding instrument run enterococcus abundance was determined using enterolert kits idexx laboratories inc following the manufacturer s specifications by the hampton roads sanitation district or the virginia department of health this method yields results in units of the most probable number mpn of cells based on statistical probability through a fluorescent indicator that is activated by enterococci bacteria the relationship between mpn and the number of colony forming units cfu is 1 1 autoclaved pure water was used as a blank 2 5 data analysis the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to test for normality among different water quality variables in both floodwater and background estuarine waters for all the datasets residuals each value minus the group mean were not normally distributed therefore the paired wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine statistical differences between floodwater and background estuarine water concentrations for all of the water quality variables measured the difference was considered significant when p 0 05 the median of the background samples was used as the paired value for the comparison this value was considered to represent the background with a single value due to the low spatial and temporal availability of riverine concentrations before the flooding campaign when a significant difference was found between floodwater and estuarine concentrations the one tailed version of the paired wilcoxon rank test was used to confirm which group of concentrations was higher 2 6 hydrodynamic model predictions of inundation volumes the schism hydrodynamic model was used to compute temporally and spatially resolved inundation maps zhang et al 2016 a street level hydrodynamic model was driven in a one way nested configuration by schism s predicted water levels prescribed as dirichlet boundary conditions at sewells point near the elizabeth river mouth to estimate water volumes and velocities throughout the cities of norfolk portsmouth and chesapeake including the elizabeth and lafayette rivers loftis et al 2018 this street level model incorporates fluid fluxes groundwater infiltration and stormwater drainage infrastructure similar to other previously developed street level models for nearby watersheds of coastal virginia wang et al 2015 loftis et al 2016 the geospatial inundation depth results from these models are presented as high resolution time aware gis rasters of flood predictions prior to the 2017 king tide loftis et al 2019 hourly inundation depths from 36 h simulation results beginning at 06 00 on november 4 2017 and ending at 18 00 on november 5 2017 from schism and the street level model were used to estimate water volumes from gis raster outputs at 1 meter resolution scale for this study danielson et al 2016 2 7 nutrient loading calculations we calculated the amount of n and p entering the lafayette river during a single flooding event using an estimation of the volume of water inundating the landscape calculated from the aforementioned hydrodynamic models and the difference in concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the floodwater samples and median concentrations measured from the adjacent estuarine water previous to the flooding event for the nutrient loading estimates floodwater concentrations were pooled and the median concentration was calculated to reduce the influence of outliers while the background riverine concentration was calculated as the median of surface 0 25 m concentrations measured at a time series site near the mouth of the lafayette river the median of each group was used to avoid biasing by extreme low and high measurements nutrient inputs from floodwater to the estuary were calculated only when concentrations were statistically higher in the floodwaters doing a paired wilcoxon signed rank test see above to calculate the volume of floodwater inundation depths were extracted from the predictive model s gis raster outputs for the peak inundation period 13 36 utc on november 4 and 13 36 utc on november 5 14 30 utc by computing the difference between values from the same lidar derived digital elevation model of the chesapeake bay used by the hydrodynamic models danielson et al 2016 and water surface elevation data for locations where water level sensors are located near the study site loftis et al 2017 3 results and discussion to our knowledge this is the first estimate of nutrient loading to the chesapeake bay or anywhere as a result of tidal flooding such a loading calculation has not been made previously because it is difficult to gather enough samples in the right places at the right times and over appropriate timescales a confluence of events and sampling programs enabled this project we summarize them here to both advance our ability and improve our methods for quantifying nutrient loading resulting from tidal flooding tidal flooding is increasing in the mid atlantic region as a result of climate change and sea level rise ezer et al 2013 ezer and atkinson 2014 ezer 2018 the king tide mapping event provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to calculate floodwater inundation volumes at a street level for the lafayette river watershed loftis et al 2019 in order to make an accurate assessment of nutrient concentrations in floodwaters it was paramount that we collect many floodwater samples over a short period of time at high tide and shortly thereafter to characterize the natural variability in floodwater nutrient concentrations over diverse land uses at a watershed scale enlisting recruiting a subset of the army of volunteers participating in the king tide mapping event enabled our synoptic water sampling the lafayette river is a small watershed completely within the city of norfolk and the one for which there is a tmdl this made it possible for us to estimate nutrient loading at a watershed scale on a relevant to the chesapeake bay restoration and the epa s tmdl the proximity of this chesapeake bay sub watershed to old dominion university enabled us to transport samples to the laboratory in less than one hour where they could be processed for later analysis see methods section finally we needed high quality estuarine observations against which to compare our floodwater measurements this was made possible through our time series sampling site in the lafayette river associated with our harmful algal bloom monitoring program 3 1 dissolved nutrient concentrations in floodwater volunteers collected 190 floodwater samples from the lafayette river watershed during the sampling campaign held during the perigean spring tide i e king tide on november 5 2017 fig 2 overall nox n and nh4 n concentrations were higher in the floodwaters collected near the mouth of the estuary than from samples collected at the middle and upper part of the lafayette river fig 2a and c while po4 3 p and donn showed an opposite pattern with higher concentrations in floodwater samples collected at the head of the system fig 2b and d floodwater samples showed a large range in concentrations of dissolved constituents fig 2a d and table 1 the average nh4 n concentration in floodwater samples was 0 017 0 032 mg l 1 table 1 more than 50 of the samples were lower than 0 013 mg l 1 while 47 of the samples had concentrations between that and 0 056 mg l 1 and the remaining 3 of the samples had concentrations above 0 056 mg l 1 table 1 the median minimum and maximum nox n concentrations were 0 094 0 001 and 1 92 mg l 1 respectively table 1 no3 n represented 80 of the nox n in 191 of the 194 samples collected and between 50 and 80 of the nox n in the remaining 3 samples concentrations of tdnn in floodwater samples ranged from 0 042 to 1 99 mg l 1 with a mean and median of 0 473 0 349 and 0 43 mg l 1 respectively table 1 estimated values of dinn and donn ranged from 0 002 to 1 96 mg l 1 with an average of 0 13 0 349 and 0 379 0 349 respectively table 1 po4 3 p showed a broad range of concentrations from 0 015 to 3 94 mg l 1 but 98 of the samples had concentrations lower than 0 217 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 0 082 0 29 mg l 1 table 1 the differences between nutrient concentrations in floodwaters and the estuarine system and the spatial variability observed in floodwater nutrient concentrations fig 2 were likely influenced by several factors these include factors known to affect nutrient runoff such as 1 land use and the condition of the landscape at the time of flooding and 2 the frequency intensity and amount of rainfall washing the landscape prior to or during the flood event as well as factors more specific to tidal flooding such as 1 the extent of flooding 2 the associated length of time floodwaters remain on and interact with the landscape 3 the frequency of flooding over previous tidal cycles and 4 the variability in estuarine conditions prior to flooding events the quality and quantity of nutrient inputs from runoff can also vary with land use because activities undertaken on the adjacent landscape influences the type of materials on the landscape e g hydrocarbons fecal material fertilizer other chemical contaminants etc and their transport to adjacent waterways e g pervious versus impervious surface wu et al 2016 of the landscape flooded in the lafayette river watershed when tidal height is 1 m above mean lower low water mllw 45 6 is residential fig 3 a 13 6 is transportation e g roads 12 5 is recreation e g parks 8 is industrial e g warehouses 7 7 is

no consistent relationship between land use and floodwater nutrient concentrations for any of the dissolved constituents measured fig 3b d this could be because the land use classifications used in this study were too broad or failed to distinguish important differences within categories for example residential land uses include green and gray areas e g grass and pavement and a military facility was classified as residential institutional and recreational land uses were also diverse the institutional category included a museum garden and a country club and the recreational designation included a zoo with direct connection to the lafayette river future research should consider evaluations of how nutrient loading from tidal flooding varies by specific land uses such an analysis was beyond the scope of this study estuarine systems are characterized by salinity gradients that reflect mixing between fresh and salt water end members which can shape nutrient distributions eyre and balls 1999 because the lafayette river is shallow and freshwater inputs are limited to runoff and groundwater the salinity gradient in this system is primarily influenced by the tides and storms most of the time the salinity gradient is relatively small and the difference between salinity near the headwaters and the mouth of the system is not more than 3 salinity units morse et al 2011 because the salinity gradient in the river is small we relied on nutrient concentrations measured nearly daily at a timeseries site near the mouth of the river for our pre flood in estuary concentration estimates while ideally paired comparisons of floodwater and pre flood in estuary nutrient concentrations adjacent to each flooded area would be optimal they were beyond the scope of this study further research is needed to better characterize variability in estuarine nutrient concentrations prior to flooding events in addition to direct loading of nutrients differences in dissolved nutrient concentrations between estuarine and floodwater samples can occur as a result of nutrient transformation as floodwaters interact with the landscape according to ezer 2018 the number of hours that water levels were 0 53 m above mean higher high water mhhw in norfolk va in 2016 was 90 h the same author report that this number has increased dramatically over the last 50 years and is projected to increase at an accelerating rate in the future although there are no studies to our knowledge reporting on floodwater soil biogeochemical interactions in urbanized areas changes in water chemistry have been observed in association with more rural systems e g weissman and tully 2020 in this study donn concentrations were higher in the estuary than in floodwaters while dinn showed an opposite trend fig 4 this could mean that higher dinn concentrations in floodwaters were due to remineralization of don to nh4 no2 and no3 during the period when the landscape was inundated rather than being due to their direct addition from materials being transported from the land for example ardón et al 2013 found that repeated saltwater intrusion during tidal flooding events changed n export from being dominated by organic n to being dominated by inorganic n in wetland sediments although reported rates of din regeneration from don and other nitrogen cycle processes show that microbial transformations are fast enough to make measurable changes over the time span in which floodwaters remains on land herbert 1999 we do not know the extent to which they do so during tidal flooding events inundating urban landscapes future studies should examine nutrient transformations e g ammonification and nitrification rates in inundated soils and floodwater to better understand the sources and fates of nutrients during tidal flooding events 3 2 dissolved nutrient inputs during tidal flooding for all of the analytes measured here the maximum concentrations in floodwaters were more than 2 to 10 times higher than those measured in the estuary at our timeseries site table 1 however only concentrations of dinn in floodwaters were statistically higher than pre flood estuarine samples p 0 05 paired wilcoxon table 1 average donn tdnn and po4 3 p concentrations were statistically higher in estuarine waters than in the floodwater samples table 1 from the lidar derived digital elevation model and corrections from water surface elevation measurements in the lafayette river we estimated that about 3 9 1010 1 6 109 l of estuarine water inundated the landscape along the perimeter of the lafayette river during the perigean spring tide on november 5 2017 making the inundation prediction model s uncertainty during this tidal inundation simulation approximately 4 2 only dinn concentrations were used to estimate nutrient inputs because this variable was the one in which concentrations were statistically higher in floodwaters than in the estuary itself and because the tdnn results and thus the donn concentrations were highly variable table 1 the difference between the median dinn concentrations in floodwater and the estuary was 0 0294 mg n l 1 multiplying this concentration by the volume of floodwater inundating the perimeter of the lafayette river during the sampling event we estimate that about 1145 kg of n was introduced to the system in the form of din during this single blue sky flooding event according to the environmental protection agency epa the land based annual load allocation for n to the lafayette river should be less than 880 kg year 1 table 9 1 epa 2010 thus based on our calculations this single flooding event delivered about 30 more of the annual load allocation for this category to the lafayette river while our results are provocative they must be considered carefully for several reasons first all flooding events are not equal tidal height and the extent of inundation varies between flooding events and the condition of the inundated landscape can also vary depending on a variety of factors e g seasonality length of time since last rainfall flooding and land use the water level the day of the flooding event during which we collected samples although high enough to inundate the streets close to the estuary fig 1 was not the as high as predicted or as high as other flooding events in the region during 2017 fig 5 during the past century the tide gage located close to the mouth of the lafayette river has registered flooding events as high as 1 9 m above mllw fig 5 further the estuarine condition is also highly variable and nutrient concentrations can vary on short temporal and spatial scales morse et al 2014 the floodwater nutrient anomalies presented here were calculated assuming homogenous nutrient concentrations within the estuary prior to the tidal flooding and using measurements collected several days before the sampling event at a site near the mouth of the tributary fig 1 however concentrations of dissolved constituents in the lafayette river water can vary on multiple spatial and temporal scales depending on weather e g rainfall and wind morse et al 2014 egerton et al 2014 filippino et al 2017 biogeochemical seasonality mulholland et al 2009 2018 and changes in estuarine water transport morse et al 2011 2013 thus our approach could over or under estimate floodwater nutrient fluxes if background concentrations decreased or increased relative to the median value used for our calculations this variability could confound our ability to determine nutrient loads accurately during individual flooding events while we had many synoptic floodwater samples we had few in estuary nutrient concentration measurements just prior to the tidal flooding we recommend incorporating pre flood sampling along the length of the estuary to provide better paired comparisons of floodwater versus estuarine nutrient concentrations sampling estuarine conditions immediately before each flooding event would also allow us to account for the variability associated with biogeochemical and ecological seasonality that has been observed in this estuarine system morse et al 2014 egerton et al 2014 mulholland et al 2018 overall this study points to blue sky flooding as a potentially significant source of nutrients to estuarine and coastal systems this is not surprising as nutrient inputs from overland stormwater runoff are known to be significant hale et al 2015 as sea levels continue to rise in many coastal areas around the globe haigh et al 2014 water level induced transport of materials from the landscape to the connected waterways will likely increase in coastal watersheds unless measures are taken to prevent these transports increases in the intensity frequency and duration of harmful algal blooms habs and expansion of hypoxic waters in the chesapeake bay have been attributed to more than 100 years of intense nutrient loading to the system kemp et al 2005 sea level rise and associated increases in tidal flooding may exacerbate nutrient loading the chesapeake bay restoration and similar efforts in other coastal waterways along the eastern seaboard of the u s have implemented both voluntary and mandatory nutrient reduction actions to achieve water quality goals these efforts will be jeopardized if nutrient loads delivered as a result of coastal flooding are ignored and strategies for reducing these loads are not adopted particularly in hot spots for water quality impairments such as the lafayette river the lafayette river has been identified as an initiation site for harmful algal blooms habs and these have been linked to n inputs morse et al 2011 2013 2014 mulholland et al 2018 similarly links between nutrient inputs and habs have been observed throughout the chesapeake bay watershed and other coastal areas around the globe see wells et al 2015 and references therein 3 3 microbial contamination in floodwaters the median and average abundance of enterococcus was 1220 and 6283 8984 mpn 100 ml 1 respectively with results ranging from 30 to 24 000 mpn 100 ml 1 fig 5 further the maximum detectable concentration of 24 000 mpn 100 ml 1 the upper limit of analytical detection for the method was observed in 17 of the samples collected there was no clear spatial pattern in enterococcus abundance fig 6 enterococcus spp is a general fecal indicator shed by a variety of organisms into the environment during excretion franzetti et al 2004 its abundance in the environment has been associated with human health risks since the last century which has made it the default indicator for fecal contamination cabelli et al 1982 transmission to humans can occur either by consuming or having contact with contaminated objects or water enayati et al 2015 iversen et al 2004 in this study enterococcus in floodwaters were far in excess of standards established for recreational waters by the us environmental protection agency fig 7 this standard recommends concentrations be no higher than 104 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml of water to achieve an estimated illness rate of 36 per 1000 people recreational water quality criteria by epa 2012 only 5 of the samples collected during our study met this standard while the remaining samples had concentrations that were one to two orders of magnitude higher than this standard fig 7 consistent with our results gidley et al 2016 found high fecal contamination indicators e g human bacteroidales in floodwaters and at drains where floodwaters were rising to inundate the streets in miami beach fl usa ten veldhuis et al 2010 found that riverine flooding induced by excessive precipitation resulted in increases in the abundances of fecal indicators in floodwaters on the order of those found in untreated wastewater ranging from 5 104 to 1 107 cfu 100 ml 1 sources of enterococcus bacteria include warm blooded animals such as ducks geese dogs and gulls however high abundances of enterococci have been found in areas without obvious sources byappanahalli et al 2012 in the lafayette river watershed several dog parks in the residential areas along the perimeter of the lafayette river are affected by tidal flooding in addition ducks geese and gulls are commonly observed in floodwaters and could be sources of enterococcus contamination another source of enterococcus could be the transport or reproduction of bacteria during the intrusion of floodwater through storm drains haile et al 1999 found that biofilms developing within the drainage systems can increase fecal contamination indicators in floodwater during tidal flooding events in urban areas affected by tidal flooding such as norfolk virginia much of the water that inundates the landscape passes through the storm drain system e g shen et al 2019 while it is difficult to quantify people are frequently in contact with floodwater during flooding events in urban areas the most common exposures include contact with floodwaters while walking through affected areas to get to cars homes businesses schools and other destinations and contact with items e g outerwear that have been in contact with floodwater the dominant land use along the perimeter of the lafayette river is residential fig 3a which could increase the number of people in contact with floodwater and the contaminants it carries the large and increasing fraction of human populations living in coastal areas coupled with increases in tidal flooding due to sea level rise suggests that more people will be increasingly affected by flooding and exposed to potential contaminants carried by floodwaters neumann et al 2015 future research should consider not only the nutrient loads delivered to coastal waters but also the effects of tidal flooding on human health through exposure to waterborne pathogens 4 conclusions despite the impact that tidal flooding has in coastal areas the effects of these events on water quality have not been examined in this study we carried out the first comprehensive spatial characterization of nutrient and fecal material concentrations in floodwaters from an urbanized chesapeake bay sub estuary the main conclusions of this study are as follows dinn concentrations were statistically higher in floodwaters than in adjacent estuarine waters indicating that coastal flooding is a previously unquantified and substantial source of nutrients to coastal and estuarine systems enhanced biogeochemical processes in the floodwater itself or the direct transport of dissolved nitrogen from the landscape to estuarine waters could explain the differences between floodwater and estuarine concentrations enterococcus abundance exceeded the recommended standard for recreational waters in nearly all of the floodwaters examined suggesting that contact with floodwaters can be harmful to public health results from this study suggest that din transport into adjacent water bodies by floodwaters may be high thus failing to consider nutrient fluxes resulting from tidally induced inundations could result in underestimates of nutrient inputs into coastal waters their exclusion could bias water quality model projections of nutrient loads to coastal areas thereby jeopardizing mitigation conservation and restoration efforts further research should be done to confirm these estimates and their

16867,sea level rise has increased the frequency of tidal flooding even without accompanying precipitation in many coastal areas worldwide as the tide rises inundates the landscape and then recedes it can transport organic and inorganic matter between terrestrial systems and adjacent aquatic environments however the chemical and biological effects of tidal flooding on urban estuarine systems remain poorly constrained here we provide the first extensive quantification of floodwater nutrient concentrations during a tidal flooding event and estimate the nitrogen n loading to the lafayette river an urban tidal sub tributary of the lower chesapeake bay usa to enable the scale of synoptic sampling necessary to accomplish this we trained citizen scientist volunteers to collect 190 flood water samples during a perigean spring tide to measure total dissolved n tdn dissolved inorganic n din and phosphate concentrations and enterococcus abundance from the retreating ebb tide while using a phone application to measure the extent of tidal inundation almost 95 of enterococcus results had concentrations that exceeded the standard established for recreational waters 104 mpn 100 ml 1 floodwater dissolved nutrient concentrations were higher than concentrations measured in natural estuarine waters suggesting floodwater as a source of dissolved nutrients to the estuary however only din concentrations were statistically higher in floodwater samples than in the estuary using a hydrodynamic model to calculate the volume of water inundating the landscape and the differences between the median din concentrations in floodwaters and the estuary we estimate that 1 145 kg of din entered the lafayette river during this single blue sky tidal flooding event this amount exceeds the annual n load allocation for overland flow established by federal regulations for this segment of the chesapeake bay by 30 because tidal flooding is projected to increase in the future as sea levels continue to rise it is crucial we quantify nutrient loading from tidal flooding in order to set realistic water quality restoration targets for tidally influenced water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sea level rise tidal flooding nitrogen loading water quality enterococcus king tide 1 introduction sea level rise slr has severely impacted low elevation coastal areas world wide causing more frequent and severe inundations during tidal flooding events nicholls and cazenave 2010 coastal flooding in the lower chesapeake bay region has accelerated because rates of relative sea level rise along the u s east coast are about 30 higher than the global average ezer and atkinson 2014 due to the combination of long term anthropogenic sea level rise tebaldi et al 2012 local subsidence ezer and corlett 2012 natural climate variability ezer et al 2013 and changes in oceanic circulation affecting the adjacent gulf stream ezer et al 2013 as a result the hours per year with water levels 0 5 m above mean higher high water mhhw have increased dramatically ezer et al 2018 relative slr for the region also appears to be accelerating boon and mitchell 2015 boon et al 2018 suggesting that the severity of tidal flooding will continue to increase in the foreseeable future for example spanger siegfried et al 2014 reported that 30 of 52 cities along the northeast coast of the us are predicted to have more than 20 tidal flooding events each year that will cause considerable impact e g closure of roads and damage to infrastructure by the year 2030 and more than 50 events per year by 2045 including some extreme cases that are predicted to have more than 250 tidal flooding events per year by 2045 because of its gravitational forcing tidal flooding can occur at high tide in the absence of rain i e blue sky flooding and can be predicted with high precision loftis et al 2019 meteorological forcing e g wind speed and direction and ocean circulation e g strength of western boundary currents can exacerbate or ameliorate tidal height independent of gravitational forcing ezer et al 2013 ezer 2018 and this is predicted with less precision and on shorter timescales most studies examining impacts of tidal flooding have focused on threats to resources on land such as urban infrastructure and human health li et al 2013 ching pong et al 2018 akpinar elci et al 2018 and wetlands raposa et al 2016 however little is known about water quality impairments to adjacent aquatic ecosystems that result from recurrent tidal flooding in urban areas while estimates of stormwater inputs into coastal systems have been made e g hale et al 2015 exchanges of materials e g sediment nutrients and fecal matter between coastal lands and adjacent aquatic systems as a result of tidal flooding have not been quantified efforts to restore the chesapeake bay have been ongoing since 1985 however because voluntary restoration activities failed to achieve their goals by 2010 the restoration was placed under federal mandate to achieve restoration targets the u s environmental protection agency epa established segment specific total maximum daily loads tmdls for the entire chesapeake bay watershed wainger 2012 these load allocations were designed to be protective of water quality impairments that impede recreational and commercial use of its resources including low dissolved oxygen hypoxic suboxic zones accumulation of fecal contaminants low water clarity and excessive algal biomass wainger et al 2013 limits were established for nitrogen n and phosphorus p loads because these two elements have been recognized as essential nutrients for phytoplankton growth downing 1997 bristow et al 2017 and excess algal growth has been linked to reduced water clarity and the development of hypoxic anoxic waters through the creation of biological oxygen demand hagy et al 2004 the tmdls also allocate nutrient loads by sector establishing load allocations for wastewater treatment facilities industrial discharges atmospheric deposition and other point and non point land based sources e g runoff the land based load allocation is primarily from stormwater inputs and associated runoff nutrients delivered to the watershed during coastal flooding in the absence of rainfall are not currently accounted for in these allocations when areas are inundated as a result of coastal flooding materials that have accumulated on the landscape can be carried into waterways when floodwaters recede pandey et al 2014 köhler et al 2013 selbig 2016 further due to the amount of time tidal floodwaters remain on the landscape i e hours biogeochemical reactions may alter the composition of nutrient elements within the floodwaters or mobilize material on the landscapes or in soils facilitating its delivery to the estuary quantifying nutrient inputs from coastal flooding and including these inputs in the tmdl is of paramount importance for accurately calculating nutrient loads and their potential water quality impacts to low lying tidal regions of the chesapeake bay watershed if nutrient loads delivered during tidal flooding events are substantial this could jeopardize the realization of water quality restoration goals here we provide the results of a study in which the objective was to provide the first extensive spatial characterization of nutrient concentrations from tidal floodwaters and estimate nutrient loading during a blue sky tidal flooding event in the lafayette river a sub tributary of the lower chesapeake bay this was made possible by leveraging a citizen science project that enabled tributary wide intensive and synoptic sample collection during a tidal flooding event in 2017 associated with a perigean spring tide i e king tide we measured dissolved n and p concentrations in water samples collected from the receding high tide corrected these for concentrations already present in the estuarine water prior to its encroachment onto the land and combined these with modeled estimates of floodwater volume to calculate nutrient loading to the lafayette river from a tidal flooding event to test the hypothesis that floodwaters from an urban landscape are a net source of dissolved nutrients to the estuary 2 methods 2 1 study site the lafayette river watershed is a sub tributary of the lower chesapeake bay located completely within the city of norfolk va fig 1 most of its watershed is prone to flooding because elevations are less than 5 m above mean sea level fig 1 and kleinosky et al 2007 long term water level data indicate that tidal flooding will become more frequent and intense in the future spanger siegfried et al 2014 ezer 2018 2 2 floodwater sample collection and processing during the perigean spring tide i e king tide that occurred on november 5 2017 fig 1 public and private media outlets and a non profit group located in norfolk va organized a crowd sourced citizen science sampling event catch the king that set a guinness world record for most contributions to an environmental survey loftis et al 2019 this project was made possible by the development of a smartphone application sea level rise concursive corporation funded by the non profit group wetlands watch http wetlandswatch org the application allows users to report the extent of tidal flooding by walking along the water s edge and periodically e g every five steps pressing a button on their smart phone to drop pins that are data that include the geographic coordinates at the water s edge and the associated time and date of data collection the phone application also allows the user to save pictures and comments associated with data points in parallel with the inaugural catch the king event in 2017 we trained a subset of volunteers to collect water samples from the retreating floodwaters while also using the phone application to measure the extent of tidal inundation volunteers primarily included high school students taking advanced placement environmental science their teachers and parents and graduate and undergraduate students graduate and undergraduate faculty and staff from old dominion university these volunteers collected 190 floodwater samples within an hour of high tide teams of volunteers were trained to use the phone application before the king tide event on the day of the event sampling teams were provided with acid cleaned sample bottles gloves sample log sheets to record metadata coolers with ice packs to store samples and instructions for sample collection and data recording using the provided log sheets and the sea level rise phone application each team was then assigned to sample in a specific part of the watershed where flooding was expected based on output from the tidal inundation tracking application for norfolk titan model http gisapp1 norfolk gov titan home aspx samples were transported in the coolers to old dominion university norfolk va where salinity was measured immediately using refractometers and then water samples filtered through pre combusted glass fiber filters whatman gf75 nominal pore size of 0 3 μm and frozen for later analysis of nutrient concentrations see below pictures sample identifiers and location data and salinity results were used to confirm that samples were collected from floodwater from 40 sampling sites floodwater samples were collected in autoclave sterilized glass 250 ml bottles for enumeration of enterococcus abundance by the hampton roads sanitation district or the virginia department of health within 24 h of sample collection 2 3 estuarine sample collection surface 0 25 m water samples were collected almost daily between august 1 and september 10 2017 at a site near the mouth of the lafayette river fig 1 a total of 39 samples samples were collected directly into 15 ml falcon tubes using a peristaltic pump connected to a whatman 0 8 0 2 μm pore size filter transported in a cooler with ice to the laboratory at old dominion university frozen and stored until analysis see below sample analyses were conducted using the same methods described above for floodwater samples 2 4 sample analyses we analyzed total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 no2 nox and phosphate po4 3 concentrations using standard colorimetric methods all concentrations were express in mg l 1 of n or p nh4 samples were analyzed within a week and the rest of the dissolved constituents were analyzed within a month of their collection nh4 concentrations were analyzed using the phenol hypochlorite method with spectrophotometric detection solorzano 1969 po4 3 nox and no2 were analyzed on an astoria pacific nutrient autoanalyzer according to the manufacturer s specifications using standard colorimetric techniques grasshoff et al 1999 briefly po4 3 was analyzed using the molybdenum blue method nox was measured by first reducing no3 to no2 using a cadmium coil and then no2 was measured as an azo dye no2 was measured with the same technique but without the cadmium coil no3 was calculated as the difference between nox and no2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen din was calculated as the sum of nox and nh4 total dissolved nitrogen tdn samples were pretreated with potassium persulfate for complete oxidation of dissolved nitrogen compounds to no3 valderrama 1981 oxidized samples were then analyzed to measure no3 concentrations as described above a glutamic acid c5h9no4 standard was used to corroborate that the efficiency of the oxidation step was above 95 dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between tdn and din for all the dissolved nutrients measured deionized water diw was used as an instrument blank and to determine a reagent blank reagent blanks were treated the same as samples standards with concentrations at the low end of the standard curve were run every 10 samples to ensure the stability of sample runs detection limits 3 σ n 3 were calculated for each instrumental run using repeat measurements of the lowest standard concentration samples with concentrations less than this were assigned the concentration of the calculated detection limit for the corresponding instrument run enterococcus abundance was determined using enterolert kits idexx laboratories inc following the manufacturer s specifications by the hampton roads sanitation district or the virginia department of health this method yields results in units of the most probable number mpn of cells based on statistical probability through a fluorescent indicator that is activated by enterococci bacteria the relationship between mpn and the number of colony forming units cfu is 1 1 autoclaved pure water was used as a blank 2 5 data analysis the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to test for normality among different water quality variables in both floodwater and background estuarine waters for all the datasets residuals each value minus the group mean were not normally distributed therefore the paired wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine statistical differences between floodwater and background estuarine water concentrations for all of the water quality variables measured the difference was considered significant when p 0 05 the median of the background samples was used as the paired value for the comparison this value was considered to represent the background with a single value due to the low spatial and temporal availability of riverine concentrations before the flooding campaign when a significant difference was found between floodwater and estuarine concentrations the one tailed version of the paired wilcoxon rank test was used to confirm which group of concentrations was higher 2 6 hydrodynamic model predictions of inundation volumes the schism hydrodynamic model was used to compute temporally and spatially resolved inundation maps zhang et al 2016 a street level hydrodynamic model was driven in a one way nested configuration by schism s predicted water levels prescribed as dirichlet boundary conditions at sewells point near the elizabeth river mouth to estimate water volumes and velocities throughout the cities of norfolk portsmouth and chesapeake including the elizabeth and lafayette rivers loftis et al 2018 this street level model incorporates fluid fluxes groundwater infiltration and stormwater drainage infrastructure similar to other previously developed street level models for nearby watersheds of coastal virginia wang et al 2015 loftis et al 2016 the geospatial inundation depth results from these models are presented as high resolution time aware gis rasters of flood predictions prior to the 2017 king tide loftis et al 2019 hourly inundation depths from 36 h simulation results beginning at 06 00 on november 4 2017 and ending at 18 00 on november 5 2017 from schism and the street level model were used to estimate water volumes from gis raster outputs at 1 meter resolution scale for this study danielson et al 2016 2 7 nutrient loading calculations we calculated the amount of n and p entering the lafayette river during a single flooding event using an estimation of the volume of water inundating the landscape calculated from the aforementioned hydrodynamic models and the difference in concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the floodwater samples and median concentrations measured from the adjacent estuarine water previous to the flooding event for the nutrient loading estimates floodwater concentrations were pooled and the median concentration was calculated to reduce the influence of outliers while the background riverine concentration was calculated as the median of surface 0 25 m concentrations measured at a time series site near the mouth of the lafayette river the median of each group was used to avoid biasing by extreme low and high measurements nutrient inputs from floodwater to the estuary were calculated only when concentrations were statistically higher in the floodwaters doing a paired wilcoxon signed rank test see above to calculate the volume of floodwater inundation depths were extracted from the predictive model s gis raster outputs for the peak inundation period 13 36 utc on november 4 and 13 36 utc on november 5 14 30 utc by computing the difference between values from the same lidar derived digital elevation model of the chesapeake bay used by the hydrodynamic models danielson et al 2016 and water surface elevation data for locations where water level sensors are located near the study site loftis et al 2017 3 results and discussion to our knowledge this is the first estimate of nutrient loading to the chesapeake bay or anywhere as a result of tidal flooding such a loading calculation has not been made previously because it is difficult to gather enough samples in the right places at the right times and over appropriate timescales a confluence of events and sampling programs enabled this project we summarize them here to both advance our ability and improve our methods for quantifying nutrient loading resulting from tidal flooding tidal flooding is increasing in the mid atlantic region as a result of climate change and sea level rise ezer et al 2013 ezer and atkinson 2014 ezer 2018 the king tide mapping event provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to calculate floodwater inundation volumes at a street level for the lafayette river watershed loftis et al 2019 in order to make an accurate assessment of nutrient concentrations in floodwaters it was paramount that we collect many floodwater samples over a short period of time at high tide and shortly thereafter to characterize the natural variability in floodwater nutrient concentrations over diverse land uses at a watershed scale enlisting recruiting a subset of the army of volunteers participating in the king tide mapping event enabled our synoptic water sampling the lafayette river is a small watershed completely within the city of norfolk and the one for which there is a tmdl this made it possible for us to estimate nutrient loading at a watershed scale on a relevant to the chesapeake bay restoration and the epa s tmdl the proximity of this chesapeake bay sub watershed to old dominion university enabled us to transport samples to the laboratory in less than one hour where they could be processed for later analysis see methods section finally we needed high quality estuarine observations against which to compare our floodwater measurements this was made possible through our time series sampling site in the lafayette river associated with our harmful algal bloom monitoring program 3 1 dissolved nutrient concentrations in floodwater volunteers collected 190 floodwater samples from the lafayette river watershed during the sampling campaign held during the perigean spring tide i e king tide on november 5 2017 fig 2 overall nox n and nh4 n concentrations were higher in the floodwaters collected near the mouth of the estuary than from samples collected at the middle and upper part of the lafayette river fig 2a and c while po4 3 p and donn showed an opposite pattern with higher concentrations in floodwater samples collected at the head of the system fig 2b and d floodwater samples showed a large range in concentrations of dissolved constituents fig 2a d and table 1 the average nh4 n concentration in floodwater samples was 0 017 0 032 mg l 1 table 1 more than 50 of the samples were lower than 0 013 mg l 1 while 47 of the samples had concentrations between that and 0 056 mg l 1 and the remaining 3 of the samples had concentrations above 0 056 mg l 1 table 1 the median minimum and maximum nox n concentrations were 0 094 0 001 and 1 92 mg l 1 respectively table 1 no3 n represented 80 of the nox n in 191 of the 194 samples collected and between 50 and 80 of the nox n in the remaining 3 samples concentrations of tdnn in floodwater samples ranged from 0 042 to 1 99 mg l 1 with a mean and median of 0 473 0 349 and 0 43 mg l 1 respectively table 1 estimated values of dinn and donn ranged from 0 002 to 1 96 mg l 1 with an average of 0 13 0 349 and 0 379 0 349 respectively table 1 po4 3 p showed a broad range of concentrations from 0 015 to 3 94 mg l 1 but 98 of the samples had concentrations lower than 0 217 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 0 082 0 29 mg l 1 table 1 the differences between nutrient concentrations in floodwaters and the estuarine system and the spatial variability observed in floodwater nutrient concentrations fig 2 were likely influenced by several factors these include factors known to affect nutrient runoff such as 1 land use and the condition of the landscape at the time of flooding and 2 the frequency intensity and amount of rainfall washing the landscape prior to or during the flood event as well as factors more specific to tidal flooding such as 1 the extent of flooding 2 the associated length of time floodwaters remain on and interact with the landscape 3 the frequency of flooding over previous tidal cycles and 4 the variability in estuarine conditions prior to flooding events the quality and quantity of nutrient inputs from runoff can also vary with land use because activities undertaken on the adjacent landscape influences the type of materials on the landscape e g hydrocarbons fecal material fertilizer other chemical contaminants etc and their transport to adjacent waterways e g pervious versus impervious surface wu et al 2016 of the landscape flooded in the lafayette river

no consistent relationship between land use and floodwater nutrient concentrations for any of the dissolved constituents measured fig 3b d this could be because the land use classifications used in this study were too broad or failed to distinguish important differences within categories for example residential land uses include green and gray areas e g grass and pavement and a military facility was classified as residential institutional and recreational land uses were also diverse the institutional category included a museum garden and a country club and the recreational designation included a zoo with direct connection to the lafayette river future research should consider evaluations of how nutrient loading from tidal flooding varies by specific land uses such an analysis was beyond the scope of this study estuarine systems are characterized by salinity gradients that reflect mixing between fresh and salt water end members which can shape nutrient distributions eyre and balls 1999 because the lafayette river is shallow and freshwater inputs are limited to runoff and groundwater the salinity gradient in this system is primarily influenced by the tides and storms most of the time the salinity gradient is relatively small and the difference between salinity near the headwaters and the mouth of the system is not more than 3 salinity units morse et al 2011 because the salinity gradient in the river is small we relied on nutrient concentrations measured nearly daily at a timeseries site near the mouth of the river for our pre flood in estuary concentration estimates while ideally paired comparisons of floodwater and pre flood in estuary nutrient concentrations adjacent to each flooded area would be optimal they were beyond the scope of this study further research is needed to better characterize variability in estuarine nutrient concentrations prior to flooding events in addition to direct loading of nutrients differences in dissolved nutrient concentrations between estuarine and floodwater samples can occur as a result of nutrient transformation as floodwaters interact with the landscape according to ezer 2018 the number of hours that water levels were 0 53 m above mean higher high water mhhw in norfolk va in 2016 was 90 h the same author report that this number has increased dramatically over the last 50 years and is projected to increase at an accelerating rate in the future although there are no studies to our knowledge reporting on floodwater soil biogeochemical interactions in urbanized areas changes in water chemistry have been observed in association with more rural systems e g weissman and tully 2020 in this study donn concentrations were higher in the estuary than in floodwaters while dinn showed an opposite trend fig 4 this could mean that higher dinn concentrations in floodwaters were due to remineralization of don to nh4 no2 and no3 during the period when the landscape was inundated rather than being due to their direct addition from materials being transported from the land for example ardón et al 2013 found that repeated saltwater intrusion during tidal flooding events changed n export from being dominated by organic n to being dominated by inorganic n in wetland sediments although reported rates of din regeneration from don and other nitrogen cycle processes show that microbial transformations are fast enough to make measurable changes over the time span in which floodwaters remains on land herbert 1999 we do not know the extent to which they do so during tidal flooding events inundating urban landscapes future studies should examine nutrient transformations e g ammonification and nitrification rates in inundated soils and floodwater to better understand the sources and fates of nutrients during tidal flooding events 3 2 dissolved nutrient inputs during tidal flooding for all of the analytes measured here the maximum concentrations in floodwaters were more than 2 to 10 times higher than those measured in the estuary at our timeseries site table 1 however only concentrations of dinn in floodwaters were statistically higher than pre flood estuarine samples p 0 05 paired wilcoxon table 1 average donn tdnn and po4 3 p concentrations were statistically higher in estuarine waters than in the floodwater samples table 1 from the lidar derived digital elevation model and corrections from water surface elevation measurements in the lafayette river we estimated that about 3 9 1010 1 6 109 l of estuarine water inundated the landscape along the perimeter of the lafayette river during the perigean spring tide on november 5 2017 making the inundation prediction model s uncertainty during this tidal inundation simulation approximately 4 2 only dinn concentrations were used to estimate nutrient inputs because this variable was the one in which concentrations were statistically higher in floodwaters than in the estuary itself and because the tdnn results and thus the donn concentrations were highly variable table 1 the difference between the median dinn concentrations in floodwater and the estuary was 0 0294 mg n l 1 multiplying this concentration by the volume of floodwater inundating the perimeter of the lafayette river during the sampling event we estimate that about 1145 kg of n was introduced to the system in the form of din during this single blue sky flooding event according to the environmental protection agency epa the land based annual load allocation for n to the lafayette river should be less than 880 kg year 1 table 9 1 epa 2010 thus based on our calculations this single flooding event delivered about 30 more of the annual load allocation for this category to the lafayette river while our results are provocative they must be considered carefully for several reasons first all flooding events are not equal tidal height and the extent of inundation varies between flooding events and the condition of the inundated landscape can also vary depending on a variety of factors e g seasonality length of time since last rainfall flooding and land use the water level the day of the flooding event during which we collected samples although high enough to inundate the streets close to the estuary fig 1 was not the as high as predicted or as high as other flooding events in the region during 2017 fig 5 during the past century the tide gage located close to the mouth of the lafayette river has registered flooding events as high as 1 9 m above mllw fig 5 further the estuarine condition is also highly variable and nutrient concentrations can vary on short temporal and spatial scales morse et al 2014 the floodwater nutrient anomalies presented here were calculated assuming homogenous nutrient concentrations within the estuary prior to the tidal flooding and using measurements collected several days before the sampling event at a site near the mouth of the tributary fig 1 however concentrations of dissolved constituents in the lafayette river water can vary on multiple spatial and temporal scales depending on weather e g rainfall and wind morse et al 2014 egerton et al 2014 filippino et al 2017 biogeochemical seasonality mulholland et al 2009 2018 and changes in estuarine water transport morse et al 2011 2013 thus our approach could over or under estimate floodwater nutrient fluxes if background concentrations decreased or increased relative to the median value used for our calculations this variability could confound our ability to determine nutrient loads accurately during individual flooding events while we had many synoptic floodwater samples we had few in estuary nutrient concentration measurements just prior to the tidal flooding we recommend incorporating pre flood sampling along the length of the estuary to provide better paired comparisons of floodwater versus estuarine nutrient concentrations sampling estuarine conditions immediately before each flooding event would also allow us to account for the variability associated with biogeochemical and ecological seasonality that has been observed in this estuarine system morse et al 2014 egerton et al 2014 mulholland et al 2018 overall this study points to blue sky flooding as a potentially significant source of nutrients to estuarine and coastal systems this is not surprising as nutrient inputs from overland stormwater runoff are known to be significant hale et al 2015 as sea levels continue to rise in many coastal areas around the globe haigh et al 2014 water level induced transport of materials from the landscape to the connected waterways will likely increase in coastal watersheds unless measures are taken to prevent these transports increases in the intensity frequency and duration of harmful algal blooms habs and expansion of hypoxic waters in the chesapeake bay have been attributed to more than 100 years of intense nutrient loading to the system kemp et al 2005 sea level rise and associated increases in tidal flooding may exacerbate nutrient loading the chesapeake bay restoration and similar efforts in other coastal waterways along the eastern seaboard of the u s have implemented both voluntary and mandatory nutrient reduction actions to achieve water quality goals these efforts will be jeopardized if nutrient loads delivered as a result of coastal flooding are ignored and strategies for reducing these loads are not adopted particularly in hot spots for water quality impairments such as the lafayette river the lafayette river has been identified as an initiation site for harmful algal blooms habs and these have been linked to n inputs morse et al 2011 2013 2014 mulholland et al 2018 similarly links between nutrient inputs and habs have been observed throughout the chesapeake bay watershed and other coastal areas around the globe see wells et al 2015 and references therein 3 3 microbial contamination in floodwaters the median and average abundance of enterococcus was 1220 and 6283 8984 mpn 100 ml 1 respectively with results ranging from 30 to 24 000 mpn 100 ml 1 fig 5 further the maximum detectable concentration of 24 000 mpn 100 ml 1 the upper limit of analytical detection for the method was observed in 17 of the samples collected there was no clear spatial pattern in enterococcus abundance fig 6 enterococcus spp is a general fecal indicator shed by a variety of organisms into the environment during excretion franzetti et al 2004 its abundance in the environment has been associated with human health risks since the last century which has made it the default indicator for fecal contamination cabelli et al 1982 transmission to humans can occur either by consuming or having contact with contaminated objects or water enayati et al 2015 iversen et al 2004 in this study enterococcus in floodwaters were far in excess of standards established for recreational waters by the us environmental protection agency fig 7 this standard recommends concentrations be no higher than 104 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml of water to achieve an estimated illness rate of 36 per 1000 people recreational water quality criteria by epa 2012 only 5 of the samples collected during our study met this standard while the remaining samples had concentrations that were one to two orders of magnitude higher than this standard fig 7 consistent with our results gidley et al 2016 found high fecal contamination indicators e g human bacteroidales in floodwaters and at drains where floodwaters were rising to inundate the streets in miami beach fl usa ten veldhuis et al 2010 found that riverine flooding induced by excessive precipitation resulted in increases in the abundances of fecal indicators in floodwaters on the order of those found in untreated wastewater ranging from 5 104 to 1 107 cfu 100 ml 1 sources of enterococcus bacteria include warm blooded animals such as ducks geese dogs and gulls however high abundances of enterococci have been found in areas without obvious sources byappanahalli et al 2012 in the lafayette river watershed several dog parks in the residential areas along the perimeter of the lafayette river are affected by tidal flooding in addition ducks geese and gulls are commonly observed in floodwaters and could be sources of enterococcus contamination another source of enterococcus could be the transport or reproduction of bacteria during the intrusion of floodwater through storm drains haile et al 1999 found that biofilms developing within the drainage systems can increase fecal contamination indicators in floodwater during tidal flooding events in urban areas affected by tidal flooding such as norfolk virginia much of the water that inundates the landscape passes through the storm drain system e g shen et al 2019 while it is difficult to quantify people are frequently in contact with floodwater during flooding events in urban areas the most common exposures include contact with floodwaters while walking through affected areas to get to cars homes businesses schools and other destinations and contact with items e g outerwear that have been in contact with floodwater the dominant land use along the perimeter of the lafayette river is residential fig 3a which could increase the number of people in contact with floodwater and the contaminants it carries the large and increasing fraction of human populations living in coastal areas coupled with increases in tidal flooding due to sea level rise suggests that more people will be increasingly affected by flooding and exposed to potential contaminants carried by floodwaters neumann et al 2015 future research should consider not only the nutrient loads delivered to coastal waters but also the effects of tidal flooding on human health through exposure to waterborne pathogens 4 conclusions despite the impact that tidal flooding has in coastal areas the effects of these events on water quality have not been examined in this study we carried out the first comprehensive spatial characterization of nutrient and fecal material concentrations in floodwaters from an urbanized chesapeake bay sub estuary the main conclusions of this study are as follows dinn concentrations were statistically higher in floodwaters than in adjacent estuarine waters indicating that coastal flooding is a previously unquantified and substantial source of nutrients to coastal and estuarine systems enhanced biogeochemical processes in the floodwater itself or the direct transport of dissolved nitrogen from the landscape to estuarine waters could explain the differences between floodwater and estuarine concentrations enterococcus abundance exceeded the recommended standard for recreational waters in nearly all of the floodwaters examined suggesting that contact with floodwaters can be harmful to public health results from this study suggest that din transport into adjacent water bodies by floodwaters may be high thus failing to consider nutrient fluxes resulting from tidally induced inundations could result in underestimates of nutrient inputs into coastal waters their exclusion could bias water quality model projections of nutrient loads to coastal areas thereby jeopardizing mitigation conservation and restoration efforts further research should be done to confirm these estimates and their

16868,in electromembrane processes such as electrodialysis ed and ion concentration polarization icp the diffusion layers on both diluate and concentrate sides influence permselectivity of the ion exchange membrane and current utilization the diffusion layer in the diluate stream due to lower salinity and higher resistivity has been regarded as the primary source of energy loss in contrast very few studies have focused on the diffusion layer in the concentrate stream in this paper we evaluate the influence of hydrodynamic convective flow on the development of diffusion layers on both concentrate and diluate sides specifically in the icp desalination process interestingly the higher convective flow in the concentrate side was shown to drastically improve the current utilization drop in high operating current which has been a recurring challenge in electromembrane processes we attribute this to the prevention of co ion leakage into the membrane confirmed by both experimentation and numerical modeling this new insight has a clear design implication for optimizing electromembrane processes for higher energy efficiency keywords electromembrane current efficiency ion concentration polarization hydrodynamic convection co ion leakage 1 introduction electrodialysis ed fig 1 a is a mature desalination technology which has diluate and concentrate compartments separated by alternating two ion exchange membranes anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem allowing selective ion transport strathmann 2010 it has been widely applied in food processing seawater desalination and brine effluent treatment fidaleo and moresi 2006 korngold et al 2009 sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2008 the selective ion transport develops diffusion layers also known as ion concentration polarization next to aem and cem which lead to ion removal or concentration downstream the diffusivity of ionic species is one of the significant factors in developing the diffusion layer in the diluate compartment it has been experimentally and theoretically proven that the diffusion layer next to cem δ d cem is thicker than the diffusion layer next to aem δ d aem with a sodium chloride solution δ d cem δ d aem fig 1a due to the higher diffusivity of chloride t c l 0 606 compared to that of sodium t n a 0 393 the majority ions in seawater kwak et al 2013 shaposhnik et al 1997 1995 based on this scientific insight we discovered and reported the novel ion concentration polarization icp process which utilizes only cems to achieve an improved current utilization cu also known as current efficiency than ed c u icp c u ed fig 1b al anzi et al 2020 choi et al 2019 kim et al 2017 kwak et al 2016 yoon et al 2019 ideally cu in ed is cu 1 at zero current limit but cu in icp processes is improved as 1 2 at zero current limit with sodium chloride solution due to its diffusivity mismatch e g chloride diffusivity is higher than that of sodium kwak et al 2016 the selective ion transport through ion exchange membranes creates diffusion layers on both depleted depletion layer and concentrated concentration layer sides of the membrane which is the fundamental phenomenon that enables both ed and icp processes it is well understood that a thicker ion depletion region as a result of the higher operating current is often associated with increased cell resistivity resulting in additional voltage drop energy loss to mitigate this spacers are added to diluate channel for enhanced mixing or the flow speed is increased to minimize the boundary layer thickness balster et al 2010 2006 another significant loss mechanism in electromembrane processes is the precipitous drop in cu in proportion to the applied current which is ubiquitously observed in experimental works on ed and icp processes doornbusch et al 2020 kim et al 2017 2016 tanaka 2000 yoon et al 2019 however understanding of the mechanism behind this has been less than desired various second order phenomena have been suggested as the main reason for the drop in cu including 1 new current carrier generation e g water splitting nikonenko et al 2010 rubinstein and shtilman 1979 and 2 membrane discharging by thicker depletion layer andersen et al 2012 frilette 1957 and 3 large trans membrane concentration difference leading to strong back diffusion and osmosis chehayeb et al 2017 however as our analysis indicates none of these effects are large enough to explain dramatic reduction in cu cu value of the membrane is directly related to the ion permselectivity of the membrane and the selectivity of commonly used ed membranes are generally high 97 at equilibrium condition zero current limit therefore a deterioration in cu must be related to a loss in selectivity specifically leakage of co ions under a high current operation even at equilibrium increased salinity around cation exchange membranes cems compared with the inherent fixed anion concentration in the membrane will lead to more anions penetrating into the membrane governed by donnan partitioning geise et al 2012 abu rjal et al developed a simple analytical model demonstrating that a thicker boundary later on the concentrate side reduces membrane permselectivity abu rjal et al 2014 however there has not been any experimental study on this topic not to mention any strategy to mitigate this selectivity loss for more optimal electromembrane operation it has been experimentally demonstrated by many researchers that higher hydrodynamic flow speed u h in ed and icp improves the overall energy efficiency as well as the current efficiency la cerva et al 2018 nakayama et al 2017 yoon et al 2019 previous studies in ed have mainly focused on the reduction of depletion layer thickness by increasing the flow speed u d in the diluate channel since δ d x u or by employing mesh spacers as a turbulence promoter or corrugated membrane balster et al 2010 tadimeti et al 2016 numerical analyses for reverse electrodialysis show that a higher hydrodynamic flow speed leads to a decrease in the system resistance moya 2016 and an improved counter ion transport tedesco et al 2016 also the multi stage ed has been actively investigated to diminish thicker diffusion layers that may result from the single stage ed doornbusch et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 yan et al 2019 however the control of hydrodynamic flow in the concentrate stream u c didn t receive much attention yet higher u c u c h may lead to a thinner concentration layer near cem sweeping out of concentrated stream near the membrane fig 1c and resulting in the reduction of surface concentration of cathodic side of cem c s c and thinner δ c which will reduce any co ion leakage from the concentrate side this provides the experimental evidence regarding the mechanism behind cu lowering at high current and offers ideas to mitigate this limitation in system engineering in this work we regulate the distribution of hydrodynamic flow in diluate and concentrate stream i e u d and u c independently and evaluate the influence of u d and u c on the current distribution energy efficiency voltage drop and cu using the icp process with return flow spacer combined with numerical simulation we provide experimental evidence for the mechanism of cu lowering for the first time to our best knowledge 2 material and method 2 1 device fabrication the benchtop scale icp desalination with return flow spacer was used for experiments and its configuration fabrication and operation were described and demonstrated in previous works kim et al 2016 yoon

physicochemical transport model the time varying behavior of the system is dictated by continuity which is given in this case as 1 c i t j i 0 where j i and c i are the molar flux density and molar

relating to boundary conditions assumptions parameters and numerical methods 3 result and discussion 3 1 osmosis back diffusion and water splitting cannot explain cu lowering observed fig 2 a shows the general schematic of experimental system to evaluate the icp process with various flow and current flux conditions the flow rate for outlet of diluate q d and concentrate q c streams are controlled to have a target flow velocity by adjusting the flow control needle valves attached to the outlets the effective voltage drop v eff and the salinity of both diluate c d and concentrate c c streams are measured under an application of a given current flux in the icp architecture we have the flexibility to control the flow speeds of both channels u d and u c independently which was used to experimentally investigate the relationship between cu and the boundary layer thickness on both sides of the membrane in fig 2b experimentally removed salt flux j s e x p was compared with theoretically estimated chemical flux expected from various secondary mechanisms suggested previously andersen et al 2012 chehayeb et al 2017 frilette 1957 the salt flux in icp process j s i c p is derived the salt fluxes in ed j s e d described by a combination of electro migration j s e e d a m t s e d f i and trans membrane diffusion j s m d a m l s δ c as follow 7 j s e d a m t s e d f i l s

transference number in the icp process 10 t i c p c e m t c e m t t where t c e m and t t represent the outflux by electro migration and diffusive migration respectively the transference number of icp process with sodium chloride can be written as following 11 t i c p c e m t c e m t n a t c l where t n a 0 393 and t c l 0 606 are transference number of sodium and chloride respectively eq 11 gives the result of the calculation of 1 213 in t i c p c e m 0 213 is the advantage obtained by the diffusivity difference the salt transport equation for the icp process can be rewritten by following equation 12 j s i c p a m t i c p c e m f i l s δ c if the ion exchange membranes remain an ideal permselectivity one would expect that salt flux by migrations j s m i c p a m t i c p c e m f i would be the same as j s e x p in reality j s e x p is always lower than j s m i c p yet one can see that the difference between them is increasing in proportion to the operating current at the same diluate flow speed cu is critically dependent on the flow speed of the concentrate flow speed if the concentrate flow speed is set higher than that of diluate flow speed 2 mm s of u d with 4 mm s of u c 2 d 4 c and 2 d 8 c conditions one recovers near ideal cu values over a wide range of current density values up to 100 ma cm2 effectively mitigating the issue of membrane selectivity loss interestingly higher u c i e 2 d 8 c still allow to maintain high cu values even with a current flux beyond the limiting condition areas shaded in gray in fig 2 compared to 2 d 4 c condition in contrast estimated secondary flux value such as back diffusion j s m d osmosis j w m o and electro osmosis j w m e are found to be at least an order of magnitude smaller casting doubts on the importance of these secondary transport processes for example j s m d salt back diffusion is accounting for only 0 7 of j s m e in the case of 2 d 4 c even at the limiting current i l 2 d 4 c 3 2 the effect of hydrodynamic convection in performance of icp process as previously reported yoon et al 2019 the icp process with the return flow spacer shows a symmetrical variation of concentration profiles at c d and c c fig 3 a to evaluate the system characteristic we measure the current voltage i v response fig 3b and calculate the current utilization cu fig 3c shown in the equation below 13 cu z f q d c f c d i where z is ion valence f is faraday s constant and i is total current as generally observed in the electro membrane processes i e ed and icp higher hydrodynamic flow velocity reduces resistance promoting mass transfer through the formation of thin diffusion layers fig 3c also cu generally increases with higher hydrodynamic flow velocity while decreases with an increase in the operating current fig 3d however it is not clear which factor δ c or c c influences cu changes since the symmetrical distribution of hydrodynamic convection q d q c provides only a balanced change in c d and c c therefore we set out to assess the effect of hydrodynamic flow velocity in the concentrate stream u c by testing various u c values of 0 5 to 8 mm s with a fixed value of u d at 2 mm s fig 4 the i v response shows that higher u c leads to increased cell resistance fig 4a however higher u c at the same u d and current values leads to a dramatic reduction in the salinity of diluate output c d fig 4b representing a significant improvement in cu fig 4c and figure s5 this result simply shows that the reduction in c c allows improving cu as discussed in the previous paragraph from fig 4d one can see that lower c c caused by higher u c values is the main driving factor for maintaining high cu values rather than δ c or any boundary layer development in the diluate channel such as higher c d 3 3 numerical analysis in order to explore the phenomena discussed in this article more thoroughly we supplemented our experiments with numerical simulations these simulations focus specifically on processes in the concentrate stream that affect membrane transport its selectivity in particular we modeled ion and solvent transport throughout the three region system using nernst planck poisson and navier stokes the membrane itself was modeled as a region of fixed charge x 5 7 m with no permeability for solvent transport for the applied current and flow conditions considered in the physical system the membrane generates near complete depletion in the diluted stream channel since the diluate stream and its respective phenomena are not the focus of our analysis here we chose a sufficiently large diluted stream velocity u d 80 mm s which renders boundary layer in the diluate channel almost negligible and numerically simplified the simulation significantly as demonstrated in fig 5 a the perpendicularly applied electric field ϕ and solvent flow u generate a diffusion boundary layer on the concentrate side of the membrane whose thickness increases along the length of the membrane by the gibbs donnan effect galama et al 2013 this produces a larger concentration of both co c c o i o n i e c l and counter ions c c o u n t e r i o n i e n a inside the membrane fig 5b i ii to maintain membrane electroneutrality c m e m c c o i o n c c o u n t e r i o n c m e m is the charge density of membrane geise et al 2012 however as shown in fig 5b i the co ion concentration increases more substantially relative to its equilibrium value this leads to the behavior shown in fig 5c i and ii as the diffusion boundary layer thickness increases over the length of the membrane the simulated permselectivity for counter ion reduces substantially allowing co ion leakage it is observed that the migration of co ion j m c l contributes to the majority of the co ion flux j c l compared with the diffusion flux of co ion j d c l figure s7 thus as a whole the membrane becomes less selective for counter ion when a large ion enrichment layer is allowed to develop as we can see in fig 5c i when we diminish this diffusion boundary layer by increasing the flow rate of the concentrate stream the selectivity as described by integral transference t i j i k j k converges to the ideal case unity transference for counter ion and 1 2 of current utilization for icp process fig 5d ultimately this explains why we experience better membrane performance under higher u c 4 conclusion herein we demonstrate the influence of hydrodynamic convective flow on the ion transport in the electromembrane process the increase in hydrodynamic flow in concentrate stream leads to a reduction in the ion concentration near the membrane subsequently it results in improved electromembrane process i e higher current utilization and more uniform current distribution this mechanism is clearly validated by both experiments and numerical simulation in addition the benefit of higher u c is maximized in the operating condition beyond the limiting current regime where a thicker concentration layer is inevitably developed the numerical simulation shows that a lower u c leads to a thicker diffusion layer on the cathodic side of cation exchange membrane while increasing both co and counter ions in the membrane to maintain its electroneutrality this increase in co ion concentration increases the leakage migration of co ions diminishing the transference of membrane while the concept presented here was demonstrated using icp desalination process only it is clear that other desalination processes such as ed can also benefit from the same strategy to achieve higher cu and energy efficiency perhaps at the cost of lower recovery rate from the fast flow in the concentrate channel at the same time in our simulation result we note that counter ion transport is largely unaffected even under the fast concentrate stream flow which may be an optimal operating condition with better energy efficiency for certain desalination applications e g portable scale desalination declaration of

16868,in electromembrane processes such as electrodialysis ed and ion concentration polarization icp the diffusion layers on both diluate and concentrate sides influence permselectivity of the ion exchange membrane and current utilization the diffusion layer in the diluate stream due to lower salinity and higher resistivity has been regarded as the primary source of energy loss in contrast very few studies have focused on the diffusion layer in the concentrate stream in this paper we evaluate the influence of hydrodynamic convective flow on the development of diffusion layers on both concentrate and diluate sides specifically in the icp desalination process interestingly the higher convective flow in the concentrate side was shown to drastically improve the current utilization drop in high operating current which has been a recurring challenge in electromembrane processes we attribute this to the prevention of co ion leakage into the membrane confirmed by both experimentation and numerical modeling this new insight has a clear design implication for optimizing electromembrane processes for higher energy efficiency keywords electromembrane current efficiency ion concentration polarization hydrodynamic convection co ion leakage 1 introduction electrodialysis ed fig 1 a is a mature desalination technology which has diluate and concentrate compartments separated by alternating two ion exchange membranes anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem allowing selective ion transport strathmann 2010 it has been widely applied in food processing seawater desalination and brine effluent treatment fidaleo and moresi 2006 korngold et al 2009 sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2008 the selective ion transport develops diffusion layers also known as ion concentration polarization next to aem and cem which lead to ion removal or concentration downstream the diffusivity of ionic species is one of the significant factors in developing the diffusion layer in the diluate compartment it has been experimentally and theoretically proven that the diffusion layer next to cem δ d cem is thicker than the diffusion layer next to aem δ d aem with a sodium chloride solution δ d cem δ d aem fig 1a due to the higher diffusivity of chloride t c l 0 606 compared to that of sodium t n a 0 393 the majority ions in seawater kwak et al 2013 shaposhnik et al 1997 1995 based on this scientific insight we discovered and reported the novel ion concentration polarization icp process which utilizes only cems to achieve an improved current utilization cu also known as current efficiency than ed c u icp c u ed fig 1b al anzi et al 2020 choi et al 2019 kim et al 2017 kwak et al 2016 yoon et al 2019 ideally cu in ed is cu 1 at zero current limit but cu in icp processes is improved as 1 2 at zero current limit with sodium chloride solution due to its diffusivity mismatch e g chloride diffusivity is higher than that of sodium kwak et al 2016 the selective ion transport through ion exchange membranes creates diffusion layers on both depleted depletion layer and concentrated concentration layer sides of the membrane which is the fundamental phenomenon that enables both ed and icp processes it is well understood that a thicker ion depletion region as a result of the higher operating current is often associated with increased cell resistivity resulting in additional voltage drop energy loss to mitigate this spacers are added to diluate channel for enhanced mixing or the flow speed is increased to minimize the boundary layer thickness balster et al 2010 2006 another significant loss mechanism in electromembrane processes is the precipitous drop in cu in proportion to the applied current which is ubiquitously observed in experimental works on ed and icp processes doornbusch et al 2020 kim et al 2017 2016 tanaka 2000 yoon et al 2019 however understanding of the mechanism behind this has been less than desired various second order phenomena have been suggested as the main reason for the drop in cu including 1 new current carrier generation e g water splitting nikonenko et al 2010 rubinstein and shtilman 1979 and 2 membrane discharging by thicker depletion layer andersen et al 2012 frilette 1957 and 3 large trans membrane concentration difference leading to strong back diffusion and osmosis chehayeb et al 2017 however as our analysis indicates none of these effects are large enough to explain dramatic reduction in cu cu value of the membrane is directly related to the ion permselectivity of the membrane and the selectivity of commonly used ed membranes are generally high 97 at equilibrium condition zero current limit therefore a deterioration in cu must be related to a loss in selectivity specifically leakage of co ions under a high current operation even at equilibrium increased salinity around cation exchange membranes cems compared with the inherent fixed anion concentration in the membrane will lead to more anions penetrating into the membrane governed by donnan partitioning geise et al 2012 abu rjal et al developed a simple analytical model demonstrating that a thicker boundary later on the concentrate side reduces membrane permselectivity abu rjal et al 2014 however there has not been any experimental study on this topic not to mention any strategy to mitigate this selectivity loss for more optimal electromembrane operation it has been experimentally demonstrated by many researchers that higher hydrodynamic flow speed u h in ed and icp improves the overall energy efficiency as well as the current efficiency la cerva et al 2018 nakayama et al 2017 yoon et al 2019 previous studies in ed have mainly focused on the reduction of depletion layer thickness by increasing the flow speed u d in the diluate channel since δ d x u or by employing mesh spacers as a turbulence promoter or corrugated membrane balster et al 2010 tadimeti et al 2016 numerical analyses for reverse electrodialysis show that a higher hydrodynamic flow speed leads to a decrease in the system resistance moya 2016 and an improved counter ion transport tedesco et al 2016 also the multi stage ed has been actively investigated to diminish thicker diffusion layers that may result from the single stage ed doornbusch et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 yan et al 2019 however the control of hydrodynamic flow in the concentrate stream u c didn t receive much attention yet higher u c u c h may lead to a thinner concentration layer near cem sweeping out of concentrated stream near the membrane fig 1c and resulting in the reduction of surface concentration of cathodic side of cem c s c and thinner δ c which will reduce any co ion leakage from the concentrate side this provides the experimental evidence regarding the mechanism behind cu lowering at high current and offers ideas to mitigate this limitation in system engineering in this work we regulate the distribution of hydrodynamic flow in diluate and concentrate stream i e u d and u c independently and evaluate the influence of u d and u c on the current distribution energy efficiency voltage drop and cu using the icp process with return flow spacer combined with numerical simulation we provide experimental evidence for the mechanism of cu lowering for the first time to our best knowledge 2 material and method 2 1 device fabrication the benchtop scale icp desalination with return flow spacer was used for experiments and its configuration fabrication and operation were described and demonstrated in previous works kim et al 2016 yoon et al 2019 the icp desalination device comprises two electrode compartments and icp compartment stacked up with alternating cems and spacers figure s1 the electrode compartments for anode and cathode are fabricated in clear cast acrylic frame with ru ir coated titanium plates as electrodes baoji qixin titanium co ltd china sealed by silicon rubber the icp compartment is made of three spacers and two pieces of cation exchange membrane neosepta cmx astom co japan and two pieces of end membrane ftcm fuma tech gmbh germany with 5 15 c m 2 of the effective membrane area 2 2 system operation and measurement sodium chloride s5886 sigma aldrich co st louis mo usa solution with a concentration of 35 g l was prepared for representative salinity for seawater sodium sulfate 239 313 sigma aldrich co solution with a concentration of 0 6 m was used in the electrode rinsing channels two pumps peristaltic pump masterflex l s pump cole parmer instrument company llc vernon hills il and circulation pump mcmaster were used to apply the sodium chloride solution with various flow rates for feed flow and sodium sulfate solution with 300 ml min for rinse respectively the constant current is applied by the dc power supply 9205 b k precision cor yorba linda ca usa the voltage drop between spacers was measured by the digital multimeter 5491b b k precision cor the salinity changes at the outlet of diluate and concentrate streams were monitored by flow through conductivity probe 16 900 flow thru conductivity electrode microelectrode inc bedford nh usa then the diluate and concentrate solution are collected after the salinity changes have stabilized the electrode conductivity cell 013610md thermo fisher scientific inc cambridge ma usa measures the salinity of collected solutions 2 3 physicochemical transport model the time varying behavior of the system is dictated by continuity which is given in this case as 1 c i t j i 0 where j i and c i are the molar flux density and molar concentration of ion i respectively chemical flux from diffusion migration and convection is given by the nernst planck equations for dilute solutions 2 j i d i c i z i f rt c i ϕ c i u where u ϕ d i and z i are the molar averaged solvent velocity electric potential diffusivity and charge number of ion i respectively the electric potential is coupled to the space charge density through the poisson equation 3 e 2 ϕ ρ sc ϵ 0 ϵ r f ϵ 0 ϵ r i z i c i where e is the electric field vector ρ sc is the space charge ϵ 0 is the permittivity of free space and ϵ r is the relative permittivity the electric current density is given as 4 i f i z i j i which assumes displacement currents have a negligible effect finally navier stokes governs solvent transport 5 u t u u 1 ρ w p ν 2 u where ρ w is the solvent density ν is the kinematic viscosity and p is the pressure the main difference between the aqueous phase and the membrane itself is that this region contains fixed negative charge of molar concentration x in other words 6 ρ sc f i z i c i x throughout the membrane region in order to speed up convergence we given the membrane region initial conditions from solutions to an equilibrium model in order to model galvanostatic polarization across the widths of the channels we implement an electric field boundary condition at the boundary extending along y w m 2 w ch flavin et al 2019 all scaling meshing linear solving and numerical integration was performed using the finite element method within comsol multiphysics see section 3 supplementary information for further details relating to boundary conditions assumptions parameters and numerical methods 3 result and discussion 3 1 osmosis back diffusion and water splitting cannot explain cu lowering observed fig 2 a shows the general schematic of experimental system to evaluate the icp process with various flow and current flux conditions the flow rate for outlet of diluate q d and concentrate q c streams are controlled to have a target flow velocity by adjusting the flow control needle valves attached to the outlets the effective voltage drop v eff and the salinity of both diluate c d and concentrate c c streams are measured under an application of a given current flux in the icp architecture we have the flexibility to control the flow speeds of both channels u d and u c independently which was used to experimentally investigate the relationship between cu and the boundary layer thickness on both sides of the membrane in fig 2b experimentally removed salt flux j s e x p was compared with theoretically estimated chemical flux expected from various secondary mechanisms suggested previously andersen et al 2012 chehayeb et al 2017 frilette 1957 the salt flux in icp process j s i c p is derived the salt fluxes in ed j s e d described by a combination of electro migration j s e e d a m t s e d f i and trans membrane diffusion j s m d a m l s δ c as follow 7 j s e d a m t s e d f i l s δ c where a m is the effective membrane area t s e d is the transference number of solute in ion exchange membranes f is the faraday s constant i is the current flux l s 1 083 10 7 m s is the membrane constant for salt flux by diffusion fidaleo and moresi 2005 t s e d is given by 8 t c e m t a e m 2 1 with an ideal permselectivity of ion exchange membranes t c e m 1 is the ideal transference number of cation in cem and t a e m 1 is the ideal transference number of cation in aem the theoretical transference number for icp process employing only cem t i c p c e m can be calculated as a control volume analysis figure s4 the detailed control volume analysis is described in section 1 supplementary information in the icp process outflux of solute comprise of electro and diffusive migrations j s m icp as follow 9 j s m icp t c e m t t i e f where i e is the net system current t and t are transference numbers of cation and anion respectively the sum of transference numbers is the overall transference number in the icp process 10 t i c p c e m t c e m t t where t c e m and t t represent the outflux by electro migration and diffusive migration respectively the transference number of icp process with sodium chloride can be written as following 11 t i c p c e m t c e m t n a t c l where t n a 0 393 and t c l 0 606 are transference number of sodium and chloride respectively eq 11 gives the result of the calculation of 1 213 in t i c p c e m 0 213 is the advantage obtained by the diffusivity difference the salt transport equation for the icp process can be rewritten by following equation 12 j s i c p a m t i c p c e m f i l s δ c if the ion exchange membranes remain an ideal permselectivity one would expect that salt flux by migrations j s m i c p a m t i c p c e m f i would be the same as j s e x p in reality j s e x p is always lower than j s m i c p yet one can see that the difference between them is increasing in proportion to the operating current at the same diluate flow speed cu is critically dependent on the flow speed of the concentrate flow speed if the concentrate flow speed is set higher than that of diluate flow speed 2 mm s of u d with 4 mm s of u c 2 d 4 c and 2 d 8 c conditions one recovers near ideal cu values over a wide range of current density values up to 100 ma cm2 effectively mitigating the issue of membrane selectivity loss interestingly higher u c i e 2 d 8 c still allow to maintain high cu values even with a current flux beyond the limiting condition areas shaded in gray in fig 2 compared to 2 d 4 c condition in contrast estimated secondary flux value such as back diffusion j s m d osmosis j w m o and electro osmosis j w m e are found to be at least an order of magnitude smaller casting doubts on the importance of these secondary transport processes for example j s m d salt back diffusion is accounting for only 0 7 of j s m e in the case of 2 d 4 c even at the limiting current i l 2 d 4 c 3 2 the effect of hydrodynamic convection in performance of icp process as previously reported yoon et al 2019 the icp process with the return flow spacer shows a symmetrical variation of concentration profiles at c d and c c fig 3 a to evaluate the system characteristic we measure the current voltage i v response fig 3b and calculate the current utilization cu fig 3c shown in the equation below 13 cu z f q d c f c d i where z is ion valence f is faraday s constant and i is total current as generally observed in the electro membrane processes i e ed and icp higher hydrodynamic flow velocity reduces resistance promoting mass transfer through the formation of thin diffusion layers fig 3c also cu generally increases with higher hydrodynamic flow velocity while decreases with an increase in the operating current fig 3d however it is not clear which factor δ c or c c influences cu changes since the symmetrical distribution of hydrodynamic convection q d q c provides only a balanced change in c d and c c therefore we set out to assess the effect of hydrodynamic flow velocity in the concentrate stream u c by testing various u c values of 0 5 to 8 mm s with a fixed value of u d at 2 mm s fig 4 the i v response shows that higher u c leads to increased cell resistance fig 4a however higher u c at the same u d and current values leads to a dramatic reduction in the salinity of diluate output c d fig 4b representing a significant improvement in cu fig 4c and figure s5 this result simply shows that the reduction in c c allows improving cu as discussed in the previous paragraph from fig 4d one can see that lower c c caused by higher u c values is the main driving factor for maintaining high cu values rather than δ c or any boundary layer development in the diluate channel such as higher c d 3 3 numerical analysis in order to explore the phenomena discussed in this article more thoroughly we supplemented our experiments with numerical simulations these simulations focus specifically on processes in the concentrate stream that affect membrane transport its selectivity in particular we modeled ion and solvent transport throughout the three region system using nernst planck poisson and navier stokes the membrane itself was modeled as a region of fixed charge x 5 7 m with no permeability for solvent transport for the applied current and flow conditions considered in the physical system the membrane generates near complete depletion in the diluted stream channel since the diluate stream and its respective phenomena are not the focus of our analysis here we chose a sufficiently large diluted stream velocity u d 80 mm s which renders boundary layer in the diluate channel almost negligible and numerically simplified the simulation significantly as demonstrated in fig 5 a the perpendicularly applied electric field ϕ and solvent flow u generate a diffusion boundary layer on the concentrate side of the membrane whose thickness increases along the length of the membrane by the gibbs donnan effect galama et al 2013 this produces a larger concentration of both co c c o i o n i e c l and counter ions c c o u n t e r i o n i e n a inside the membrane fig 5b i ii to maintain membrane electroneutrality c m e m c c o i o n c c o u n t e r i o n c m e m is the charge density of membrane geise et al 2012 however as shown in fig 5b i the co ion concentration increases more substantially relative to its equilibrium value this leads to the behavior shown in fig 5c i and ii as the diffusion boundary layer thickness increases over the length of the membrane the simulated permselectivity for counter ion reduces substantially allowing co ion leakage it is observed that the migration of co ion j m c l contributes to the majority of the co ion flux j c l compared with the diffusion flux of co ion j d c l figure s7 thus as a whole the membrane becomes less selective for counter ion when a large ion enrichment layer is allowed to develop as we can see in fig 5c i when we diminish this diffusion boundary layer by increasing the flow rate of the concentrate stream the selectivity as described by integral transference t i j i k j k converges to the ideal case unity transference for counter ion and 1 2 of current utilization for icp process fig 5d ultimately this explains why we experience better membrane performance under higher u c 4 conclusion herein we demonstrate the influence of hydrodynamic convective flow on the ion transport in the electromembrane process the increase in hydrodynamic flow in concentrate stream leads to a reduction in the ion concentration near the membrane subsequently it results in improved electromembrane process i e higher current utilization and more uniform current distribution this mechanism is clearly validated by both experiments and numerical simulation in addition the benefit of higher u c is maximized in the operating condition beyond the limiting current regime where a thicker concentration layer is inevitably developed the numerical simulation shows that a lower u c leads to a thicker diffusion layer on the cathodic side of cation exchange membrane while increasing both co and counter ions in the membrane to maintain its electroneutrality this increase in co ion concentration increases the leakage migration of co ions diminishing the transference of membrane while the concept presented here was demonstrated using icp desalination process only it is clear that other desalination processes such as ed can also benefit from the same strategy to achieve higher cu and energy efficiency perhaps at the cost of lower recovery rate from the fast flow in the concentrate channel at the same time in our simulation result we note that counter ion transport is largely unaffected even under the fast concentrate stream flow which may be an optimal operating condition with better energy efficiency for certain desalination applications e g portable scale desalination declaration of

16869,as bridge in global cycles of carbon nitrogen and sulfur sulfate reducing bacteria srb play more and more important role under various environments especially the saline alkali environments with significant increase in area caused by human activities sulfate reduction can be inhibited by environmental nitrate however how srb cope with environmental nitrate stress in these extreme environments still remain unclear here after a long term enrichment of sediment from saline alkali qinghai lake of china using anaerobic filter reactors nitrate was added to evaluate the response of srb with the increase in nitrate concentrations the inhibition on sulfate reduction was gradually observed interestingly extension of hydraulic retention time can relieve the inhibition caused by high nitrate concentration mass balance analysis showed that nitrate reduction is prior to sulfate reduction further metatranscriptomic analysis shows that genes of nitrite reductase periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase gene and energy metabolisms lactate dehydrogenase formate dehydrogenase pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and fumarate reductase genes in srb was down regulated challenging the long held opinion that up regulation of these genes can relieve the nitrate inhibition most importantly the nitrate addition activated the denitrification pathway in denitrifying bacteria db via significantly up regulating the expression of the corresponding genes nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase c subunit nitric oxide reductase activation protein and nitrous oxide reductase genes quickly reducing the environmental nitrate and relieving the nitrate inhibition on srb our findings unravel that in response to environmental nitrate stress haloalkaliphilic srb show dependency on db and expand our knowledge of microbial relationship during sulfur and nitrogen cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate reducing bacteria denitrifying bacteria metatranscriptomic analysis nitrate inhibition enriched biomass 1 introduction environmental degradation and global warming caused by human activities lead to gradual increase in environmental salinity and ph vicente serrano et al 2020 and extremophiles play an increasing role in terrestrial biogeochemical cycles according to the statistics the global area of saline alkali soils sediments is more than 950 million hectares wu et al 2020 which is consistently growing by 1 15 106 hm2 year 1 xia et al 2019 the contradiction between social development and environmental protection raises a question that more and more attention should be paid to elemental cycles in such environments before the great oxidation event low oxygen concentration in atmosphere sulfate reduction process mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is an essential process for microbial energy generation via anaerobic respiration hofer 2018 roerdink 2020 to date srb have been proved to be widespread in diverse environments using sulfate instead of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor hofer 2018 heterotrophic sulfate reduction is coupled to the oxidation of environmental organic matter hofer 2018 zhou et al 2011 accordingly given the sulfur is one of the most abundant elements around the world ubiquitous srb always play important roles as bridge in global cycles of carbon nitrogen and sulfur zhou et al 2011 especially in terrestrial sediments and wetlands hofer 2018 however nitrite intermediate of the nitrogen cycle can inhibit the activity of srb bell et al 2020 while srb show positive responses to this inhibition at neutral ph and low salinity he et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 for instance response of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough srb to nitrate stress showed that nitrite reductase nrfah commonly found in srb was up regulated to compete more electrons and protons to quickly reduce nitrite suppressing the inhibition due to the nitrate stress bell et al 2020 most importantly lactate and formate metabolisms were observed to be enhanced to provide more electrons and protons reducing power for the nrfah to relieve the inhibition as soon as possible he et al 2006 however microbes have made some changes in metabolic patterns to thrive in extreme habitats and there are few reports on the response of haloalkaliphilic srb to environmental nitrate stress in saline alkali lake elemental sulfur cycle mediated by haloalkaliphilic srb had been found to be very active sorokin et al 2015 sorokin et al 2010 vavourakis et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 peak activity of sulfate reduction was found in the top 4 cm of sediments from soda lake vavourakis et al 2019 most importantly higher salinity decreased not only the concentration of dissolved oxygen but also the oxygen diffusion coefficients jamnongwong et al 2010 creating hypoxic habitats in surface sediments suitable for anaerobic life accordingly the surface saline alkali sediments are ideal for in depth research on mechanisms that how haloalkaliphilic srb deal with environmental stress ubiquitous srb were found to thrive with nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms in saline alkali environments with inorganic nitrogen sorokin et al 2015 besides higher salinity can significantly enhance the nitrogen transformation rates especially the denitrification rate li et al 2019 our previous study also showed that haloalkaliphilic srb and denitrifying bacteria db can co exist well zhou et al 2014b meanwhile continuous monitoring revealed nitrate reduction is prior to sulfate reduction zhou et al 2014b hence we hypothesized that haloalkaliphilic db are responsible for quickly relieving the environmental nitrate inhibition on srb to let the srb thrive in these habitats qinghai lake the largest saline alkali lake of china was selected as study site surface sediments and overlying water were collected from this lake for enrichment our previous study on the coexistence of haloalkaliphilic srb and db zhou et al 2014b can be regarded as a feasibility research of this study making the long term enrichment meaningful however the coexistence mechanism still remains unclear to gain complete and deeper understanding spieck et al 2020 long term enrichment of sediments was performed for about 4 years zhou et al 2014a b zhou and xing 2015 zhou et al 2015 the relative abundances of srb dominant species desulfonatronovibrio and db dominant species halomonas respectively reached 3 4 and 10 while more details for bacterial community structure can be found in our previous study zhou et al 2015 to verify our hypothesis we applied the stress response to nitrate addition onto the enrichment the potential rates of sulfate and nitrate removal mass balance analysis metatranscriptomic analysis and metabolomics analysis were conducted to assess the nitrate stress response of haloalkaliphilic srb and db and to unravel how haloalkaliphilic srb thrive in the nitrate enriched habitats 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling qinghai lake 36 32 37 15 n 99 36 100 47 e is the largest saline alkali lake of china with a salinity of 15 5 g l and ph of 9 cui and li 2016 the area of the lake is more than 4400 km2 at an elevation of 3194 m the annual precipitation was 350 400 mm more than 60 65 of which was attributed to the rainfall in summer cui and li 2016 ding et al 2019 while the annual evaporation of qinghai lake can reach 2000 mm ding et al 2019 this contributes to the saline alkali environment of qinghai lake official protection and national nature reserve policies keep the lake away from pollution by human activities lin et al 2020 in this study we randomly selected 30 typical riparian sites flooded area 4 5 m away from the land water interface around the lake for each sampling site sediment was sampled using grab bucket after that the top 5 cm of sediment was taken out and stored in sterile plastic bag the overlying water close to the surface sediment was also collected for the subsequent enrichment after being transported to laboratory on ice one part of sediments was used to measure the physicochemical characteristics table s1 and the other part was mixed adequately to form a composite sample which was divided into three parts one part was stored at 4 c and used to measure physicochemical characteristics as soon as possible another part was used for the enrichment the last part was stored at 80 c for further molecular analysis 2 2 enrichment the two methods used for enrichment are shown in fig 1 i for the first one haloalkaliphilic srb were enriched alternately using bioreactor and serum bottle for about 4 years in the first year lactate was used as electron donor to start up and operate the two parallel laboratory scale anaerobic filter reactors after that every six months enriched biomass was sampled from the inlet of bioreactors which were continuously operated and inoculated into the serum bottles for serial subcultivation within 3 months subsequently enrichment cultures in serum bottles were transferred back to the corresponding bioreactors after 4 transfers different concentrations of nitrate were added into the influents of bioreactors to test the response of haloalkaliphilic srb and db table s2 for the second one ethanol and formate acetate were used to enrich different types of srb we used synthetic wastewater for the 4 years of enrichment and

bioreactor the ph was always maintained at approximately 9 5 tran et al 2021 due to the carbonate bicarbonate buffer and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 24 h the n2 was poured into the bioreactors from the top to maintain anaerobic environments 2 3 analytical methods samples from the down middle and up connections fig s1a were collected every day during the nitrate stress which were

propionate and formate and lactate in supernatant were determined using high performance liquid chromatography zhou and xing 2015 2 4 total rna extraction cdna synthesis and sequencing according to the place where nitrate inhibition occurred enriched biomass from the inlet and down sample connection of same bioreactor fig s1a was collected and mixed which was quickly frozen by liquid nitrogen and then kept in laboratory at 80 c before rna extraction before the nitrate addition activated sludge was sampled and used as control the total rna was extracted using a powersoil total rna isolation kit mobio carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions total rna extraction from four enriched biomass samples two from the bioreactors without nitrate the other from the bioreactors

ragmentation buffer was added into the mrna solution to break the mrna into small fragments which were used as template to synthesize the first strand of cdna with random hexamer primer after that dntps were completely removed and buffers datps dgtps dctps dutps rnase h and dna ploymerase i were added into the system to synthesize the second strand of cdna mccarren et al 2010 after purification end reparation and 3 end adenine addition adaptor sequence was connected to cdna subsequently the second strand of cdna was digested by uracil n glycosylase finally qualified library was sequenced by illumina hiseq2000 raw sequencing data obtained from this study were deposited to the ncbi sequence read archive database with accession no srp068443 2 5 data analysis paired end reads were generated

differentially expressed genes degs due to the nitrate addition and do some further analysis possion distribution was used to do the screening of degs in our study specificity value was calculated to determine the relative transcription level of a specific unigene defined as the ratio of the normalized with bioreactor fed with nitrate to without bioreactor fed without nitrate read number it was as

other was replaced with 0 001 tarazona et al 2011 therefore the calculated gene expression can be directly used for comparing the differences of gene expression between with and without nitrate 3 results and discussion 3 1 response of haloalkaliphilic srb to the nitrate exposure the performance of haloalkaliphilic srb was not significantly influenced by the nitrate addition fig 1iia in stages 1 4 with lower concentrations of nitrate sulfate removal rate can reach 2 9 0 0 kg m 3 d 1 which was even higher than that in stage 0 without nitrate 2 7 0 1 kg m 3 d 1 indicating that the inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb was temporary the inhibition of sulfate reduction was reported to be actually caused by nitrite an intermediate during the nitrate reduction bell et al 2020 which can be relieved if the environmental nitrite was completely used up the nrfha harboring srb can transform nitrite most importantly after 4 years of enrichment 16s rrna amplicon sequencing showed that the haloalkaliphilic db were also enriched zhou et al 2014a b zhou et al 2015 with the relative abundance of 10 28 zhou et al 2015 hence we hypothesized that haloalkaliphilic db may play an important role in relieving the inhibition conversely obvious inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb was observed after being exposed to higher nitrate concentration 1500 mg l 1 fig 1iia it was found that the most of sulfate was reduced in the bottom of bioreactor fig s1 dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr an essential enzyme in sulfate reduction pathway has a higher affinity for nitrite than sulfite einsiedl 2008 haveman et al 2003 and nitrite reduction is prior to sulfite reduction turning dsr into rate limiting enzyme for sulfate reduction in the presence of nitrate within the same hrt interaction time between dsr and sulfite was less under high nitrate concentration than under low nitrate concentration resulting in the decrease in sulfate removal efficiency the above findings were further confirmed by prolonging the hrt from 24 h to 72 h fig 2 3 2 changes in vfa concentrations due to the nitrate addition given srb are heterotrophic available electron donors during sulfate reduction should be first identified fig 1iib not only can nitrate influence the performance of srb but also the concentrations of vfas under higher nitrate concentration the most obvious change was propionate concentration which increased with a decrease in acetate concentration we have proved that the oxidation process of propionate was coupled with sulfate reduction process zhou and xing 2015 which can be mediated by syntrophobacter a syntrophic propionate degrading srb zhou et al 2015 the above result indicates that the nitrate addition may inhibit the propionate metabolism of syntrophobacter it was found that sulfate removal efficiency rate was positively correlated with the acetate concentration r 0 508 p 0 000 n 64 while the concentrations of lactate r 0 278 p 0 026 n 64 propionate r 0 527 p 0 000 n 64 and formate r 0 450 p 0 000 n 64 show negative correlations with sulfate removal efficiency rate table s3 these results indicate that the haloalkaliphilic srb are incomplete oxidizers with acetate as end product and the lactate propionate and formate may serve as electron donors for sulfate reduction accordingly the changes in substances and energy metabolisms of the srb due to the nitrate stress should be unraveled 3 3 whether prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition sulfate reduction in different sample connections was investigated under high nitrate concentration 1500 mg l 1 fig s1 average sulfate removal efficiencies in different sample connections were 45 5 1 04 0 down 0 is inlet of bioreactor 56 2 2 65 0 middle and 73 3 1 93 0 up respectively the amount of sulfate reduced in the bottom of bioreactor 0 down accounted for 62 1 of total amount of sulfate reduced in the bioreactor furthermore nitrate and nitrite were not detected in the effluents of down sample connection hence it was inferred that nitrate reduction was indeed prior to sulfate reduction and the nitrate inhibition may only exist in the bottom of bioreactor where the most of sulfate was reduced nitrate stress was terminated to further confirm the inference fig s1 and the most of sulfate 72 1 was also found to be reduced in the bottom of bioreactor compared with the performance under high nitrate concentration 1500 mg l 1 significant increase in sulfate reduction was observed in every sample connection and sulfate concentration in the down sample connection decreased by 398 mg l 1 in the absence of nitrate however more sulfate 152 mg l 1 was reduced between down and up sample connection in the presence of nitrate than that in the absence of nitrate the above results further indicate the nitrate inhibition only exists in the bottom of bioreactor and due to the inhibition the time which should have been used to reduce 398 mg l 1 sulfate by srb was used for nitrate reduction in the bottom of bioreactor accordingly prolonging the exposure time may relieve the nitrate inhibition to reinforce this conclusion hrt was prolonged from 24 h to 72 h with sufficient electron donor to increase the exposure time between srb and sulfate after prolonging hrt sulfate removal efficiency gradually increased with an average value of above 90 fig 2 and the sulfate removal rate can reach 2 9 kg m 3 d 1 this result further confirms that with sufficient electron donor prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb however the underlying mechanisms of how haloalkaliphilic srb cope with nitrite inhibition have not been reported 3 4 mass balance during the sulfate reduction process in the presence and absence of nitrate in the presence of nitrate acetate concentration continually increased with the increase of sulfate removal efficiency while lactate concentration decreased fig 3 the above results indicate that lactate is degraded via the following pathway lactate is firstly oxidized by lactate dehydrogenase ldh to generate pyruvate and then pyruvate was converted into acetyl coa by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por heidelberg et al 2004 which is used for cell growth and acetate production electrons produced during this process can be utilized for sulfate reduction however it was reported that pyruvate can also be broken down into formate and acetyl coa by pyruvate formate lyase pfl heidelberg et al 2004 zhou et al 2011 formate was only detected at lower sulfate removal efficiency fig 1b this result indicates that the nitrate stress also decreases the formate metabolism of haloalkaliphilic srb based on the assumption that the lactate consumption rate and acetate production rate of db in the presence of nitrate were the same as those in the absence of nitrate we performed mass balance calculation lactate consumed in different positions accounted for 61 7 0 down 79 9 0 middle and 97 0 0 up of total lactate in the presence of nitrate respectively while the percentages were 78 1 88 9 and 97 5 in the absence of nitrate respectively fig s2 furthermore after removing nitrate the decreases in lactate and sulfate concentrations in the down sample connection were 1 77 g l 1 and 398 mg l 1 respectively most importantly according to the stoichiometry zhou and xing 2015 to reduce the 398 mg l 1 sulfate srb only need 746 mg l 1 lactate much lower than the decrease of 1 77 g l 1 this result indicates that lactate metabolism was inhibited by the nitrate stress in the bottom of bioreactor rather than in the up down interval of bioreactor besides after removing nitrate the increase in acetate concentration in the down sample connection was 700 mg l 1 while to reduce 398 mg l 1 sulfate srb only produce 497 mg l 1 acetate accounting for 71 of acetate concentration difference furthermore the amount of sulfate reduced at up down interval only accounted for 37 9 and 22 7 of total reduced sulfate fig s1 most importantly acetate produced at up down interval in the presence of nitrate 2 32 g l 1 was much higher than that in the absence of nitrate 1 51 g l 1 these results indicate that the nitrate addition inhibit activities of not only srb but also other acetogenic bacteria in the bottom of bioreactor our above findings further unravel that nitrate inhibition indeed only exists in the bottom of bioreactor from the perspective of mass balance in summary nitrate inhibited activities of not only srb but also other microorganisms further study showed that prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb however metabolisms of electron donors used for sulfate reduction were inhibited due to the nitrate stress weakening the electron transfer process for relieving the nitrate inhibition on sulfate reduction surprisingly we found that haloalkaliphilic db may play an important role in relieving nitrate inhibition hence how haloalkaliphilic srb and db cope with the nitrate stress and why prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition should be unraveled at transcriptional level 3 5 metatranscriptomic analysis we performed metatranscriptomic analysis to compare gene expression profiles of srb and db between before and after nitrate addition fig 2 as reference for metatranscriptomic analysis clone libraries were constructed to evaluate the highly enriched culture and we obtained highly enriched desulfonatronum sp and desulfonatronovibrio sp fig 1i which was consistent with our previous result revealed by amplicon sequencing zhou et al 2015 changes in gene expression profile were observed fig s3 due to the nitrate exposure more than 84 0 of total degs 5754 6816 fig s4 were down regulated providing transcriptional evidences for that how sulfate reduction processes and metabolisms of electron donors used for sulfate reduction were inhibited however genes of nitrate reduction in db were significantly up regulated supporting our hypothesis that haloalkaliphilic db may play an important role in relieving the inhibition model for sulfate reduction fig 4 i haveman et al 2004 he et al 2006 heidelberg et al 2004 keller et al 2014 keller and wall 2011 zhou et al 2011 at the transcriptional level were demonstrated most of genes involved in sulfate reduction pathway were down regulated table s4 due to the nitrate stress including dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsrab it was reported that dsrab has a higher affinity for nitrite than that for sulfite einsiedl 2008 haveman et al 2003 hence due to the presence of competitive inhibitor nitrite sulfite was reduced slowly and accumulated leading to down regulating the upstream genes in sulfate reduction pathway he et al 2006 fig 4i the down regulation of those genes may cause the decrease in sulfate removal efficiency fig 1ii most importantly periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase gene nrfha was also down regulated after nitrate addition in our study the nrfha can compete electrons with other enzymes involved in sulfate reduction haveman et al 2004 he et al 2006 previous study found that most of srb harbored nrfha marietou 2016 which was up regulated when srb were exposed to nitrite to relieve nitrite inhibition hence the up regulation of nrfha has been assumed to be the important way to relieve the nitrate inhibition bell et al 2020 haveman et al 2004 he et al 2010 he et al 2006 korte et al 2015 marietou 2016 zhou et al 2011 the contradiction between our results and the long held opinions may be because 1 the strong stress resistance of haloalkaliphilic srb may make them able to tolerate a certain concentration of nitrate within a short time and 2 haloalkaliphilic db able to coexist well with srb zhou et al 2014b may quickly reduce the nitrate weakening the role of nrfha in reducing nitrate and down regulating the nrfha of srb our above finding and inference raised the question that whether and how haloalkaliphilic db quickly reduce the environmental nitrate relieving the inhibition on srb both sulfate and nitrate reduction processes need electrons via electron transfer chains however srb showed no positive response to relieve this inhibition in our study after nitrate addition genes involved in energy metabolism were differentially down regulated especially for the lactate dehydrogenase ldh formate dehydrogenase fdhcd pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase porab and fumarate reductase genes frdb table s4 however our results were contrary to the previous research on d vulgaris hildenborough that the ldh fdh and porab were up regulated to produce more electrons and protons for nrfha to relieve nitrate inhibition he et al 2010 he et al 2006 this may be because less electrons and protons were needed due to the down regulation of nrfha resulting in the down regulation of those genes the nitrate stress also down regulated the operons for electron transfer involved in sulfate reduction table s4 including menaquinone linked quinone reductase complex qrcbcd quinone interacting membrane bound oxidoreductase complex qmob and dissimilatory sulfite reductase transmembrane complex dsrk table s4 these results are consistent with other studies haveman et al 2004 he et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 however cytochrome c class iii cyca was reported to be up regulated he et al 2006 in d vulgaris hildenborough to transfer more electrons to nrfha and to relieve this inhibition which was also down regulated in haloalkaliphilic srb the above results further indicate that competition between nitrite and sulfate reduction for electrons is not the main reason of nitrate inhibition energy is needed to activate the sulfate reduction process stoeva et al 2020 in response to nitrate stress some changes in energy metabolism of haloalkaliphilic srb also occurred which was consistent with the response of d vulgaris hildenborough he et al 2010 he et al 2006 the significant one was the down regulation of atp synthase genes however the reasons for this down regulation were quite different for d vulgaris hildenborough more electrons and protons were produced most of which in periplasm were used by nrfha to reduce nitrite bell et al 2020 hence transmembrane proton concentration gradient was lowered which cannot drive atp synthase well while fewer electrons and protons were produced in haloalkaliphilic srb decreasing the transmembrane proton concentration gradient according to the above facts that negative performance of srb and the quick reduction of nitrate we are more confident that addition of nitrate activated and strengthened the denitrification pathway in db reducing the environmental nitrate and relieving the nitrate inhibition on srb to find out direct evidences model for nitrate reduction fig 4ii formusa 2015 stein 2020 stewart et al 2012 wallenstein et al 2006 xi et al 2013 at the transcriptional level were demonstrated genes involved in denitrification were significantly up regulated in db table s5 except for cytoplasmic nitrate reductase gene narg which was slightly down regulated most importantly some genes involved in substance and energy metabolisms were induced by the nitrate addition nitrite reductase gene nirs hallin et al 2018 key gene in denitrification was significantly induced nitric oxide reductase c subunit gene norc transferring electrons duarte et al 2014 to norb no n2o was also induced meanwhile the nitrate addition significantly up regulated nitric oxide reductase activation protein gene nord and nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz hallin et al 2018 stein 2020 the above results unravel that 1 nitrate addition activated the denitrification pathway and nitrite can be quickly reduced into n2 and 2 srb passively waited for db to reduce nitrate why prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition 4 conclusions and implications in summary high nitrate concentration can inhibit the activity of haloalkaliphilic srb mass balance analysis showed that nitrate reduction is prior to sulfate reduction with sufficient electron donor prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb further metatranscriptomic analysis shows that in response to environmental nitrate stress haloalkaliphilic srb show dependency on db apart from heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification ge et al 2020 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium ge et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation wang et al 2021 can also reduce the environmental nitrate nitrite hence the future researches should also focus on 1 roles of other extremophiles in sulfur and nitrogen cycles including the main driving forces and microbially driven mechanisms 2 exploration of detailed and direct interaction between haloalkaliphilic srb and extremophiles 3 successful application of metaproteomics analysis in extreme environments 4 isolation of pure haloalkaliphilic srb and extremophiles for more in depth control studies subsequently we can further unravel the underlying mechanisms for nitrate stress on sulfate reduction and confidently revise the sulfur and nitrogen cycles declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgments this research is financially

16869,as bridge in global cycles of carbon nitrogen and sulfur sulfate reducing bacteria srb play more and more important role under various environments especially the saline alkali environments with significant increase in area caused by human activities sulfate reduction can be inhibited by environmental nitrate however how srb cope with environmental nitrate stress in these extreme environments still remain unclear here after a long term enrichment of sediment from saline alkali qinghai lake of china using anaerobic filter reactors nitrate was added to evaluate the response of srb with the increase in nitrate concentrations the inhibition on sulfate reduction was gradually observed interestingly extension of hydraulic retention time can relieve the inhibition caused by high nitrate concentration mass balance analysis showed that nitrate reduction is prior to sulfate reduction further metatranscriptomic analysis shows that genes of nitrite reductase periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase gene and energy metabolisms lactate dehydrogenase formate dehydrogenase pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and fumarate reductase genes in srb was down regulated challenging the long held opinion that up regulation of these genes can relieve the nitrate inhibition most importantly the nitrate addition activated the denitrification pathway in denitrifying bacteria db via significantly up regulating the expression of the corresponding genes nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase c subunit nitric oxide reductase activation protein and nitrous oxide reductase genes quickly reducing the environmental nitrate and relieving the nitrate inhibition on srb our findings unravel that in response to environmental nitrate stress haloalkaliphilic srb show dependency on db and expand our knowledge of microbial relationship during sulfur and nitrogen cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate reducing bacteria denitrifying bacteria metatranscriptomic analysis nitrate inhibition enriched biomass 1 introduction environmental degradation and global warming caused by human activities lead to gradual increase in environmental salinity and ph vicente serrano et al 2020 and extremophiles play an increasing role in terrestrial biogeochemical cycles according to the statistics the global area of saline alkali soils sediments is more than 950 million hectares wu et al 2020 which is consistently growing by 1 15 106 hm2 year 1 xia et al 2019 the contradiction between social development and environmental protection raises a question that more and more attention should be paid to elemental cycles in such environments before the great oxidation event low oxygen concentration in atmosphere sulfate reduction process mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is an essential process for microbial energy generation via anaerobic respiration hofer 2018 roerdink 2020 to date srb have been proved to be widespread in diverse environments using sulfate instead of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor hofer 2018 heterotrophic sulfate reduction is coupled to the oxidation of environmental organic matter hofer 2018 zhou et al 2011 accordingly given the sulfur is one of the most abundant elements around the world ubiquitous srb always play important roles as bridge in global cycles of carbon nitrogen and sulfur zhou et al 2011 especially in terrestrial sediments and wetlands hofer 2018 however nitrite intermediate of the nitrogen cycle can inhibit the activity of srb bell et al 2020 while srb show positive responses to this inhibition at neutral ph and low salinity he et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 for instance response of desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough srb to nitrate stress showed that nitrite reductase nrfah commonly found in srb was up regulated to compete more electrons and protons to quickly reduce nitrite suppressing the inhibition due to the nitrate stress bell et al 2020 most importantly lactate and formate metabolisms were observed to be enhanced to provide more electrons and protons reducing power for the nrfah to relieve the inhibition as soon as possible he et al 2006 however microbes have made some changes in metabolic patterns to thrive in extreme habitats and there are few reports on the response of haloalkaliphilic srb to environmental nitrate stress in saline alkali lake elemental sulfur cycle mediated by haloalkaliphilic srb had been found to be very active sorokin et al 2015 sorokin et al 2010 vavourakis et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 peak activity of sulfate reduction was found in the top 4 cm of sediments from soda lake vavourakis et al 2019 most importantly higher salinity decreased not only the concentration of dissolved oxygen but also the oxygen diffusion coefficients jamnongwong et al 2010 creating hypoxic habitats in surface sediments suitable for anaerobic life accordingly the surface saline alkali sediments are ideal for in depth research on mechanisms that how haloalkaliphilic srb deal with environmental stress ubiquitous srb were found to thrive with nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms in saline alkali environments with inorganic nitrogen sorokin et al 2015 besides higher salinity can significantly enhance the nitrogen transformation rates especially the denitrification rate li et al 2019 our previous study also showed that haloalkaliphilic srb and denitrifying bacteria db can co exist well zhou et al 2014b meanwhile continuous monitoring revealed nitrate reduction is prior to sulfate reduction zhou et al 2014b hence we hypothesized that haloalkaliphilic db are responsible for quickly relieving the environmental nitrate inhibition on srb to let the srb thrive in these habitats qinghai lake the largest saline alkali lake of china was selected as study site surface sediments and overlying water were collected from this lake for enrichment our previous study on the coexistence of haloalkaliphilic srb and db zhou et al 2014b can be regarded as a feasibility research of this study making the long term enrichment meaningful however the coexistence mechanism still remains unclear to gain complete and deeper understanding spieck et al 2020 long term enrichment of sediments was performed for about 4 years zhou et al 2014a b zhou and xing 2015 zhou et al 2015 the relative abundances of srb dominant species desulfonatronovibrio and db dominant species halomonas respectively reached 3 4 and 10 while more details for bacterial community structure can be found in our previous study zhou et al 2015 to verify our hypothesis we applied the stress response to nitrate addition onto the enrichment the potential rates of sulfate and nitrate removal mass balance analysis metatranscriptomic analysis and metabolomics analysis were conducted to assess the nitrate stress response of haloalkaliphilic srb and db and to unravel how haloalkaliphilic srb thrive in the nitrate enriched habitats 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling qinghai lake 36 32 37 15 n 99 36 100 47 e is the largest saline alkali lake of china with a salinity of 15 5 g l and ph of 9 cui and li 2016 the area of the lake is more than 4400 km2 at an elevation of 3194 m the annual precipitation was 350 400 mm more than 60 65 of which was attributed to the rainfall in summer cui and li 2016 ding et al 2019 while the annual evaporation of qinghai lake can reach 2000 mm ding et al 2019 this contributes to the saline alkali environment of qinghai lake official protection and national nature reserve policies keep the lake away from pollution by human activities lin et al 2020 in this study we randomly selected 30 typical riparian sites flooded area 4 5 m away from the land water interface around the lake for each sampling site sediment was sampled using grab bucket after that the top 5 cm of sediment was taken out and stored in sterile plastic bag the overlying water close to the surface sediment was also collected for the subsequent enrichment after being transported to laboratory on ice one part of sediments was used to measure the physicochemical characteristics table s1 and the other part was mixed adequately to form a composite sample which was divided into three parts one part was stored at 4 c and used to measure physicochemical characteristics as soon as possible another part was used for the enrichment the last part was stored at 80 c for further molecular analysis 2 2 enrichment the two methods used for enrichment are shown in fig 1 i for the first one haloalkaliphilic srb were enriched alternately using bioreactor and serum bottle for about 4 years in the first year lactate was used as electron donor to start up and operate the two parallel laboratory scale anaerobic filter reactors after that every six months enriched biomass was sampled from the inlet of bioreactors which were continuously operated and inoculated into the serum bottles for serial subcultivation within 3 months subsequently enrichment cultures in serum bottles were transferred back to the corresponding bioreactors after 4 transfers different concentrations of nitrate were added into the influents of bioreactors to test the response of haloalkaliphilic srb and db table s2 for the second one ethanol and formate acetate were used to enrich different types of srb we used synthetic wastewater for the 4 years of enrichment and transfers which consisted of 31 8 g of na2co3 21 g of nahco3 0 5 g of yeast extract 0 5 g of nh4cl 2 g of kh2po4 6 g of nacl corresponding to 4 44 g na2so4 and carbon sources with a cod so4 2 ratio of 2 0 the operational parameter of bioreactors and determination of oxidation reduction potential orp can be found in our previous study zhou and xing 2015 the influent was fed from the bottom of bioreactor the ph was always maintained at approximately 9 5 tran et al 2021 due to the carbonate bicarbonate buffer and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 24 h the n2 was poured into the bioreactors from the top to maintain anaerobic environments 2 3 analytical methods samples from the down middle and up connections fig s1a were collected every day during the nitrate stress which were centrifuged to obtain supernatant concentrations of sulfate nitrate and nitrite in supernatant were quantified using ion chromatograph concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas e g acetate propionate and formate and lactate in supernatant were determined using high performance liquid chromatography zhou and xing 2015 2 4 total rna extraction cdna synthesis and sequencing according to the place where nitrate inhibition occurred enriched biomass from the inlet and down sample connection of same bioreactor fig s1a was collected and mixed which was quickly frozen by liquid nitrogen and then kept in laboratory at 80 c before rna extraction before the nitrate addition activated sludge was sampled and used as control the total rna was extracted using a powersoil total rna isolation kit mobio carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions total rna extraction from four enriched biomass samples two from the bioreactors without nitrate the other from the bioreactors with nitrate was simultaneously performed rna solution from the same source was pooled for subsequent treatment to obtain messenger rna mrna dna was digested and ribosomal rna was also removed the ragmentation buffer was added into the mrna solution to break the mrna into small fragments which were used as template to synthesize the first strand of cdna with random hexamer primer after that dntps were completely removed and buffers datps dgtps dctps dutps rnase h and dna ploymerase i were added into the system to synthesize the second strand of cdna mccarren et al 2010 after purification end reparation and 3 end adenine addition adaptor sequence was connected to cdna subsequently the second strand of cdna was digested by uracil n glycosylase finally qualified library was sequenced by illumina hiseq2000 raw sequencing data obtained from this study were deposited to the ncbi sequence read archive database with accession no srp068443 2 5 data analysis paired end reads were generated with illumina platform to obtain clean data li et al 2009 n reads low quality reads and adaptor sequences were removed before de novo assembly soap was used to remove 16s rrna sequences short reads were assembled with trinity grabherr et al 2011 to obtain longer and non redundant unigenes assembled unigenes from each sample were further assembled after that unigenes were separately blasted

differentially expressed genes degs due to the nitrate addition and do some further analysis possion distribution was used to do the screening of degs in our study specificity value was calculated to determine the relative transcription level of a specific unigene defined as the ratio of the normalized with bioreactor fed with nitrate to without bioreactor fed without nitrate read number it was as follows unigene specificity with rpkm without rpkm luo et al 2014 when multiple unigenes were referred to a same gene the specificity for this particular gene was calculated as follows gene specificity unigene length unigene specificity unigene lengths to calculate all defined specificity under all conditions rpkm of zero where a transcript was present in one data set but not in the other was replaced with 0 001 tarazona et al 2011 therefore the calculated gene expression can be directly used for comparing the differences of gene expression between with and without nitrate 3 results and discussion 3 1 response of haloalkaliphilic srb to the nitrate exposure the performance of haloalkaliphilic srb was not significantly influenced by the nitrate addition fig 1iia in stages 1 4 with lower concentrations of nitrate sulfate removal rate can reach 2 9 0 0 kg m 3 d 1 which was even higher than that in stage 0 without nitrate 2 7 0 1 kg m 3 d 1 indicating that the inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb was temporary the inhibition of sulfate reduction was reported to be actually caused by nitrite an intermediate during the nitrate reduction bell et al 2020 which can be relieved if the environmental nitrite was completely used up the nrfha harboring srb can transform nitrite most importantly after 4 years of enrichment 16s rrna amplicon sequencing showed that the haloalkaliphilic db were also enriched zhou et al 2014a b zhou et al 2015 with the relative abundance of 10 28 zhou et al 2015 hence we hypothesized that haloalkaliphilic db may play an important role in relieving the inhibition conversely obvious inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb was observed after being exposed to higher nitrate concentration 1500 mg l 1 fig 1iia it was found that the most of sulfate was reduced in the bottom of bioreactor fig s1 dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr an essential enzyme in sulfate reduction pathway has a higher affinity for nitrite than sulfite einsiedl 2008 haveman et al 2003 and nitrite reduction is prior to sulfite reduction turning dsr into rate limiting enzyme for sulfate reduction in the presence of nitrate within the same hrt interaction time between dsr and sulfite was less under high nitrate concentration than under low nitrate concentration resulting in the decrease in sulfate removal efficiency the above findings were further confirmed by prolonging the hrt from 24 h to 72 h fig 2 3 2 changes in vfa concentrations due to the nitrate addition given srb are heterotrophic available electron donors during sulfate reduction should be first identified fig 1iib not only can nitrate influence the performance of srb but also the concentrations of vfas under higher nitrate concentration the most obvious change was propionate concentration which increased with a decrease in acetate concentration we have proved that the oxidation process of propionate was coupled with sulfate reduction process zhou and xing 2015 which can be mediated by syntrophobacter a syntrophic propionate degrading srb zhou et al 2015 the above result indicates that the nitrate addition may inhibit the propionate metabolism of syntrophobacter it was found that sulfate removal efficiency rate was positively correlated with the acetate concentration r 0 508 p 0 000 n 64 while the concentrations of lactate r 0 278 p 0 026 n 64 propionate r 0 527 p 0 000 n 64 and formate r 0 450 p 0 000 n 64 show negative correlations with sulfate removal efficiency rate table s3 these results indicate that the haloalkaliphilic srb are incomplete oxidizers with acetate as end product and the lactate propionate and formate may serve as electron donors for sulfate reduction accordingly the changes in substances and energy metabolisms of the srb due to the nitrate stress should be unraveled 3 3 whether prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition sulfate reduction in different sample connections was investigated under high nitrate concentration 1500 mg l 1 fig s1 average sulfate removal efficiencies in different sample connections were 45 5 1 04 0 down 0 is inlet of bioreactor 56 2 2 65 0 middle and 73 3 1 93 0 up respectively the amount of sulfate reduced in the bottom of bioreactor 0 down accounted for 62 1 of total amount of sulfate reduced in the bioreactor furthermore nitrate and nitrite were not detected in the effluents of down sample connection hence it was inferred that nitrate reduction was indeed prior to sulfate reduction and the nitrate inhibition may only exist in the bottom of bioreactor where the most of sulfate was reduced nitrate stress was terminated to further confirm the inference fig s1 and the most of sulfate 72 1 was also found to be reduced in the bottom of bioreactor compared with the performance under high nitrate concentration 1500 mg l 1 significant increase in sulfate reduction was observed in every sample connection and sulfate concentration in the down sample connection decreased by 398 mg l 1 in the absence of nitrate however more sulfate 152 mg l 1 was reduced between down and up sample connection in the presence of nitrate than that in the absence of nitrate the above results further indicate the nitrate inhibition only exists in the bottom of bioreactor and due to the inhibition the time which should have been used to reduce 398 mg l 1 sulfate by srb was used for nitrate reduction in the bottom of bioreactor accordingly prolonging the exposure time may relieve the nitrate inhibition to reinforce this conclusion hrt was prolonged from 24 h to 72 h with sufficient electron donor to increase the exposure time between srb and sulfate after prolonging hrt sulfate removal efficiency gradually increased with an average value of above 90 fig 2 and the sulfate removal rate can reach 2 9 kg m 3 d 1 this result further confirms that with sufficient electron donor prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb however the underlying mechanisms of how haloalkaliphilic srb cope with nitrite inhibition have not been reported 3 4 mass balance during the sulfate reduction process in the presence and absence of nitrate in the presence of nitrate acetate concentration continually increased with the increase of sulfate removal efficiency while lactate concentration decreased fig 3 the above results indicate that lactate is degraded via the following pathway lactate is firstly oxidized by lactate dehydrogenase ldh to generate pyruvate and then pyruvate was converted into acetyl coa by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por heidelberg et al 2004 which is used for cell growth and acetate production electrons produced during this process can be utilized for sulfate reduction however it was reported that pyruvate can also be broken down into formate and acetyl coa by pyruvate formate lyase pfl heidelberg et al 2004 zhou et al 2011 formate was only detected at lower sulfate removal efficiency fig 1b this result indicates that the nitrate stress also decreases the formate metabolism of haloalkaliphilic srb based on the assumption that the lactate consumption rate and acetate production rate of db in the presence of nitrate were the same as those in the absence of nitrate we performed mass balance calculation lactate consumed in different positions accounted for 61 7 0 down 79 9 0 middle and 97 0 0 up of total lactate in the presence of nitrate respectively while the percentages were 78 1 88 9 and 97 5 in the absence of nitrate respectively fig s2 furthermore after removing nitrate the decreases in lactate and sulfate concentrations in the down sample connection were 1 77 g l 1 and 398 mg l 1 respectively most importantly according to the stoichiometry zhou and xing 2015 to reduce the 398 mg l 1 sulfate srb only need 746 mg l 1 lactate much lower than the decrease of 1 77 g l 1 this result indicates that lactate metabolism was inhibited by the nitrate stress in the bottom of bioreactor rather than in the up down interval of bioreactor besides after removing nitrate the increase in acetate concentration in the down sample connection was 700 mg l 1 while to reduce 398 mg l 1 sulfate srb only produce 497 mg l 1 acetate accounting for 71 of acetate concentration difference furthermore the amount of sulfate reduced at up down interval only accounted for 37 9 and 22 7 of total reduced sulfate fig s1 most importantly acetate produced at up down interval in the presence of nitrate 2 32 g l 1 was much higher than that in the absence of nitrate 1 51 g l 1 these results indicate that the nitrate addition inhibit activities of not only srb but also other acetogenic bacteria in the bottom of bioreactor our above findings further unravel that nitrate inhibition indeed only exists in the bottom of bioreactor from the perspective of mass balance in summary nitrate inhibited activities of not only srb but also other microorganisms further study showed that prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb however metabolisms of electron donors used for sulfate reduction were inhibited due to the nitrate stress weakening the electron transfer process for relieving the nitrate inhibition on sulfate reduction surprisingly we found that haloalkaliphilic db may play an important role in relieving nitrate inhibition hence how haloalkaliphilic srb and db cope with the nitrate stress and why prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition should be unraveled at transcriptional level 3 5 metatranscriptomic analysis we performed metatranscriptomic analysis to compare gene expression profiles of srb and db between before and after nitrate addition fig 2 as reference for metatranscriptomic analysis clone libraries were constructed to evaluate the highly enriched culture and we obtained highly enriched desulfonatronum sp and desulfonatronovibrio sp fig 1i which was consistent with our previous result revealed by amplicon sequencing zhou et al 2015 changes in gene expression profile were observed fig s3 due to the nitrate exposure more than 84 0 of total degs 5754 6816 fig s4 were down regulated providing transcriptional evidences for that how sulfate reduction processes and metabolisms of electron donors used for sulfate reduction were inhibited however genes of nitrate reduction in db were significantly up regulated supporting our hypothesis that haloalkaliphilic db may play an important role in relieving the inhibition model for sulfate reduction fig 4 i haveman et al 2004 he et al 2006 heidelberg et al 2004 keller et al 2014 keller and wall 2011 zhou et al 2011 at the transcriptional level were demonstrated most of genes involved in sulfate reduction pathway were down regulated table s4 due to the nitrate stress including dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene dsrab it was reported that dsrab has a higher affinity for nitrite than that for sulfite einsiedl 2008 haveman et al 2003 hence due to the presence of competitive inhibitor nitrite sulfite was reduced slowly and accumulated leading to down regulating the upstream genes in sulfate reduction pathway he et al 2006 fig 4i the down regulation of those genes may cause the decrease in sulfate removal efficiency fig 1ii most importantly periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase gene nrfha was also down regulated after nitrate addition in our study the nrfha can compete electrons with other enzymes involved in sulfate reduction haveman et al 2004 he et al 2006 previous study found that most of srb harbored nrfha marietou 2016 which was up regulated when srb were exposed to nitrite to relieve nitrite inhibition hence the up regulation of nrfha has been assumed to be the important way to relieve the nitrate inhibition bell et al 2020 haveman et al 2004 he et al 2010 he et al 2006 korte et al 2015 marietou 2016 zhou et al 2011 the contradiction between our results and the long held opinions may be because 1 the strong stress resistance of haloalkaliphilic srb may make them able to tolerate a certain concentration of nitrate within a short time and 2 haloalkaliphilic db able to coexist well with srb zhou et al 2014b may quickly reduce the nitrate weakening the role of nrfha in reducing nitrate and down regulating the nrfha of srb our above finding and inference raised the question that whether and how haloalkaliphilic db quickly reduce the environmental nitrate relieving the inhibition on srb both sulfate and nitrate reduction processes need electrons via electron transfer chains however srb showed no positive response to relieve this inhibition in our study after nitrate addition genes involved in energy metabolism were differentially down regulated especially for the lactate dehydrogenase ldh formate dehydrogenase fdhcd pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase porab and fumarate reductase genes frdb table s4 however our results were contrary to the previous research on d vulgaris hildenborough that the ldh fdh and porab were up regulated to produce more electrons and protons for nrfha to relieve nitrate inhibition he et al 2010 he et al 2006 this may be because less electrons and protons were needed due to the down regulation of nrfha resulting in the down regulation of those genes the nitrate stress also down regulated the operons for electron transfer involved in sulfate reduction table s4 including menaquinone linked quinone reductase complex qrcbcd quinone interacting membrane bound oxidoreductase complex qmob and dissimilatory sulfite reductase transmembrane complex dsrk table s4 these results are consistent with other studies haveman et al 2004 he et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 however cytochrome c class iii cyca was reported to be up regulated he et al 2006 in d vulgaris hildenborough to transfer more electrons to nrfha and to relieve this inhibition which was also down regulated in haloalkaliphilic srb the above results further indicate that competition between nitrite and sulfate reduction for electrons is not the main reason of nitrate inhibition energy is needed to activate the sulfate reduction process stoeva et al 2020 in response to nitrate stress some changes in energy metabolism of haloalkaliphilic srb also occurred which was consistent with the response of d vulgaris hildenborough he et al 2010 he et al 2006 the significant one was the down regulation of atp synthase genes however the reasons for this down regulation were quite different for d vulgaris hildenborough more electrons and protons were produced most of which in periplasm were used by nrfha to reduce nitrite bell et al 2020 hence transmembrane proton concentration gradient was lowered which cannot drive atp synthase well while fewer electrons and protons were produced in haloalkaliphilic srb decreasing the transmembrane proton concentration gradient according to the above facts that negative performance of srb and the quick reduction of nitrate we are more confident that addition of nitrate activated and strengthened the denitrification pathway in db reducing the environmental nitrate and relieving the nitrate inhibition on srb to find out direct evidences model for nitrate reduction fig 4ii formusa 2015 stein 2020 stewart et al 2012 wallenstein et al 2006 xi et al 2013 at the transcriptional level were demonstrated genes involved in denitrification were significantly up regulated in db table s5 except for cytoplasmic nitrate reductase gene narg which was slightly down regulated most importantly some genes involved in substance and energy metabolisms were induced by the nitrate addition nitrite reductase gene nirs hallin et al 2018 key gene in denitrification was significantly induced nitric oxide reductase c subunit gene norc transferring electrons duarte et al 2014 to norb no n2o was also induced meanwhile the nitrate addition significantly up regulated nitric oxide reductase activation protein gene nord and nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz hallin et al 2018 stein 2020 the above results unravel that 1 nitrate addition activated the denitrification pathway and nitrite can be quickly reduced into n2 and 2 srb passively waited for db to reduce nitrate why prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition 4 conclusions and implications in summary high nitrate concentration can inhibit the activity of haloalkaliphilic srb mass balance analysis showed that nitrate reduction is prior to sulfate reduction with sufficient electron donor prolonging the exposure time can relieve the nitrate inhibition on haloalkaliphilic srb further metatranscriptomic analysis shows that in response to environmental nitrate stress haloalkaliphilic srb show dependency on db apart from heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification ge et al 2020 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium ge et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation wang et al 2021 can also reduce the environmental nitrate nitrite hence the future researches should also focus on 1 roles of other extremophiles in sulfur and nitrogen cycles including the main driving forces and microbially driven mechanisms 2 exploration of detailed and direct interaction between haloalkaliphilic srb and extremophiles 3 successful application of metaproteomics analysis in extreme environments 4 isolation of pure haloalkaliphilic srb and extremophiles for more in depth control studies subsequently we can further unravel the underlying mechanisms for nitrate stress on sulfate reduction and confidently revise the sulfur and nitrogen cycles declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgments this research is financially
