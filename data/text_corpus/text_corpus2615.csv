13075,sustainable recycling of earth abundant transition metals and water overwhelming macroplastics are currently needed to alleviate depletion of resources and risks posed against environmental sustainability and health in this contribution copper metal recovered from an electronic waste was used to fabricate microfloral copper ii oxide cuo particles via an anodized metastable pathway interaction of the latter with hot polysulfone in dimethylsulfoxide dmso led to the formation of a floating photocatalyst via a non solvent phase separation the catalyst was used for the degradation of humic acid and flavonoid dyes in the presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 a light emitting diode led and sunlight a pyramidal triangular model was used to predict the life cycle of h2o2 while an enhanced photocatalytic property was observed after irradiation with light the as synthesized materials showed attractiveness for the degradation of phenolic and carboxylic acid bearing organic pollutants in water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment plastic composite copper oxide photocatalysis microparticles 1 introduction plastics of various dimensions macro micro and nano are problematic towards the sustainability of the aquatic environment due to the threats they posed against the food chain one resolution towards alleviating this challenge is recycling these materials for reuse as adsorbents for water remediation 1 2 catalysts for sustainable material production 3 4 or as a platform for supporting materials capable of promoting degradation or pollutant s removal from aqueous environments however as attractive as this idea may seem the hydrophobicity of many plastics limits their use as adsorbents also certain catalysts of the noble metal class e g gold and platinum are very expensive to generate and apply industrially due to their scarce raw materials and tedious ore processing as a results the degradation performance of the first series transition metal oxide tmo nano microparticles such as those of titanium ti iron fe nickel ni and copper cu whose resources are more earthly available are currently being exploited 5 8 conventionally many approaches such as hydrothermal solvothermal and precipitation are employed to synthesize these materials 9 10 however among these techniques precipitation seems to have gained considerable attention due to its clear chemistry and low energy dispensation for example synthesis of materials can be achieved at room temperature 11 metastable colloidal crystallization a form of precipitation technique has gained attraction recently due to its low cost and relatively minimum energy dispensation conventional methods for generating metastable particles include precipitation in alkaline media followed by heating 12 15 cation exchange 16 and reduction of the metallic salt with a suitable organic substance 17 18 another method is the use of the electrochemical technique 19 the latter has the advantage of low cost synthesis at low temperature and industrial scale up conventional methods of dealing with plastic wastes include landfilling water burdening discharge incineration and recycling 20 21 however while landfills water discharges and direct burning remain a threat to the environment including contribution to poor quality food chain air pollution and climate change plastic s recycling strategy such as pyrolysis under controlled environment or dissolution in a suitable aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide dmf and tetrahydrofuran thf is gaining momentum due to its relatively environmental sustainability advantages such as zero carbon emission and production of functional materials 3 4 as proof of concept a thermoplastic polysulfone was transformed into photocatalytic enabled beads by interacting with electrochemically generated 3d microfloral copper ii oxide cuo particles synthesized via metastable crystallization pathway in a dimethylsulfoxide dmso solution through a non solvent phase separation to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the development of photocatalytic enabled polysulfone plastic beads using microfloral cuo in dmso the composite beads were made to be in contact with organic dyes humic acid in alkaline glucose solution dye a and anthocyanin pigment from grape dye b in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and two light sources led and sunlight to evaluate their fenton like reaction and photocatalytic degradation capability the degradation was monitored chromametrically through observing

the presence of the pristine black particles yellow beads pristine polysulfone showing higher effect than the grayish beads the poor performance of the black particles might be due to the greater absorption of light in the visible and infrared than those of the gray and yellow materials moreover the greater performance of the yellow beads over the grayish beads might be due to their maximum

13076,the bimetallic organic framework mof mil 53 type fe co bdc was facilely synthesized solvo thermally at 100 c fe co bdc the as synthesized fe co bdc was characterized utilizing sem edx pxrd ftir raman xps and bet characterization reveals that fe co bdc particles are octahedron crystalline flexible nanoporous material with remarkable anion exchange ability assessment of its adsorptive anion exchange capability was performed against cr oxyanion as a known terrible contaminant kinetic study via pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso diffusion binding db and weber morris wm models and isotherm study via freundlich and langmuir models applying isoelectric condition were carried out for such assessment the kinetic study disclosed the quickness of cr oxyanion adsorption with significant reversibility prominently the breathing effect is highly suggested to contribute to the adsorption mechanism where an anion exchange event comprises such breathing especially for internal recipient sites isotherm study shows that fe co bdc is of notable capacity towards cr oxyanion 588 mg g 1 and isotherm analysis indicates involvement of more than one mechanism in the adsorption process keywords fe co bdc mil 53 mofs breathing cr vi removal 1 introduction nowadays water pollution is a global environmental concern and extensive research attention has been focused on the removal of pollutants from wastewater 1 one of the highly toxic contaminants is chromium which is reasonably widespread due to its use as an antifouling agent in cooling towers metal plating pigments textiles wood preservation and leather tanning etc 2 consequently its concentration in the environment particularly in water masses has considerably increased during the last three decades 3 chromium has two abundant forms cr iii and cr vi and the hexavalent form is toxic and is assumed to be carcinogenic 4 it affects the human kidney and liver and causes dermatitis and diarrhea 5 according to the who its acceptable levels in surface water bodies are 0 05 ppm and its concentration in industrial wastewaters varies from 0 5 to 270 ppm 6 thus it is important to treat chromium wastewaters various techniques have been implemented for the removal of inorganic metal ions including ion exchange 7 adsorption 8 and photocatalytic degradation 9 ion exchange is considered a cost effective and eco friendly strategy since they usually offer several advantages in terms of sensitivity selectivity and simplicity of operation 10 normally ion exchangers are divided into two categories inorganic and organic types most inorganic ion exchangers such as zeolites and layered double hydroxides depend on small pore sizes for ionic exchange and thus exchange kinetics is slow as well as adsorption capacity is limited 11 although organic exchangers such as sol gel adsorbents and polymer resins are rapid ion exchangers they are not of excellent thermal and chemical stability like inorganic counterparts 12 13 the development of higher performance ion exchangers for water treatment is still a need and a challenge in this work mof is used as an adsorbent mofs are a quite new class of hybrid materials a mof material is composed of metal ions connected by organic linkers and structure of which is characterized as being porous 15 mofs are composed of organic linkers that are bridged between the metal ions or clusters mofs get great attention because of their low densities high surface areas tunable pore size and high porosities 15 mofs have been widely studied in various application areas such as gas separation 16 gas adsorption and storage 17 catalysis 18 adsorption of organic molecules 19 sensing 20 21 and drug delivery 22 one of the most important research areas of mofs is the adsorptive removal of organic and inorganic contaminants their adsorption capabilities have been relatively unexplored compared to the other adsorbents such as activated carbon or zeolites 23 in the adsorption means the regeneration of mofs compared to activated carbon and zeolite which requires high temperatures and cost be likely to require less processing 24 all these advantages make it an excellent adsorbent candidate compared with other porous materials in this study the bimetallic fe co bdc a type of mil 53 was selected as the mof to use this material has been used in the photocatalytic removal of organic contaminants 25 unlike other mofs fe co mil 53 does not have a high surface area however because of its flexible structure it opens its pores only in the presence of guest molecules 26 its structure consists of fe iii co ii oh 1 4 bdc which is a typical class of mofs generated by a combination between fe iii co ii cations and 1 4 dicarboxylic acid 25 although this material does not have a high specific surface area it could be used in various applications such as adsorption of contaminants and toxic gases thanks to the breathing feature or flexible structure the main advantage of using the bimetallic mof based on iron cobalt open metal nodes is to enhance the flexibility of the mof 25 to provide ion exchange with dichromate ion in wastewater the goals of this study are 1 to synthesize and characterize fe co bdc 2 to study adsorption interaction between this mof and dichromate ion in an aqueous solution 3 to understand the adsorption mechanism and adsorption characteristics of dichromate ion onto fe co bdc this work visibly demonstrates the role of the gate opening mechanism for the remarkable increase of porosity and utilizing breathing action for effective and capacitive adsorption 2 experimental 2 1 materials and preparation of fe co bdc iron chloride fecl3 6h2o 98 sigma aldrich cobalt chloride hexahydrate cocl2 6h2o 99 sigma aldrich 1 4 benzene dicarboxylic acid h2bdc 98 sigma aldrich and n n dimethylformamide dmf 98 sigma aldrich were used for the synthesis of fe co bdc potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 99 alfa aesar was used to prepare the synthetic chromium solutions using di water absolute ethanol nacl and naoh all from alfa aesar were used for washing ph adjustment and regeneration purposes samples of fe co bdc were synthesized through sequential addition of fecl3 6h2o 0 135 g 0 5 mmol cocl2 6h2o 0 115 g 0 5 mmol 1 4 benzene dicarboxylic acid h2bdc 0 166 g 1 mmol and acetic acid 1 ml into a beaker where after n n dimethylformamide dmf 20 ml was added until the reagents were completely dissolved 25 the mixture was poured into a closed vial and placed in an oven at 100 c for 6 h the resulting brown powder fe co bdc were recovered by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min and rinsed three times with dmf acetone and water finally the recovered crystals were placed into an oven set at 140 c to dry overnight 2 2

structure ii powder x ray diffraction pxrd shimadzu xd l for crystalline nature iii sem edx zeiss evo 10 microscopy for surface morphology and elemental composition iv the x ray photoelectron spectrum xps was acquired on k alpha thermo fisher scientific usa with a monochromatic al kα 1486 7 ev and v bet analysis n2 adsorption nova station a for surface area determination 2 3 adsorption experiments solutions of different initial concentrations of dichromate were prepared 5 10 25 and 50 ppm by dissolving respective amounts in 50 ml water the batch method was conducted for all adsorption experiments with some conditions were kept fixed i temperature ambient 20 c ii sample agitation rate 100 rpm and iii ph of cr oxyanion solution 5 3 0 02 the isoelectric condition of fe co bdc surface to avoid probable buffering 27 an amount of fe co bdc 0 05 g was used for each adsorption experiment to monitor adsorption propagation for each experiment every 5 min throughout the total period of an hour a liquor sample of 3 ml was withdrawn from the adsorption flask and absorbance was measured for acidic range at λ 375 nm 28 using agilent uv vis cary 60 and then the liquor volume was returned to the flask in this work pfo and pso models were applied to construe the kinetics of experimental data using the customary following linear forms 29 30 pfo ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pso t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t mg g 1 are the adsorbate amounts adsorbed at equilibrium and at any time t respectively andk 1 l min 1 and k 2 g mg min 1 are models rate constants the experimental adsorption capacity at equilibrium q exp mg g 1 was calculated using the following known equation q exp c i c e v m where c i and c e mg l 1 are the initial concentration and concentration at equilibrium v l is the volume of solution and m g is the mass of the adsorbent error in capacity estimation by a model is given according to the following relation q 100 q exp q model q exp linear forms of freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherm models were applied in this work and have the following expression respectively ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 1 q e 1 q o 1 b q o c e where q e mg g 1 is the amount of contaminant adsorbed at equilibrium and ce mg l 1 is the concentration of a contaminant at equilibrium 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization pristine fe co bdc was characterized using sem edx pxrd ftir raman xps and bet further cr oxyanion treated fe co bdc samples were also characterized using pxrd edx ftir raman xps to gain some qualitative understanding of adsorption nature the sem image of fe co bdc shown in fig 1 a elucidates its octahedron morphological shape with particle longitudinal size of about 3 5 μm fig 2 a shows the edx spectrum of fe co bdc and elemental content comprises c o fe and co where their distributions within the sample according to the elemental mapping shown in fig 2 b c d e are of good uniformity and homogeneity and co seems to be randomly distributed within the frameworks 31 the xrd pattern of fe co bdc is shown in fig 1 b the recorded 2θ values are consistent with the single crystal data simulation in the reported literature 25 this suggests that both fe and co are allocated randomly yet equivalently within fe co bdc matrix generally the breathing phenomenon significantly affects the xrd patterns of the phases through changes in the cell volume and symmetry 32 to assess the crystallinity and phase purity of the prepared fe co bdc mof x ray powder diffraction xrd was recorded for the mof before adsorption which demonstrated the characteristic peaks at 2θ 9 3 12 46 16 48 18 72 and 21 76 which well matching with those reported for mil 53 fe mof in previous literature 33 34 the new peak at 10 5 after adsorption samples suggests the breathing effect during the adsorption process where mil 53 transforms from closed pores cp to open pores lp this behavior has been perceived before inflexible mil 53 and is related to the departure of water 35 36 it is worth mentioning here that bimetallic mof offers good flexibility compared to the single metal mof the presence of co in the mil 53 fe structure enhanced the breathing effect during adsorption 37 38 the raman spectrum of the fe co bdc is given in fig 1 c and shows the peaks at 1605 and 1420 cm 1 which are following the stretching modes of the carboxylate group moreover the three peaks at 1140 860 and 629 cm 1 are caused by the formation of a ch bond produced from the benzene ring in the sample the peak at 464 cm 1 could reveal the existence of m o in the structure of fe co bdc the same sample with some consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles is very similar to that of the pristine one this should indicate physical adsorption ftir spectrum of fe co bdc is given in fig 1 d and comprises two strong peaks at 1377 and1585 cm 1 that are associated with the characteristic antisymmetric and symmetric oco stretching frequency vibrations respectively another two peaks at 748 and 3422 cm 1 are also observed due to the ch bonding vibration and the oh stretching mode of the benzene ring respectively further the metal oxygen bond vibration ν m o at 543 cm 1wasobserved to be attributed to the interactions between the carboxyl group of terephthalic acid and fe co atoms 39 fig 3 presents the xps survey spectra of fe co bdc before and after adsorption of cr oxyanions the two spectra are very similar indicating the robustness of the material structure the presence of the principal fe2p co2p c1s and o1s core levels before and after adsorption with relatively similar abundances table 1 proposes the significant chemical stability of fe co bdc during the adsorption desorption process moreover chlorine is observed before adsorption which confirms the presence of cl within fe co bdc matrix as a legitimate part of the structure and this agrees with edx analysis after adsorption the spectrum shows no presence of cl and instead chromium is present which also agrees with edx analysis the observed matching of atomic ratios of fe co and c o before and after adsorption table 1 confirms the successful adsorption without any significant damage in the chemical structure of fe co bdc structure for both the nods and the linkers the in depth analysis of xps results was carried out to profoundly investigate the possible adsorption and substitution mechanism s concerning the removal of dichromate also the possibilities of the breathing action to occur accompanying adsorption and any change in oxidation states during the exchange of chlorine by dichromate were considered the fe2p high resolution xps spectrum of fe co bdc samples are shown in fig 4 a b which display two main peaks in both cases before and after adsorption these peaks were indexed to fe2p1 2 before 711 68 and after 712 08 ev and fe2p3 2 before 725 74 and after 725 9 ev the splitting energy of the 2p doublet 2p1 2 2p3 2 was found to be about 14 ev which is quite similar to the references 40 41 this implies that the valence state of fe in both cases before and after adsorption was iii 42 43 to further confirm the valence state of fe and extract more analysis details in both of these samples the fe2p peaks were fitted into six to seven peaks including gupta and sen gs multiples surface structures and shake up related satellites 44 45 the fitting results as shown in fig 4 a b were indexed well with fe3 gs multiples which confirm that the valence state of fe in the fe co bdc before and after adsorption is iii hence the adsorption process did not imply any significant change in the fe oxidation state interestingly observed a slight shifting in binding energies and the disappearance of satellite peaks at 729 45 ev after adsorption and this may indicate the possibility of having a slight difference within the electronic environment and charge transfer rate around fe3 after adsorption 46 47 two reasons may be proposed to elucidate this significant phenomenon the first is the subtraction of chlorine as it would be discussed later which has a i charge with the substitution by dichromate of ii charge the second may be due to the size and charge differences between infused dichromate and leached chlorine ion which may cause a slight deformation in the bonding structure affecting the electronic environment of the metallic cluster nodes and ligands deconvoluting the cobalt 2p spectrum gives rise to the main significant three peaks fig 4 c d the fitted peaks at the before 782 08 and the after 782 28 ev should be attributed to co2p3 2 of co2 indicating the possibility of having co o contribution 48 49 further the observed peaks around the before 786 11 and the after 785 77 ev and the before 789 02 and the after 789 17 ev could be attributed to co2p3 2 co2 and co2p3 2 of co2 co3 mixed structure 50 51 the shake up satellite observed at the before 792 38 and the after 793 38 ev supports the possibility of having to co2 co3 mixed structure 52 54 moreover the co2p1 2 of co2 co3 and its corresponding shake up satellite are observed around the before 796 98 and the after 795 88 ev and the before 803 28 and after 803 51 ev respectively 55 56 the feature peaks of co2p3 2 and co2p1 2 with multiple splitting energy demonstrates that co exists in two oxidation states ii and iii with the proposed incorporation of co o as oh or ooh species 55 the co2p peak may be shifted to higher energy concerning neat co compounds due to incorporation with fe 57 58 hence and overall it seems that starting co2 ions were partially oxidized into co3 to keep the charge balance with fe3 in the cluster nodes 57 59 these results confirm that co ions may have different coordination environments 60 61 which may allow successive redox electron transfer 62 63 it is worth mentioning that the obtained fe co heterogeneous metal cluster modes with mixed valance may have a superior redox activity which is essential for some catalytic reactions 64 65 the cl2p core level spectral envelope was adequately decomposed into three spin orbit split doublets cl2p3 2 and cl2p1 2 indicating three different electronic environments of chorine fig 4 e the binding energy values for the cl2p3 2 peaks resided at 197 7 ev 199 0 ev and 200 1 ev the first and last suggest the presence of the chloride ion cl 66 and covalent chlorine atom cl 67 68 respectively the chlorine species with intermediate binding energy cl is more appropriately associated with charge transfer interactions between the coordinated chlorine and metal 69 70 however this binding energy contribution may also be referred to free cl ion 71 since cl is mainly bonded coordinated with metallic spices of fe and co which have a mixed oxidation state and significant heterogeneity it was expected to observe this variation of cl components interestingly all chlorine species have completely vanished after the successive adsorption regeneration processes of dichromate after adsorption the newly observed cr2p peaks at 577 78 582 31and 579 65 588 09 ev are attributed to cr iii 72 73 and cr vi species 73 74 respectively fig 4 f this can be ascribed to cr vi in dichromate ions 75 76 as well as those for cr iii most likely as cr oh 3 and cr2o3 77 the observation of cr iii peaks in the xps spectra can be ascribed to either reduction of the cr vi or to previously encountered photoelectron reduction of cr vi to cr iii under the operating conditions of xps analysis 76 78 it is also possible to suppose that there is a partial reduction of cr vi to cr iii occurred on fe co bdc due to its heterogeneous metal cluster nodes with mixed valance with a great possibility of having redox activity 64 65 however attract attention the presence of cr with two oxidation states the starting vi and the developed iii the appearance of the reduced form iii was surprising both fe co bdc nature and adsorption process environment are not expected to be responsible for such reduction however one possibility is that xps measurement is responsible for such reduction 79 80 the deconvoluted c1s spectra consisted of two main peaks before adsorption at 285 1 and 288 8 ev which could be assigned to sp2 sp3 bonds of benzene 81 82 and coo 83 84 respectively fig 4 g h on the other hand after adsorption a new peak is detected at 284 9 ev which could be considered as a split of the first one this phenomenon may be attributed to an abrupt change in bonding energy of cc cc bonds as a direct result of structure deformation transitions or the breathing action it may be assumed that fe co bdc breath dichromate due to adsorption and diffusion and exhale of water and departure of chlorine the deconvoluted o1s also consists of three peaks fig 4 i j the observed peaks at the before 530 98 and after 530 59 ev and the before 533 53 and after 533 48 ev could be assigned to om 85 and oh 85 86 respectively further the co observed band at the before 532 67 and the after 532 08 ev 87 88 showed a significant change after adsorption according to bet analysis and interestingly fe co bdc was found to have a nano pore structure as indicated by n2 sorption isotherms fig 5 b the calculated brunauer emmett teller bet surface area sa value of fe co bdc demonstrated a sa of about 300 m2 g this sa is significantly higher than that of the conventional mil 53 fe which was calculated as 15 m2 g fig 5 a this considerable increase of sa from 15 to 300 m2 g should be attributed to the incorporation of cobalt metal centers 38 the incorporation of cobalt within the frameworks greatly enhances the surface area due to the addition of secondary metal nodes in mil 53 several defects are expected to increase giving rise to increased porosity 89 such significant enhancement of sa is supposed to effectively enhance the adsorption process in addition the hysteresis type shown in fig 5 b is a strong sign of flexibility of fe co bdc 90 pore size distribution psd is shown in fig 5 c and indicates that fe co bdc is nano porous with two main pore types centered at about 1 5 and 1 8 nm which is larger than the dichromate ionic size about 0 65 nm which in turn facilitates adsorption process 3 2 adsorption performance the pristine fe co bdc is discerned comprising chloride fig 6a which should be a substitution of hydroxyl groups 91 such substituent chloride is highly dedicated to exchanging to verify the anion exchange process extra edx analyses have been performed for fe co bdc after cr oxyanion adsorption and again after regeneration by nacl solution fig 6a and b the chloride substituent should be responsible for cr oxyanions removal via an anion exchange mechanism as fig 6b shows after treating pristine fe co bdc with cr oxyanions solution cr comes into view at the complete expense of cl by treating the sample with regenerating nacl 1 m solution for about 1 h cl comes into view again at some expense of cr not shown this is an anion exchange process upon regeneration cl cr oxyanion exchange is not complete due to large size cr oxyanions which may need more time for completeness also lewis s acid base or coordinative interaction between the oxygen of cr oxyanions with unsaturated metal position open metal sites can explain the non completeness of regeneration to the best of our knowledge this is the first anion exchange process present by a mil 35 material the selection of a suitable ph level for an adsorption process is crucial for both the successful removal of the adsorbate and for more understanding of the process zeta potential analysis was performed for fe co bdc applying final ph vs initial ph method and phpzc was found to be about 5 3 92 conditioning adsorption cr oxyanions fe co bdc system at ph 5 3 renders an isoelectric surface of fe co bdc however specifies speciation of cr oxyanions as cr2o7 2 hcro4 and cro4 2 and most of which is cr2o7 2 93 fig 7 shows the change of the adsorbed amount of cr oxyanions q with time for the different initial concentrations for all c i values from the figure it is obvious that a speedy uptake occurred as the immediate steep increase of q occurs within the first period pi stage which extended only 3 5 min and then a period of a relaxed adsorption increase pii stage follows which covers time span that increases with c i the phenomenon of immediate steep increase of q indicates the strong affinity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions which should be reliant on some favoring strong physical chemical interactions with the external surface and abundance of recipient sites this phenomenon has analogous in some previous studies for example 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic was exchanged with cl using mil 101 cr cl mof where the first rapid adsorption stage of that study extended over 100 min from a total adsorption period of 1000 min and about 82 of total uptake has been recorded for the highest applied initial concentration during this period 94 for the pi stage however although q increases with c i the uptake percentage generally decreases reflecting the strong dynamic reversibility of the adsorption process this reversibility is also evident by the same performance of the pii stage where equilibration is maintained eventually the strong dynamic reversibility firmly implies the readiness of fe co bdc structure for anionic exchange noticeable are the endpoints of the pi stage and the start of the pii stage is the same for all c i keeping in mind that the pii stage is responsible for adsorbing of 19 18 23 and 32 of total adsorbed amounts for c i 5 10 25 and 50 ppm respectively no doubt that the recipient sites on the outer surface of fe co bdc particles are limited compared to internal recipient sites and hence pii stage should start earlier for higher c i even if the outer surface of fe co bdc particles is not that limited and the pii stage should be delayed start for higher c i hence the reason for this similarity of starting time of pii stage is that outer recipient sites are very abundant considering the applied concentration range 5 50 ppm and in addition not only the initial concentration cr oxyanions is a driving force but also the fe co bdc material has a strong attractive environment for these anions with very suitable pore size nevertheless the sudden transition from rapid adsorption pi stage to relatively relaxed one pii stage should commence from a significant diffusion exertion besides the general increase of q during the pii stage with c i suggests the importance of diffusion especially for the higher c i values referring to fe co bdc structure the readily cr oxyanions cl exchange can be suggested to take place during the pi stage within the very superficial layers outward migration of cl should be momentous due to proposed weak bonding within fe co bdc matrix and because of its small size compared to that of cr oxyanions after interacting within the very superficial layers cr oxyanions simply migrate inward during the pii stage within fe co bdc channels and gradually replacing cl making use of breathing mode of flexible fe co bdc 95 for effective cr oxyanion cl exchange both the ions have to have the ability to migrate without considerable restraint within fe co bdc matrix which belongs to the mil 53 family whose flexibility originates from the mutual effect of the metal node and the linker molecule 26 it is worth mentioning that fe bdc shows lower adsorption capacity compared to fe co bdc as stated in fig 7 for 25 ppm 70 less in adsorption capacity 3 3 adsorption kinetics and isotherms for further understanding and appropriate assessment of the adsorption process kinetic modelling and isotherm modelling were performed both can lay prominence on the adsorption mechanism pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models are usually applied for studying the communal rate of adsorption these models reflect the chemical and or physical binding interaction s between the solute and the active sites of the adsorbent presenting the dependency of adsorption rate on the available active sites on the surface of the adsorbent concerning solute concentration 96 97 it is not accustomed to applying pfo through stages nevertheless it could be advantageous to apply such a procedure for better understanding the adsorption process fig 8 shows the staged pfo modelling for the different initial concentrations model outputs are summarized in table 2 a brief inspection of table 2 considering the pi stage points to the following i fitting for the pi stage is decidedly accepted due to high values of r 2 ii the modelled q pfo pi value strong positively diverges from q exp pi value i e pfo modelling over estimates q pfo pi with respect to q exp pi as initial concentration increases and this divergence suggests the conformity of pfo adsorption process with low concentrations of cr oxyanions i e external active sites are highly abundant for low concentrations and iii the model estimated rate constants are almost similar around ca 0 33 which is not usual for adsorption processes and this implies that most of the adsorption events occurring during this period should be among the external sites and hence rate constants are very similar which is following basics of kinetic science considering the pii stage fitting is generally less proper compared to that of the pi stage considering values of r 2 and hence adsorption process should not be controlled by cr oxyanions concentration solely q decreases sharply with c i which opposites the expectation of being increasing relation this indicates that the pii stage does not follow the pfo model and or another adsorption mechanism other than exchange contributes the other mechanism could be the coordination of cr oxyanions via oxygen with some unsaturated nodes metals 93 98 also the rate constants k pfo pii are neither similar to those of the pi stage nor have a trend with concentration this also indicates no suitability of the pfo model for the pii stage this is accepted as cr oxyanions in this stage became low enough to affect the rate besides recipient sites generally it could be inferred that pfo model is successful in representing the adsorption process for the pi stage fig 9 shows the pso modelling for the different initial concentrations as always observed for many adsorption systems this model shows a remarkable good fitting for the different concentrations this is a consequence of the ability of the pso model to represent both physical and chemical adsorption processes 99 the model outputs are summarized in table 3 the modelled q psovalues are in good agreement with q exp values as q values infer the model estimated rate constant k pso remarkably decreases regularly with initial concentration which points to the extended capacity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions over the applied concentration range and also points to the reversibility character of the adsorption process that is valid for both chemical and physical processes 99 the change of k pso with c i was also presented in many other works and it was a decreased relation in most cases this relation has been verified experimentally and theoretically 96 pfo and pso models do not describe the role of diffusion mechanisms in adsorption processes 96 hence there is always a need to apply models that consider the diffusion steps that necessarily accompany any adsorption process using porous materials herein the db model was applied according to the staging approach fig 10 shows the db model representation of the experimental data for the different initial concentrations where the selected n 0 55 gave the best fitting 96 97 similar to pfo modelling the two periods pi and pii were considered and the model outputs are summarized in table 4 for the pi stage the good fitting according to r 2 values suggests that a diffusion step contributes during this period even though the period is of very short duration accordingly film diffusion can be suggested to contribute where adsorption occurs on the external surface using the first layer of material where channel opening is not eagerly required and ion exchange occurs with external nodes and hence it can be suggested that fe co bdc surface is of polarized nature the values of q db pi match adequately with the corresponding q exp pi values especially for low concentrations although slight negative divergence is observed as initial concentration increases which are similar to pfo modelling yet with under estimate this divergence type should indicate the dependency of adsorption on cr oxyanions for low concentrations these divergences indicate that both types of modelling are required for the best representation of the removal process the model estimated rate constant k db pi increases regularly with initial concentration which is in agreement with pso modelling and suggests the increase of solute migration under the influence of concentration difference as a driving force 96 100 considering the pii stage fitting is generally less proper compared to that of the pi stage except for 50 ppm case similar to pfo modelling q do not change regularly with c i inferring different diffusion performances also k db piidoes not properly change with c i inferring also different diffusion performances generally it could be inferred that the db model successfully represents the adsorption process for the pi stage considering the wm model fig 11 shows its representation of the experimental data for the different initial concentrations similar to db modelling two stages were considered covering the same periods as for db modelling for the pi stage although r 2 values are very acceptable q wm pi values are inconvenient compared to corresponding q db pi except for c i 50 ppm table 5 however k wm pi value increases regularly with c i same as k db pi supporting the proposal of the importance of film diffusion as db model implies for the pii stage generally r 2 values are acceptable for c i 25 and 50 ppm however the corresponding q wm pii values are far from q exp pii though k wm pii value increases regularly with c i same as k db pi support the proposal of the importance of pore diffusion adsorbent capacity and type of interaction towards certain adsorbates can be determined by studying adsorption the freundlich parameters k f and n are related to the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively the freundlich model considers multilayer adsorption and or more than one binding mechanism considering energy heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface towards the targeted solute q o mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 is related to the energy of adsorption langmuir model assumes saturated monolayer adsorption homogeneous adsorbent surface and inhibition of transmigration of adsorbate on that surface fig 12 a and b presents freundlich and langmuir s modelling of experimental isotherm data respectively table 6 gives the models outputs according to r 2 values both models represent satisfactorily the isotherm which is an indistinct case hence enrolment of more than one mechanism for adsorption should be suggested and departure of water should be considered accordingly obeying the freundlich model presumes the involvement of binding mechanism in addition to anion exchange even of a minor yet effective share and coordination of cr oxyanions via oxygen atoms with positive nodes is the highly probable choice as it is of a similar energetic process 101 another proposal is the strong contribution of diffusion steps with a distinctive energy according to langmuir modelling outputs table 6 the maximum capacity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions is of a sizeable amount 588 mg g 1 and this also indicates the involvement of more than one mechanism compared to other some distinguished selected mofs fe co bdc is highly capacitive towards cr oxyanions as given in comparison table 7 3 4 desorption and reusability of fe co bdc for the possible control of the performance of adsorbent systems regeneration and reusability are important influencing factors the desorption of cr oxyanion could be achieved by using a solution of 1 m nacl in the system to allow ions exchange the results obtained following five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 13 as seen the removal efficiency gradually decreased with higher numbers of regeneration cycles the decrease in removal efficiency may be due to the adsorption sites on the surfaces being damaged or destroyed by multiple adsorption desorption experiments 78 although the removal efficiency was decreased it sustained at a level of 70 for the fifth cycle these results revealed that this new fe co bdc has excellent regeneration and recycling efficiencies 3 5 proposed adsorption mechanism as mentioned above anion exchange and cr oxyanion coordination are the two proposed fixing modes to accommodate cr oxyanion by fe co bdc fe co bdc is flexible 104 and before the commencement of adsorption channels of fe co bdc are occupied by h2o molecules which cause fe co bdc to be of a narrow pore type np 105 hence the adsorption mechanism should comprise in addition to cl exchange and oxyanion binding h2o desorption i e the breathing action should end up with a massive uptake of cr2o7 2 this action can be tentatively envisaged as follows i approach of cr2o7 2 to channel window of fe co bdc ii simultaneous electrostatic interaction between the approaching negative charged guest cr oxyanion and the nodes which stimulate the transition of the np to the large pore type lp that is window opening occurs as linker linker angles balances for lp configuration iii expel of h2o with the infusion of cr oxyanion considering step ii it is evident that the flexibility of mil 53 frameworks depends on the metal node and breathing is a complete cooperative effect of the metal node and linker the μ2 oh groups and their interactions with guest molecules have been identified as one of the key features during the breathing transitions in mil 53 26 106 this gate opening phenomenon has been claimed for the shape of the adsorption isotherm of irmof 1 towards condensed c2h6 and c2h4 guests 107 108 for metal carboxylate organic frameworks the positively charged metal ion is surrounded by negatively charged donor oxygen atoms and a sufficiently strong electric field will deform this unit and induce a local dipole moment or induce deformation of the carboxylate units would also polarize the system 109 it could be said that incorporation of co in mil 53 produces a heterogeneous metal cluster nodes with mixed valance which could lubricate structure for breathing in addition the reversibility of the system can be explained by recalling that adsorption occurs in aqueous medium where the plenty water has to re adsorb and equilibrate with cr oxyanion kinetic study affirms that increasing of cr2o7 2 concentration enhanced electrostatic interactions promoted window opening 106 also the isotherm study substantiates the remarkable high capacity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions a colossal bulk accommodation should be assigned in this case the suggested adsorption breathing mechanism is depicted in fig 14 the fe co bdc changes from closed pores cp to large pores lp upon subjecting to dichromate anions 4 conclusion mechanism of adsorption can be attributed to two steps from the summarized adsorption study in the previous section first ion exchange process through the fast exchange of cl ions with the cr2o7 2 hydrated ions due to the plenty of the well distributed cl on the upper layer of the fe co bdc secondly after fast complete coverage of the bdc interactive surface layer fe co bdc modify its structure to the breathing mode to incubate adequately the adsorbed chromate ions during this process the fe co bdc rearrange of its intermolecular plane structure which attributed in increasing the spacious molecular effect and modify the pores in fe co bdc which confirmed previously with the peak shift in the xrd pattern from 10 1 in fresh prepared fe co bdc has been shifted to 10 8 this consequently creates a chance for further physical adsorption with the rest exist chromium ions in the contaminated solution as appeared in the second pii adsorption isotherm the breathing effect resulted in the co fe positive nodes take effective positions after rearrangement of the orientation of the molecular lattice structure that functionally can attract more chromium ions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13076,the bimetallic organic framework mof mil 53 type fe co bdc was facilely synthesized solvo thermally at 100 c fe co bdc the as synthesized fe co bdc was characterized utilizing sem edx pxrd ftir raman xps and bet characterization reveals that fe co bdc particles are octahedron crystalline flexible nanoporous material with remarkable anion exchange ability assessment of its adsorptive anion exchange capability was performed against cr oxyanion as a known terrible contaminant kinetic study via pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso diffusion binding db and weber morris wm models and isotherm study via freundlich and langmuir models applying isoelectric condition were carried out for such assessment the kinetic study disclosed the quickness of cr oxyanion adsorption with significant reversibility prominently the breathing effect is highly suggested to contribute to the adsorption mechanism where an anion exchange event comprises such breathing especially for internal recipient sites isotherm study shows that fe co bdc is of notable capacity towards cr oxyanion 588 mg g 1 and isotherm analysis indicates involvement of more than one mechanism in the adsorption process keywords fe co bdc mil 53 mofs breathing cr vi removal 1 introduction nowadays water pollution is a global environmental concern and extensive research attention has been focused on the removal of pollutants from wastewater 1 one of the highly toxic contaminants is chromium which is reasonably widespread due to its use as an antifouling agent in cooling towers metal plating pigments textiles wood preservation and leather tanning etc 2 consequently its concentration in the environment particularly in water masses has considerably increased during the last three decades 3 chromium has two abundant forms cr iii and cr vi and the hexavalent form is toxic and is assumed to be carcinogenic 4 it affects the human kidney and liver and causes dermatitis and diarrhea 5 according to the who its acceptable levels in surface water bodies are 0 05 ppm and its concentration in industrial wastewaters varies from 0 5 to 270 ppm 6 thus it is important to treat chromium wastewaters various techniques have been implemented for the removal of inorganic metal ions including ion exchange 7 adsorption 8 and photocatalytic degradation 9 ion exchange is considered a cost effective and eco friendly strategy since they usually offer several advantages in terms of sensitivity selectivity and simplicity of operation 10 normally ion exchangers are divided into two categories inorganic and organic types most inorganic ion exchangers such as zeolites and layered double hydroxides depend on small pore sizes for ionic exchange and thus exchange kinetics is slow as well as adsorption capacity is limited 11 although organic exchangers such as sol gel adsorbents and polymer resins are rapid ion exchangers they are not of excellent thermal and chemical stability like inorganic counterparts 12 13 the development of higher performance ion exchangers for water treatment is still a need and a challenge in this work mof is used as an adsorbent mofs are a quite new class of hybrid materials a mof material is composed of metal ions connected by organic linkers and structure of which is characterized as being porous 15 mofs are composed of organic linkers that are bridged between the metal ions or clusters mofs get great attention because of their low densities high surface areas tunable pore size and high porosities 15 mofs have been widely studied in various application areas such as gas separation 16 gas adsorption and storage 17 catalysis 18 adsorption of organic molecules 19 sensing 20 21 and drug delivery 22 one of the most important research areas of mofs is the adsorptive removal of organic and inorganic contaminants their adsorption capabilities have been relatively unexplored compared to the other adsorbents such as activated carbon or zeolites 23 in the adsorption means the regeneration of mofs compared to activated carbon and zeolite which requires high temperatures and cost be likely to require less processing 24 all these advantages make it an excellent adsorbent candidate compared with other porous materials in this study the bimetallic fe co bdc a type of mil 53 was selected as the mof to use this material has been used in the photocatalytic removal of organic contaminants 25 unlike other mofs fe co mil 53 does not have a high surface area however because of its flexible structure it opens its pores only in the presence of guest molecules 26 its structure consists of fe iii co ii oh 1 4 bdc which is a typical class of mofs generated by a combination between fe iii co ii cations and 1 4 dicarboxylic acid 25 although this material does not have a high specific surface area it could be used in various applications such as adsorption of contaminants and toxic gases thanks to the breathing feature or flexible structure the main advantage of using the bimetallic mof based on iron cobalt open metal nodes is to enhance the flexibility of the mof 25 to provide ion exchange with dichromate ion in wastewater the goals of this study are 1 to synthesize and characterize fe co bdc 2 to study adsorption interaction between this mof and dichromate ion in an aqueous solution 3 to understand the adsorption mechanism and adsorption characteristics of dichromate ion onto fe co bdc this work visibly demonstrates the role of the gate opening mechanism for the remarkable increase of porosity and utilizing breathing action for effective and capacitive adsorption 2 experimental 2 1 materials and preparation of fe co bdc iron chloride fecl3 6h2o 98 sigma aldrich cobalt chloride hexahydrate cocl2 6h2o 99 sigma aldrich 1 4

dimethylformamide dmf 20 ml was added until the reagents were completely dissolved 25 the mixture was poured into a closed vial and placed in an oven at 100 c for 6 h the resulting brown powder fe co bdc were recovered by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min and rinsed three times with dmf acetone and water finally the recovered crystals were placed into an oven set at 140 c to dry overnight 2 2 characterization of fe co bdc the synthesized fe co bdc was characterized using several techniques i ftir kbr pellet method using jasco ft ir 4100 and raman model sentera bruker germany for chemical

solutions of different initial concentrations of dichromate were prepared 5 10 25 and 50 ppm by dissolving respective amounts in 50 ml water the batch method was conducted for all adsorption experiments with some conditions were kept fixed i temperature ambient 20 c ii sample agitation rate 100 rpm and iii ph of cr oxyanion solution 5 3 0 02 the isoelectric condition of fe co bdc surface to avoid probable buffering 27 an amount of fe co bdc 0 05 g was used for each adsorption experiment to monitor adsorption propagation for each experiment every 5 min throughout the total period of an hour a liquor sample of 3 ml was withdrawn from the adsorption flask and absorbance was measured for acidic range at λ 375 nm 28 using agilent uv vis cary 60 and then the liquor volume was returned to the flask in this work pfo and pso models were applied to construe the kinetics of experimental data using the customary following linear forms 29 30 pfo ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pso t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t mg g 1 are the adsorbate amounts adsorbed at equilibrium and at any time t respectively andk 1 l min 1 and k 2 g mg min 1 are models rate constants the experimental adsorption

the volume of solution and m g is the mass of the adsorbent error in capacity estimation by a model is given according to the following relation q 100 q exp q model q exp linear forms of freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherm models were applied in this work and have the following expression respectively ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 1 q e 1 q o 1 b q o c e where q e mg g 1 is the amount of contaminant adsorbed at equilibrium and ce mg l 1 is the concentration of a contaminant at equilibrium 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization pristine fe co bdc was characterized using sem edx pxrd ftir raman xps and bet further cr oxyanion treated fe co bdc samples were also characterized using pxrd edx ftir raman xps to gain some qualitative understanding of adsorption nature the sem image of fe co bdc shown in fig 1 a elucidates its octahedron morphological shape with particle longitudinal size of about 3 5 μm fig 2 a shows the edx spectrum of fe co bdc and elemental content comprises c o fe and co where their distributions within the sample according to the elemental mapping shown in fig 2 b c d e are of good uniformity and homogeneity and co seems to be randomly distributed within the frameworks 31 the xrd pattern of fe co bdc is shown in fig 1 b the recorded 2θ values are consistent with the single crystal data simulation in the reported literature 25 this suggests that both fe and co are allocated randomly yet equivalently within fe co bdc matrix generally the breathing phenomenon significantly affects the xrd patterns of the phases through changes in the cell volume and symmetry 32 to assess the crystallinity and phase purity of the prepared fe co bdc mof x ray powder diffraction xrd was recorded for the mof before adsorption which demonstrated the characteristic peaks at 2θ 9 3 12 46 16 48 18 72 and 21 76 which well matching with those reported for mil 53 fe mof in previous literature 33 34 the new peak at 10 5 after adsorption samples suggests the breathing effect during the adsorption process where mil 53 transforms from closed pores cp to open pores lp this behavior has been perceived before inflexible mil 53 and is related to the departure of water 35 36 it is worth mentioning here that bimetallic mof offers good flexibility compared to the single metal mof the presence of co in the mil 53 fe structure enhanced the breathing effect during adsorption 37 38 the raman spectrum of the fe co bdc is given in fig 1 c and shows the peaks at 1605 and 1420 cm 1 which are following the stretching modes of the carboxylate group moreover the three peaks at 1140 860 and 629 cm 1 are caused by the formation of a ch bond produced from the benzene ring in the sample the peak at 464 cm 1 could reveal the existence of m o in the structure of fe co bdc the same sample with some consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles is very similar to that of the pristine one this should indicate physical adsorption ftir spectrum of fe co bdc is given in fig 1 d and comprises two strong peaks at 1377 and1585 cm 1 that are associated with the characteristic antisymmetric and symmetric oco stretching frequency vibrations respectively another two peaks at 748 and 3422 cm 1 are also observed due to the ch bonding vibration and the oh stretching mode of the benzene ring respectively further the metal oxygen bond vibration ν m o at 543 cm 1wasobserved to be attributed to the interactions between the carboxyl group of terephthalic acid and fe co atoms 39 fig 3 presents the xps survey spectra of fe co bdc before and after adsorption of cr oxyanions the two spectra are very similar indicating the robustness of the material structure the presence of the principal fe2p co2p c1s and o1s core levels before and after adsorption with relatively similar abundances table 1 proposes the significant chemical stability of fe co bdc during the adsorption desorption process moreover chlorine is observed before adsorption which confirms the presence of cl within fe co bdc matrix as a legitimate part of the structure and this agrees with edx analysis after adsorption the spectrum shows no presence of cl and instead chromium is present which also agrees with edx analysis the observed matching of atomic ratios of fe co and c o before and after adsorption table 1 confirms the successful adsorption without any significant damage in the chemical structure of fe co bdc structure for both the nods and the linkers the in depth analysis of xps results was carried out to profoundly investigate the possible adsorption and substitution mechanism s concerning the removal of dichromate also the possibilities of the breathing action to occur accompanying adsorption and any change in oxidation states during the exchange of chlorine by dichromate were considered the fe2p high resolution xps spectrum of fe co bdc samples are shown in fig 4 a b which display two main peaks in both cases before and after adsorption these peaks were indexed to fe2p1 2 before 711 68 and after 712 08 ev and fe2p3 2 before 725 74 and after 725 9 ev the splitting energy of the 2p doublet 2p1 2 2p3 2 was found to be about 14 ev which is quite similar to the references 40 41 this implies that the valence state of fe in both cases before and after adsorption was iii 42 43 to further confirm the valence state of fe and extract more analysis details in both of these samples the fe2p peaks were fitted into six to seven peaks including gupta and sen gs multiples surface structures and shake up related satellites 44 45 the fitting results as shown in fig 4 a b were indexed well with fe3 gs multiples which confirm that the valence state of fe in the fe co bdc before and after adsorption is iii hence the adsorption process did not imply any significant change in the fe oxidation state interestingly observed a slight shifting in binding energies and the disappearance of satellite peaks at 729 45 ev after adsorption and this may indicate the possibility of having a slight difference within the electronic environment and charge transfer rate around fe3 after adsorption 46 47 two reasons may be proposed to elucidate this significant phenomenon the first is the subtraction of chlorine as it would be discussed later which has a i charge with the substitution by dichromate of ii charge the second may be due to the size and charge differences between infused dichromate and leached chlorine ion which may cause a slight deformation in the bonding structure affecting the electronic environment of the metallic cluster nodes and ligands deconvoluting the cobalt 2p spectrum gives rise to the main significant three peaks fig 4 c d the fitted peaks at the before 782 08 and the after 782 28 ev should be attributed to co2p3 2 of co2 indicating the possibility of having co o contribution 48 49 further the observed peaks around the before 786 11 and the after 785 77 ev and the before 789 02 and the after 789 17 ev could be attributed to co2p3 2 co2 and co2p3 2 of co2 co3 mixed structure 50 51 the shake up satellite observed at the before 792 38 and the after 793 38 ev supports the possibility of having to co2 co3 mixed structure 52 54 moreover the co2p1 2 of co2 co3 and its corresponding shake up satellite are observed around the before 796 98 and the after 795 88 ev and the before 803 28 and after 803 51 ev respectively 55 56 the feature peaks of co2p3 2 and co2p1 2 with multiple splitting energy demonstrates that co exists in two oxidation states ii and iii with the proposed incorporation of co o as oh or ooh species 55 the co2p peak may be shifted to higher energy concerning neat co compounds due to incorporation with fe 57 58 hence and overall it seems that starting co2 ions were partially oxidized into co3 to keep the charge balance with fe3 in the cluster nodes 57 59 these results confirm that co ions may have different coordination environments 60 61 which may allow successive redox electron transfer 62 63 it is worth mentioning that the obtained fe co heterogeneous metal cluster modes with mixed valance may have a superior redox activity which is essential for some catalytic reactions 64 65 the cl2p core level spectral envelope was adequately decomposed into three spin orbit split doublets cl2p3 2 and cl2p1 2 indicating three different electronic environments of chorine fig 4 e the binding energy values for the cl2p3 2 peaks resided at 197 7 ev 199 0 ev and 200 1 ev the first and last suggest the presence of the chloride ion cl 66 and covalent chlorine atom cl 67 68 respectively the chlorine species with intermediate binding energy cl is more appropriately associated with charge transfer interactions between the coordinated chlorine and metal 69 70 however this binding energy contribution may also be referred to free cl ion 71 since cl is mainly bonded coordinated with metallic spices of fe and co which have a mixed oxidation state and significant heterogeneity it was expected to observe this variation of cl components interestingly all chlorine species have completely vanished after the successive adsorption regeneration processes of dichromate after adsorption the newly observed cr2p peaks at 577 78 582 31and 579 65 588 09 ev are attributed to cr iii 72 73 and cr vi species 73 74 respectively fig 4 f this can be ascribed to cr vi in dichromate ions 75 76 as well as those for cr iii most likely as cr oh 3 and cr2o3 77 the observation of cr iii peaks in the xps spectra can be ascribed to either reduction of the cr vi or to previously encountered photoelectron reduction of cr vi to cr iii under the operating conditions of xps analysis 76 78 it is also possible to suppose that there is a partial reduction of cr vi to cr iii occurred on fe co bdc due to its heterogeneous metal cluster nodes with mixed valance with a great possibility of having redox activity 64 65 however attract attention the presence of cr with two oxidation states the starting vi and the developed iii the appearance of the reduced form iii was surprising both fe co bdc nature and adsorption process environment are not expected to be responsible for such reduction however one possibility is that xps measurement is responsible for such reduction 79 80 the deconvoluted c1s spectra consisted of two main peaks before adsorption at 285 1 and 288 8 ev which could be assigned to sp2 sp3 bonds of benzene 81 82 and coo 83 84 respectively fig 4 g h on the other hand after adsorption a new peak is detected at 284 9 ev which could be considered as a split of the first one this phenomenon may be attributed to an abrupt change in bonding energy of cc cc bonds as a direct result of structure deformation transitions or the breathing action it may be assumed that fe co bdc breath dichromate due to adsorption and diffusion and exhale of water and departure of chlorine the deconvoluted o1s also consists of three peaks fig 4 i j the observed peaks at the before 530 98 and after 530 59 ev and the before 533 53 and after 533 48 ev could be assigned to om 85 and oh 85 86 respectively further the co observed band at the before 532 67 and the after 532 08 ev 87 88 showed a significant change after adsorption according to bet analysis and interestingly fe co bdc was found to have a nano pore structure as indicated by n2 sorption isotherms fig 5 b the calculated brunauer emmett teller bet surface area sa value of fe co bdc demonstrated a sa of about 300 m2 g this sa is significantly higher than that of the conventional mil 53 fe which was calculated as 15 m2 g fig 5 a this considerable increase of sa from 15 to 300 m2 g should be attributed to the incorporation of cobalt metal centers 38 the incorporation of cobalt within the frameworks greatly enhances the surface area due to the addition of secondary metal nodes in mil 53 several defects are expected to increase giving rise to increased porosity 89 such significant enhancement of sa is supposed to effectively enhance the adsorption process in addition the hysteresis type shown in fig 5 b is a strong sign of flexibility of fe co bdc 90 pore size distribution psd is shown in fig 5 c and indicates that fe co bdc is nano porous with two main pore types centered at about 1 5 and 1 8 nm which is larger than the dichromate ionic size about 0 65 nm which in turn facilitates adsorption process 3 2 adsorption performance the pristine fe co bdc is discerned comprising chloride fig 6a which should be a substitution of hydroxyl groups 91 such substituent chloride is highly dedicated to exchanging to verify the anion exchange process extra edx analyses have been performed for fe co bdc after cr oxyanion adsorption and again after regeneration by nacl solution fig 6a and b the chloride substituent should be responsible for cr oxyanions removal via an anion exchange mechanism as fig 6b shows after treating pristine fe co bdc with cr oxyanions solution cr comes into view at the complete expense of cl by treating the sample with regenerating nacl 1 m solution for about 1 h cl comes into view again at some expense of cr not shown this is an anion exchange process upon regeneration cl cr oxyanion exchange is not complete due to large size cr oxyanions which may need more time for completeness also lewis s acid base or coordinative interaction between the oxygen of cr oxyanions with unsaturated metal position open metal sites can explain the non completeness of regeneration to the best of our knowledge this is the first anion exchange process present by a mil 35 material the selection of a suitable ph level for an adsorption process is crucial for both the successful removal of the adsorbate and for more understanding of the process zeta potential analysis was performed for fe co bdc applying final ph vs initial ph method and phpzc was found to be about 5 3 92 conditioning adsorption cr oxyanions fe co bdc system at ph 5 3 renders an isoelectric surface of fe co bdc however specifies speciation of cr oxyanions as cr2o7 2 hcro4 and cro4 2 and most of which is cr2o7 2 93 fig 7 shows the change of the adsorbed amount of cr oxyanions q with time for the different initial concentrations for all c i values from the figure it is obvious that a speedy uptake occurred as the immediate steep increase of q occurs within the first period pi stage which extended only 3 5 min and then a period of a relaxed adsorption increase pii stage follows which covers time span that increases with c i the phenomenon of immediate steep increase of q indicates the strong affinity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions which should be reliant on some favoring strong physical chemical interactions with the external surface and abundance of recipient sites this phenomenon has analogous in some previous studies for example 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic was exchanged with cl using mil 101 cr cl mof where the first rapid adsorption stage of that study extended over 100 min from a total adsorption period of 1000 min and about 82 of total uptake has been recorded for the highest applied initial concentration during this period 94 for the pi stage however although q increases with c i the uptake percentage generally decreases reflecting the strong dynamic reversibility of the adsorption process this reversibility is also evident by the same performance of the pii stage where equilibration is maintained eventually the strong dynamic reversibility firmly implies the readiness of fe co bdc structure for anionic exchange noticeable are the endpoints of the pi stage and the start of the pii stage is the same for all c i keeping in mind that the pii stage is responsible for adsorbing of 19 18 23 and 32 of total adsorbed amounts for c i 5 10 25 and 50 ppm respectively no doubt that the recipient sites on the outer surface of fe co bdc particles are limited compared to internal recipient sites and hence pii stage should start earlier for higher c i even if the outer surface of fe co bdc particles is not that limited and the pii stage should be delayed start for higher c i hence the reason for this similarity of starting time of pii stage is that outer recipient sites are very abundant considering the applied concentration range 5 50 ppm and in addition not only the initial concentration cr oxyanions is a driving force but also the fe co bdc material has a strong attractive environment for these anions with very suitable pore size nevertheless the sudden transition from rapid adsorption pi stage to relatively relaxed one pii stage should commence from a significant diffusion exertion besides the general increase of q during the pii stage with c i suggests the importance of diffusion especially for the higher c i values referring to fe co bdc structure the readily cr oxyanions cl exchange can be suggested to take place during the pi stage within the very superficial layers outward migration of cl should be momentous due to proposed weak bonding within fe co bdc matrix and because of its small size compared to that of cr oxyanions after interacting within the very superficial layers cr oxyanions simply migrate inward during the pii stage within fe co bdc channels and gradually replacing cl making use of breathing mode of flexible fe co bdc 95 for effective cr oxyanion cl exchange both the ions have to have the ability to migrate without considerable restraint within fe co bdc matrix which belongs to the mil 53 family whose flexibility originates from the mutual effect of the metal node and the linker molecule 26 it is worth mentioning that fe bdc shows lower adsorption capacity compared to fe co bdc as stated in fig 7 for 25 ppm 70 less in adsorption capacity 3 3 adsorption kinetics and isotherms for further understanding and appropriate assessment of the adsorption process kinetic modelling and isotherm modelling were performed both can lay prominence on the adsorption mechanism pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models are usually applied for studying the communal rate of adsorption these models reflect the chemical and or physical binding interaction s between the solute and the active sites of the adsorbent presenting the dependency of adsorption rate on the available active sites on the surface of the adsorbent concerning solute concentration 96 97 it is not accustomed to applying pfo through stages nevertheless it could be advantageous to apply such a procedure for better understanding the adsorption process fig 8 shows the staged pfo modelling for the different initial concentrations model outputs are summarized in table 2 a brief inspection of table 2 considering the pi stage points to the following i fitting for the pi stage is decidedly accepted due to high values of r 2 ii the modelled q pfo pi value strong positively diverges from q exp pi value i e pfo modelling over estimates q pfo pi with respect to q exp pi as initial concentration increases and this divergence suggests the conformity of pfo adsorption process with low concentrations of cr oxyanions i e external active sites are highly abundant for low concentrations and iii the model estimated rate constants are almost similar around ca 0 33 which is not usual for adsorption processes and this implies that most of the adsorption events occurring during this period should be among the external sites and hence rate constants are very similar which is following basics of kinetic science considering the pii stage fitting is generally less proper compared to that of the pi stage considering values of r 2 and hence adsorption process should not be controlled by cr oxyanions concentration solely q decreases sharply with c i which opposites the expectation of being increasing relation this indicates that the pii stage does not follow the pfo model and or another adsorption mechanism other than exchange contributes the other mechanism could be the coordination of cr oxyanions via oxygen with some unsaturated nodes metals 93 98 also the rate constants k pfo pii are neither similar to those of the pi stage nor have a trend with concentration this also indicates no suitability of the pfo model for the pii stage this is accepted as cr oxyanions in this stage became low enough to affect the rate besides recipient sites generally it could be inferred that pfo model is successful in representing the adsorption process for the pi stage fig 9 shows the pso modelling for the different initial concentrations as always observed for many adsorption systems this model shows a remarkable good fitting for the different concentrations this is a consequence of the ability of the pso model to represent both physical and chemical adsorption processes 99 the model outputs are summarized in table 3 the modelled q psovalues are in good agreement with q exp values as q values infer the model estimated rate constant k pso remarkably decreases regularly with initial concentration which points to the extended capacity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions over the applied concentration range and also points to the reversibility character of the adsorption process that is valid for both chemical and physical processes 99 the change of k pso with c i was also presented in many other works and it was a decreased relation in most cases this relation has been verified experimentally and theoretically 96 pfo and pso models do not describe the role of diffusion mechanisms in adsorption processes 96 hence there is always a need to apply models that consider the diffusion steps that necessarily accompany any adsorption process using porous materials herein the db model was applied according to the staging approach fig 10 shows the db model representation of the experimental data for the different initial concentrations where the selected n 0 55 gave the best fitting 96 97 similar to pfo modelling the two periods pi and pii were considered and the model outputs are summarized in table 4 for the pi stage the good fitting according to r 2 values suggests that a diffusion step contributes during this period even though the period is of very short duration accordingly film diffusion can be suggested to contribute where adsorption occurs on the external surface using the first layer of material where channel opening is not eagerly required and ion exchange occurs with external nodes and hence it can be suggested that fe co bdc surface is of polarized nature the values of q db pi match adequately with the corresponding q exp pi values especially for low concentrations although slight negative divergence is observed as initial concentration increases which are similar to pfo modelling yet with under estimate this divergence type should indicate the dependency of adsorption on cr oxyanions for low concentrations these divergences indicate that both types of modelling are required for the best representation of the removal process the model estimated rate constant k db pi increases regularly with initial concentration which is in agreement with pso modelling and suggests the increase of solute migration under the influence of concentration difference as a driving force 96 100 considering the pii stage fitting is generally less proper compared to that of the pi stage except for 50 ppm case similar to pfo modelling q do not change regularly with c i inferring different diffusion performances also k db piidoes not properly change with c i inferring also different diffusion performances generally it could be inferred that the db model successfully represents the adsorption process for the pi stage considering the wm model fig 11 shows its representation of the experimental data for the different initial concentrations similar to db modelling two stages were considered covering the same periods as for db modelling for the pi stage although r 2 values are very acceptable q wm pi values are inconvenient compared to corresponding q db pi except for c i 50 ppm table 5 however k wm pi value increases regularly with c i same as k db pi supporting the proposal of the importance of film diffusion as db model implies for the pii stage generally r 2 values are acceptable for c i 25 and 50 ppm however the corresponding q wm pii values are far from q exp pii though k wm pii value increases regularly with c i same as k db pi support the proposal of the importance of pore diffusion adsorbent capacity and type of interaction towards certain adsorbates can be determined by studying adsorption the freundlich parameters k f and n are related to the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively the freundlich model considers multilayer adsorption and or more than one binding mechanism considering energy heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface towards the targeted solute q o mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 is related to the energy of adsorption langmuir model assumes saturated monolayer adsorption homogeneous adsorbent surface and inhibition of transmigration of adsorbate on that surface fig 12 a and b presents freundlich and langmuir s modelling of experimental isotherm data respectively table 6 gives the models outputs according to r 2 values both models represent satisfactorily the isotherm which is an indistinct case hence enrolment of more than one mechanism for adsorption should be suggested and departure of water should be considered accordingly obeying the freundlich model presumes the involvement of binding mechanism in addition to anion exchange even of a minor yet effective share and coordination of cr oxyanions via oxygen atoms with positive nodes is the highly probable choice as it is of a similar energetic process 101 another proposal is the strong contribution of diffusion steps with a distinctive energy according to langmuir modelling outputs table 6 the maximum capacity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions is of a sizeable amount 588 mg g 1 and this also indicates the involvement of more than one mechanism compared to other some distinguished selected mofs fe co bdc is highly capacitive towards cr oxyanions as given in comparison table 7 3 4 desorption and reusability of fe co bdc for the possible control of the performance of adsorbent systems regeneration and reusability are important influencing factors the desorption of cr oxyanion could be achieved by using a solution of 1 m nacl in the system to allow ions exchange the results obtained following five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 13 as seen the removal efficiency gradually decreased with higher numbers of regeneration cycles the decrease in removal efficiency may be due to the adsorption sites on the surfaces being damaged or destroyed by multiple adsorption desorption experiments 78 although the removal efficiency was decreased it sustained at a level of 70 for the fifth cycle these results revealed that this new fe co bdc has excellent regeneration and recycling efficiencies 3 5 proposed adsorption mechanism as mentioned above anion exchange and cr oxyanion coordination are the two proposed fixing modes to accommodate cr oxyanion by fe co bdc fe co bdc is flexible 104 and before the commencement of adsorption channels of fe co bdc are occupied by h2o molecules which cause fe co bdc to be of a narrow pore type np 105 hence the adsorption mechanism should comprise in addition to cl exchange and oxyanion binding h2o desorption i e the breathing action should end up with a massive uptake of cr2o7 2 this action can be tentatively envisaged as follows i approach of cr2o7 2 to channel window of fe co bdc ii simultaneous electrostatic interaction between the approaching negative charged guest cr oxyanion and the nodes which stimulate the transition of the np to the large pore type lp that is window opening occurs as linker linker angles balances for lp configuration iii expel of h2o with the infusion of cr oxyanion considering step ii it is evident that the flexibility of mil 53 frameworks depends on the metal node and breathing is a complete cooperative effect of the metal node and linker the μ2 oh groups and their interactions with guest molecules have been identified as one of the key features during the breathing transitions in mil 53 26 106 this gate opening phenomenon has been claimed for the shape of the adsorption isotherm of irmof 1 towards condensed c2h6 and c2h4 guests 107 108 for metal carboxylate organic frameworks the positively charged metal ion is surrounded by negatively charged donor oxygen atoms and a sufficiently strong electric field will deform this unit and induce a local dipole moment or induce deformation of the carboxylate units would also polarize the system 109 it could be said that incorporation of co in mil 53 produces a heterogeneous metal cluster nodes with mixed valance which could lubricate structure for breathing in addition the reversibility of the system can be explained by recalling that adsorption occurs in aqueous medium where the plenty water has to re adsorb and equilibrate with cr oxyanion kinetic study affirms that increasing of cr2o7 2 concentration enhanced electrostatic interactions promoted window opening 106 also the isotherm study substantiates the remarkable high capacity of fe co bdc towards cr oxyanions a colossal bulk accommodation should be assigned in this case the suggested adsorption breathing mechanism is depicted in fig 14 the fe co bdc changes from closed pores cp to large pores lp upon subjecting to dichromate anions 4 conclusion mechanism of adsorption can be attributed to two steps from the summarized adsorption study in the previous section first ion exchange process through the fast exchange of cl ions with the cr2o7 2 hydrated ions due to the plenty of the well distributed cl on the upper layer of the fe co bdc secondly after fast complete coverage of the bdc interactive surface layer fe co bdc modify its structure to the breathing mode to incubate adequately the adsorbed chromate ions during this process the fe co bdc rearrange of its intermolecular plane structure which attributed in increasing the spacious molecular effect and modify the pores in fe co bdc which confirmed previously with the peak shift in the xrd pattern from 10 1 in fresh prepared fe co bdc has been shifted to 10 8 this consequently creates a chance for further physical adsorption with the rest exist chromium ions in the contaminated solution as appeared in the second pii adsorption isotherm the breathing effect resulted in the co fe positive nodes take effective positions after rearrangement of the orientation of the molecular lattice structure that functionally can attract more chromium ions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13077,removal of noxious dyes and oils from the modern day industrial discharges is compulsory to safeguard humans aquatic organisms and water quality and to prevent ecological damages induced by pollutants the underscored problems were addressed by one pot fabrication of sodium alginate grafted poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formamide sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel the hydrogel swelled in water up to 7665 due to water absorption through fickian diffusion the smart hydrogel efficiently performed sorption of methylene green mg from aqueous solution owing to outstanding swelling potential and electrostatic interactions the maximum sorption potency of the adsorbent reached to 1915 mg g 1 with excellent removal at 5 and 11 ph values the mg sorption followed pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models thus indicating chemisorption of cationic mg onto anionic sorbent due to the development of electrostatic bond the used sa g p aac co vfa mg sorbent was tested for oil toluene as oil probe separation from its aqueous emulsion the material exhibited 94 separation efficiency toward toluene eradication which remained unchanged for five successive runs the remarkable swelling and sorption potencies of the hydrogel coupled with the outstanding toluene separation efficiency of the mg sorbed hydrogel make the subject hydrogel a versatile material for relevant industrial and environmental applications keywords hydrogel fickian diffusion batch adsorption kinetics oil separation 1 introduction the increment in global population at alarming pace has led to rapid industrialization consequently more industrial effluents are directly discharged into the water bodies which are laden with noxious pollutants including dyes and oils 1 4 the toxic dyes badly affect aquatic life and human health in addition to worsening water quality due to their carcinogenic non biodegradable and teratogenic nature 5 7 likewise the oil and greases in wastewater are carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans besides causing ecological damages for aquatic life 8 9 thus eradication of toxic dyes and insoluble oil from water reservoirs is highly desirable to protect humans aquatic life and water bodies from their noxious effects 10 11 but elimination of both the pollutants by means of single approach is difficult owing to significant differences in their properties under aquatic environment 12 therefore the development of versatile materials for removal of the subject pollutants may have enormous practical significance 13 14 among a variety of water purification techniques 15 adsorption is preferred for dyes eradication due to simple design facile operation promising efficiency incredible versatility and cost effectiveness 16 10 17 presently the application of polymeric hydrogels for sorptive elimination of dyes is a hot research topic due to their fast fabrication environment friendliness economic viability rapid sorption and regeneration cycles 18 20 hydrogels are smart materials formed by extensive crosslinking of hydrophilic polymer chains in three dimensions 21 22 these intelligent materials have been widely applied in different domains including agriculture 23 drug delivery 24 tissue engineering 25 solid surface repairing 26 and wastewater treatment 27 14 in adsorption a plethora of polyacrylic acid co acrylamides hydrogels have been developed which displayed excellent swelling and consequent sorption potencies toward dyes eradication 28 30 but the usage of acrylamide for the hydrogel fabrication is the prime concern of environmental scientists due to its toxic and carcinogenic nature 31 the accidental release disposal of the toxic acrylamide monomers may seriously contaminate water owing to their water soluble nature in addition the persistence of unreacted acrylamide in the hydrogel backbone may also contaminate water during wastewater treatment thus n vinylformamide was applied instead of acrylamide in the hydrogel fabrication due to its relatively lower toxicity easy processing non carcinogenic and non neurotoxic nature 32 although the hydrogels derived from synthetic polymers are bestowed with good adsorptive swelling and mechanical properties but the underscored polymers are costly non biodegradable and toxic 33 34 in contrast biopolymers derived hydrogels bdh are less expensive non toxic and biodegradable but their poor mechanical strength hinders its large scale applications 35 36 therefore incorporation of biopolymers into the synthetic hydrogels may combine the beneficial features of both the precursors for instance sodium alginate g polyacrylic acid co allyltrimethylammonium chloride 37 sodium alginate poly acrylic acid attapulgite 38 and poly acryl amide co acrylic acid sodium alginate 39 sorbents of admirable swelling and sorption properties have been developed hence biopolymer sodium alginate sa was incorporated into the synthetic hydrogel to reduce toxicity and enhance swelling and sorption potencies 40 thus a novel sodium alginate grafted poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formamide sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel by means of well known free radical polymerization method the swelling and sorption potencies of the resultant graft copolymeric hydrogel was comprehensively inspected by employing methylene green mg as model probe dye during sorption experiments after sorption the mg loaded hydrogel was subjected to the separation of toluene as oil probe from its aqueous emulsion for comparison copolymeric poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formamide p aac co vfa hydrogel was also developed by the same protocol in addition to applied side the work is deemed to bridge the prevailing knowledge gaps in the literature and will guide future research under the umbrella of organic hydrogels for elimination of environmental toxins 2 experimental 2 1 materials acrylic acid aac 99 sigma aldrich and n vinyl formamide vfa 99 sigma aldrich were used as monomers while sodium alginate sa 98 molecular mass 216 g mol 1 sigma aldrich was used as backbone for grafting of vfa and aac fragments ammonium persulphate aps 98 sigma aldrich n n methylene bisacrylamide mba 99 sigma aldrich and tetramethyl ethylenediamine temed 99 sigma aldrich were applied as redox initiator cross linker and an accelerator respectively zinc chloride double salt of methylene green mg sigma aldrich having 65 of dye contents was applied as cationic dye probe for evaluation of sorption potential of the anionic hydrogels all the materials were chemically pure of analytical grade and used directly as received without prior purification for synthesis and subsequent sorption studies solutions were prepared in distilled milli q water of resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 298 k 2 2 synthesis the sa g p aac co vpa sorbent was fabricated at 60 c in electric oven by using one pot free radical in situ polymerization method 41 scheme 1 the precursors aa vfa and mba were charged to milli q deionized water in the feed ratio of 85 10 5 respectively briefly aa 5 ml vfa 0 6 g and mba 0 061 g were charged to milli q deionized water followed by sonication until a homogenous mixture was formed the resultant solution was charged drop wise to 5 ml of 2 aqueous sa solution 0 14 g sa 50 ml water under constant vigorous stirring coupled with the slow rise of temperature to 60 c the mixture was kept overnight for stirring to ensure complete mixing of the two solutions followed by purging with argon gas for 15 min in order to flush out the dissolved molecular oxygen that may hinder the polymerization and consequent gelation reactions after that 20 μl temed and 0 05 g aps were added to the same solution in order to initiate and accelerate the reaction the resultant homogeneous mixture was heated at 60 c for 30 min in the oven which lead to the synthesis of sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel the hydrogel fabrication was visually confirmed by complete transformation of the mixture to hydrogel as displayed in fig 1a the product was cooled washed with deionized water and dried at 0 75 kpa and 40 c in vacuum oven likewise the copolymeric p aa co vfa hydrogel depicted in fig 1d was also fabricated via one pot polymerization of aa and vfa by following the same protocol as documented for sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel 42 2 3 characterization the images of sa g p aa co vfa and p aa co vfa were recorded at different resolutions by using sem jsm 5910 jeol in order to visually confirm the surface morphology at nano scale ftir 4000 400 cm 1 and uv visible 200 800 nm spectra and thermograms 33 600 c were recorded by ftir spectrophotometer perkinelmer spectrum version 10 5 1 uv visible spectrophotomer shimadzhu 1800 and thermogravimetric analyser shimadzhu tga 50 respectively tensile stress strain curves of the hydrogels were obtained by universal testing machine mts industrial systems china co ltd 2 4 swelling measurements the ph sensitive swelling behavior of graft and copolymeric hydrogels were thoroughly examined at ph 4 7 9 and 11 at room temperature 25 2 c precisely weighted dry sample of the hydrogel was charged to 200 ml milli q double distilled water followed by recording its weight after 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 h and so on till the weight become constant the surface water was wiped out with tissue paper prior to weight determination the water absorbency was measured quantitatively in terms of swelling calculated by eq 1 10 1 swelling ratio m s m d m d 100 where md and ms represents masses of dry collapsed and gel like swollen superabsorbents hydrogels respectively 2 5 adsorption studies 2 5 1 adsorption equilibrium the p aa co vfa and sa g p aa co vfa hydrogels were used for the eradication of methylene green mg from the aqueous environment by batch adsorption protocol the two solutions of mg having 10 5 m and 2 10 5 m concentration were prepared in milli q distilled water mqdw for the equilibration experiments after that superabsorbent 0 1 g and aqueous mg 10 ml were charged successively to each of the six reagent bottles rb the initial ph was then adjusted to 7 by means of hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m via ph meter the rb was agitated vigorously at 200 rpm in thermostated water tsw bath at 25 c for time periods of 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h the mixture was then filtered and the filtrate was proceeded for the determination of residual dye concentration via uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu 1800 the concentration of mg was determined by dividing absorbance over slope of linear regression plot of calibration curve obtained over a concentration range of mg 2 5 2 adsorption kinetics the range of contact time for the investigation of adsorption kinetics at 10 c 20 c and 30 c was fixed from 5 to 30 min in the light of equilibration studies 10 ml solution 10 5 m of mg were charged to 0 1 g of hydrogel taken in six rb followed by vigorous joggling at 200 rpm in tsw bath for 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min respectively the slurry was then filtered and the amount of left over dye was spectrophotometrically determined in the filtrate 2 5 3 adsorption isotherms superabsorbent 0 1 g and different concentrations 0 012 0 045 m of aqueous mg 10 ml were added in succession to each of the rbs present in the series the consequent slurries were shaken vigorously in tsw bath at 30 c for 23 h after 23 h the slurries were subjected to filtration followed by spectrophotometric examination of the filtrate for quantitative determination of leftover mg 2 6 separation of toluene in water emulsion the emulsion of 1 wt toluene in water was prepared by sequential addition of 1 g and 0 02 g of toluene oil probe and tween 80 surfactant into so much milli q water that the final weight of mixture become 100 g 8 43 the mixture was then subjected to fast mechanical stirring for 30 min in order to prepare full emulsion filter paper of pore radius 15 20 μm was placed on the porcelain bed of the buckner funnel followed by the addition of 2 g sa g p aa co vfa mg powder which were subsequently spread over the filter paper to form a compact thin film a second filter paper was placed above the layer of waste sorbent thus the dye loaded hydrogel was imprisoned between the two filter papers subsequently 20 ml of the emulsion was poured into the buckner funnel and vacuum pump pressure 0 1 mpa was turned on to start the desired filtration the concentration c t residual toluene in the filtrate was obtained spectrophotometrically by measuring maximum absorbance λ max centered at 269 nm which was subsequently divided by the slope of the calibration plot furthermore contrast experiment was also performed by filtering the emulsion through two filter papers followed by measuring toluene concentration in the filtrate which remained same before and after filtration the separation efficiency of the waste sorbent toward toluene eradication from its aqueous emulsion was assessed by the expression depicted in eq 2 43 2 separation efficiency 1 c t c o 100 whereas c o and c t denote the concentration of toluene before and after separation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 surface morphology the surface morphology of copolymer and graft copolymer hydrogels presented in fig 1 was confirmed visually at the macroscopic and microscopic scale by photographs captured via digital camera and sem respectively both the superabsorbents are rough spongy and porous as evident from their micrographs in fig 1 b c e and f thereby most favorable for mg adsorption sorption processes the pores in sa g p aa co vfa and p aa co vfa hydrogels may be generated due to phase separation during fabrication or water evaporation from the pore already present within the 3d network 44 these micro pores act as water absorption channels and present interaction sites for mg adsorption thus reducing water flow resistance and consequently enhance swelling and adsorptive potential of the graft and copolymeric adsorbents 3 1 2 ftir investigations the ftir spectrum of sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel provides ample evidence for its fabrication owing to the existence of different signals corresponding to the functionalities of the hydrogel fig 2 the aac fragment in the sa g p aa co vfa sorbent was reflected by the appearance of carbonyl c o 1706 cm 1 and hydroxyl oh 3544 cm 1 stretching waves 45 48 the result was further cemented by existence of c o symmetric 1446 cm 1 and anti symmetric 1541 cm 1 signals of aa fragment the existence of vfa in the sorbent was unraveled by characteristic n h 3284 cm 1 and co 1642 cm 1 stretching signals likewise the development of p aac co vfa hydrogel was signalled by the appearance of peaks corresponding to oh n h and c o functionalities of aac and vfa fig 2 furthermore successful aac and vfa grafting onto sa chains was depicted by oh 3405 cm 1 vibrations signal belonged to sa interestingly the subject wave was not witnessed in the spectrum of copolymeric hydrogel which further supported aac and vfa grafting onto chains of sa besides complete polymerization of the monomers in the hydrogels was evidenced by absence of signals at 1634 cm 1 and 1625 cm 1 corresponding to stretching c c vibrations of aac and vfa respectively 3 1 3 thermal properties the thermogravimetric plot depicted in fig 3 for sa g p aac co vfa sorbent is characterized by three distinct regions of mass loss the first region 33 250 c of 4 mass loss may be derived from the combination of moisture desorption cooh groups inter intra chain dehydration to corresponding esters rings dehydration and glycosidic c o c bonds breaking of sa 49 51 the second region 250 330 c involving 14 mass loss correspond to decarboxylation reaction of the remaining carboxyl cooh and anhydrides of the preceding step besides the cooh functionalities of graft copolymeric hydrogel may also undergo degradation in this temperature domain 42 the final event 330 465 c of 11 mass loss originated from smaller fragments degradation which belonged to polymeric chains moreover the small weight loss of 4 at temperature 465 c may be ascribed to the breakage of 3d interpenetrating polymeric networks of the hydrogels likewise the thermogram of copolymeric p aac co vfa hydrogel depicted in fig 3a also undergone three steps degradation in different temperature domains with their corresponding mass losses documented in table s1 the sa g p aa co vfa superabsorbent demonstrated significantly enhanced thermal stability than p aac co vfa at all temperatures owing to formation of new covalent bonds between monomers and sa fig 3a 49 hence this confirms successful grafting of the monomers onto the polymeric chains of sa which is in agreement with the outcome of ftir spectroscopy moreover sa incorporation leads to enhancement in thermal stability of the graft copolymeric hydrogel which is depicted by its substantially slower mass loss relative to the copolymeric hydrogel 3 1 4 mechanical properties the stress strain curve exhibited in fig 3b depicts the typical brittle tensile character of the graft copolymeric hydrogel the material linearly underwent rise in tensile strength with simultaneous increment in strain which points to its elastic nature the mechanical features related to the tensile behavior of the graft copolymeric and the copolymeric hydrogels are listed in table s2 relative to the copolymeric hydrogel the increment in ultimate tensile strength uts and decline in tensile strain may stem from sa incorporation which enters into covalent bond formation with aac and vfa thus sa considerably improves mechanical features of the graft copolymeric hydrogel and the subject material may be superior sorbent from the copolymeric hydrogel in terms of mechanical robustness 3 2 proposed mechanism the development of graft copolyemeric sorbent depicted in scheme 2 was elaborated by means of comprehensive mechanism given on the basis of results attained from aforementioned techniques 52 15 initially aps thermally dissociates at 60 c to radicals named sulphate anions which immediately abstract hydrogen from sa backbone to generate an alkoxy ro macro radical initiator the resultant ro radicals target the double bonds present in the monomers thus creating a new reaction site which further attack the olefinic bonds to give birth to new active centres the polymerization reaction continues in the described fashion till a polymeric chain of maximum length is achieved meanwhile the mba associates the growing polymeric chains thus acting like a hook to construct a 3d polymeric skeleton moreover the active centres of sa and growing copolymeric chain combine with each other to yield the desired graft copolymeric material similarly a comprehensive mechanistic pathway depicted in scheme s1 was also suggested on the basis of results obtained from characterization techniques 3 3 swelling measurements the swelling potential of sa g p aa co vfa superabsorbent in a wide ph range 04 11 was inspected thoroughly as a function of time fig 4a the rate of water uptake rapidly increased initially followed by gradual decline till the attainment of equilibrium at ph 11 the superabsorbent hydrogel reached equilibrium in 23 h with corresponding maximum water absorption of 7665 the remarkable swelling may stem from the predominant electrostatic repulsion between the coo groups of sa and aac the substantial increment in swelling of the superabsorbent with a rise in ph of aqueous environment may occur owing to the wide opening of pores at ph 4 actually the carboxylate coo anions are produced at ph 4 which electrostatically repel each other thereby leads to pores opening and consequently water diffusion occurs freely into the hydrogel at ph 4 the superabsorbent molecules are neutral and collapsed due to numerous hydrogen bonds among the polymeric chains hence the hydrogel pores are shut which hinder water diffusion into the hydrogel which leads to decrease in swelling under acidic conditions 42 the p aac co vfa hydrogel demonstrated swelling of 4044 which is significantly lower than the sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel fig s1a the substantial increment in swelling potential of the grafted copolymer relative to the copolymer may be attributed to sa incorporation moreover the superabsorbents underwent swelling and shrinking at ph 9 and ph 4 respectively due to the deprotonation and protonation of the ph responsive cooh groups fig 4b the hydrogel maintained swelling 95 after 5 consecutive swelling deswelling runs which indicated its stable and reusable nature ficks law is usually applied to explore the transport mechanism of water diffusion into the bulk of hydrogels in aqueous medium the swelling contents determined at different ph values were used for the calculation of f by using eq 3 53 the values of f evaluated at different time periods were fitted to eq 4 in order to probe the nature of water diffusion into the superabsorbent 3 f s t s o k t n 4 ln f ln k n ln t the slope and intercept of ln f verses ln t linear plots displayed in fig 4c and fig s1b for sa g p aac co vfa and p aac co vfa hydrogels was applied for the evaluation of n and k respectively and are documented in table 1 the graphical data for the plots was obtained prior to attainment of swelling equilibrium for the area in which initial 60 water by mass enters the superabsorbents the n values 0 461 0 494 calculated for grafted copolymeric and copolymeric hydrogels at different ph are 0 5 which depict fickian behavior in case of water permeation into the sorbent 54 3 3 1 adsorption equilibrium kinetic studies are crucial for rate determination which is indispensable for comprehending sorbent efficiency and sorption mechanism 55 likewise the equilibration study explores the equilibration time of adsorbate which is vital in the treatment of waste water during the initial 30 min the sorption rate of both the hydrogels was quite high owing to availability of plentiful sorption sites coo in the porous 3d network of the hydrogels fig s2a b 52 the equilibrium was attained in 30 min after which the quantity of mg sorbed remained almost constant 3 3 2 ph effect the sa g p vfa co aac sorbent is endowed with ph sensitive moieties which induce substantial variation in surface charges upon change in ph thus monitoring the sorption properties of the said hydrogel the sorption is low at ph 3 followed by steep increase in sorption up to ph 5 fig 5 after that the amount quantity q e of dye sorbed declined till ph 9 and then again steep rise in sorption occurred up to ph 11 the sharp variations in q e owing to ph changes may stem from the structural variations of the dye and sorbent in acidic and alkaline environments actually the extent of mg protonation increases with decrease in ph below pka pka 4 1 which induce more positive charge on the dye thus enhancing their sorption capacity toward anionic hydrogel in contrast the extent of deprotonation of the sorbent goes on increasing with ph rise above pka pka 4 5 which give the hydrogel more negative charge thus the sorption is governed by equilibrium between prontonation and de protonation of the dye and sorbent respectively ideally the highest degree of protonation and de protonation in the mg and sorbent may cause excellent removal of the subject pollutants this situation occurs at ph 5 in which the protonated state of mg and the deprotonated form of the anionic sorbent are present in copious amount which subsequently binds with each other via electrostatic interactions 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics the time range 05 30 min for the subsequent kinetic investigations at different temperatures was fixed in the light of equilibration studies the sorption potential of sa g p aa co vfa was higher than p aa co vfa hydrogel due to the presence of more binding sites coo contributed by aa and sa thus sa incorporation enhances the sorption potential of the grafted copolymer the data of mg sorption kinetics was inserted into pseudo first order pseudo second order and parabolic diffusion kinetic models in order to probe the kinetics of the involved sorption process the kinetic expressions for pseudo first and pseudo second order are depicted in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 q e t 1 k 2 q e 2 where q t mol g and q e mol g denote the amount of mg sorbed after predefined time interval t and equilibrium time respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 dm3 mole 1 s 1 represent the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate constant respectively the slope and intercept of the linear fragments of ln q e q t verses t at different 10 c 20 c and 30 c temperatures shown in figs 6a and s3a were used for the determination of q e and k 1 which are documented in table 2 likewise the slope and intercept of the of t q t verses t linear plots shown in figs 6b and s3b were proceeded for the determination of k 2 and q t at different temperatures table 2 the correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo first and pseudo second order plots are 0 95 and 0 999 respectively which points to excellent fitting into the pseudo second order model compared to the preceding model moreover the k 1 and k 2 values increase with rise in temperature which indicates endothermic nature of the mg adsorption on both the superabsorbent hydrogels the kinetic expressions of intraparticle diffusion depicted in eq 7 was also applied to the data 7 q t k diff t 0 5 c here q t mg g 1 is the amount of mg sorbed after vigorous shaking for time t the k diff and c represent the intraparticle diffusion constant and intercept of linear segments of q t against t 0 5 the slope k diff and intercept c of q t against t 0 5 linear curves in fig 7 a and b were used to evaluate k diff which are documented in the figure for every segment of the graph the mg uptake q t verses ln time plots depicted in fig 7 a and b at 10 c 20 c and 30 c for both the superabsorbent hydrogels are multi linear having three distinct regions which points to occurrence of the adsorption in three successive steps the macroporous external surface diffusion represent the initial step in which mg molecules diffuses into the macrospores of the hydrogels the second and third step involve the mesoporous intraparticle and microporous diffusion into the mesopores and microspores respectively 56 57 the slope which is equal to intraparticle rate constant of first step is higher than second which is further greater than the final step of diffusion i e k1 k2 k3 the decrease in diffusion rate from initial to final phase may be attributed to decrease in pores dimension which offer more resistance toward mg diffusion thus may significantly decline the rate of diffusion 3 3 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm explores the maximum sorption potential of a sorbent which is vital for the designing of batch or column systems 58 at 30 c the mg sorption onto grafted copolymeric hydrogel was thoroughly scrutinized by starting with different initial concentrations c i of the dye the mg absorbed q e increased linearly with the rise in equilibrium concentration c e of the residual dye in solution till complete saturation of sorption centers on the grafted hydrogel the maximum quantity q m of mg eradicated was 1915 mg g 1 which is higher than related polyacrylic acid based hydrogels table 3 the consequent data was inserted into the eq 8 of langmuir adsorption isotherm and langmuir constant k l was evaluated which was subsequently utilized to the determine separation factor r l by eq 9 8 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m 9 r l 1 1 k l c o here q e c o and c e represents the amount adsorbed mol g 1 initial and residual equilibrium in solution concentrations mol l 1 of mg respectively besides k l and q m are the langmuir constants related to maximum sorption capacity and sorption energy in table s1 q m and k l were calculated from the slope and intercept of c e q e verses c e curves depicted in fig 8b calculated at different initial concentrations 0 012 to 0 045 m the values of r l 0 9992 0 9998 1 signify the mg sorption as favorable chemisorption by the graft copolymeric sorbent 59 moreover the linear sort of sorption in the present case was evidenced by r l 1 the isothermal data was also fitted into the equations of freundlich eq 10 and temkin eq 11 models to dig deeper the sorption of mg onto sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel 10 ln q e ln k f ln c e n 11 c q rt b ln k t rt b ln c e both q e and c q denote the equilibrium amount of mg sorbed mg g 1 while c e is the residual dye concentration mg l 1 in solution the t and r represent the absolute temperature k and gas constant 8 314 kj mol 1 respectively while b is a constant which is related to heat of adsorption the constants 1 n and k f are known as freundlich constants related to the intensity and capacity of adsorption in table s3 the k and 1 n values are documented which were calculated from the slope and intercept of the lnq e verses lnc e plot displayed in fig 8c for the hydrogels similarly the slope and intercept of the linear temkin curves depicted in fig 8d for the sa g p aa co vfa were used for the determination of b and k f respectively which are listed in table s3 the r2 value 0 98 for the langmuir plot is higher than that of freundlich r2 0 94 and temkin r2 0 96 which point to the best fitting of the isotherm data into the langmuir model the maximum amount q m of mg adsorbed calculated from the langmuir equation is equal to 2500 mg g 1 while the experimentally determined value of q m is 1915 mg g 1 in case of mg elimination by sa g p aa co vfa sorbent both the theoretical and experimental q m values are higher than that of related polyacrylic acid based hydrogel presented in table 3 moreover the data of mg sorption followed pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models thus indicating chemisorption of cationic mg onto anionic sorbent due to the development of electrostatic bond 3 4 separation of toluene in water emulsion regeneration of the sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel was difficult and time consuming owing to firm sorption chemisorption of the dye therefore the waste sorbent sa g p aa co vfa mg was tested for toluene 1 wt separation from its aqueous emulsion stabilized by tween 80 the separation of toluene from emulsion in the present composition was vital owing to low 1 wt oil contents in waste water and small droplets size of toluene the assembly for vacuum driven filtration is depicted in fig 9a in which a constant pressure of 0 1 mpa was maintained by means of a vacuum pump before filtration the emulsion was white turbid fig 9b which became colorless after filtration pointing toward effective separation of toluene fig 9c the filtrate was analyzed spectrophotometrically for the quantitative determination of residual toluene fig 9d the maximum absorbance λ max 269 nm was divided by the slope of the linear regression plot of the calibration curve obtained over a concentration range of toluene fig 10a the separation efficiency was 94 in the initial run which remained stable up to five successive runs with negligible loss in separation performance fig 10b the documented separation efficiency equal to 94 is almost comparable to the separation efficiency of the waste material used for the same purpose by d li et al 43 the sa g p aa co vfa mg efficiently eradicated toluene from water owing to the plentiful existence of hydroxyl oh amide nh and carbonyl c o functionalities which endow leophobic character to the waste sorbent in aquatic environment the contrast experiment was performed by filtering the emulsion through two filter papers and the concentration of toluene was same before and after filtration thus the waste sorbent could work efficiently toward oil separation from the water up to five successive runs 4 conclusion in the present work a novel sodium alginate grafted poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formaide sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel was fabricated by free radical polymerization route the hydrogel swelled in aqueous medium through fickian diffusion with maximum swelling potential of 7665 due to the plentiful existence of carboxylate functionalities contributed by acrylic acid aa and sodium alginate sa units owing to high swelling all the sorption sites particularly carboxylate coo anions were fully exposed for catching cationic methylene green mg which endowed the material remarkable sorption potential reaching up to 1915 mg g 1 the sorption data fitted well into pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm model which pointed toward chemisorption owing to electrostatic bond formation between the cationic mg and anionic sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel interestingly the used sa g p aac co vfa mg hydrogel exhibited 94 separation efficiency toward eradication of toluene oil probe which remained stable for five successive runs the present endeavor develops a versatile material with remarkable swelling sorption and oil in water separation performance and thus would be a potential candidate for relevant industrial and environmental applications declaration of competing interest no conflict

13077,removal of noxious dyes and oils from the modern day industrial discharges is compulsory to safeguard humans aquatic organisms and water quality and to prevent ecological damages induced by pollutants the underscored problems were addressed by one pot fabrication of sodium alginate grafted poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formamide sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel the hydrogel swelled in water up to 7665 due to water absorption through fickian diffusion the smart hydrogel efficiently performed sorption of methylene green mg from aqueous solution owing to outstanding swelling potential and electrostatic interactions the maximum sorption potency of the adsorbent reached to 1915 mg g 1 with excellent removal at 5 and 11 ph values the mg sorption followed pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models thus indicating chemisorption of cationic mg onto anionic sorbent due to the development of electrostatic bond the used sa g p aac co vfa mg sorbent was tested for oil toluene as oil probe separation from its aqueous emulsion the material exhibited 94 separation efficiency toward toluene eradication which remained unchanged for five successive runs the remarkable swelling and sorption potencies of the hydrogel coupled with the outstanding toluene separation efficiency of the mg sorbed hydrogel make the subject hydrogel a versatile material for relevant industrial and environmental applications keywords hydrogel fickian diffusion batch adsorption kinetics oil separation 1 introduction the increment in global population at alarming pace has led to rapid industrialization consequently more industrial effluents are directly discharged into the water bodies which are laden with noxious pollutants including dyes and oils 1 4 the toxic dyes badly affect aquatic life and human health in addition to worsening water quality due to their carcinogenic non biodegradable and teratogenic nature 5 7 likewise the oil and greases in wastewater are carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans besides causing ecological damages for aquatic life 8 9 thus eradication of toxic dyes and insoluble oil from water reservoirs is highly desirable to protect humans aquatic life and water bodies from their noxious effects 10 11 but elimination of both the pollutants by means of single approach is difficult owing to significant differences in their properties under aquatic environment 12 therefore the development of versatile materials for removal of the subject pollutants may have enormous practical significance 13 14 among a variety of water purification techniques 15 adsorption is preferred for dyes eradication due to simple design facile operation promising efficiency incredible versatility and cost effectiveness 16 10 17 presently the application of polymeric hydrogels for sorptive elimination of dyes is a hot research topic due to their fast fabrication environment friendliness economic viability rapid sorption and regeneration cycles 18 20 hydrogels are smart materials formed by extensive crosslinking of hydrophilic polymer chains in three dimensions 21 22 these intelligent materials have been widely applied in different domains including agriculture 23 drug delivery 24 tissue engineering 25 solid surface repairing 26 and wastewater treatment 27 14 in adsorption a plethora of polyacrylic acid co acrylamides hydrogels have been developed which displayed excellent swelling and consequent sorption potencies toward dyes eradication 28 30 but the usage of acrylamide for the hydrogel fabrication is the prime concern of environmental scientists due to its toxic and carcinogenic nature 31 the accidental release disposal of the toxic acrylamide monomers may seriously contaminate water owing to their water soluble nature in addition the persistence of unreacted acrylamide in the hydrogel backbone may also contaminate water during wastewater treatment thus n vinylformamide was applied instead of acrylamide in the hydrogel fabrication due to its relatively lower toxicity easy processing non carcinogenic and non neurotoxic nature 32 although the hydrogels derived from synthetic polymers are bestowed with good adsorptive swelling and mechanical properties but the underscored polymers are costly non biodegradable and toxic 33 34 in contrast biopolymers derived hydrogels bdh are less expensive non toxic and biodegradable but their poor mechanical strength hinders its large scale applications 35 36 therefore incorporation of biopolymers into the synthetic hydrogels may combine the beneficial features of both the precursors for instance sodium alginate g polyacrylic acid co allyltrimethylammonium chloride 37 sodium alginate poly acrylic acid attapulgite 38 and poly acryl amide co acrylic acid sodium alginate 39 sorbents of admirable swelling and sorption properties have been developed hence biopolymer sodium alginate sa was incorporated into the synthetic hydrogel to reduce toxicity and enhance swelling and sorption potencies 40 thus a novel sodium alginate grafted poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formamide sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel by means of well known free radical polymerization method the swelling and sorption potencies of the resultant graft copolymeric hydrogel was comprehensively inspected by employing methylene green mg as model probe dye during sorption experiments after sorption the mg loaded hydrogel was subjected to the separation of toluene as oil probe from its aqueous emulsion for comparison copolymeric poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formamide p aac co vfa hydrogel was also developed by the same protocol in addition to applied side the work is deemed to bridge the prevailing knowledge gaps in the literature and will guide future research under the umbrella of organic hydrogels for elimination of environmental toxins 2 experimental 2 1 materials acrylic acid aac 99 sigma aldrich and n vinyl formamide vfa 99 sigma aldrich were used as monomers while sodium alginate sa 98 molecular mass 216 g mol 1 sigma aldrich was used as backbone for grafting of vfa and aac fragments ammonium persulphate aps 98 sigma aldrich n n methylene bisacrylamide mba 99 sigma aldrich and tetramethyl ethylenediamine temed 99 sigma aldrich were applied as redox initiator cross linker and an accelerator respectively zinc chloride double salt of methylene green mg sigma aldrich having 65 of dye contents was applied as cationic dye probe for evaluation of sorption potential of the anionic hydrogels all the materials were chemically pure of analytical grade and used directly as received without prior purification for synthesis and subsequent sorption studies solutions were prepared in distilled milli q water of resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 298 k 2 2 synthesis the sa g p aac co vpa sorbent was fabricated at 60 c in electric oven by using one pot free radical in situ polymerization method 41 scheme 1 the precursors aa vfa and mba were charged to milli q deionized water in the feed ratio of 85 10 5 respectively briefly aa 5 ml vfa 0 6 g and mba 0 061 g were charged to milli q deionized water followed by sonication until a homogenous mixture was formed the resultant solution was charged drop wise to 5 ml of 2 aqueous sa solution 0 14 g sa 50 ml water under constant vigorous stirring coupled with the slow rise of temperature to 60 c the mixture was kept overnight for stirring to ensure complete mixing of the two solutions followed by purging with argon gas for 15 min in order to flush out the dissolved molecular oxygen that may hinder the polymerization and consequent gelation reactions after that 20 μl temed and 0 05 g aps were added to the same solution in order to initiate and accelerate the reaction the resultant homogeneous mixture was heated at 60 c for 30 min in the oven which lead to the synthesis of sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel the hydrogel fabrication was visually confirmed by complete transformation of the mixture to hydrogel as displayed in fig 1a the product was cooled washed with deionized water and dried at 0 75 kpa and 40 c in vacuum oven likewise the copolymeric p aa co vfa hydrogel depicted in fig 1d was also fabricated via one pot polymerization of aa and vfa by following the same protocol as documented for sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel 42 2 3 characterization the images of sa g p aa co vfa and p aa co vfa were recorded at different resolutions by using sem jsm 5910 jeol in order to visually confirm the surface morphology at nano scale ftir 4000 400 cm 1 and uv visible 200 800 nm spectra and thermograms 33 600 c were recorded by ftir spectrophotometer perkinelmer spectrum version 10 5 1 uv visible spectrophotomer shimadzhu 1800 and thermogravimetric analyser shimadzhu tga 50 respectively tensile stress strain curves of the hydrogels were obtained by universal testing machine mts industrial systems china co ltd 2 4 swelling measurements the ph sensitive swelling behavior of graft and copolymeric hydrogels were thoroughly examined at ph 4 7 9 and 11 at room temperature 25 2 c precisely weighted dry sample of the hydrogel was charged to 200 ml milli q double distilled water followed by recording its weight after 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 h and so on till the weight become constant the surface water was wiped out with tissue paper prior to weight determination the water absorbency was measured quantitatively in terms of swelling calculated by eq 1 10 1 swelling ratio m s m d m d 100 where md and ms represents masses of dry collapsed and gel like swollen superabsorbents hydrogels respectively 2 5 adsorption studies 2 5 1 adsorption equilibrium the p aa co vfa and sa g p aa co vfa hydrogels were used for the eradication of methylene green mg from the aqueous environment by batch adsorption protocol the two solutions of mg having 10 5 m and 2 10 5 m concentration were prepared in milli q distilled water mqdw for the equilibration experiments after that superabsorbent 0 1 g and aqueous mg 10 ml were charged successively to each of the six reagent bottles rb the initial ph was then adjusted to 7 by means of hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m via ph meter the rb was agitated vigorously at 200 rpm in thermostated water tsw bath at 25 c for time periods of 0 5 1 2 4 6 and 8 h the mixture was then filtered and the filtrate was proceeded for the determination of residual dye concentration via uv visible spectrophotometer shimadzu 1800 the concentration of mg was determined by dividing absorbance over slope of linear regression plot of calibration curve obtained over a concentration range of mg 2 5 2 adsorption kinetics the range of contact time for the investigation of adsorption kinetics at 10 c 20 c and 30 c was fixed from 5 to 30 min in the light of equilibration studies 10 ml solution 10 5 m of mg were charged to 0 1 g of hydrogel taken in six rb followed by vigorous joggling at 200 rpm in tsw bath for 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 min respectively the slurry was then filtered and the amount of left over dye was spectrophotometrically determined in the filtrate 2 5 3 adsorption isotherms superabsorbent 0 1 g and different concentrations 0 012 0 045 m of aqueous mg 10 ml were added in succession to each of the rbs present in the series the consequent slurries were shaken vigorously in tsw bath at 30 c for 23 h after 23 h the slurries were subjected to filtration followed by spectrophotometric examination of the filtrate for quantitative determination of leftover mg 2 6 separation of toluene in water emulsion the emulsion of 1 wt toluene in water was prepared by sequential addition of 1 g and 0 02 g of toluene oil probe and tween 80 surfactant into so much milli q water that the final weight of mixture become 100 g 8 43 the mixture was then subjected to fast mechanical stirring for 30 min in order to prepare full emulsion filter paper of pore radius 15 20 μm was placed on the porcelain bed of the buckner funnel followed by the addition of 2 g sa g p aa co vfa mg powder which were subsequently spread over the filter paper to form a compact thin film a second filter paper was placed above the layer of waste sorbent thus the dye loaded hydrogel was imprisoned between the two filter papers subsequently 20 ml of the emulsion was poured into the buckner funnel and vacuum pump pressure 0 1 mpa was turned on to start the desired filtration the concentration c t residual toluene in the filtrate was obtained spectrophotometrically by measuring maximum absorbance λ max centered at 269 nm which was subsequently divided by the slope of the calibration plot furthermore contrast experiment was also performed by filtering the emulsion through two filter papers followed by measuring toluene concentration in the filtrate which remained same before and after filtration the separation efficiency of the waste sorbent toward toluene eradication from its aqueous emulsion was assessed by the expression depicted in eq 2 43 2 separation efficiency 1 c t c o 100 whereas c o and c t denote the concentration of toluene before and after separation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 surface morphology the surface morphology of copolymer and graft copolymer hydrogels presented in fig 1 was confirmed visually at the macroscopic and microscopic scale by photographs captured via digital camera and sem respectively both the superabsorbents are rough spongy and porous as evident from their micrographs in fig 1 b c e and f thereby most favorable for mg adsorption sorption processes the pores in sa g p aa co vfa and p aa co vfa hydrogels may be generated due to phase separation during fabrication or water evaporation from the pore already present within the 3d network 44 these micro pores act as water absorption channels and present interaction sites for mg adsorption thus reducing water flow resistance and consequently enhance swelling and adsorptive potential of the graft and copolymeric adsorbents 3 1 2 ftir investigations the ftir spectrum of sa g p aac co vfa hydrogel provides ample evidence for its fabrication owing to the existence of different signals corresponding to the functionalities of the hydrogel fig 2 the aac fragment in the sa g p aa co vfa sorbent was reflected by the appearance of carbonyl c o 1706 cm 1 and hydroxyl oh 3544 cm 1 stretching waves 45 48 the result was further cemented by existence of c o symmetric 1446 cm 1 and anti symmetric 1541 cm 1 signals of aa fragment the existence of vfa in the sorbent was unraveled by characteristic n h 3284 cm 1 and co 1642 cm 1 stretching signals likewise the development of p aac co vfa hydrogel was signalled by the appearance of peaks corresponding to oh n h and c o functionalities of aac and vfa fig 2 furthermore successful aac and vfa grafting onto sa chains was depicted by oh 3405 cm 1 vibrations signal belonged to sa interestingly the subject wave was not witnessed in the spectrum of copolymeric hydrogel which further supported aac and vfa grafting onto chains of sa besides complete polymerization of the monomers in the hydrogels was evidenced by absence of signals at 1634 cm 1 and 1625 cm 1 corresponding to stretching c c vibrations of aac and vfa respectively 3 1 3 thermal properties the thermogravimetric plot depicted in fig 3 for sa g p aac co vfa sorbent is characterized by three distinct regions of mass loss the first region 33 250 c of 4 mass loss may be derived from the combination of moisture desorption cooh groups inter intra chain dehydration to corresponding esters rings dehydration and glycosidic c o c bonds breaking of sa 49 51 the second region 250 330 c involving 14 mass loss correspond to decarboxylation reaction of the remaining carboxyl cooh and anhydrides of the preceding step besides the cooh functionalities of graft copolymeric hydrogel may also undergo degradation in this temperature domain 42 the final event 330 465 c of 11 mass loss originated from smaller fragments degradation which belonged to polymeric chains moreover the small weight loss of 4 at temperature 465 c may be ascribed to the breakage of 3d interpenetrating polymeric networks of the hydrogels likewise the thermogram of copolymeric p aac co vfa hydrogel depicted in fig 3a also undergone three steps degradation in different temperature domains with their corresponding mass losses documented in table s1 the sa g p aa co vfa superabsorbent demonstrated significantly enhanced thermal stability than p aac co vfa at all temperatures owing to formation of new covalent bonds between monomers and sa fig 3a 49 hence this confirms successful grafting of the monomers onto the polymeric chains of sa which is in agreement with the outcome of ftir spectroscopy moreover sa incorporation leads to enhancement in thermal stability of the graft copolymeric hydrogel which is depicted by its substantially slower mass loss relative to the copolymeric hydrogel 3 1 4 mechanical properties the stress strain curve exhibited in fig 3b depicts the typical brittle tensile character of the graft copolymeric hydrogel the material linearly underwent rise in tensile strength with simultaneous increment in strain which points to its elastic nature the mechanical features related to the tensile behavior of the graft copolymeric and the copolymeric hydrogels are listed in table s2 relative to the copolymeric hydrogel the increment in ultimate tensile strength uts and decline in tensile strain may stem from sa incorporation which enters into covalent bond formation with aac and vfa thus sa considerably improves mechanical features of the graft copolymeric hydrogel and the subject material may be superior sorbent from the copolymeric hydrogel in terms of mechanical robustness 3 2 proposed mechanism the development of graft copolyemeric sorbent depicted in scheme 2 was elaborated by means of comprehensive mechanism given on the basis of results attained from aforementioned techniques 52 15 initially aps thermally dissociates at 60 c to radicals named sulphate anions which immediately abstract hydrogen from sa backbone to generate an alkoxy ro macro radical initiator the resultant ro radicals target the double bonds present in the monomers thus creating a new reaction site which further attack the olefinic bonds to give birth to new active centres the polymerization reaction continues in the described fashion till a polymeric chain of maximum length is achieved meanwhile the mba associates the growing polymeric chains thus acting like a hook to construct a 3d polymeric skeleton moreover the active centres of sa and growing copolymeric chain combine with each other to yield the desired graft copolymeric material similarly a comprehensive mechanistic pathway depicted in scheme s1 was also suggested on the basis of results obtained from characterization techniques 3 3 swelling measurements the swelling potential of sa g p aa co vfa superabsorbent in a wide ph range 04 11 was inspected thoroughly as a function of time fig 4a the rate of water uptake rapidly increased initially followed by gradual decline till the attainment of equilibrium at ph 11 the superabsorbent hydrogel reached equilibrium in 23 h with corresponding maximum water absorption of 7665 the remarkable swelling may stem from the predominant electrostatic repulsion between the coo groups of sa and aac the substantial increment in swelling of the superabsorbent with a rise in ph of aqueous environment may occur owing to the wide opening of pores at ph 4 actually the carboxylate coo anions are produced at ph 4 which electrostatically repel each other thereby leads to pores opening and consequently water diffusion occurs freely into the hydrogel at ph 4 the superabsorbent molecules are neutral and collapsed due to numerous hydrogen bonds among the polymeric chains hence the hydrogel pores are shut which hinder water diffusion into the hydrogel which leads to decrease in swelling under acidic conditions 42 the p aac co vfa hydrogel demonstrated swelling of 4044 which is significantly lower than the sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel fig s1a the substantial increment in swelling potential of the grafted copolymer relative to the copolymer may be attributed to sa incorporation moreover the superabsorbents underwent swelling and shrinking at ph 9 and ph 4 respectively due to the deprotonation and protonation of the ph responsive cooh groups fig 4b the hydrogel maintained swelling 95 after 5 consecutive swelling deswelling runs which indicated its stable and reusable nature ficks law is usually applied to explore the transport mechanism of water diffusion into the bulk of hydrogels in aqueous medium the swelling contents determined at different ph values were used for the calculation of f by using eq 3 53 the values of f evaluated at different time periods were fitted to eq 4 in order to probe the nature of water diffusion into the superabsorbent 3 f s t s o k t n 4 ln f ln k n ln t the slope and intercept of ln f verses ln t linear plots displayed in fig 4c and fig s1b for sa g p aac co vfa and p aac co vfa hydrogels was applied for the evaluation of n and k respectively and are documented in table 1 the graphical data for the plots was obtained prior to attainment of swelling equilibrium for the area in which initial 60 water by mass enters the superabsorbents the n values 0 461 0 494 calculated for grafted copolymeric and copolymeric hydrogels at different ph are 0 5 which depict fickian behavior in case of water permeation into the sorbent 54 3 3 1 adsorption equilibrium kinetic studies are crucial for rate determination which is indispensable for comprehending sorbent efficiency and sorption mechanism 55 likewise the equilibration study explores the equilibration time of adsorbate which is vital in the treatment of waste water during the initial 30 min the sorption rate of both the hydrogels was quite high owing to availability of plentiful sorption sites coo in the porous 3d network of the hydrogels fig s2a b 52 the equilibrium was attained in 30 min after which the quantity of mg sorbed remained almost constant 3 3 2 ph effect the sa g p vfa co aac sorbent is endowed with ph sensitive moieties which induce substantial variation in surface charges upon change in ph thus monitoring the sorption properties of the said hydrogel the sorption is low at ph 3 followed by steep increase in sorption up to ph 5 fig 5 after that the amount quantity q e of dye sorbed declined till ph 9 and then again steep rise in sorption occurred up to ph 11 the sharp variations in q e owing to ph changes may stem from the structural variations of the dye and sorbent in acidic and alkaline environments actually the extent of mg protonation increases with decrease in ph below pka pka 4 1 which induce more positive charge on the dye thus enhancing their sorption capacity toward anionic hydrogel in contrast the extent of deprotonation of the sorbent goes on increasing with ph rise above pka pka 4 5 which give the hydrogel more negative charge thus the sorption is governed by equilibrium between prontonation and de protonation of the dye and sorbent respectively ideally the highest degree of protonation and de protonation in the mg and sorbent may cause excellent removal of the subject pollutants this situation occurs at ph 5 in which the protonated state of mg and the deprotonated form of the anionic sorbent are present in copious amount which subsequently binds with each other via electrostatic interactions 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics the time range 05 30 min for the subsequent kinetic investigations at different temperatures was fixed in the light of equilibration studies the sorption potential of sa g p aa co vfa was higher than p aa co vfa hydrogel due to the presence of more binding sites coo contributed by aa and sa thus sa incorporation enhances the sorption potential of the grafted copolymer the data of mg sorption kinetics was inserted into pseudo first order pseudo second order and parabolic diffusion kinetic models in order to probe the kinetics of the involved sorption process the kinetic expressions for pseudo first and pseudo second order are depicted in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 q e t 1 k 2 q e 2 where q t mol g and q e mol g denote the amount of mg sorbed after predefined time interval t and equilibrium time respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 dm3 mole 1 s 1 represent the pseudo first and pseudo second order rate constant respectively the slope and intercept of the linear fragments of ln q e q t verses t at different 10 c 20 c and 30 c temperatures shown in figs 6a and s3a were used for the determination of q e and k 1 which are documented in table 2 likewise the slope and intercept of the of t q t verses t linear plots shown in figs 6b and s3b were proceeded for the determination of k 2 and q t at different temperatures table 2 the correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo first and pseudo second order plots are 0 95 and 0 999 respectively which points to excellent fitting into the pseudo second order model compared to the preceding model moreover the k 1 and k 2 values increase with rise in temperature which indicates endothermic nature of the mg adsorption on both the superabsorbent hydrogels the kinetic expressions of intraparticle diffusion depicted in eq 7 was also applied to the data 7 q t k diff t 0 5 c here q t mg g 1 is the amount of mg sorbed after vigorous shaking for time t the k diff and c represent the intraparticle diffusion constant and intercept of linear segments of q t against t 0 5 the slope k diff and intercept c of q t against t 0 5 linear curves in fig 7 a and b were used to evaluate k diff which are documented in the figure for every segment of the graph the mg uptake q t verses ln time plots depicted in fig 7 a and b at 10 c 20 c and 30 c for both the superabsorbent hydrogels are multi linear having three distinct regions which points to occurrence of the adsorption in three successive steps the macroporous external surface diffusion represent the initial step in which mg molecules diffuses into the macrospores of the hydrogels the second and third step involve the mesoporous intraparticle and microporous diffusion into the mesopores and microspores respectively 56 57 the slope which is equal to intraparticle rate constant of first step is higher than second which is further greater than the final step of diffusion i e k1 k2 k3 the decrease in diffusion rate from initial to final phase may be attributed to decrease in pores dimension which offer more resistance toward mg diffusion thus may significantly decline the rate of diffusion 3 3 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm explores the maximum sorption potential of a sorbent which is vital for the designing of batch or column systems 58 at 30 c the mg sorption onto grafted copolymeric hydrogel was thoroughly scrutinized by starting with different initial concentrations c i of the dye the mg absorbed q e increased linearly with the rise in equilibrium concentration c e of the residual dye in solution till complete saturation of sorption centers on the grafted hydrogel the maximum quantity q m of mg eradicated was 1915 mg g 1 which is higher than related polyacrylic acid based hydrogels table 3 the consequent data was inserted into the eq 8 of langmuir adsorption isotherm and langmuir constant k l was evaluated which was subsequently utilized to the determine separation factor r l by eq 9 8 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m 9 r l 1 1 k l c o here q e c o and c e represents the amount adsorbed mol g 1 initial and residual equilibrium in solution concentrations mol l 1 of mg respectively besides k l and q m are the langmuir constants related to maximum sorption capacity and sorption energy in table s1 q m and k l were calculated from the slope and intercept of c e q e verses c e curves depicted in fig 8b calculated at different initial concentrations 0 012 to 0 045 m the values of r l 0 9992 0 9998 1 signify the mg sorption as favorable chemisorption by the graft copolymeric sorbent 59 moreover the linear sort of sorption in the present case was evidenced by r l 1 the isothermal data was also fitted into the equations of freundlich eq 10 and temkin eq 11 models to dig deeper the sorption of mg onto sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel 10 ln q e ln k f ln c e n 11 c q rt b ln k t rt b ln c e both q e and c q denote the equilibrium amount of mg sorbed mg g 1 while c e is the residual dye concentration mg l 1 in solution the t and r represent the absolute temperature k and gas constant 8 314 kj mol 1 respectively while b is a constant which is related to heat of adsorption the constants 1 n and k f are known as freundlich constants related to the intensity and capacity of adsorption in table s3 the k and 1 n values are documented which were calculated from the slope and intercept of the lnq e verses lnc e plot displayed in fig 8c for the hydrogels similarly the slope and intercept of the linear temkin curves depicted in fig 8d for the sa g p aa co vfa were used for the determination of b and k f respectively which are listed in table s3 the r2 value 0 98 for the langmuir plot is higher than that of freundlich r2 0 94 and temkin r2 0 96 which point to the best fitting of the isotherm data into the langmuir model the maximum amount q m of mg adsorbed calculated from the langmuir equation is equal to 2500 mg g 1 while the experimentally determined value of q m is 1915 mg g 1 in case of mg elimination by sa g p aa co vfa sorbent both the theoretical and experimental q m values are higher than that of related polyacrylic acid based hydrogel presented in table 3 moreover the data of mg sorption followed pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models thus indicating chemisorption of cationic mg onto anionic sorbent due to the development of electrostatic bond 3 4 separation of toluene in water emulsion regeneration of the sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel was difficult and time consuming owing to firm sorption chemisorption of the dye therefore the waste sorbent sa g p aa co vfa mg was tested for toluene 1 wt separation from its aqueous emulsion stabilized by tween 80 the separation of toluene from emulsion in the present composition was vital owing to low 1 wt oil contents in waste water and small droplets size of toluene the assembly for vacuum driven filtration is depicted in fig 9a in which a constant pressure of 0 1 mpa was maintained by means of a vacuum pump before filtration the emulsion was white turbid fig 9b which became colorless after filtration pointing toward effective separation of toluene fig 9c the filtrate was analyzed spectrophotometrically for the quantitative determination of residual toluene fig 9d the maximum absorbance λ max 269 nm was divided by the slope of the linear regression plot of the calibration curve obtained over a concentration range of toluene fig 10a the separation efficiency was 94 in the initial run which remained stable up to five successive runs with negligible loss in separation performance fig 10b the documented separation efficiency equal to 94 is almost comparable to the separation efficiency of the waste material used for the same purpose by d li et al 43 the sa g p aa co vfa mg efficiently eradicated toluene from water owing to the plentiful existence of hydroxyl oh amide nh and carbonyl c o functionalities which endow leophobic character to the waste sorbent in aquatic environment the contrast experiment was performed by filtering the emulsion through two filter papers and the concentration of toluene was same before and after filtration thus the waste sorbent could work efficiently toward oil separation from the water up to five successive runs 4 conclusion in the present work a novel sodium alginate grafted poly acrylic acid co n vinyl formaide sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel was fabricated by free radical polymerization route the hydrogel swelled in aqueous medium through fickian diffusion with maximum swelling potential of 7665 due to the plentiful existence of carboxylate functionalities contributed by acrylic acid aa and sodium alginate sa units owing to high swelling all the sorption sites particularly carboxylate coo anions were fully exposed for catching cationic methylene green mg which endowed the material remarkable sorption potential reaching up to 1915 mg g 1 the sorption data fitted well into pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm model which pointed toward chemisorption owing to electrostatic bond formation between the cationic mg and anionic sa g p aa co vfa hydrogel interestingly the used sa g p aac co vfa mg hydrogel exhibited 94 separation efficiency toward eradication of toluene oil probe which remained stable for five successive runs the present endeavor develops a versatile material with remarkable swelling sorption and oil in water separation performance and thus would be a potential candidate for relevant industrial and environmental applications declaration of competing interest no conflict

13078,bioretention has been increasingly used in stormwater runoff treatment however its performance was often restricted by poor treatment or even the net leaching of nitrate to solve this problem a biochar woodchip modified bioretention system was developed in this study the modified system greatly enhanced the nitrogen removal than the conventional sand bioretention system the nitrate removal efficiency in the modified bioretention system ranges between 46 8 21 1 and 73 6 6 5 much higher than the conventional system only 38 6 18 4 and 24 4 6 0 the nitrogen removal process pore water variation and functional gene analysis further demonstrate that the biochar and woodchip amendment extended the reactive volume in the bioreactor facilitating nitrogen removal in both the upper layer and internal water storage zone iwsz biochar amendment in the upper layer increased volumetric water content ammonium adsorption nitrification and denitrification although a slight amount of ammonium generation was found woodchip addition greatly enhanced the denitrification rate in the iwsz in contrast the upper layer of the conventional system cannot completely adsorb and transform ammonium the denitrification performance in both the upper layer and iwsz of the conventional system was poor as well and the lack of nosz in the iwsz also made it potentially become a nitrous oxide emission source overall the biochar woodchip modified system greatly extended the reactive volume and enhanced nitrogen removal making it become a promising alternative to conventional sand bioretention system for stormwater runoff nitrogen treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords low impact development bioretention system heterotrophic denitrification dissolved nitrogen internal water storage zone 1 introduction rapid urban development has led to the increase of urban impervious areas which greatly accelerates runoff accumulation excessive runoff volume not only caused potential urban flooding problems but also greatly enhanced the transportation of pollutants such as organic matter suspended solids and nutrients into the natural water body and led to several severe urban water problems such as algae blooms and eutrophication 1 3 to resolve the problem green infrastructures have been more and more frequently used in urban stormwater management 4 6 as one of the most commonly used green infrastructures bioretention also known as stormwater biofilter or rain garden has received extensive attention recently for its flexibility conventional bioretention systems are soil or sand made biofiltration systems that can remove pollutants via several physical and biogeochemical processes such as interception adsorption biotransformation and biodegradation 7 however several studies indicate that conventional bioretention systems can only effectively remove particulate pollutants it is difficult for the conventional system to remove dissolved nutrients especially nitrate 8 9 plant assimilation and microbial denitrification play the most important role in nitrate removal 10 among them microbial denitrification was a more desirable way since it can transform nitrate into nitrogen gas and remove it from the bioretention system permanently 11 12 however due to the lack of carbon sources in stormwater runoff and drastic change of stormwater conditions effective denitrification generally cannot be achieved in the conventional bioretention system 12 bioretention media and configuration are critical influencing factors for dissolved nitrogen removal because they will influence both physical and biogeochemical processes accordingly developing and optimizing the key design factor related to media and configuration for enhanced nitrate removal has received extensive attention 13 the most common amendment way is by elevating the outlet to create an internal water storage zone iwsz this kind of amendment was tested to be able to help maintain an anoxic zone and increase water holding capacity as well as hydraulic retention time which is conducive for denitrification 14 17 several studies reported that the iwsz amendment does increase denitrification performance 18 19 however nitrate leaching was still observed in those iwsz modified systems 20 21 apart from the iwsz media amendment is another way for enhanced pollutant removal several amended media such as water treatment residual 22 fly ash 23 biochar and organic matter containing material 24 were proposed however only organic matter was commonly reported to be effective for enhanced nitrate removal for it can generate dissolved organic carbon for heterotrophic denitrification and the performance of organic matter amendment was reported to be varied greatly from effective removal to net leaching 25 recently biochar was reported to be able to increase nitrate removal in bioretention systems by increasing media water content pollutant accumulation and decreasing dissolved oxygen etc 26 29 however nitrate leaching was still found when biochar modified bioretention systems without iwsz was used to treat ammonium dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate simultaneously 30 the main reason is nitrate transformed by organic nitrogen and ammonium can lead to a high amount of nitrate generation in the upper layer of the bioretention system those parts of nitrate can be leached quickly during the next rainfall event 30 31 therefore the more effective way to remove nitrate by bioretention systems still needs to be tested given the need for enhanced nitrogen removal in the bioretention system this study developed and tested a modified biochar woodchip layered bioretention system this study aims to a assess the newly established modified system in terms of nitrogen removal performance b study the difference of nitrogen treatment process between the modified system and conventional sand bioretention system and c explore the mechanism for the enhanced nitrogen treatment after biochar and woodchip amendment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention system establishment in this study two conventional sand bioretention reactors csb and two modified biochar woodchip bioretention reactors mwb were established using acrylic 30 cm i d 120 cm height each reactor contained five layers from the bottom up drainage layer 5 cm transition layer 5 cm submerged layer 40 cm upper layer 45 cm and cobblestone protection layer 5 cm fig 1 filling media include 0 075 mm to 4 75 mm quartz sands pine woodchip local horticultural company moss peat nord agri sia latvia and biochar toroyal group china biochar was produced by pine wood at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c the media were analysed for basic properties according to the guideline to get a suitable filling scheme 32 an ec 5 sensor connected with an em 50 data collector was inserted into the media during filling and these instruments were used for volumetric water content monitoring after media filling the surface of the bioretention reactors was covered with aluminium film to prevent the influence of light the detailed property of each reactor was listed in table 1 more reactor design information can be found in our previous study 33 2 2 experimental procedures synthetic stormwater was prepared by tap water in each test 180 l tap water was collected beforehand and stood for more than one day to eliminate the residual chlorine thereafter at the beginning of each test dechlorinated water was further mixed with a machine mixer 1 h for aeration then the pre prepared pollutant stock solution was added into the dechlorinated water and stirred uniformly by a machine mixer potassium nitrate kno3 and ammonium chloride nh4cl were used to simulate nitrate and ammonium pollutant in phase i 4 mg l no3 n was prepared in the synthetic stormwater and in phase ii both 4 mg l no3 n and 4 mg l nh4 n were prepared to achieve an 8 mg l tn in synthetic stormwater the pollutant concentration referred to the typical highway runoff concentration monitored in chongqing china 34 35 phase i aims to evaluate the nitrate removal ability of the two systems and phase ii aims to test whether ammonium will lead to nitrate leaching and diminish the nitrogen removal performance of those systems received stormwater volume for two phases was the same and it was calculated as v a φ h where a cm2 indicates the estimated catchment area which was set to be twenty times of the surface area of each reactor 706 5 cm2 φ refers to the runoff coefficient and it is assumed to be 0 7 which is in the range of dense urban areas h mm is the rainfall depth which indicates the height of rainfall that will accumulate on the surface if penetration was neglected and this parameter is 25 mm the calculated influent synthetic stormwater was 24 7 l all simulated rainfall events last 2 h which leads to a flow rate of 205 8 ml min or a hydraulic loading rate of equal to 175 mm h the antecedent dry duration for both phases was 3 days i e the simulated rainfall event was applied for bioretention reactors after 72 h of the last simulated rainfall event synthetic stormwater was distributed to each reactor using peristaltic pumps and sprinkler heads for each reactor a calibrated bucket was used to receive the effluent and count the volume of effluent during the routine experiment stormwater was mixed uniformly in the bucket immediately when no obvious effluent was observed after each rainfall event and a 500 ml water sample was collected for further analysis at the end of each phase two intensive sampling experiments were conducted to test the pollutant removal process during intensive sampling experiments six water samples were taken for each reactor at the time when effluent volumes were 3 5 7 10 5 14 17 5 21 l using 100 ml sampling bottles to test the pollutant variation in the iwsz eight 50 ml pore water samples were collected for each reactor at 0 1 3 7 19 31 55 and 72 h from the water sample port between port 5 and port 7 of the iwsz during the 3 d antecedent dry duration 2 3 sampling and data analysis during the routine experiment the total effluent volume of each reactor was recorded and the collected water sample was analysed for no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn pollutant mass removal efficiency r was used and it was calculated as eq 2 2 r 1 v out c out v in c in where vin and vout l are the influent and effluent volume of each reactor cin and cout are the influent and effluent pollutant concentrations three parameters include ph oxidant reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do were analysed immediately after water sample collection during the intensive sampling experiment ph and do were analysed with corresponding probes connected to multifunctional detectors wtw 3620 german and orp value was measured by another orp meter hq30d hach usa pore water samples and all the water samples collected in the intensive sampling were analysed following the same procedure with routine experiments nitrogen species i e no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn were analysed using uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa based on standard methods within 24 h after water samples collection statistical analysis of anova was performed to test whether there have significant differences between two variables using spss a p value of 0 05 was used as the threshold of significant difference 2 4 functional gene analysis after phase ii media from different layers of each reactor were collected for functional gene analysis all the media were frozen at 80 c until dna extraction m5635 02mag bind soil dna kit omega china was utilized for total genomic dna extraction based on manufacturing instructions the purification and pretreatment steps followed the manufacturer s protocols as well dna concentrations were measured using nanodrop 2000 thermo usa genes encoding 1 ammonia monooxygenase amoa 2 copper containing nitrite reductases nirk 3 haem containing nitrite reductases nirs and 4 nitrous oxide reductase nosz were selected as the representative of genes for enzymes of nitrification and denitrification they were amplified using real time quantitative polymerase chain reactions qpcr conducted on edc 810 real time pcr equipment eastwin beijing china primers for each gene were according to the studies of 36 39 the detailed primers information was listed in table 2 for the qpcr reaction system 1 μl of dna was diluted to a suitable concentration to make dna templates mixture a was made by 10 μl 2 sybr real time pcr green master mix vazyme nanjing china 0 4 μl forward and reverse primers 10 μm then 8 μl mixture a and 8 μl dna templates were used for the qpcr reaction system the gene copies numbers in each sample were normalized with samples weight expressed as copies g 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall nitrogen removal performance in phase i and phase ii the results of the nitrogen concentration and nitrogen mass removal in the effluent of csb and wmb during phase i and phase ii are shown in table 3 in phase i only 4 mg l no3 n was applied in the influent mwb showed almost three times higher no3 n removal than csb which indicates that media amendment greatly enhanced denitrification of the modified bioretention system although there did not exist ammonium in the influent in this phase nh4 n was still detected in the effluent of both systems especially mwb which was probably caused by media in situ decomposition ammonium leaching was also found in several other studies where the bioretention system was modified with organic matters 40 41 as for nitrite it was below the detection limit for all influent samples and the concentration in the effluent is very low as well in phase ii both reactors could maintain a relatively high removal performance of nh4 n without significant difference p 0 05 several studies demonstrate that the higher ion exchange ability of biochar makes it outperform sand for ammonium adsorption 42 43 due to the potentially existing in situ generations of ammonium in the iwsz of mwb the nearly same nh4 n removal indirectly demonstrate that biochar addition in the current study enhanced ammonium removal from influent as for nitrate the no3 n removal in both systems decreased in phase ii the nitrate transformed from adsorbed ammonium through nitrification was demonstrated to be able to lead to a higher nitrate leaching 11 nevertheless compared with csb whose effluent no3 n concentration rose by about 1 87 mg l from phase i to phase ii the no3 n concentration in the effluent of mwb only rose by approximately 0 96 mg l this result further demonstrates that the modified bioretention system greatly enhanced nitrate removal performance even when ammonium was applied in influent as for nitrite all systems showed higher nitrite generation than phase i after 4 mg l nh4 n was added since almost no no2 n was generated in phase i the reason for nitrite generation in phase ii is highly possible to be incomplete nitrification as for tn although tn removal of csb in phase ii was slightly lower than in phase i the difference was not significant p 0 05 similar results were also found for mwb whose tn removal slightly increased in phase ii but no significant difference was found p 0 05 the relatively close tn removal efficiency between the two phases of wmb also indicates that higher nitrogen mass reduction was achieved in wmb in phase ii if 24 7 l influent volume was used for calculation the mass removal of tn in each wmb reactor was about 106 1 15 7 mg during each experiment in phase ii this figure is about 2 times higher than the tn mass removal of wmb in phase i 53 9 7 8 mg in comparison the tn mass removal in csb was only 19 7 7 6 mg and 21 9 13 1 mg in phase i and phase ii respectively compared with csb biochar and woodchip amendment greatly enhanced the tn removal performance 3 2 nitrogen removal processes in the conventional and modified system to further study the difference in terms of nitrogen removal processes in the csb and wmb two intensive samplings were conducted nh4 n removal processes were similar in mwb between two phases fig 2a the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of mwb was about 1 2 mg l before 10 5 l while it decreased steadily to about 0 7 mg l in 21 l in both phases in comparison the nh4 n variation pattern in csb changed dramatically between phase i and phase ii the nh4 n concentration kept relatively low all the time in phase i however in phase ii the nh4 n concentration in effluent of csb increased steadily from about 0 4 mg l in 3 5 l to approximately 1 2 mg l in 21 l the height of iwsz is 0 45 m if 0 45 was used as estimated porosity to calculate the pore volume the estimated pore volume of iwsz was approximately 14 3 l table 1 therefore the different patterns of the two systems indicate that the ammonium in the effluent of the two systems came from different sources for mwb the ammonium was mainly generated in the iwsz the potential media decomposing caused the initial high nh4 n in contrast relatively poor ammonium adsorption of sand in the upper layer make csb cannot effectively absorb the ammonium from influent which leads to an increase in nh4 n when effluent volume increased in comparison both systems showed a similar no3 n variation between two phases the no3 n concentration kept slightly below 4 mg l in csb in phase i fig 2b after ammonium addition in phase ii the effluent concentration of no3 n kept similar with phase i before 10 5 l while after 10 5 l it raised rapidly to almost 11 mg l in 21 l as for mwb a very low no3 n concentration was found in its effluent in both two phases before 14 l however it increased to about 4 mg l and almost 11 mg l in phase i and phase ii respectively compared to csb the much lower no3 n pollution level in the effluent of wmb further indicates that biochar and woodchip amendment significantly increase denitrification performance although nitrate leaching still exists especially when ammonium was added in the influent the wmb showed a lower and lagged nitrate breakthrough than csb those results indicate that the modified system can maintain a higher resistance to nitrate leaching than the conventional system as for no2 n fig 2c its concentration in both systems kept very low in the first phase however in phase ii the no2 n concentration in both systems increased with the increase of effluent volume especially for csb no2 n range between 0 11 0 01 mg l and 0 36 0 10 mg l as discussed in section 3 1 the nitrite generated in phase ii is highly possible caused by nitrification the low contact times caused by high hydraulic loading rates in the current study may lead to incomplete nitrification which can result in nitrite accumulation 25 overall for tn since the majority nitrogen species in the effluent of both systems is no3 n the tn variation in the effluent generally showed a similar pattern with no3 n media amendment in the modified system greatly increased tn removal in both phases especially before 17 5 l apart from nitrogen species ph orp and do were also analysed during intensive sampling as shown in fig 3 the effluent ph in both systems was between 7 0 and 7 5 the effluent of mwb showed a slightly lower ph than csb which is caused by media property table 1 in phase ii the effluent ph decreased with the increase of effluent volume in both systems which might be attributed to alkalinity consumption led by the nitrification process the decrease of ph after woodchip addition has been previously reported in previous studies 44 45 however compared with their studies where ph values were generally lower than 7 the ph value in the effluent of mwb was slightly higher biochar was demonstrated to be able to increase solution ph 46 the higher ph in mwb was probably caused by biochar addition since the pore water in the upper layer can be flushed into iwsz during each stormwater event which may neutralize the ph in the stagnant water in the iwsz besides the previous study indicates that the drop of ph in the woodchip based system was due to volatile fatty acids vfas generation during woodchip hydrolysis 45 vfas especially low molecular vfas can facilitate several different denitrifiers proliferation such as denitratisoma and dechloromonas 47 which is beneficial for effective denitrification in comparison orp and do showed a more significant difference between mwb and csb the effluent of mwb showed a significantly lower orp value than csb with the increase of effluent volume the orp value in mwb increased especially after 14 l as for do both systems showed a relatively low do concentration before 14 l with csb showing a slightly higher do than mwb after 14 l the do in mwb kept about 1 3 mg l while the do in csb increased drastically to about 6 mg l previous study demonstrated that biochar addition can increase soil moisture content which can further prolong the diffusion path of the influent and entrap do when the infiltration rate was low 28 we anticipate that even if do may penetrate through the biochar layer during drastic stormwater conditions it may be consumed quickly in the iwsz by woodchip decomposing in antecedent dry duration as well the stronger do resistance after woodchip and biochar addition effectively avoids the destruction of the anoxic environment of the iwsz the stable anoxic environment together with the organic matter decomposition in the iwsz both ensured sustainable denitrification in the iwsz of wmb 3 3 pollutant variation in pore water of the iwsz to further study the potential role of the iwsz on nitrate removal pore water was collected from iwsz during the 3 d antecedent dry duration fig 4 nh4 n concentration in pore water was very low at the beginning 0 h and it increased continuously in the mwb during antecedent dry duration and reached 1 31 0 13 mg l in 72 h fig 4a this result confirmed that although biochar addition greatly enhanced ammonium removal from influent ammonium was generated in situ in the iwsz in contrast the nh4 n in the iwsz of csb showed a decreasing trend its concentration in csb was about 1 0 mg l at 0 h and it decreased steadily to 0 31 0 10 mg l in 72 h the exist of nh4 n in the iwsz of csb indicates that ammonium was not fully absorbed by the upper layer of the csb a high amount of ammonium still entered into the iwsz during each rainfall event besides since nitrification was generally thought to take place in an aerobic environment the drop of nh4 n in the iwsz of csb during 72 h indirectly demonstrated that the anoxic environment in its iwsz was destroyed during rainfall events which also fit the poor do entrapment results of csb discussed in section 3 2 as for nitrate the iwsz of mwb demonstrated a much higher denitrification ability than the iwsz of csb the no3 n concentration in mwb declined drastically from 3 53 0 18 mg l to 0 38 0 10 mg l within the first 19 h and remained very low until 72 h in comparison the no3 n concentration in csb only steadily dropped it took csb 72 h for the no3 n concentration dropped from 4 35 0 38 mg l in to 2 18 0 23 mg l fig 4b the excellent denitrification in the iwsz after woodchip addition also fits the results of other studies 25 40 44 as one solid substrate woodchips can be degraded to bioavailable carbon sources e g low molecular vfas by several heterotrophic bacteria which make it can be further used by heterotropic denitrifiers 47 besides woodchip can also act as a supporter for microbial biofilm 25 studies even indicate that woodchip is more durable than other solid organic substrates such as compost and straw and has less excessive dissolved organic matter generation and nitrous oxide emissions potential 25 those merits make woodchips become an excellent choice for the iwsz modification as for nitrite the iwsz of mwb showed an initial no2 n generation in the first 3 h up to 0 34 0 08 mg l whereas it decreased to very low concentration within 19 h 0 03 0 04 mg l fig 4c the transient nitrite generation in the initial 19 h is probably caused by the rapid denitrification fig 4b as for csb no2 n stably exists in the iwsz for 72 h without obvious fluctuation approximately 0 1 to 0 2 mg l fig 4c we anticipate that this phenomenon was caused by incomplete nitrification as discussed before a constant drop of nh4 n was found in the iwsz of csb therefore apart from inadequate contact time the insufficient oxygen transfer to biofilm in the iwsz will also lead to limited nitrification as well as nitrite generation 25 generally for tn although its concentration in the mwb increased slightly after 19 h the overall tn removal performance was still higher in the iwsz of mwb than in the csb fig 4d 3 4 enhanced nitrate removal mechanism in the modified system to further explore and validate the enhanced nitrate removal mechanism after biochar and woodchip modification functional genes related to nitrification and denitrification were tested and the results are shown in fig 5 the upper layer of both systems showed a high abundance of amoa about 1 5 105 copies per gram of media within a similar range with the results tested in field scale bioretention system whose amoa abundance ranged from 104 to 106 copies per gram soil 48 this result indicates that the upper layer of both systems has enough nitrification ability however due to the low ammonium adsorption ability and lower water holding capacity csb cannot effectively remove the ammonium from the influent a large amount of ammonium will enter the lower part of the upper layer or iwsz the junction of anoxic area and aerobic area only a small amount of ammonium can be adsorbed by the upper layer of csb and be nitrified during antecedent dry durations accordingly compared to mwb the iwsz of csb showed a higher abundance of amoa which agreed with the results discussed above that nitrification also exists in the iwsz of csb in comparison the denitrification related genes i e nirs nosz and nirk showed a more interesting pattern both nirk and nirs are the important genes encoding nitrite reductases and control the step from nitrite to nitric oxide in denitrification while nosz plays an important role in nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas transformation 49 they were frequently used as the representative genes for denitrification activity 27 48 the abundance of nirs in both samples was relatively close however its abundance was one to two orders of magnitudes lower than nirk in contrast the abundance of nirk in the iwsz of mwb was about 12 times higher than that in csb and the abundance of nosz in the iwsz of mwb was even 125 times higher than that in csb the higher denitrification related genes also fit the higher denitrification ability found in section 3 3 compared to csb woodchip addition provided additional electron donors biochar and woodchip both helped the maintenance of the anoxic conditions in the iwsz all those factors are critical for denitrifier to proliferation meanwhile apart from poor denitrification the lack of nosz in the iwsz of csb may lead to other concerns since the nosz gene encodes the enzyme for the nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas transformation the lack of nosz activity is often deemed as an indicator of incomplete denitrification that could result in the emission of nitrous oxide a powerful greenhouse gas 50 51 unstable anoxic conditions and insufficient electron donors can both lead to incomplete denitrification and nitrous oxide generation 16 in contrast there is less likely to have this problem in the iwsz of the modified system as for the upper layer interestingly the nirk and nosz gene abundance in the upper layer of both csb and mwb were higher than their iwsz counterparts the decrease of abundance of denitrification related function gene with the increase of media depth was also reported by several studies 48 51 researches indicated that the higher denitrification gene in the upper layer suggests that there exists a denitrification microsite during inundation time following each rainfall event especially where contains organic matters such as plant debris and accumulated organic matter 51 since moss peat was used in the upper layer of both systems it is plausible that the denitrification hot zone also exists in the upper layer if inundation conditions were provided according to the data of the volumetric water content sensor the volumetric water content of the upper layer of mwb was about 0 40 0 45 m3 m3 and of the csb was approximately 0 22 0 32 m3 m3 fig 6 both systems showed an inundation time during and following each rainfall event compared with csb the upper layer of mwb showed a higher volumetric water content and longer inundation time than the upper layer of csb which indicates that biochar addition may form more denitrification microsite in the upper layer to prove this opinion according to the nitrogen removal results and data presented in phase ii an estimated nitrogen removal contribution of the different layer was calculated for csb the majority of nitrate include nitrate from influent and transformed by ammonium was removed by the iwsz 93 9 only 6 1 of nitrate was removed by the upper layer in comparison the nitrate removed by the iwsz and upper layer in mwb was 46 5 and 53 5 respectively this result further confirmed that biochar amendment greatly extends the denitrification reactive volume which led to almost half of nitrate being removed in the upper layer by in situ denitrification 3 5 implication for bioretention design and operation although woodchip was used more and more often in recent studies for nitrate removal in stormwater runoff several problems such as poor ammonium treatment nitrate leaching still exist especially during heavy rainfall events 25 a recent study also indicates that the woodchip amendment mainly performs effective denitrification during dry duration instead of the rainfall event due to the relative short hydraulic retention time 47 increasing woodchip filling content may generate more dissolved organic carbon in the pore water and help for the denitrification during the transitory rainfall events but it will inevitably increase the by product generation and capital cost this study provides a new idea to solve this problem i e using both biochar and woodchip amendment to enlarge reactive volume and enhance efficiency biochar can increase water holding ability and do resistance which can make the generally accepted aerobic upper layer of the bioretention system become a multiple function zone for both nitrification and denitrification the extended reactive volume can also help for do consumption and make the denitrification in iwsz of woodchip bioretention more stable meanwhile a high rate of denitrification was supported in the iwsz by woodchip in other words higher reactive volume provided by biochar can not only make the bioretention system achieve the same or even higher nitrogen removal than the conventional system but also effectively protect iwsz for denitrification meanwhile this new configuration can also decrease the operation cost during bioretention construction firstly as one co product of waste biomass from other processes biochar itself is economic 46 secondly the higher reactive volume enables to compress of the substrate height and decrease media usage besides this configuration may even show more flexibility for retrofit and achieve muti function for example biochar can be amended with fe al to achieve higher phosphorus removal 26 or be produced in a different procedure for antibiotics removal 52 4 conclusion this study developed a biochar woodchip modified bioretention system and compared it with the conventional sand bioretention system systematically the modified bioretention system achieved excellent nitrogen removal performance the tn and no3 n mass removal efficiency in the modified system could reach 58 0 10 8 and 46 8 21 1 respectively when 4 mg l no3 n and 4 mg l nh4 n was applied in influent higher than the conventional system whose tn and no3 n removal was only 12 9 6 7 and 38 6 18 4 respectively a set of analyses based on pore water variation functional genes analysis etc illustrate that biochar amendment in the upper layer facilitates ammonium adsorption and nitrification it also increased the volumetric water content and prolonged inundation time which facilitated the denitrification in the upper layer woodchip amendment greatly enhanced the denitrification rate in the iwsz despite the existence of a slight amount of ammonium generation besides an extremely low nosz gene abundance was found in the iwsz of the conventional system which also indicates that the conventional system is potentially a nitrous oxide source overall the modified biochar woodchip bioretention system was tested to be an effective alternative to the conventional system for enhanced nitrogen removal in stormwater runoff treatment more studies related to long term evaluation nitrous oxide emission as well as a pilot or field scale study were still needed in the future declaration of competing interest the authors

13078,bioretention has been increasingly used in stormwater runoff treatment however its performance was often restricted by poor treatment or even the net leaching of nitrate to solve this problem a biochar woodchip modified bioretention system was developed in this study the modified system greatly enhanced the nitrogen removal than the conventional sand bioretention system the nitrate removal efficiency in the modified bioretention system ranges between 46 8 21 1 and 73 6 6 5 much higher than the conventional system only 38 6 18 4 and 24 4 6 0 the nitrogen removal process pore water variation and functional gene analysis further demonstrate that the biochar and woodchip amendment extended the reactive volume in the bioreactor facilitating nitrogen removal in both the upper layer and internal water storage zone iwsz biochar amendment in the upper layer increased volumetric water content ammonium adsorption nitrification and denitrification although a slight amount of ammonium generation was found woodchip addition greatly enhanced the denitrification rate in the iwsz in contrast the upper layer of the conventional system cannot completely adsorb and transform ammonium the denitrification performance in both the upper layer and iwsz of the conventional system was poor as well and the lack of nosz in the iwsz also made it potentially become a nitrous oxide emission source overall the biochar woodchip modified system greatly extended the reactive volume and enhanced nitrogen removal making it become a promising alternative to conventional sand bioretention system for stormwater runoff nitrogen treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords low impact development bioretention system heterotrophic denitrification dissolved nitrogen internal water storage zone 1 introduction rapid urban development has led to the increase of urban impervious areas which greatly accelerates runoff accumulation excessive runoff volume not only caused potential urban flooding problems but also greatly enhanced the transportation of pollutants such as organic matter suspended solids and nutrients into the natural water body and led to several severe urban water problems such as algae blooms and eutrophication 1 3 to resolve the problem green infrastructures have been more and more frequently used in urban stormwater management 4 6 as one of the most commonly used green infrastructures bioretention also known as stormwater biofilter or rain garden has received extensive attention recently for its flexibility conventional bioretention systems are soil or sand made biofiltration systems that can remove pollutants via several physical and biogeochemical processes such as interception adsorption biotransformation and biodegradation 7 however several studies indicate that conventional bioretention systems can only effectively remove particulate pollutants it is difficult for the conventional system to remove dissolved nutrients especially nitrate 8 9 plant assimilation and microbial denitrification play the most important role in nitrate removal 10 among them microbial denitrification was a more desirable way since it can transform nitrate into nitrogen gas and remove it from the bioretention system permanently 11 12 however due to the lack of carbon sources in stormwater runoff and drastic change of stormwater conditions effective denitrification generally cannot be achieved in the conventional bioretention system 12 bioretention media and configuration are critical influencing factors for dissolved nitrogen removal because they will influence both physical and biogeochemical processes accordingly developing and optimizing the key design factor related to media and configuration for enhanced nitrate removal has received extensive attention 13 the most common amendment way is by elevating the outlet to create an internal water storage zone iwsz this kind of amendment was tested to be able to help maintain an anoxic zone and increase water holding capacity as well as hydraulic retention time which is conducive for denitrification 14 17 several studies reported that the iwsz amendment does increase denitrification performance 18 19 however nitrate leaching was still observed in those iwsz modified systems 20 21 apart from the iwsz media amendment is another way for enhanced pollutant removal several amended media such as water treatment residual 22 fly ash 23 biochar and organic matter containing material 24 were proposed however only organic matter was commonly reported to be effective for enhanced nitrate removal for it can generate dissolved organic carbon for heterotrophic denitrification and the performance of organic matter amendment was reported to be varied greatly from effective removal to net leaching 25 recently biochar was reported to be able to increase nitrate removal in bioretention systems by increasing media water content pollutant accumulation and decreasing dissolved oxygen etc 26 29 however nitrate leaching was still found when biochar modified bioretention systems without iwsz was used to treat ammonium dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate simultaneously 30 the main reason is nitrate transformed by organic nitrogen and ammonium can lead to a high amount of nitrate generation in the upper layer of the bioretention system those parts of nitrate can be leached quickly during the next rainfall event 30 31 therefore the more effective way to remove nitrate by bioretention systems still needs to be tested given the need for enhanced nitrogen removal in the bioretention system this study developed and tested a modified biochar woodchip layered bioretention system this study aims to a assess the newly established modified system in terms of nitrogen removal performance b study the difference of nitrogen treatment process between the modified system and conventional sand bioretention system and c explore the mechanism for the enhanced nitrogen treatment after biochar and woodchip amendment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention system establishment in this study two conventional sand bioretention reactors csb and two modified biochar woodchip bioretention reactors mwb were established using acrylic 30 cm i d 120 cm height each reactor contained five layers from the bottom up drainage layer 5 cm transition layer 5 cm submerged layer 40 cm upper layer 45 cm and cobblestone protection layer 5 cm fig 1 filling media include 0 075 mm to 4 75 mm quartz sands pine woodchip local horticultural company moss peat nord agri sia latvia and biochar toroyal group china biochar was produced by pine wood at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c the media were analysed for basic properties according to the guideline to get a suitable filling scheme 32 an ec 5 sensor connected with an em 50 data collector was inserted into the media during filling and these instruments were used for volumetric water content monitoring after media filling the surface of the bioretention reactors was covered with aluminium film to prevent the influence of light the detailed property of each reactor was listed in table 1 more reactor design information can be found in our previous study 33 2 2 experimental procedures synthetic stormwater was prepared by tap water in each test 180 l tap water was collected beforehand and stood for more than one day to eliminate the residual chlorine thereafter at the beginning of each test dechlorinated water was further mixed with a machine mixer 1 h for aeration then the pre prepared pollutant stock solution was added into the dechlorinated water and stirred uniformly by a machine mixer potassium nitrate kno3 and ammonium chloride nh4cl were used to simulate nitrate and ammonium pollutant in phase i 4 mg l no3 n was prepared in the synthetic stormwater and in phase ii both 4 mg l no3 n and 4 mg l nh4 n were prepared to achieve an 8 mg l tn in synthetic stormwater the pollutant concentration referred to the typical highway runoff concentration monitored in chongqing china 34 35 phase i aims to evaluate the nitrate removal ability of the two systems and phase ii aims to test whether ammonium will lead to nitrate leaching and diminish the nitrogen removal performance of those systems received stormwater volume for two phases was the same and it was calculated as v a φ h where a cm2 indicates the estimated catchment area which was set to be twenty times of the surface area of each reactor 706 5 cm2 φ refers to the runoff coefficient and it is assumed to be 0 7 which is in the range of dense urban areas h mm is the rainfall depth which indicates the height of rainfall that will accumulate on the surface if penetration was neglected and this parameter is 25 mm the calculated influent synthetic stormwater was 24 7 l all simulated rainfall events last 2 h which leads to a flow rate of 205 8 ml min or a hydraulic loading rate of equal to 175 mm h the antecedent dry duration for both phases was 3 days i e the simulated rainfall event was applied for bioretention reactors after 72 h of the last simulated rainfall event synthetic stormwater was distributed to each reactor using peristaltic pumps and sprinkler heads for each reactor a calibrated bucket was used to receive the effluent and count the volume of effluent during the routine experiment stormwater was mixed uniformly in the bucket immediately when no obvious effluent was observed after each rainfall event and a 500 ml water sample was collected for further analysis at the end of each phase two intensive sampling experiments were conducted to test the pollutant removal process during intensive sampling experiments six water samples were taken for each reactor at the time when effluent volumes were 3 5 7 10 5 14 17 5 21 l using 100 ml sampling bottles to test the pollutant variation in the iwsz eight 50 ml pore water samples were collected for each reactor at 0 1 3 7 19 31 55 and 72 h from the water sample port between port 5 and port 7 of the iwsz during the 3 d antecedent dry duration 2 3 sampling and data analysis during the routine experiment the total effluent volume of each reactor was recorded and the collected water sample was analysed for no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn pollutant mass removal efficiency r was used and it was calculated as eq 2 2 r 1 v out c out v in c in where vin and vout l are the influent and effluent volume of each reactor cin and cout are the influent and effluent pollutant concentrations three parameters include ph oxidant reduction potential

multifunctional detectors wtw 3620 german and orp value was measured by another orp meter hq30d hach usa pore water samples and all the water samples collected in the intensive sampling were analysed following the same procedure with routine experiments nitrogen species i e no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn were analysed using uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa based on standard methods within 24 h after water samples collection statistical analysis of anova was performed to test whether there have significant differences between two variables using spss a p value of 0 05 was used as the threshold of significant difference 2 4 functional gene analysis after phase ii media from different layers of each reactor were collected for functional gene analysis all the media were frozen at 80 c until dna extraction m5635 02mag bind soil dna kit omega china was utilized for total genomic dna extraction based on manufacturing instructions the purification and pretreatment steps followed the manufacturer s protocols as well dna concentrations were measured using nanodrop 2000 thermo usa genes encoding 1 ammonia monooxygenase amoa 2 copper containing nitrite reductases nirk 3 haem containing nitrite reductases nirs and 4 nitrous oxide reductase nosz were selected as the representative of genes for enzymes of nitrification and denitrification they were amplified using real time quantitative polymerase chain reactions qpcr conducted on edc 810 real time pcr equipment eastwin beijing china primers for each gene were according to the studies of 36 39 the detailed primers

normalized with samples weight expressed as copies g 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall nitrogen removal performance in phase i and phase ii the results of the nitrogen concentration and nitrogen mass removal in the effluent of csb and wmb during phase i and phase ii are shown in table 3 in phase i only 4 mg l no3 n was applied in the influent mwb showed almost three times higher no3 n removal than csb which indicates that media amendment greatly enhanced denitrification of the modified bioretention system although there did not exist ammonium in the influent in this phase nh4 n was still detected in the effluent of both systems especially mwb which was probably caused by media in situ decomposition ammonium leaching was also found in several other studies where the bioretention system was modified with organic matters 40 41 as for nitrite it was below the detection limit for all influent samples and the concentration in the effluent is very low as well in phase ii both reactors could maintain a relatively high removal performance of nh4 n without significant difference p 0 05 several studies demonstrate that the higher ion exchange ability of biochar makes it outperform sand for ammonium adsorption 42 43 due to the potentially existing in situ generations of ammonium in the iwsz of mwb the nearly same nh4 n removal indirectly demonstrate that biochar addition in the current study enhanced ammonium removal from influent as for nitrate the no3 n removal in both systems decreased in phase ii the nitrate transformed from adsorbed ammonium through nitrification was demonstrated to be able to lead to a higher nitrate leaching 11 nevertheless compared with csb whose effluent no3 n concentration rose by about 1 87 mg l from phase i to phase ii the no3 n concentration in the effluent of mwb only rose by approximately 0 96 mg l this result further demonstrates that the modified bioretention system greatly enhanced nitrate removal performance even when ammonium was applied in influent as for nitrite all systems showed higher nitrite generation than phase i after 4 mg l nh4 n was added since almost no no2 n was generated in phase i the reason for nitrite generation in phase ii is highly possible to be incomplete nitrification as for tn although tn removal of csb in phase ii was slightly lower than in phase i the difference was not significant p 0 05 similar results were also found for mwb whose tn removal slightly increased in phase ii but no significant difference was found p 0 05 the relatively close tn removal efficiency between the two phases of wmb also indicates that higher nitrogen mass reduction was achieved in wmb in phase ii if 24 7 l influent volume was used for calculation the mass removal of tn in each wmb reactor was about 106 1 15 7 mg during each experiment in phase ii this figure is about 2 times higher than the tn mass removal of wmb in phase i 53 9 7 8 mg in comparison the tn mass removal in csb was only 19 7 7 6 mg and 21 9 13 1 mg in phase i and phase ii respectively compared with csb biochar and woodchip amendment greatly enhanced the tn removal performance 3 2 nitrogen removal processes in the conventional and modified system to further study the difference in terms of nitrogen removal processes in the csb and wmb two intensive samplings were conducted nh4 n removal processes were similar in mwb between two phases fig 2a the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of mwb was about 1 2 mg l before 10 5 l while it decreased steadily to about 0 7 mg l in 21 l in both phases in comparison the nh4 n variation pattern in csb changed dramatically between phase i and phase ii the nh4 n concentration kept relatively low all the time in phase i however in phase ii the nh4 n concentration in effluent of csb increased steadily from about 0 4 mg l in 3 5 l to approximately 1 2 mg l in 21 l the height of iwsz is 0 45 m if 0 45 was used as estimated porosity to calculate the pore volume the estimated pore volume of iwsz was approximately 14 3 l table 1 therefore the different patterns of the two systems indicate that the ammonium in the effluent of the two systems came from different sources for mwb the ammonium was mainly generated in the iwsz the potential media decomposing caused the initial high nh4 n in contrast relatively poor ammonium adsorption of sand in the upper layer make csb cannot effectively absorb the ammonium from influent which leads to an increase in nh4 n when effluent volume increased in comparison both systems showed a similar no3 n variation between two phases the no3 n concentration kept slightly below 4 mg l in csb in phase i fig 2b after ammonium addition in phase ii the effluent concentration of no3 n kept similar with phase i before 10 5 l while after 10 5 l it raised rapidly to almost 11 mg l in 21 l as for mwb a very low no3 n concentration was found in its effluent in both two phases before 14 l however it increased to about 4 mg l and almost 11 mg l in phase i and phase ii respectively compared to csb the much lower no3 n pollution level in the effluent of wmb further indicates that biochar and woodchip amendment significantly increase denitrification performance although nitrate leaching still exists especially when ammonium was added in the influent the wmb showed a lower and lagged nitrate breakthrough than csb those results indicate that the modified system can maintain a higher resistance to nitrate leaching than the conventional system as for no2 n fig 2c its concentration in both systems kept very low in the first phase however in phase ii the no2 n concentration in both systems increased with the increase of effluent volume especially for csb no2 n range between 0 11 0 01 mg l and 0 36 0 10 mg l as discussed in section 3 1 the nitrite generated in phase ii is highly possible caused by nitrification the low contact times caused by high hydraulic loading rates in the current study may lead to incomplete nitrification which can result in nitrite accumulation 25 overall for tn since the majority nitrogen species in the effluent of both systems is no3 n the tn variation in the effluent generally showed a similar pattern with no3 n media amendment in the modified system greatly increased tn removal in both phases especially before 17 5 l apart from nitrogen species ph orp and do were also analysed during intensive sampling as shown in fig 3 the effluent ph in both systems was between 7 0 and 7 5 the effluent of mwb showed a slightly lower ph than csb which is caused by media property table 1 in phase ii the effluent ph decreased with the increase of effluent volume in both systems which might be attributed to alkalinity consumption led by the nitrification process the decrease of ph after woodchip addition has been previously reported in previous studies 44 45 however compared with their studies where ph values were generally lower than 7 the ph value in the effluent of mwb was slightly higher biochar was demonstrated to be able to increase solution ph 46 the higher ph in mwb was probably caused by biochar addition since the pore water in the upper layer can be flushed into iwsz during each stormwater event which may neutralize the ph in the stagnant water in the iwsz besides the previous study indicates that the drop of ph in the woodchip based system was due to volatile fatty acids vfas generation during woodchip hydrolysis 45 vfas especially low molecular vfas can facilitate several different denitrifiers proliferation such as denitratisoma and dechloromonas 47 which is beneficial for effective denitrification in comparison orp and do showed a more significant difference between mwb and csb the effluent of mwb showed a significantly lower orp value than csb with the increase of effluent volume the orp value in mwb increased especially after 14 l as for do both systems showed a relatively low do concentration before 14 l with csb showing a slightly higher do than mwb after 14 l the do in mwb kept about 1 3 mg l while the do in csb increased drastically to about 6 mg l previous study demonstrated that biochar addition can increase soil moisture content which can further prolong the diffusion path of the influent and entrap do when the infiltration rate was low 28 we anticipate that even if do may penetrate through the biochar layer during drastic stormwater conditions it may be consumed quickly in the iwsz by woodchip decomposing in antecedent dry duration as well the stronger do resistance after woodchip and biochar addition effectively avoids the destruction of the anoxic environment of the iwsz the stable anoxic environment together with the organic matter decomposition in the iwsz both ensured sustainable denitrification in the iwsz of wmb 3 3 pollutant variation in pore water of the iwsz to further study the potential role of the iwsz on nitrate removal pore water was collected from iwsz during the 3 d antecedent dry duration fig 4 nh4 n concentration in pore water was very low at the beginning 0 h and it increased continuously in the mwb during antecedent dry duration and reached 1 31 0 13 mg l in 72 h fig 4a this result confirmed that although biochar addition greatly enhanced ammonium removal from influent ammonium was generated in situ in the iwsz in contrast the nh4 n in the iwsz of csb showed a decreasing trend its concentration in csb was about 1 0 mg l at 0 h and it decreased steadily to 0 31 0 10 mg l in 72 h the exist of nh4 n in the iwsz of csb indicates that ammonium was not fully absorbed by the upper layer of the csb a high amount of ammonium still entered into the iwsz during each rainfall event besides since nitrification was generally thought to take place in an aerobic environment the drop of nh4 n in the iwsz of csb during 72 h indirectly demonstrated that the anoxic environment in its iwsz was destroyed during rainfall events which also fit the poor do entrapment results of csb discussed in section 3 2 as for nitrate the iwsz of mwb demonstrated a much higher denitrification ability than the iwsz of csb the no3 n concentration in mwb declined drastically from 3 53 0 18 mg l to 0 38 0 10 mg l within the first 19 h and remained very low until 72 h in comparison the no3 n concentration in csb only steadily dropped it took csb 72 h for the no3 n concentration dropped from 4 35 0 38 mg l in to 2 18 0 23 mg l fig 4b the excellent denitrification in the iwsz after woodchip addition also fits the results of other studies 25 40 44 as one solid substrate woodchips can be degraded to bioavailable carbon sources e g low molecular vfas by several heterotrophic bacteria which make it can be further used by heterotropic denitrifiers 47 besides woodchip can also act as a supporter for microbial biofilm 25 studies even indicate that woodchip is more durable than other solid organic substrates such as compost and straw and has less excessive dissolved organic matter generation and nitrous oxide emissions potential 25 those merits make woodchips become an excellent choice for the iwsz modification as for nitrite the iwsz of mwb showed an initial no2 n generation in the first 3 h up to 0 34 0 08 mg l whereas it decreased to very low concentration within 19 h 0 03 0 04 mg l fig 4c the transient nitrite generation in the initial 19 h is probably caused by the rapid denitrification fig 4b as for csb no2 n stably exists in the iwsz for 72 h without obvious fluctuation approximately 0 1 to 0 2 mg l fig 4c we anticipate that this phenomenon was caused by incomplete nitrification as discussed before a constant drop of nh4 n was found in the iwsz of csb therefore apart from inadequate contact time the insufficient oxygen transfer to biofilm in the iwsz will also lead to limited nitrification as well as nitrite generation 25 generally for tn although its concentration in the mwb increased slightly after 19 h the overall tn removal performance was still higher in the iwsz of mwb than in the csb fig 4d 3 4 enhanced nitrate removal mechanism in the modified system to further explore and validate the enhanced nitrate removal mechanism after biochar and woodchip modification functional genes related to nitrification and denitrification were tested and the results are shown in fig 5 the upper layer of both systems showed a high abundance of amoa about 1 5 105 copies per gram of media within a similar range with the results tested in field scale bioretention system whose amoa abundance ranged from 104 to 106 copies per gram soil 48 this result indicates that the upper layer of both systems has enough nitrification ability however due to the low ammonium adsorption ability and lower water holding capacity csb cannot effectively remove the ammonium from the influent a large amount of ammonium will enter the lower part of the upper layer or iwsz the junction of anoxic area and aerobic area only a small amount of ammonium can be adsorbed by the upper layer of csb and be nitrified during antecedent dry durations accordingly compared to mwb the iwsz of csb showed a higher abundance of amoa which agreed with the results discussed above that nitrification also exists in the iwsz of csb in comparison the denitrification related genes i e nirs nosz and nirk showed a more interesting pattern both nirk and nirs are the important genes encoding nitrite reductases and control the step from nitrite to nitric oxide in denitrification while nosz plays an important role in nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas transformation 49 they were frequently used as the representative genes for denitrification activity 27 48 the abundance of nirs in both samples was relatively close however its abundance was one to two orders of magnitudes lower than nirk in contrast the abundance of nirk in the iwsz of mwb was about 12 times higher than that in csb and the abundance of nosz in the iwsz of mwb was even 125 times higher than that in csb the higher denitrification related genes also fit the higher denitrification ability found in section 3 3 compared to csb woodchip addition provided additional electron donors biochar and woodchip both helped the maintenance of the anoxic conditions in the iwsz all those factors are critical for denitrifier to proliferation meanwhile apart from poor denitrification the lack of nosz in the iwsz of csb may lead to other concerns since the nosz gene encodes the enzyme for the nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas transformation the lack of nosz activity is often deemed as an indicator of incomplete denitrification that could result in the emission of nitrous oxide a powerful greenhouse gas 50 51 unstable anoxic conditions and insufficient electron donors can both lead to incomplete denitrification and nitrous oxide generation 16 in contrast there is less likely to have this problem in the iwsz of the modified system as for the upper layer interestingly the nirk and nosz gene abundance in the upper layer of both csb and mwb were higher than their iwsz counterparts the decrease of abundance of denitrification related function gene with the increase of media depth was also reported by several studies 48 51 researches indicated that the higher denitrification gene in the upper layer suggests that there exists a denitrification microsite during inundation time following each rainfall event especially where contains organic matters such as plant debris and accumulated organic matter 51 since moss peat was used in the upper layer of both systems it is plausible that the denitrification hot zone also exists in the upper layer if inundation conditions were provided according to the data of the volumetric water content sensor the volumetric water content of the upper layer of mwb was about 0 40 0 45 m3 m3 and of the csb was approximately 0 22 0 32 m3 m3 fig 6 both systems showed an inundation time during and following each rainfall event compared with csb the upper layer of mwb showed a higher volumetric water content and longer inundation time than the upper layer of csb which indicates that biochar addition may form more denitrification microsite in the upper layer to prove this opinion according to the nitrogen removal results and data presented in phase ii an estimated nitrogen removal contribution of the different layer was calculated for csb the majority of nitrate include nitrate from influent and transformed by ammonium was removed by the iwsz 93 9 only 6 1 of nitrate was removed by the upper layer in comparison the nitrate removed by the iwsz and upper layer in mwb was 46 5 and 53 5 respectively this result further confirmed that biochar amendment greatly extends the denitrification reactive volume which led to almost half of nitrate being removed in the upper layer by in situ denitrification 3 5 implication for bioretention design and operation although woodchip was used more and more often in recent studies for nitrate removal in stormwater runoff several problems such as poor ammonium treatment nitrate leaching still exist especially during heavy rainfall events 25 a recent study also indicates that the woodchip amendment mainly performs effective denitrification during dry duration instead of the rainfall event due to the relative short hydraulic retention time 47 increasing woodchip filling content may generate more dissolved organic carbon in the pore water and help for the denitrification during the transitory rainfall events but it will inevitably increase the by product generation and capital cost this study provides a new idea to solve this problem i e using both biochar and woodchip amendment to enlarge reactive volume and enhance efficiency biochar can increase water holding ability and do resistance which can make the generally accepted aerobic upper layer of the bioretention system become a multiple function zone for both nitrification and denitrification the extended reactive volume can also help for do consumption and make the denitrification in iwsz of woodchip bioretention more stable meanwhile a high rate of denitrification was supported in the iwsz by woodchip in other words higher reactive volume provided by biochar can not only make the bioretention system achieve the same or even higher nitrogen removal than the conventional system but also effectively protect iwsz for denitrification meanwhile this new configuration can also decrease the operation cost during bioretention construction firstly as one co product of waste biomass from other processes biochar itself is economic 46 secondly the higher reactive volume enables to compress of the substrate height and decrease media usage besides this configuration may even show more flexibility for retrofit and achieve muti function for example biochar can be amended with fe al to achieve higher phosphorus removal 26 or be produced in a different procedure for antibiotics removal 52 4 conclusion this study developed a biochar woodchip modified bioretention system and compared it with the conventional sand bioretention system systematically the modified bioretention system achieved excellent nitrogen removal performance the tn and no3 n mass removal efficiency in the modified system could reach 58 0 10 8 and 46 8 21 1 respectively when 4 mg l no3 n and 4 mg l nh4 n was applied in influent higher than the conventional system whose tn and no3 n removal was only 12 9 6 7 and 38 6 18 4 respectively a set of analyses based on pore water variation functional genes analysis etc illustrate that biochar amendment in the upper layer facilitates ammonium adsorption and nitrification it also increased the volumetric water content and prolonged inundation time which facilitated the denitrification in the upper layer woodchip amendment greatly enhanced the denitrification rate in the iwsz despite the existence of a slight amount of ammonium generation besides an extremely low nosz gene abundance was found in the iwsz of the conventional system which also indicates that the conventional system is potentially a nitrous oxide source overall the modified biochar woodchip bioretention system was tested to be an effective alternative to the conventional system for enhanced nitrogen removal in stormwater runoff

13079,in this study impact of different inoculum on the performance of membrane bioreactors mbrs was investigated for municipal wastewater treatment waste sludges from a conventional activated sludge cas system and a high rate activated sludge hras system were used as inoculums at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively a commercial ultrafiltration uf membrane was tested in parallel with a low cost polyester hollow fiber support material dynamic membrane dm uf and dm membranes were operated for 67 days at a flux of 8 l m2 h at each stage high chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod removal efficiencies 86 and 74 respectively low mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration 10 mg l and low turbidity values were achieved in permeates at each stage extracellular polymeric substances eps content was higher at stage 1 which caused an increase in sludge resistance to filtration srf and sludge volume index svi based on morphological analysis compact dynamic cake layer was formed on the support material at stage 1 while porous dynamic layer was formed at stage 2 thus dm was operated at lower tmp at stage 2 based on the results obtained from the study sludge from hras system showed better performance as inoculum compared to the sludge from cas system for dm applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dynamic membrane hollow fiber inoculum sludge membrane bioreactor municipal wastewater 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs have been developed as an alternative for conventional biological treatment systems for industrial and municipal wastewater treatment 1 2 secondary clarifiers are substituted with microfiltration or ultrafiltration uf membranes for solid separation in mbr applications since the solids can be kept inside the reactor sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt can be decoupled in mbrs thus the volume of the treatment system can be reduced by operating the system at high mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration high effluent quality can be provided by mbrs in terms of suspended solids and microbiological contaminations however cost of membrane module and fouling are the main factors that can limit the feasibility of full scale mbrs especially for municipal wastewater treatment 3 therefore recent research studies focused on those problems that cause limitations for the mbr applications self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfdmbr technology can be an alternative option in place of conventional membranes 4 dynamic membrane dm layer is a secondary layer that forms on the surface of a low cost support material by the deposition of solid particles such as sludge flocs and microbial cells 5 until the formation of dm layer small sludge particles solutes and colloids can easily pass through the pores of support material which results in high organic matter concentration in the permeate however once the dm formed on the support layer high permeate quality can be achieved during the operation 6 effluent quality of the sfdmbr is similar with conventional mbr under the same operating conditions for treatment of municipal wastewater 7 physical cleaning such as water backwashing air backwashing or brushing can be applied in case of permeability reduction 8 however chemical cleaning can be required for complete flux recovery 9 whereas physical cleaning is not enough to remove the irreversible fouling 10 unstable operation of sfdmbr due to excessive deposition of solids is still the main obstacle to the full scale applications sludge type and characteristics have an important role in the treatment and filtration efficiency of sfdmbr systems generally mbrs are inoculated with waste activated sludge was that has the functional bacteria group for organic degradation under aerobic conditions 11 however change in operational conditions can change sludge characteristics and bacterial composition 12 therefore effective operation of sfdmbrs not only depends on the operational conditions but also biological processes that affect sludge properties such as mlss extracellular polymeric substances eps floc size and morphology and viscosity increase in mlss concentration can lead to a rapid formation of dm and increase in transmembrane pressure tmp 13 various researchers reported eps and soluble microbial products smp as major and prominent cause for membrane fouling in mbrs 14 15 16 17 however eps and smp have an important role for dm formation in sfdmbr eps and smp are mainly composed of protein hydrophobic and carbohydrates hydrophilic 18 19 therefore the increase in protein carbohydrates would increase the hydrophobicity and the adhesiveness of the biofilm thus dm layer can be formed in a short time 4 20 viscosity is another important parameter that affects membrane permeability sludge with higher viscosity is corresponded to higher filtration resistance 21 liang et al 16 stated that a dense cake layer was formed in sfdmbrs because of high viscosity of the sludge which is mainly correlated with carbohydrate fraction of eps furthermore larger flocs size in the sludge was reported to accelerate the formation the dm layer 22 microbial community of the sludge is also important for the operation of sfdmbrs since some bacteria are responsible for producing more eps and presenting more bridging in small flocs 23 which could affect the dm formation therefore determination of the sludge characteristics is necessary to have a stable operation for sfdmbr high rate activated sludge hras systems have become a keystone for energy efficient wastewater treatment unlike conventional activated sludge cas processes hras process is operated at short srts and hrts and low dissolved oxygen do concentrations thus energy recovery is maximized since more organics are adsorbed by bacteria and redirected to sludge stream for anaerobic sludge digestion 24 25 excess sludge obtained from the hras process has different characteristics compared to cas process such as having lower eps and sludge volume index svi 26 thus inoculation of a mbr system with waste sludge from hras systems may be beneficial in order to have an operation under lower and stable tmp the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of using different inoculums on the performance of a mbr for municipal wastewater treatment excess sludge from cas and hras systems were used as inoculums in the study conventional uf membrane was tested in parallel with a low cost polyester hollow fiber support material at the same conditions both inoculums were characterized to observe the changes during the operational period treatment and filtration performances of both membranes were investigated environmental scanning electron microscopy esem analysis was conducted for the observation of cake dm layer structure that was accumulated on the membrane the information obtained from this study is valuable to understand inoculum sludge effect on sfdmbrs operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum characterization two different inoculum sources that were obtained from the return activated sludge line of a full scale biological nutrient removal plant and was line of a pilot scale hras process were used as seed sludges at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively the characteristics of seed sludges used at each stage are presented in table 1 2 2 wastewater characterization municipal wastewater was used as substrate in this study wastewater was taken from the effluent of an aerated grit chamber of a full scale preliminary wastewater treatment plant the characteristics of the wastewater used at each stage are illustrated in table 2 2 3 membrane characteristics two u shaped membrane modules referred as dm and uf were used at each stage a multi multifilament polyester filter was used as a support material for dm formation an uf membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf was used in the study the median pore size of the support material was 8 times higher than that of uf membrane the characteristics of each membrane are provided in table 3 2 4 experimental setup a laboratory scale submerged mbr 5 2 l was used in this study fig 1 the reactor was equipped with a pump watson marlow 300 series uk for wastewater feeding and two vacuum pumps longer bt100 2j china for obtaining permeate from each membrane module uf and dm modules do was provided by an air diffuser placed at the bottom of the reactor the system was equipped with do temperature and ph probes a level sensor and two pressure transmitters jumo midas germany a computer was connected to the system to control programmable logic controller plc and record the data by using a supervisory control and data acquisition scada program 2 5 experimental procedure uf module and the polyester support material were submerged in the bioreactor the reactor was fed with raw wastewater at room temperature for 67 days at each stage the flux of each membrane was increased gradually till it reached to an average value of 8 l m2 h during the first days of operation the formation of dm on the support material was expected which could be confirmed by increase in tmp and improvement in permeate quality 7 air diffuser was used in the bioreactor to maintain do concentration at average value of 2 9 0 8 mg l during the operation the system was operated at each stage at hrt of 0 87 days and organic loading rate olr of 0 42 kg cod m3 d no sludge was wasted except for sampling during the operation the system was operated in cycles of filtration and backwash by using the permeate pump in reverse mode during the backwashing filtration and backwash periods were set as 190 and 35 s respectively these periods were reported to be effective for the operation of stable mbrs without quick deposition of excessive cake layer 7 2 6 experimental analyses ts vs mlss mlvss cod scod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n tn tp and svi were measured based on standard methods 27 a capillary suction time cst analyzer triton electronics type 304 m was used to measure cst of sludge a turbiditimeter hach 2100 p usa was used to measure the turbidity of the influent and permeate d50 values of sludge was determined by using mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments hydro 2000 mu uk zeta potential measurements were made by using a zetasizer malvern nano z uk analyzer ion chromatography ic was used for quantitative measurement of anion and cation ions in the liquid samples ion measurements were performed with tripton capillary suction type ic device dionex ics 3000 usa smp and eps contents of sludge were measured by applying the following procedures a volume of 21 ml sludge sample was added to a flask and centrifuged at 4000g for 5 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered by a 0 45 μm filter and the filtrate was collected for smp determination the precipitated part of the sludge is used for eps measurement 7 ml phosphate buffer solution pbs was added to the flask and mixed with a vortex to re suspend the precipitated part then 14 ml pre heated 60 c pbs was added to the flask and mixed with vortex for 1 min a high speed centrifuge 4000g for 10 min at 4 c was applied to collect the supernatant for loosely bound eps lb eps measurement re suspension was made with 21 ml pre heated 60 c pbs and then the suspension was heated for 30 min at 60 c after 30 min the sample was cooled down to the room temperature and centrifuged at 4000g for 15 min the supernatant was collected for tightly bound eps tb eps measurement by using d glucose as standard solution at a wavelength of 490 nm 28 modified lowry method 29 was used for protein measurement with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard solution at a wavelength of 750 nm sludge resistance to filtration srf of sludge samples was examined with stirred dead end filtration system amicon model 8010 usa the cell was filled with 10 ml of sludge sample and nitrogen gas was applied to fix the pressure at 0 5 bar a balance was connected to the computer for recording mass of permeate within 15 s time intervals flat sheet celluse membrane filter millipore pltk02510 was used as filtering media

of permeate pa s t is filtration time s δp is applied pressure kpa and v is filtrate volume m3 at the end of the operation periods the membranes were taken out of the reactor the membranes were cut into an appropriate size and air dried at 4 c before morphological analysis the surface of the membranes was imaged by an esem thermo fisher scientific inc fei quanta feg 250 esem uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge characteristics mlss mlvss concentrations and mlvss mlss ratio during the operational period of stage 1 and stage 2 are shown in fig 2 the average mlss concentrations at stage 1 and stage 2 were 6944 145 mg l and 6832 151 mg l with average mlvss mlss ratios of 65 8 and 62 1 respectively average cod concentration at stage 1 was 7133 129 mg l which was close to the cod concentration of the inoculum sludge average cod concentration at stage 2 decreased from 9934 mg l to 7006 118 mg l which could be partly explained by the soluble organics that might pass through the membrane since higher scod was measured in the inoculum of stage 2 compared to stage 1 due to the operation of hras system at much shorter srts and lower do concentration compared to the cas system excess sludge obtained from the hras system might contain more easily biodegradable organics these organics were degraded at the first days of operation where do concentration in the reactor was more than 2 mg l the average ph was found to be 7 33 0 17 and 6 95 0 14 at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively lower ph at stage 2 confirmed that more organics were degraded and thus carbon dioxide was produced which caused a slight decrease in ph fig 2 d psd at stage 1 did not change significantly during the whole operational period fig 3 a the biggest fraction of particle size contributing more than 42 was in the range of 20 50 μm higher amount of coarse 500 1000 μm and fine 0 20 μm particles were found in the inoculum of stage 2 fig 3 b compared to stage 1 during the operation period of stage 2 the percentage of coarse particles decreased which might be related to flocs breakage due to shear force of the vigorous aeration inside the reactor 31 besides the percentage of fine particles decreased as well which might be a result of solubilization of the organics and passing through the membranes at stage 2 after 14 days at stage 2 the particles that have a size range of 20 50 μm formed the biggest fraction of psd more than 41 which was similar to stage 1 d50 values were stable during the experimental period of each stage the average d50 of sludge at stage 1 and stage 2 were 45 5 1 0 and 41 6 0 8 μm respectively cst and sludge particle size are both substantial parameters for fouling characterization and dm formation 16 32 the cst values were stable during the operation period of stage 1 however cst of sludge was high at the beginning of stage 2 and decreased till the system reached to the steady state conditions fig 4 the average cst of sludge at stage 1 and stage 2 were 30 1 4 and 22 6 3 0 s respectively svi is a significant parameter related to sludge settleability 33 svi was 155 3 1 ml g at stage 1 and 69 0 32 ml g at stage 2 according to yu et al 34 svi value varied between 69 and 246 ml g in a sfdmbr they reported that the lower settleability caused higher filtration resistance eps is mainly characterized by protein and carbohydrates moreover the major fraction of eps is protein that provides hydrophobicity therefore more eps content in sludge is a sign of more hydrophobicity 4 table 4 shows the eps content including lb eps and tb eps and smp concentrations in the sludge at each stage total eps content and smp concentration were higher at stage 1 compared to stage 2 meng et al 35 reported that higher sludge hydrophobicity distinctly increased the membrane fouling due to attaching of sludge flocs onto each other and also membrane surface according to yu et al 34 initial cake layer formation time could be shortened with higher hydrophobicity which was related to the protein content of the sludge hence it can be concluded that eps content has a predominant effect on both membrane fouling and dm formation smp concentration was measured as 17 7 0 8 mg g mlvss at stage 1 which was higher than the one measured at stage 2 increase of smp could increase the sludge viscosity which affected the settling properties of sludge adversely 4 higher svi values measured at stage 1 could be related with the higher smp concentration at stage 1 lb eps was higher at stage 1 which was reported to be more responsible for membrane fouling in comparison to tb eps 36 a strong positive correlation between lb eps and svi is available for activated sludge 37 zeta potential is an effective parameter to understand both the surface charge of the sludge flocs and particles and fouling behavior of the sludge in mbr systems the average zeta potential values were determined as 23 6 0 6 and 17 0 2 1 mv for stage 1 and stage 2 respectively several researchers showed that the surface charge of sludge flocs is highly affected by the eps content 38 39 thus the difference between zeta potential of stage 1 and stage 2 might be related to the difference in eps content between stage 1 and stage 2 srf analyses were conducted in order to examine the sludge filterability difference at stage 1 and stage 2 average srf values were found as 3 20 1010 and 1 29 1010 m kg at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively ahmed et al 40 reported that srf decreased from 1 2 1012 to 6 1011 m kg when srt increased from 20 to 60 days in an mbr since srt in this study was infinite lower srf values were obtained which were in accordance with the above mentioned study ion concentrations in sludge are presented in table 5 for each stage na and cl concentrations in the inoculum sludge sample were 180 2 and 190 8 mg l respectively at stage 1 table 1 however the concentrations of these ions in the sludge increased to 2231 171 and 4830 43 mg l respectively at stage 1 the reason behind this increase was related to the high salinity of the wastewater used as the substrate at each stage on the other hand compared to inoculum sludge nh4 concentrations of stage 1 and stage 2 decreased form 120 1 and 261 4 to below 0 125 mg l at each stage since the reactor was aerated continuously it was expected that nh4 was converted to no3 via nitrification process the concentrations of no3 were higher in sludge compared to inoculum sludge at each stage which shows that no3 was accumulated in the reactor the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were higher at stage 1 these ions have an important role in bacterial cell attachment and biofilm structure maturation and biofilm development 41 thus more compact biofilm could be expected at stage 1 3 2 treatment performance the initial turbidity values in the permeate of dm and uf at stage 1 were 5 54 and 2 61 ntu respectively fig 5 turbidity in the permeate of dm gradually decreased during the operation period which confirmed the formation of the dynamic cake layer 7 the average turbidity in the permeate were determined as 1 20 0 35 and 0 86 0 33 for dm and uf at steady state conditions at stage 1 at stage 2 the initial turbidity values in the permeate of dm and uf were measured as 81 53 and 6 04 ntu respectively the higher turbidity values at stage 2 might be related with presence of more fine particles in the inoculum sludge at stage 2 compared to the inoculum sludge used at stage 1 which could pass through the membrane turbidity in the permeate of dm decreased throughout the operational period at stage 2 due to the formation of dynamic cake layer under steady state conditions the average turbidity in the permeate of dm and uf were obtained as 1 68 0 57 and 0 56 0 10 ntu respectively at stage 2 cod and scod concentrations in the permeate of each membrane and cod removal efficiencies achieved at each stage are illustrated in fig 6 high cod and scod removal efficiencies were obtained at each stage average cod concentrations in the permeate of dm and uf at stage 1 were 50 0 4 5 and 50 2 3 5 mg l respectively fig 6 a average scod concentrations of dm and uf at stage 1 were 44 1 5 3 and 45 6 4 1 mg l with removal efficiencies of 75 0 3 0 and 74 0 3 0 respectively fig 6 b average cod concentrations in the permeate of dm and uf were 46 9 2 3 and 46 2 2 6 mg l respectively at stage 2 cod removal efficiencies of dm and uf were 86 9 1 2 and 87 1 1 1 respectively fig 6 c average scod concentrations of dm and uf at stage 2 were 38 5 2 0 and 39 3 2 5 mg l with removal efficiencies of 76 6 2 8 and 76 1 3 2 respectively fig 6 d hras process was used to capture the organic matter present in wastewater while minimizing biological oxidation of organics 42 therefore hras sludge is a significant source of highly biodegradable organic compounds the biodegradable organic carbon in the sludge was degraded at the beginning of the operation period which resulted in high cod and scod concentrations in the permeate of dm and uf at stage 2 treatment performances of dm and uf for each stage are presented in table 6 mlss concentrations in the permeate of each membrane were less than 10 mg l at each stage the system was operated under aerobic conditions without anoxic and anaerobic zone therefore lower removal efficiencies were observed for tn and tp nh4 n removal efficiencies were found higher than 99 which was expected since only nitrification could occur poostchi et al 43 obtained removal efficiencies of more than 90 for cod 80 for nh4 n with a turbidity less than 5 ntu in the permeate by using a similar membrane material in an mbr for treating synthetic wastewater 3 3 filtration performance fig 7 shows the tmp profiles and operational fluxes obtained at stage 1 and stage 2 the flux was increased gradually from 2 to 8 l m2 h tmp of uf membrane was stable during the whole operation at each stage the average tmps of uf membrane at stage 1 and stage 2 were 48 3 and 52 1 mbar respectively the average membrane filtration resistances of uf were 2 03 1015 and 2 17 1015 m 1 at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively in contrary dm was operated at higher tmp compared to the uf membrane at each stage at stage 1 tmp increased significantly in the first few days and reached stable conditions after 16 days this increase indicated the formation of dynamic cake layer 13 the average tmp of dm was 588 33 mbar at stage 1 after stable condition was obtained whereas at stage 2 the average tmp of dm was 422 3 mbar dm was operated at higher tmp at stage 1 because srf of sludge was higher at stage 1 compared to stage 2 cho et al 14 indicated that as the bound eps increased srf value increased as well moreover relationship was found between eps and tmp bound eps at stage 1 was higher than the one at stage 2 table 4 therefore difference between the srf values of two stages might be related to the difference in bound eps content higher srf values at stage 1 indicated that resistance to filtration at stage 1 was higher than that at stage 2 which was confirmed with tmp data shown in fig 7 the average membrane filtration

13079,in this study impact of different inoculum on the performance of membrane bioreactors mbrs was investigated for municipal wastewater treatment waste sludges from a conventional activated sludge cas system and a high rate activated sludge hras system were used as inoculums at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively a commercial ultrafiltration uf membrane was tested in parallel with a low cost polyester hollow fiber support material dynamic membrane dm uf and dm membranes were operated for 67 days at a flux of 8 l m2 h at each stage high chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod removal efficiencies 86 and 74 respectively low mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration 10 mg l and low turbidity values were achieved in permeates at each stage extracellular polymeric substances eps content was higher at stage 1 which caused an increase in sludge resistance to filtration srf and sludge volume index svi based on morphological analysis compact dynamic cake layer was formed on the support material at stage 1 while porous dynamic layer was formed at stage 2 thus dm was operated at lower tmp at stage 2 based on the results obtained from the study sludge from hras system showed better performance as inoculum compared to the sludge from cas system for dm applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dynamic membrane hollow fiber inoculum sludge membrane bioreactor municipal wastewater 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs have been developed as an alternative for conventional biological treatment systems for industrial and municipal wastewater treatment 1 2 secondary clarifiers are substituted with microfiltration or ultrafiltration uf membranes for solid separation in mbr applications since the solids can be kept inside the reactor sludge retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt can be decoupled in mbrs thus the volume of the treatment system can be reduced by operating the system at high mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration high effluent quality can be provided by mbrs in terms of suspended solids and microbiological contaminations however cost of membrane module and fouling are the main factors that can limit the feasibility of full scale mbrs especially for municipal wastewater treatment 3 therefore recent research studies focused on those problems that cause limitations for the mbr applications self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfdmbr technology can be an alternative option in place of conventional membranes 4 dynamic membrane dm layer is a secondary layer that forms on the surface of a low cost support material by the deposition of solid particles such as sludge flocs and microbial cells 5 until the formation of dm layer small sludge particles solutes and colloids can easily pass through the pores of support material which results in high organic matter concentration in the permeate however once the dm formed on the support layer high permeate quality can be achieved during the operation 6 effluent quality of the sfdmbr is similar with conventional mbr under the same operating conditions for treatment of municipal wastewater 7 physical cleaning such as water backwashing air backwashing or brushing can be applied in case of permeability reduction 8 however chemical cleaning can be required for complete flux recovery 9 whereas physical cleaning is not enough to remove the irreversible fouling 10 unstable operation of sfdmbr due to excessive deposition of solids is still the main obstacle to the full scale applications sludge type and characteristics have an important role in the treatment and filtration efficiency of sfdmbr systems generally mbrs are inoculated with waste activated sludge was that has the functional bacteria group for organic degradation under aerobic conditions 11 however change in operational conditions can change sludge characteristics and bacterial composition 12 therefore effective operation of sfdmbrs not only depends on the operational conditions but also biological processes that affect sludge properties such as mlss extracellular polymeric substances eps floc size and morphology and viscosity increase in mlss concentration can lead to a rapid formation of dm and increase in transmembrane pressure tmp 13 various researchers reported eps and soluble microbial products smp as major and prominent cause for membrane fouling in mbrs 14 15 16 17 however eps and smp have an important role for dm formation in sfdmbr eps and smp are mainly composed of protein hydrophobic and carbohydrates hydrophilic 18 19 therefore the increase in protein carbohydrates would increase the hydrophobicity and the adhesiveness of the biofilm thus dm layer can be formed in a short time 4 20 viscosity is another important parameter that affects membrane permeability sludge with higher viscosity is corresponded to higher filtration resistance 21 liang et al 16 stated that a dense cake layer was formed in sfdmbrs because of high viscosity of the sludge which is mainly correlated with carbohydrate fraction of eps furthermore larger flocs size in the sludge was reported to accelerate the formation the dm layer 22 microbial community of the sludge is also important for the operation of sfdmbrs since some bacteria are responsible for producing more eps and presenting more bridging in small flocs 23 which could affect the dm formation therefore determination of the sludge characteristics is necessary to have a stable operation for sfdmbr high rate activated sludge hras systems have become a keystone for energy efficient wastewater treatment unlike conventional activated sludge cas processes hras process is operated at short srts and hrts and low dissolved oxygen do concentrations thus energy recovery is maximized since more organics are adsorbed by bacteria and redirected to sludge stream for anaerobic sludge digestion 24 25 excess sludge obtained from the hras process has different characteristics compared to cas process such as having lower eps and sludge volume index svi 26 thus inoculation of a mbr system with waste sludge from hras systems may be beneficial in order to have an operation under lower and stable tmp the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of using different inoculums on the performance of a mbr for municipal wastewater treatment excess sludge from cas and hras systems were used as inoculums in the study conventional uf membrane was tested in parallel with a low cost polyester hollow fiber support material at the same conditions both inoculums were characterized to observe the changes during the operational period treatment and filtration performances of both membranes were investigated environmental scanning electron microscopy esem analysis was conducted for the observation of cake dm layer structure that was accumulated on the membrane the information obtained from this study is valuable to understand inoculum sludge effect on sfdmbrs operations 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum characterization two different inoculum sources that were obtained from the return activated sludge line of a full scale biological nutrient removal plant and was line of a pilot scale hras process were used as seed sludges at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively the characteristics of seed sludges used at each stage are presented in table 1 2 2 wastewater characterization municipal wastewater was used as substrate in this study wastewater was taken from the effluent of an aerated grit chamber of a full scale preliminary wastewater treatment plant the characteristics of the wastewater used at each stage are illustrated in table 2 2 3 membrane characteristics two u shaped membrane modules referred as dm and uf were used at each stage a multi multifilament polyester filter was used as a support material for dm formation an uf membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf was used in the study the median pore size of the support material was 8 times higher than that of uf membrane the characteristics of each membrane are provided in table 3 2 4 experimental setup a laboratory scale submerged mbr 5 2 l was used in this study fig 1 the reactor was equipped with a pump watson marlow 300 series uk for wastewater feeding and two vacuum pumps longer bt100 2j china for obtaining permeate from each membrane module uf and dm modules do was provided by an air diffuser placed at the bottom of the reactor the system was equipped with do temperature and ph probes a level sensor and two pressure transmitters jumo midas germany a computer was connected to the system to control programmable logic controller plc and record the data by using a supervisory control and data acquisition scada program 2 5 experimental procedure uf module and the polyester support material were submerged in the bioreactor the reactor was fed with raw wastewater at room temperature for 67 days at each stage the flux of each membrane was increased gradually till it reached to an average value of 8 l m2 h during the first days of operation the formation of dm on the support material was expected which could be confirmed by increase in tmp and improvement in permeate quality 7 air diffuser was used in the bioreactor to maintain do concentration at average value of 2 9 0 8 mg l during the operation the system was operated at each stage at hrt of 0 87 days and organic loading rate olr of 0 42 kg cod m3 d no sludge was wasted except for sampling during the operation the system was operated in cycles of filtration and backwash by using the permeate pump in reverse mode during the backwashing filtration and backwash periods were set as 190 and 35 s respectively these periods were reported to be effective for the operation of stable mbrs without quick deposition of excessive cake layer 7 2 6 experimental analyses ts vs mlss mlvss cod scod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n tn tp and svi were measured based on standard methods 27 a capillary suction time cst analyzer triton electronics type 304 m was used to measure cst of sludge a turbiditimeter hach 2100 p usa was used to measure the turbidity of the influent and permeate d50 values of sludge was determined by using mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments hydro 2000 mu uk zeta potential measurements were made by using a zetasizer malvern nano z uk analyzer ion chromatography ic was used for quantitative measurement of anion and cation ions in the liquid samples ion measurements were performed with tripton capillary suction type ic device dionex ics 3000 usa smp and eps contents of sludge were measured by applying the following procedures a volume of 21 ml sludge sample was added to a flask and centrifuged at 4000g for 5 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered by a 0 45 μm filter and the filtrate was collected for smp determination the precipitated part of the sludge is used for eps measurement 7 ml phosphate buffer solution pbs was added to the flask and mixed with a vortex to re suspend the precipitated part then 14 ml pre heated 60 c pbs was added to the flask and mixed with vortex for 1 min a high speed centrifuge 4000g for 10 min at 4 c was applied to collect the supernatant for loosely bound eps lb eps measurement re suspension was made with 21 ml pre heated 60 c pbs and then the suspension was heated for 30 min at 60 c after 30 min the sample was cooled down to the room temperature and centrifuged at 4000g for 15 min the supernatant was collected for tightly bound eps tb eps measurement by using d glucose as standard solution at a wavelength of 490 nm 28 modified lowry method 29 was used for protein measurement with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard solution at a wavelength of 750 nm sludge resistance to filtration srf of sludge samples was examined with stirred dead end filtration system amicon model 8010 usa the cell was filled with 10 ml of sludge sample and nitrogen gas was applied to fix the pressure at 0 5 bar a balance was connected to the computer for recording mass of permeate within 15 s time intervals flat sheet celluse membrane filter millipore pltk02510 was used as filtering media

of permeate pa s t is filtration time s δp is applied pressure kpa and v is filtrate volume m3 at the end of the operation periods the membranes were taken out of the reactor the membranes were cut into an appropriate size and air dried at 4 c before morphological analysis the surface of the membranes was imaged by an esem thermo fisher scientific inc fei quanta feg 250 esem uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge characteristics mlss mlvss concentrations and mlvss mlss ratio during the operational period of stage 1 and stage 2 are shown in fig 2 the average mlss concentrations at stage 1 and stage 2 were 6944 145 mg l and 6832 151 mg l with average mlvss mlss ratios of 65 8 and 62 1 respectively average cod concentration at stage 1 was 7133 129 mg l which was close to the cod concentration of the inoculum sludge average cod concentration at stage 2 decreased from 9934 mg l to 7006 118 mg l which could be partly explained by the soluble organics that might pass through the membrane since higher scod was measured in the inoculum of stage 2 compared to stage 1 due to the operation of hras system at much shorter srts and lower do concentration compared to the cas system excess sludge obtained from the hras system might contain more easily biodegradable organics these organics were degraded at the first days of operation where do concentration in the reactor was more than 2 mg l the average ph was found to be 7 33 0 17 and 6 95 0 14 at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively lower ph at stage 2 confirmed that more organics were degraded and thus carbon dioxide was produced which caused a slight decrease in ph fig 2 d psd at stage 1 did not change significantly during the whole operational period fig 3 a the biggest fraction of particle size contributing more than 42 was in the range of 20 50 μm higher amount of coarse 500 1000 μm and fine 0 20 μm particles were found in the inoculum of stage 2 fig 3 b compared to stage 1 during the operation period of stage 2 the percentage of coarse particles decreased which might be related to flocs breakage due to shear force of the vigorous aeration inside the reactor 31 besides the percentage of fine particles decreased as well which might be a result of solubilization of the organics and passing through the membranes at stage 2 after 14 days at stage 2 the particles that have a size range of 20 50 μm formed the biggest fraction of psd more than 41 which was similar to stage 1 d50 values were stable during the experimental period of each stage the average d50 of sludge at stage 1 and stage 2 were 45 5 1 0 and 41 6 0 8 μm respectively cst and sludge particle size are both substantial parameters for fouling characterization and dm formation 16 32 the cst values were stable during the operation period of stage 1 however cst of sludge was high at the beginning of stage 2 and decreased till the system reached to the steady state conditions fig 4 the average cst of sludge at stage 1 and stage 2 were 30 1 4 and 22 6 3 0 s respectively svi is a significant parameter related to sludge settleability 33 svi was 155 3 1 ml g at stage 1 and 69 0 32 ml g at stage 2 according to yu et al 34 svi value varied between 69 and 246 ml g in a sfdmbr they reported that the lower settleability caused higher filtration resistance eps is mainly characterized by protein and carbohydrates moreover the major fraction of eps is protein that provides hydrophobicity therefore more eps content in sludge is a sign of more hydrophobicity 4 table 4 shows the eps content including lb eps and tb eps and smp concentrations in the sludge at each stage total eps content and smp concentration were higher at stage 1 compared to stage 2 meng et al 35 reported that higher sludge hydrophobicity distinctly increased the membrane fouling due to attaching of sludge flocs onto each other and also membrane surface according to yu et al 34 initial cake layer formation time could be shortened with higher hydrophobicity which was related to the protein content of the sludge hence it can be concluded that eps content has a predominant effect on both membrane fouling and dm formation smp concentration was measured as 17 7 0 8 mg g mlvss at stage 1 which was higher than the one measured at stage 2 increase of smp could increase the sludge viscosity which affected the settling properties of sludge adversely 4 higher svi values measured at stage 1 could be related with the higher smp concentration at stage 1 lb eps was higher at stage 1 which was reported to be more responsible for membrane fouling in comparison to tb eps 36 a strong positive correlation between lb eps and svi is available for activated sludge 37 zeta potential is an effective parameter to understand both the surface charge of the sludge flocs and particles and fouling behavior of the sludge in mbr systems the average zeta potential values were determined as 23 6 0 6 and 17 0 2 1 mv for stage 1 and stage 2 respectively several researchers showed that the surface charge of sludge flocs is highly affected by the eps content 38 39 thus the difference between zeta potential of stage 1 and stage 2 might be related to the difference in eps content between stage 1 and stage 2 srf analyses were conducted in order to examine the sludge filterability difference at stage 1 and stage 2 average srf values were found as 3 20 1010 and 1 29 1010 m kg at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively ahmed et al 40 reported that srf decreased from 1 2 1012 to 6 1011 m kg when srt increased from 20 to 60 days in an mbr since srt in this study was infinite lower srf values were obtained which were in accordance with the above mentioned study ion concentrations in sludge are presented in table 5 for each stage na and cl concentrations in the inoculum sludge sample were 180 2 and 190 8 mg l respectively at stage 1 table 1 however the concentrations of these ions in the sludge increased to 2231 171 and 4830 43 mg l respectively at stage 1 the reason behind this increase was related to the high salinity of the wastewater used as the substrate at each stage on the other hand compared to inoculum sludge nh4 concentrations of stage 1 and stage 2 decreased form 120 1 and 261 4 to below 0 125 mg l at each stage since the reactor was aerated continuously it was expected that nh4 was converted to no3 via nitrification process the concentrations of no3 were higher in sludge compared to inoculum sludge at each stage which shows that no3 was accumulated in the reactor the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were higher at stage 1 these ions have an important role in bacterial cell attachment and biofilm structure maturation and biofilm development 41 thus more compact biofilm could be expected at stage 1 3 2 treatment performance the initial turbidity values in the permeate of dm and uf at stage 1 were 5 54 and 2 61 ntu respectively fig 5 turbidity in the permeate of dm gradually decreased during the operation period which confirmed the formation of the dynamic cake layer 7 the average turbidity in the permeate were determined as 1 20 0 35 and 0 86 0 33 for dm and uf at steady state conditions at stage 1 at stage 2 the initial turbidity values in the permeate of dm and uf were measured as 81 53 and 6 04 ntu respectively the higher turbidity values at stage 2 might be related with presence of more fine particles in the inoculum sludge at stage 2 compared to the inoculum sludge used at stage 1 which could pass through the membrane turbidity in the permeate of dm decreased throughout the operational period at stage 2 due to the formation of dynamic cake layer under steady state conditions the average turbidity in the permeate of dm and uf were obtained as 1 68 0 57 and 0 56 0 10 ntu respectively at stage 2 cod and scod concentrations in the permeate of each membrane and cod removal efficiencies achieved at each stage are illustrated in fig 6 high cod and scod removal efficiencies were obtained at each stage average cod concentrations in the permeate of dm and uf at stage 1 were 50 0 4 5 and 50 2 3 5 mg l respectively fig 6 a average scod concentrations of dm and uf at stage 1 were 44 1 5 3 and 45 6 4 1 mg l with removal efficiencies of 75 0 3 0 and 74 0 3 0 respectively fig 6 b average cod concentrations in the permeate of dm and uf were 46 9 2 3 and 46 2 2 6 mg l respectively at stage 2 cod removal efficiencies of dm and uf were 86 9 1 2 and 87 1 1 1 respectively fig 6 c average scod concentrations of dm and uf at stage 2 were 38 5 2 0 and 39 3 2 5 mg l with removal efficiencies of 76 6 2 8 and 76 1 3 2 respectively fig 6 d hras process was used to capture the organic matter present in wastewater while minimizing biological oxidation of organics 42 therefore hras sludge is a significant source of highly biodegradable organic compounds the biodegradable organic carbon in the sludge was degraded at the beginning of the operation period which resulted in high cod and scod concentrations in the permeate of dm and uf at stage 2 treatment performances of dm and uf for each stage are presented in table 6 mlss concentrations in the permeate of each membrane were less than 10 mg l at each stage the system was operated under aerobic conditions without anoxic and anaerobic zone therefore lower removal efficiencies were observed for tn and tp nh4 n removal efficiencies were found higher than 99 which was expected since only nitrification could occur poostchi et al 43 obtained removal efficiencies of more than 90 for cod 80 for nh4 n with a turbidity less than 5 ntu in the permeate by using a similar membrane material in an mbr for treating synthetic wastewater 3 3 filtration performance fig 7 shows the tmp profiles and operational fluxes obtained at stage 1 and stage 2 the flux was increased gradually from 2 to 8 l m2 h tmp of uf membrane was stable during the whole operation at each stage the average tmps of uf membrane at stage 1 and stage 2 were 48 3 and 52 1 mbar respectively the average membrane filtration resistances of uf were 2 03 1015 and 2 17 1015 m 1 at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively in contrary dm was operated at higher tmp compared to the uf membrane at each stage at stage 1 tmp increased significantly in the first few days and reached stable conditions after 16 days this increase indicated the formation of dynamic cake layer 13 the average tmp of dm was 588 33 mbar at stage 1 after stable condition was obtained whereas at stage 2 the average tmp of dm was 422 3 mbar dm was operated at higher tmp at stage 1 because srf of sludge was higher at stage 1 compared to stage 2 cho et al 14 indicated that as the bound eps increased srf value increased as well moreover relationship was found between eps and tmp bound eps at stage 1 was higher than the one at stage 2 table 4 therefore difference between the srf values of two stages might be related to the difference in bound eps content higher srf values at stage 1 indicated that resistance to filtration at stage 1 was higher than that at stage 2 which was confirmed with tmp data shown in fig 7 the average membrane filtration resistances of dm were 2 46 1016 and 1 77 1016 m 1 at stage 1 and stage 2 respectively on the other hand vergine et al 32 established a close relationship between cst and filterability of mixed liquor in a sfdmbr it was reported that tmp increase was observed when cst increased moreover sludge in stage 2 showed better settleability properties than the sludge in stage 1 in terms of svi which caused higher filtration resistance at stage 1 34 these findings were in accordance with this study in which higher tmp was observed when the sludge had higher cst at stage 1 3 4 morphological analyses the virgin support material and uf membrane dm layer formed on the surface of the support materials and sludge accumulation on the uf membrane were visualized by esem at each stage fig 8 a f fig 8 a and b show the multi multifilament structure of the support material and virgin uf membrane respectively a compact and homogenous dm layer formed at stage 1 fig 8 c could be related with high eps content this compact layer could result in high levels of tmp 44 however porous dm layer was formed on the surface of the support material at stage 2 fig 8 e this higher porosity allowed dm to be operated at lower tmp at stage 2 compared to stage 1 45 cake layer structure was observed on the surface of uf membrane at each stage fig 8 d and f which explained the similarity in tmp values of uf membranes at each stage 4 conclusions impact of different inoculum sources on the performance of a mbr was evaluated for the treatment of municipal wastewater excess sludge from cas stage 1 and hras stage 2 systems were used as inoculums similar treatment performances were obtained with dm and uf membrane at each stage with quite high cod removal efficiencies 86 low turbidity values around 1 ntu and low mlss concentrations 10 mg l in the permeates thus dm can be suggested to be a feasible alternative for conventional membranes for full scale mbrs smp concentration and bound eps content of sludge were
