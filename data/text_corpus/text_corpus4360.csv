21800,this paper presents a study on reconstruction errors of wave force around a circular cylinder using measured wave elevation data through theoretical analysis and experimental validation since the accuracy of reconstructed results is directly subjected to the collected data of wave elevation some unexpected errors can be injected into the results as the data are not informative enough a mathematical analysis is presented first which considers the wave gauges uniformly distributed around the cylinder with the number of three five seven and nine amplitude error and phase error of the reconstructed wave force are defined to quantify the effect of distribution and number of wave gauges an experiment was conducted to validate the theoretical results for both amplitude and phase errors it shows that experimental data with three wave gauges can be well predicted by using theoretical analysis based on the theoretical results an amended method is proposed to improve the reconstructed results with three wave gauges the amended method is proved by the test data to be an efficient method in some specific situations finally a comprehensive discussion on the difference between two kinds of processing method of the reconstructed wave force is performed keywords circular cylinder wave force reconstruction error wave surface elevation potential theory experimental validation 1 introduction vertical cylinders are frequently used as support components for offshore structures for a constructed structure reconstructing the wave force on it in a complex wave field has become necessary for data collection and safety monitoring making this reconstruction is still a practical problem faced by researchers and engineers the wave induced action on the vertical circular cylinders has been studied for many years some empirical approaches utilizing the morison equation morison et al 1950 are frequently used for cylinders that are small compared with the wavelength of incoming waves based on the short term statistical properties of the sea waves the wave force spectrum composed of an inertial force in phase with the local flow acceleration and a drag force proportional to the square of the instantaneous flow velocity can generally be calculated by a transfer function because of its convenience and ease of use the morison equation has already been applied in many applications for instance to improve the efficiency of sea wave energy converters by combining deterministic sea wave prediction dswp with constrained optimal control li et al 2012 to estimate the wave force on a structure under random wave field and control its vibration luo and zhu 2006 ma et al 2006 and to investigate the fluid structure interaction with wave action fish et al 1980 yang and li 2013 for larger cylindrical structures the morison equation is no longer accurate and substituted by the diffraction method based on potential theory finnegan et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and numerical methods like boundary element method bem finite element method fem and finite volume method fvm kang et al 2015 liu et al 2011 paulsen et al 2014 tao et al 2007 xiao et al 2013 however few of the methods mentioned above have been applied to the field test or the safety monitoring of such structures as to the field measurements one practical method is to distribute the pressure transducers around the structure and multiply the measured data by the adjacent area then the wave force can be gained from integrating around the surface of the body however unlike in the laboratory the pressure transducers around the prototype structure are easy to break and hard to be replaced due to the deep water sediment and other physical challenges an alternative method should be developed to solve the physical problem compared with measuring water pressure wave elevation around the structure is more easily obtained in real time this indicates an indirect method using the measured data of wave elevation to provide a shortcut for determining the wave force on the body boccotti et al 2012 predicted the wave force for a truncated cylinder by using the morison equation in a random wave field with measured data of in site wave elevation the accuracy of prediction is improved by adjusting the inertia and drag coefficients with different values of keulegan carpenter number k c and reynolds re number however this method requires that the wave field is undisturbed by the objective structure a requirement that constrains the method s application in most situations with the frame of potential theory the connection between water pressure and free surface elevation has already investigated by many researchers a popular issue is the reconstruction of the wave field from bottom pressure measurements by linear models bishop and donelan 1987 tsai et al 2005 or by nonlinear models bonneton and lannes 2017 clamond and constantin 2013 deconinck et al 2012 these studies have shown the possibility of translation between the different physical quantities in a hydrodynamic problem such kind of relation for the physical quantities has also been implied by lotfollahi yaghin et al 2012 who used artificial neural network ann a popular model free method for establishing a relationship between two variances or more to build a prediction model between the inline wave force and the wave surface elevation on a vertical cylinder later liu et al 2018 established a new method to reconstruct wave force in real time by using the recorded data of wave elevation around the cylindrical structure with a large diameter compared with the wavelength the effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by a hydrodynamic experiment conducted on a circular cylinder in an unknown wave field in the study of liu et al 2018 twelve wave gauges are employed around the cylinder to record the data of free surface elevation however the proper number of wave gauges and the errors of reconstructed results as the data is inadequate are still unclear therefore in this study the errors of wave forces obtained by the linear reconstruction method with fewer wave gauges are researched the structure of the paper is as follows 2 formulates the amplitude and phase errors of the reconstructed wave force by using the mathematics model the effect of the wave gauge number and their locations on the reconstruction errors are investigated 3 performs an experimental validation comprising several regular wave and irregular wave tests the error analysis is conducted on the reconstructed wave force by being compared with the measured wave force an amended method is proposed to reduce the reconstruction errors 4 gives a further discussion about the reconstruction errors with two different processing methods finally the main findings of the present work are summarized in the last section 2 formulae of the physical problem and error analysis 2 1 mathematics model in this section a mathematical model is built to investigate the errors of the reconstructed wave force which is derived from the theoretical results of wave elevation around the cylinder the linear reconstruction method provided by liu et al 2018 is utilized for the modeling a brief review of this method is shown in appendix a fig 1 shows the diagram of wave interaction with a uniform circular cylinder which is assumed to be rigid and mounted at the bottom of the seabed the radius of the cylinder is r 0 in this study the origin of the coordinate system is set inside the cross section at the still water level swl the axis r θ for polar coordinate and x y for cartesian coordinate are defined in the horizontal plane and the z axis is perpendicular to the swl and positive upward the free surface of the incident wave η i x y t for the multi directional wave can be obtained from the sum of a series of the linear wave from different directions then the linear free surface of the incident wave has the form as 1 η i x y t j 1 n j a j cos k j x ω j t ψ j where n j is the number of the wave components a j is the wave amplitude for the component j ω j and ψ j are the wave frequency and phase respectively the vectors x and k j are x x i y j and k j k x j i k y j j where i and j represent the unit vectors in x and y axis with the airy wave assumption the relation between wave number and frequency is ω j 2 k j g tanh k j h the exposure angle κ j can be obtained from κ j arctan k y j k x j the velocity potential of the incident wave corresponding to η i x y t is 2 φ i j 1 n j a j c j z n j n k j r e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j where h is the depth of the water and j n is the first kind of bessel function function c j z has a form of 3 c j z i g ω j cosh k j z h cosh k j h where g is the gravity acceleration based on the study of maccamy and fuchs 1954 the diffraction wave potential can be given as 4 φ s j 1 n j a j c j z n a j n h n k j r e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j where h n is the first kind of hankel function and a j m is 5 a j n j n k j r 0 h n k j r 0 the total wave potential φ is the sum of φ s and φ i it is 6 φ j 1 n j a j c j z n j n k j r a j n h n k j r e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j the wave elevation around the cylinder can be calculated by 7 η θ t 1 g re φ t z 0 r r 0 substituting eq 6 into eq 7 8 η θ t re j 1 n j a j n j n k j r 0 a j n h n k j r 0 e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j by using the relation of 9 j n k j r 0 h n k j r 0 h n k j r 0 j n k j r 0 2 i π k j r 0 eq 8 for wave elevation η θ t can be reduced to 10 η θ t re n j 1 n j a j h n k j r 0 2 i π k j r 0 e i n π 2 κ j e i ω j t i ψ j e i n θ then eq 10 can be rewritten in the following form 11 η θ t n α n t e i n θ where α n t is a function only depending on t η θ t need to be processed in the frequency domain before the reconstruction for the wave force the processed wave elevation can be written as 12 η f θ t n α n t e i n θ where α n t is a function of t the expressions of α n t and α n t are given in appendix b when the incident wave is monochromatic n j 1 α n t only consists of one frequency component the absolute value of its amplitude is defined as d n the expression of d n is shown in appendix b as an example the values of d n versus k r 0 are shown in fig 2 the parameters used for fig 2 include k 1 k κ 1 0 ψ 1 0 a 1 1 and r 0 h 3 8 fig 2 illustrates that d n converges to zero as n because h n k j r 0 a denominator in eq 10 tends to be infinity another feature found in fig 2 is that d n has larger values but a narrower bandwidth for smaller values of k r 0 the wave force is reconstructed by 13 f θ 0 t a f 0 2 π η f θ t cos θ θ 0 d θ where a f ρ g r 0 and θ 0 is the angular coordinate of the vector f θ 0 t substituting eq 12 into eq 13 one can obtain 14 f θ 0 t a f π α 1 t α 1 t cos θ 0 i α 1 t α 1 t sin θ 0 in practice the time histories of wave elevation are measured at finite sites around the cylinder the angular variables for these sites are θ 1 θ 2 θ 2 n 1 where 2 n 1 n 1 2 3 is the total number of sites the total number of wave gauges used here is odd which will be discussed in 4 the discussion of fig 2 indicates that α n t can be neglected if n is large enough therefore n can be truncated at a special order b to obtain a linear system with finite equations a new function η ˆ f θ t with finite terms of α ˆ n t is defined as 15 η ˆ f θ t n b b α ˆ n t e i n θ with η ˆ f θ t related to η f θ t by η ˆ f θ n t η f θ n t n 1 2 3 2 n 1 when b n eq 15 can be assembled into a matrix form as 16 m n b n c b n t j n t where the matrices shown in eq 16 are 17 m n b n m b n θ 1 m b n θ 2 m b n θ 2 n 1 18 m b n θ e i b θ e i b 1 θ 1 e i b 1 θ e i b θ 19 c b n t α ˆ b t α ˆ b 1 t α ˆ 0 t α ˆ b 1 t α ˆ b t t 20 j n t η ˆ f θ 1 t η ˆ f θ 2 t η ˆ f θ 2 n 1 t t because the matrix m n b n is invertible as proven in appendix c the coefficient matrix c b n can be obtained by 21 c b n t m n b n 1 j n t then the wave force can be obtained by substituting α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t into eq 14 and replacing α 1 t and α 1 t respectively 2 2 theoretical results to investigate the effect of the number of wave gauges on the reconstructed wave force an analysis with monochromatic waves is performed theoretically the velocity potential of the incident wave propagating along the x axis with unit amplitude is 22 φ i c z m j m k r e i m π 2 e i m θ e i ω t following the process from eqs 2 10 the time history of wave elevation around the cylinder can be given as 23 η θ t b θ cos ω t ϕ θ where b θ and ϕ θ are the amplitude and phase for η θ t based on the previous study liu et al 2018 the processed wave elevations are given by 24 η ˆ f θ t tanh k h k b θ cos ω t ϕ θ then the detailed process of the analysis can be summarized as step 1 calculating the time history curves of theoretical wave force and wave elevation η θ t at the sites θ 1 θ 2 θ 2 n 1 by using wave diffraction theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 taking the theoretical wave force as the target wave force step 2 calculating η ˆ f θ t by using eq 24 and obtaining α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t by using eq 21 step 3 reconstructing the wave force with α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t by using eq 14 step 4 calculating the reconstruction errors between the target wave force obtained in step 1 and the reconstructed wave force obtained in step 3 the reconstruction errors can be categorized into amplitude error and phase error the amplitude error is used to evaluate the accuracy of the amplitude of the reconstructed results the phase error is used to evaluate whether the reconstructed results are synchronized with the target wave force the amplitude error of the reconstructed wave force is defined as 25 e f a f r a f t a f t where a f r is the amplitude of the reconstructed wave force and a f t is the amplitude of the target wave force similarly the phase error of the reconstructed wave force is defined as 26 e p f t f r t f t t f t where t f r is the instantaneous time corresponding to the peak value of reconstructed wave force t f t is the instantaneous time corresponding to the peak value of target wave force t f t is the period of the target wave force to obtain α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t from eq 21 two wave gauges are necessary to build the linear equation system of eq 16 as the total number of wave gauges should be odd at least three wave gauges are therefore needed for using the present method fig 3 shows four configurations of wave gauges uniformly distributed around the cylinder with the total number being three five seven and nine respectively to simplify the discussion symbols of th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are used to represent these configurations mentioned above as shown in this figure each configuration has a variance of β which can change the location of the wave gauges fig 4 shows the contours of e f with different wave gauge configurations as listed in fig 3 the horizontal coordinate k r 0 is in the range of 0 6 and the vertical coordinate is β within a period for each configuration respectively the value of the contours varies from 2 to 2 with negative value shown in blue and positive value in red the cases in the red region indicate that the linear reconstruction method would overestimate the wave force and the cases in the blue region on the contrary would underestimate the wave force in this figure the range of e f for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are 0 35 1 87 0 815 0 885 0 72 0 9 and 0 19 0 262 a general decreasing trend in the magnitude of e f can be found with the increasing number of wave gauges for the configuration of th 3 most of the cases would overestimate the wave force in the showed region especially with a higher value of k r 0 for the other three configurations the value of e f would alternate between negative and positive versus β and k r 0 the contours for e p f with different gauge configurations are shown in fig 5 the range of e p f for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are 0 186 0 330 0 251 0 086 0 108 0 194 and 0 035 0 0524 respectively for the red region shown in these figures the reconstructed wave force would be hysteresis compared with the target wave force on the contrary the reconstructed results with the cases in the blue region would be lead a general decreasing trend of e p f can be found with the increasing number of wave gauges there is a practical question of how many wave gauges around the circular cylinder are necessary for engineering applications an error within 5 is generally acceptable for most situations in fig 6 the vertical gray dash lines are the thresholds of k r 0 above which the errors e f and e p f shown in figs 4 and 5 exceed 5 for some values of β these threshold values are also listed in table 1 these data show e p f less than 5 is over a wider range of k r 0 than that of e f by considering both e f and e p f the reliable ranges of k r 0 for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are 0 0 62 0 2 13 0 3 09 and 0 5 48 the dimensionless wave force on a circular cylinder is also shown in fig 6 indicating that the force is largest with k r 0 in the range of 0 2 when k r 0 is larger than 2 the dimensional wave force is generally small because the maximum wave height corresponding to a large wave number is small table 2 shows the maximum value of e f and e p f for different configurations in this region it demonstrates that five gauges are enough to provide acceptable reconstructed results of wave force around a circular cylinder with k r 0 in 0 2 if more accurate results are required with k r 0 less than 2 seven or nine wave gauges can be considered as to th 3 the corresponding maximum errors for e f and e p f can up to 69 54 and 15 33 respectively which are highly large for the engineering applications to have a further understanding the configuration of th 3 is picked out and mainly discussed in the next section 3 experimental study 3 1 experiment setup a hydrodynamic experiment with a bottom mounted circular cylinder was performed at the wind tunnel and wave flume laboratory harbin institute of technology in china in this experiment the circular cylinder with a radius of 0 3 m was installed in the center of the wave basin wave generated by the wave maker propagated through a water depth of 0 8 m to acquire the signals of wave surface elevation around the cylinder twelve wave gauges were uniformly distributed around the cylinder a close up image of the test model is depicted in fig 7 the wave force on the cylinder was measured by a force balance installed at the bottom of the cylinder during the test the wave surface elevation and the wave force were recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 hz simultaneously this section concentrates on the horizontal component of wave force in the direction of wave propagation four different arrays of three wave gauges are tested and compared as shown in fig 8 the identifiers of wave gauges are 1 5 9 2 6 10 3 7 11 and 4 8 12 these configurations are represented by t 1 t 2 t 3 and t 4 in the following experimental study the measured wave force is taken as the target wave force to obtain e f and e p f 3 2 regular wave the comparisons of e f between experimental and theoretical results are shown in fig 9 with six different values of k r 0 in this figure the wave force amplitudes for each case are calculated by averaging the crest and trough amplitude in a wave period this allows several points to be obtained from a history curve of one test because the average values are independent of the mean value of the time history curve they have less dispersion than the results of crest amplitude or trough amplitude to provide a better validation of the theoretical results in fig 9 the average values are selected because t 2 and t 4 are symmetrical about the x axis their e f values calculated from the experimental data are similar it can be seen that the reconstructed results of e f by t 2 and t 4 are under less discreteness compared with the other two arrays it suggests that the reconstructed results of e f by t 2 and t 4 are more stable when fewer wave gauges are utilized to reconstruct wave force the reconstruction results are sensitive to the measured wave elevation at each site some unexpected disturbances like the nonlinear wave interactions and measurement errors can deteriorate the reconstructed results because the reconstructed results have different sensitivities on the data collected at different sites the dispersions of reconstructed results with the four configurations are also different for t 1 and t 3 a small disturbance on the measured wave elevation can highly affect the reconstructed results experimental and theoretical values for the phase error e p f are compared in fig 10 e p f is calculated by the instantaneous time of the crest and trough respectively good comparative results for e p f between the experimental points and theoretical curves can be found in this figure which also indicates the distribution of crest points is more discreteness than that of trough points in conclusion the trend of theoretical results with different β and k r 0 presented in 2 is well validated by the experimental results fig 11 compares the time history curves between experimental and reconstructed wave force with different configurations when twelve wave gauges are used eq 27 which is used in the study of liu et al 2018 is utilized to reconstruct the wave force the difference between the reconstructed results obtained from eqs 27 and 14 will be discussed in 4 comprehensively 27 f θ 0 t ρ g r 0 π 6 q 1 12 η θ q t cos θ q θ 0 in which θ q is the annular coordinate of wave gauge q fig 11 shows that the reconstructed force curves are much smoother and vary with time more like a trigonometric function than the measured data which have more high order vibration on the time history curves the reconstructed results by using twelve wave gauges agree well with the recorded data for the six cases as to the results of using three gauges the quality of reconstructed results is highly dependent on k r 0 and β some of the reconstructed results would overestimate the amplitude and some of them have large errors in the phase with decreasing wave number the reconstructed results gradually tend towards the measured curve when k r 0 0 586 which is in the reliable region of th 3 the reconstructed results for all configurations are acceptable compared with experimental results as shown in fig 11 f 3 3 irregular wave in this subsection the pierson moskowitz p m spectrum was adopted for generating the random wave field with a significant period of 0 8 s fig 12 a shows the wave force amplitude for corresponding measured and reconstructed results by using 12 wave gauges in this figure the crest amplitudes and trough amplitudes of reconstructed and experimental wave forces are compared all the results are made dimensionless by the maximum value of experimental amplitude comparative results show that large errors occur at the reconstructed results with large amplitudes the reconstructed wave forces in the positive wave propagation direction are underestimated with a small wave amplitude and overestimated with a large amplitude while the conclusion is opposite for the reconstructed results in the negative direction the main reason for it is the overestimation of the low frequency wave force which could enlarge the crest amplitude reconstruction and reduce the trough amplitude reconstruction by averaging the crest and trough amplitudes better comparative results can be obtained this is because the treatment of averaging is just like high pass filtering that reduces the low frequency disturbance another reason is that the wave pressure distribution in the linear wave theory is incorrect above the still water level and that has an impact on the reconstructed results when the wave height is large the phase errors for the crest point and trough point are presented in fig 12 b the average value of e p f is close to zero regardless of the force amplitude the distribution of e p f for the crest and trough amplitude is similar the spread of e p f for both crest and trough points decreases gradually with the increase of force amplitude fig 13 compares the measured and reconstructed force amplitudes for th 3 with four different configurations of wave gauges comparison in fig 12 shows that wave forces reconstructed from t 2 and t 4 have a similar trend to those using twelve wave gauges but show larger errors as to the results of t 1 and t 3 the reconstructed results tend to overestimate wave forces for both crests and troughs especially for crest wave forces reconstructed using t 3 configuration fig 14 shows the phase errors of the crest and trough points between the measured and reconstructed results in fig 14 a e p f is positive for most of the data indicating that the wave force reconstructed by t 1 would be hysteresis in the most time in fig 14 b and d the range of phase errors for t 2 and t 4 decreases with the increasing force amplitude a similar pattern to the one obtained with twelve wave gauges in fig 14 c e p f from the reconstruction by t 3 is typically zero on average different from the results obtained by twelve wave gauges e p f by t 3 has larger values with large force amplitude the wave force curves reconstructed by using the measured wave elevation are shown in fig 15 within the time interval of 0 40 s the reconstructed wave force using twelve wave gauges shows a good result compared with experimental results in comparison reconstruction using a th 3 configuration typically results in larger errors in wave force amplitude especially t 3 or larger errors in the phase especially t 1 fig 15 also indicates crest wave forces are overestimated and trough wave forces are underestimated for large wave force amplitude further analysis found that the overestimation of wave force in the low frequency region is one reason causing this phenomenon the corresponding power spectral density psd curves are shown in fig 16 indicating that high frequency components of the wave force are underestimated and the low frequency components are overestimated for all the wave gauge configurations the reason for this phenomenon is discussed in detail in the previous study of liu et al 2018 in the high frequency region all the results of th 3 are larger than the reconstructed results by using twelve wave gauges in the low frequency region t 1 configuration produced the lowest psd components but still much higher than the measured results therefore the deficiency of the linear reconstruction method can also be found in fewer wave gauges reconstruction although some of them can reduce the reconstruction error in the low frequency region they are not efficient and the improvement can be neglected as the errors of wave force magnitude and phase can be well predicted by using the theoretical method shown in 2 there is a possible way to amend the calculation process to obtain more accurate results for th 3 configurations when the wave propagation direction is unique and known the processed wave force elevation formula shown in eq 24 can be given by 28 η ˆ f θ t m 1 μ f ω m tanh k m h k m b m cos ω m t ϕ m ϕ f ω m where μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m are the amplitude correction function and phase correction function they are 29 μ f ω m 1 1 e f ω m 30 ϕ f ω m 2 π e p f ω m because of the overestimation in the low frequency region the linear method would overestimate the crest magnitude and underestimate the trough magnitude to reduce this error the frequency components smaller than 0 5 hz are eliminated by setting μ f ω m to be a very small constant in this region the time series for t 1 to t 4 of amended results are shown in fig 17 compared with the original reconstructed results fig 17 shows that the amended results reproduce the measured wave force more accurately than the originally reconstructed results the phase errors can also be ameliorated by introducing a phase correction function as shown in fig 17 c overall the amended method can accurately reconstruct the wave force time series by correcting both the amplitude and phase 4 further discussion in the above sections the errors of the linear reconstruction method are researched by comparing reconstructed wave forces with both analytical and experimental results two different ways are presented for the implementation of linear reconstruction method in the study of liu et al 2018 eq 27 is applied for the wave force reconstruction in the present study eq 14 is adopted with a restriction that the number of wave gauges is odd in this section a further discuss is conducted on the differences between the reconstructed results obtained from eq 27 and eq 14 symbols of method 1 and method 2 are used to represent the two different processes respectively the analysis presented in this study can be extended to an arbitrary cross section and the following formulae for the reconstructed method are therefore not restricted to a circular section the exact reconstructed wave force f θ 0 t on a cylinder with arbitrary cross section is given by 31 f θ 0 t s ρ g η f θ t n s n 0 ξ θ d θ where η f θ t is the exact processed wave elevation mentioned in 2 details of functions n s and ξ θ can be found in appendix d with n t o t a l wave gauges distributed at locations θ 1 θ 2 θ n t o t a l the wave force shown in eq 31 can be discretized as 32 f θ 0 t q 1 n t o t a l θ q δ θ q θ q δ θ q ψ θ t d θ in which n s is the unit vector on the surface of the cylinder θ q δ θ q θ q δ θ q where δ θ q θ q 1 θ q 2 and δ θ q θ q θ q 1 2 is the domain of wave gauge q as shown in fig 18 ψ θ t is 33 ψ θ t η f θ t w θ and 34 w θ ρ g n s n 0 ξ θ by expanding ψ θ t into a taylor series at θ θ q one obtains 35 ψ θ t ψ θ q t ψ θ q t θ θ q 1 2 ψ θ q t θ θ q 2 substituting eq 35 into eq 32 one can obtain 36 f θ 0 t q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q δ θ q q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q 3 δ θ q 3 6 where the first term on the right side of eq 36 is the linear reconstruction formulae for method 1 and the error e 1 θ 0 t of method 1 is therefore 37 e 1 θ 0 t q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q

is of third order accuracy in space in 2 of this paper a different way to get the reconstructed wave force is performed by using η ˆ f θ t as shown by method 2 as n t o t a l should be odd for this method it has n t o t a l 2 n 1 n 1 2 the linear reconstructed force f ˆ θ 0 t calculated by η ˆ f θ t is then 38 f ˆ θ 0 t q 1 2 n 1 θ q δ θ q θ q δ θ q ψ ˆ θ t d θ where ψ ˆ θ t η ˆ f θ t w θ and can be expanded in a taylor series at θ θ q as 39 ψ ˆ θ t ψ ˆ θ q t ψ ˆ θ q t θ θ q 1 2 ψ ˆ θ q t θ θ q 2 by substituting eq 39 into eq 38 one can get 40 f ˆ θ 0 t q 1 2 n 1 ψ ˆ θ q t δ θ q δ θ q q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t δ θ q 3 δ θ q 3 6 by using the relationship η θ q t η ˆ θ q t the error e 2 θ 0 t for method 2 between f ˆ θ 0 t and f θ 0 t is 41 e 2 θ 0 t f ˆ θ 0 t f θ 0 t q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t δ θ q 3 δ θ q 3 6 the detail forms of ψ θ q t ψ θ q t and ψ θ q t ψ θ q t are 42 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t η f θ q t η f θ q t w θ q 43 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t η f θ q t η f θ q t w θ q 2 η f θ q t η f θ q t w θ q with the relation of η θ q t η ˆ θ q t and eq 16 one can obtain 44 c b n t m n b n 1 m n b c b t substituting eq 44 into eq 16 then 45 η f v θ q t η f v θ q t m b n v θ q m n b n 1 m n b m b v θ q c b t where v is the derivative order in terms of θ the absolute value of the term in the bracket of eq 45 is defined as 46 g n v

n v n θ q are different among θ q q 1 2 2 n 1 but g n v n θ q follows a similar tendency to that of uniform distribution to evaluate the effect of η ˆ f v θ q t η f v θ q t one can consider the function of g n v n θ q d n where d n is the amplitude of α n t defined in 2 taking the case of a circular cylinder with uniform distribution as an example the results for g 1 v n θ q d n are shown in fig 20 with n 1 and six different k r 0 in this figure g n v n θ q d n converges to zero as n and only finite terms of g n v n θ q d n play an effective role the scope of the dominated region is broader with larger k r 0 fig 20 illustrates intuitively which part of α n t has a significant effect on the reconstruction error under different situations it also points that the part of α n t within n n would not cause any error in the reconstructed wave force comparison of e 1 θ 0 t and e 2 θ 0 t shows a difference between method 1 and method 2 as n the terms of both ψ θ q t ψ θ q t and ψ θ q t ψ θ q t convergence to zero which indicates that the convergence of method 2 is quicker than method 1 however the total number of wave gauges for method 2 must be odd while method 1 does not have such restriction although the linear reconstruction method has at least third order accuracy with a uniform distribution of wave gauges the error could also increase sharply when fewer wave gauges are used when wave exposure is known and unique the reconstructed errors can be reduced by introducing correction functions μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m for both amplitude and phase with n t o t a l μ f ω m 1 and ϕ f ω m 0 it seems that the functions of μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m always exist in theory for an arbitrary cross section the functions of μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m for a certain structure can be obtained from theory numerical method or experiment however when there are multi directional incident waves the amendment process cannot be performed and more wave gauges are still necessary to increase the accuracy and reduce the variability of reconstructed results when the incident wave exposure is unique but unknown the amendment process cannot be used either unless the direction of incident wave can be determined by using the wave elevation data 5 conclusion in this paper the amplitude and phase errors when few wave gauges are applied to reconstruct the wave force on a circular cylinder are researched a theoretical analysis was carried out with different numbers and distributions of wave gauges around the cylinder then a hydrodynamic experiment was performed on a circular cylinder to validate the theoretical results the major conclusions include 1 in theoretical analysis the amplitude and phase errors are highly dependent on the number and distribution of wave gauges as a general rule the more wave gauges are used the less error the reconstructed wave forces have the reliable range of k r 0 where the reconstruction errors are always less than 5 is 0 0 62 0 2 13 0 3 09 and 0 5 48 for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 respectively 2 the reconstruction errors for th 3 obtained from regular wave tests are well predicted by the theoretical analysis especially for the configurations of t 2 and t 4 the errors in wave force magnitude for these two configurations also show less discreteness than that of t 1 and t 3 for the phase errors the experimental results of trough amplitude are more stable compared with the results of the crest amplitude 3 for the irregular wave tests the wave force in the direction of wave propagation would be underestimated with a small wave force magnitude and overestimated with a large magnitude the conclusion is opposite for the reconstructed results in the negative direction the test results also indicate that the phase errors are generally small with a large wave force 4 basing on the theoretical analysis an amendment program is performed to improve the reconstruction accuracy furthermore the overestimation of low frequency components of the wave force could cause some unexpected error on the amplitudes of the crest and trough respectively this inaccuracy can be ameliorated by reducing these low frequency components in the frequency domain 5 with a uniform distribution of wave gauges the linear reconstruction method is of at least third order accuracy when the number of wave gauges is even method 1 is suggested otherwise method 2 is preferred because of its quicker convergence acknowledgement the financial support from the national natural science foundation of china 51725801 u1834207 and china

21800,this paper presents a study on reconstruction errors of wave force around a circular cylinder using measured wave elevation data through theoretical analysis and experimental validation since the accuracy of reconstructed results is directly subjected to the collected data of wave elevation some unexpected errors can be injected into the results as the data are not informative enough a mathematical analysis is presented first which considers the wave gauges uniformly distributed around the cylinder with the number of three five seven and nine amplitude error and phase error of the reconstructed wave force are defined to quantify the effect of distribution and number of wave gauges an experiment was conducted to validate the theoretical results for both amplitude and phase errors it shows that experimental data with three wave gauges can be well predicted by using theoretical analysis based on the theoretical results an amended method is proposed to improve the reconstructed results with three wave gauges the amended method is proved by the test data to be an efficient method in some specific situations finally a comprehensive discussion on the difference between two kinds of processing method of the reconstructed wave force is performed keywords circular cylinder wave force reconstruction error wave surface elevation potential theory experimental validation 1 introduction vertical cylinders are frequently used as support components for offshore structures for a constructed structure reconstructing the wave force on it in a complex wave field has become necessary for data collection and safety monitoring making this reconstruction is still a practical problem faced by researchers and engineers the wave induced action on the vertical circular cylinders has been studied for many years some empirical approaches utilizing the morison equation morison et al 1950 are frequently used for cylinders that are small compared with the wavelength of incoming waves based on the short term statistical properties of the sea waves the wave force spectrum composed of an inertial force in phase with the local flow acceleration and a drag force proportional to the square of the instantaneous flow velocity can generally be calculated by a transfer function because of its convenience and ease of use the morison equation has already been applied in many applications for instance to improve the efficiency of sea wave energy converters by combining deterministic sea wave prediction dswp with constrained optimal control li et al 2012 to estimate the wave force on a structure under random wave field and control its vibration luo and zhu 2006 ma et al 2006 and to investigate the fluid structure interaction with wave action fish et al 1980 yang and li 2013 for larger cylindrical structures the morison equation is no longer accurate and substituted by the diffraction method based on potential theory finnegan et al 2013 liu et al 2016 and numerical methods like boundary element method bem finite element method fem and finite volume method fvm kang et al 2015 liu et al 2011 paulsen et al 2014 tao et al 2007 xiao et al 2013 however few of the methods mentioned above have been applied to the field test or the safety monitoring of such structures as to the field measurements one practical method is to distribute the pressure transducers around the structure and multiply the measured data by the adjacent area then the wave force can be gained from integrating around the surface of the body however unlike in the laboratory the pressure transducers around the prototype structure are easy to break and hard to be replaced due to the deep water sediment and other physical challenges an alternative method should be developed to solve the physical problem compared with measuring water pressure wave elevation around the structure is more easily obtained in real time this indicates an indirect method using the measured data of wave elevation to provide a shortcut for determining the wave force on the body boccotti et al 2012 predicted the wave force for a truncated cylinder by using the morison equation in a random wave field with measured data of in site wave elevation the accuracy of prediction is improved by adjusting the inertia and drag coefficients with different values of keulegan carpenter number k c and reynolds re number however this method requires that the wave field is undisturbed by the objective structure a requirement that constrains the method s application in most situations with the frame of potential theory the connection between water pressure and free surface elevation has already investigated by many researchers a popular issue is the reconstruction of the wave field from bottom pressure measurements by linear models bishop and donelan 1987 tsai et al 2005 or by nonlinear models bonneton and lannes 2017 clamond and constantin 2013 deconinck et al 2012 these studies have shown the possibility of translation between the different physical quantities in a hydrodynamic problem such kind of relation for the physical quantities has also been implied by lotfollahi yaghin et al 2012 who used artificial neural network ann a popular model free method for establishing a relationship between two variances or more to build a prediction model between the inline wave force and the wave surface elevation on a vertical cylinder later liu et al 2018 established a new method to reconstruct wave force in real time by using the recorded data of wave elevation around the cylindrical structure with a large diameter compared with the wavelength the effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by a hydrodynamic experiment conducted on a circular cylinder in an unknown wave field in the study of liu et al 2018 twelve wave gauges are employed around the cylinder to record the data of free surface elevation however the proper number of wave gauges and the errors of reconstructed results as the data is inadequate are still unclear therefore in this study the errors of wave forces obtained by the linear reconstruction method with fewer wave gauges are researched the structure of the paper is as follows 2 formulates the amplitude and phase errors of the reconstructed wave force by using the mathematics model the effect of the wave gauge number and their locations on the reconstruction errors are investigated 3 performs an experimental validation comprising several regular wave and irregular wave tests the error analysis is conducted on the reconstructed wave force by being compared with the measured wave force an amended method is proposed to reduce the reconstruction errors 4 gives a further discussion about the reconstruction errors with two different processing methods finally the main findings of the present work are summarized in the last section 2 formulae of the physical problem and error analysis 2 1 mathematics model in this section a mathematical model is built to investigate the errors of the reconstructed wave force which is derived from the theoretical results of wave elevation around the cylinder the linear reconstruction method provided by liu et al 2018 is utilized for the modeling a brief review of this method is shown in appendix a fig 1 shows the diagram of wave interaction with a uniform circular cylinder which is assumed to be rigid and mounted at the bottom of the seabed the radius of the cylinder is r 0 in this study the origin of the coordinate system is set inside the cross section at the still water level swl the axis r θ for polar coordinate and x y for cartesian coordinate are defined in the horizontal plane and the z axis is perpendicular to the swl and positive upward the free surface of the incident wave η i x y t for the multi directional wave can be obtained from the sum of a series of the linear wave from different directions then the linear free surface of the incident wave has the form as 1 η i x y t j 1 n j a j cos k j x ω j t ψ j where n j is the number of the wave components a j is the wave amplitude for the component j ω j and ψ j are the wave frequency and phase respectively the vectors x and k j are x x i y j and k j k x j i k y j j where i and j represent the unit vectors in x and y axis with the airy wave assumption the relation between wave number and frequency is ω j 2 k j g tanh k j h the exposure angle κ j can be obtained from κ j arctan k y j k x j the velocity potential of the incident wave corresponding to η i x y t is 2 φ i j 1 n j a j c j z n j n k j r e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j where h is the depth of the water and j n is the first kind of bessel function function c j z has a form of 3 c j z i g ω j cosh k j z h cosh k j h where g is the gravity acceleration based on the study of maccamy and fuchs 1954 the diffraction wave potential can be given as 4 φ s j 1 n j a j c j z n a j n h n k j r e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j where h n is the first kind of hankel function and a j m is 5 a j n j n k j r 0 h n k j r 0 the total wave potential φ is the sum of φ s and φ i it is 6 φ j 1 n j a j c j z n j n k j r a j n h n k j r e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j the wave elevation around the cylinder can be calculated by 7 η θ t 1 g re φ t z 0 r r 0 substituting eq 6 into eq 7 8 η θ t re j 1 n j a j n j n k j r 0 a j n h n k j r 0 e i n π 2 κ j e i n θ e i ω j t i ψ j by using the relation of 9 j n k j r 0 h n k j r 0 h n k j r 0 j n k j r 0 2 i π k j r 0 eq 8 for wave elevation η θ t can be reduced to 10 η θ t re n j 1 n j a j h n k j r 0 2 i π k j r 0 e i n π 2 κ j e i ω j t i ψ j e i n θ then eq 10 can be rewritten in the following form 11 η θ t n α n t e i n θ where α n t is a function only depending on t η θ t need to be processed in the frequency domain before the reconstruction for the wave force the processed wave elevation can be written as 12 η f θ t n α n t e i n θ where α n t is a function of t the expressions of α n t and α n t are given in appendix b when the incident wave is monochromatic n j 1 α n t only consists of one frequency component the absolute value of its amplitude is defined as d n the expression of d n is shown in appendix b as an example the values of d n versus k r 0 are shown in fig 2 the parameters used for fig 2 include k 1 k κ 1 0 ψ 1 0 a 1 1 and r 0 h 3 8 fig 2 illustrates that d n converges to zero as n because h n k j r 0 a denominator in eq 10 tends to be infinity another feature found in fig 2 is that d n has larger values but a narrower bandwidth for smaller values of k r 0 the wave force is reconstructed by 13 f θ 0 t a f 0 2 π η f θ t cos θ θ 0 d θ where a f ρ g r 0 and θ 0 is the angular coordinate of the vector f θ 0 t substituting eq 12 into eq 13 one can obtain 14 f θ 0 t a f π α 1 t α 1 t cos θ 0 i α 1 t α 1 t sin θ 0 in practice the time histories of wave elevation are measured at finite sites around the cylinder the angular variables for these sites are θ 1 θ 2 θ 2 n 1 where 2 n 1 n 1 2 3 is the total number of sites the total number of wave gauges used here is odd which will be discussed in 4 the discussion of fig 2 indicates that α n t can be neglected if n is large enough therefore n can be truncated at a special order b to obtain a linear system with finite equations a new function η ˆ f θ t with finite terms of α ˆ n t is defined as 15 η ˆ f θ t n b b α ˆ n t e i n θ with η ˆ f θ t related to η f θ t by η ˆ f θ n t η f θ n t n 1 2 3 2 n 1 when b n eq 15 can be assembled into a matrix form as 16 m n b n c b n t j n t where the matrices shown in eq 16 are 17 m n b n m b n θ 1 m b n θ 2 m b n θ 2 n 1 18 m b n θ e i b θ e i b 1 θ 1 e i b 1 θ e i b θ 19 c b n t α ˆ b t α ˆ b 1 t α ˆ 0 t α ˆ b 1 t α ˆ b t t 20 j n t η ˆ f θ 1 t η ˆ f θ 2 t η ˆ f θ 2 n 1 t t because the matrix m n b n is invertible as proven in appendix c the coefficient matrix c b n can be obtained by 21 c b n t m n b n 1 j n t then the wave force can be obtained by substituting α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t into eq 14 and replacing α 1 t and α 1 t respectively 2 2 theoretical results to investigate the effect of the number of wave gauges on the reconstructed wave force an analysis with monochromatic waves is performed theoretically the velocity potential of the incident wave propagating along the x axis with unit amplitude is 22 φ i c z m j m k r e i m π 2 e i m θ e i ω t following the process from eqs 2 10 the time history of wave elevation around the cylinder can be given as 23 η θ t b θ cos ω t ϕ θ where b θ and ϕ θ are the amplitude and phase for η θ t based on the previous study liu et al 2018 the processed wave elevations are given by 24 η ˆ f θ t tanh k h k b θ cos ω t ϕ θ then the detailed process of the analysis can be summarized as step 1 calculating the time history curves of theoretical wave force and wave elevation η θ t at the sites θ 1 θ 2 θ 2 n 1 by using wave diffraction theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 taking the theoretical wave force as the target wave force step 2 calculating η ˆ f θ t by using eq 24 and obtaining α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t by using eq 21 step 3 reconstructing the wave force with α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t by using eq 14 step 4 calculating the reconstruction errors between the target wave force obtained in step 1 and the reconstructed wave force obtained in step 3 the reconstruction errors can be categorized into amplitude error and phase error the amplitude error is used to evaluate the accuracy of the amplitude of the reconstructed results the phase error is used to evaluate whether the reconstructed results are synchronized with the target wave force the amplitude error of the reconstructed wave force is defined as 25 e f a f r a f t a f t where a f r is the amplitude of the reconstructed wave force and a f t is the amplitude of the target wave force similarly the phase error of the reconstructed wave force is defined as 26 e p f t f r t f t t f t where t f r is the instantaneous time corresponding to the peak value of reconstructed wave force t f t is the instantaneous time corresponding to the peak value of target wave force t f t is the period of the target wave force to obtain α ˆ 1 t and α ˆ 1 t from eq 21 two wave gauges are necessary to build the linear equation system of eq 16 as the total number of wave gauges should be odd at least three wave gauges are therefore needed for using the present method fig 3 shows four configurations of wave gauges uniformly distributed around the cylinder with the total number being three five seven and nine respectively to simplify the discussion symbols of th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are used to represent these configurations mentioned above as shown in this figure each configuration has a variance of β which can change the location of the wave gauges fig 4 shows the contours of e f with different wave gauge configurations as listed in fig 3 the horizontal coordinate k r 0 is in the range of 0 6 and the vertical coordinate is β within a period for each configuration respectively the value of the contours varies from 2 to 2 with negative value shown in blue and positive value in red the cases in the red region indicate that the linear reconstruction method would overestimate the wave force and the cases in the blue region on the contrary would underestimate the wave force in this figure the range of e f for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are 0 35 1 87 0 815 0 885 0 72 0 9 and 0 19 0 262 a general decreasing trend in the magnitude of e f can be found with the increasing number of wave gauges for the configuration of th 3 most of the cases would overestimate the wave force in the showed region especially with a higher value of k r 0 for the other three configurations the value of e f would alternate between negative and positive versus β and k r 0 the contours for e p f with different gauge configurations are shown in fig 5 the range of e p f for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are 0 186 0 330 0 251 0 086 0 108 0 194 and 0 035 0 0524 respectively for the red region shown in these figures the reconstructed wave force would be hysteresis compared with the target wave force on the contrary the reconstructed results with the cases in the blue region would be lead a general decreasing trend of e p f can be found with the increasing number of wave gauges there is a practical question of how many wave gauges around the circular cylinder are necessary for engineering applications an error within 5 is generally acceptable for most situations in fig 6 the vertical gray dash lines are the thresholds of k r 0 above which the errors e f and e p f shown in figs 4 and 5 exceed 5 for some values of β these threshold values are also listed in table 1 these data show e p f less than 5 is over a wider range of k r 0 than that of e f by considering both e f and e p f the reliable ranges of k r 0 for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 are 0 0 62 0 2 13 0 3 09 and 0 5 48 the dimensionless wave force on a circular cylinder is also shown in fig 6 indicating that the force is largest with k r 0 in the range of 0 2 when k r 0 is larger than 2 the dimensional wave force is generally small because the maximum wave height corresponding to a large wave number is small table 2 shows the maximum value of e f and e p f for different configurations in this region it demonstrates that five gauges are enough to provide acceptable reconstructed results of wave force around a circular cylinder with k r 0 in 0 2 if more accurate results are required with k r 0 less than 2 seven or nine wave gauges can be considered as to th 3 the corresponding maximum errors for e f and e p f can up to 69 54 and 15 33 respectively which are highly large for the engineering applications to have a further understanding the configuration of th 3 is picked out and mainly discussed in the next section 3 experimental study 3 1 experiment setup a hydrodynamic experiment with a bottom mounted circular cylinder was performed at the wind tunnel and wave flume laboratory harbin institute of technology in china in this experiment the circular cylinder with a radius of 0 3 m was installed in the center of the wave basin wave generated by the wave maker propagated through a water depth of 0 8 m to acquire the signals of wave surface elevation around the cylinder twelve wave gauges were uniformly distributed around the cylinder a close up image of the test model is depicted in fig 7 the wave force on the cylinder was measured by a force balance installed at the bottom of the cylinder during the test the wave surface elevation and the wave force were recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 hz simultaneously this section concentrates on the horizontal component of wave force in the direction of wave propagation four different arrays of three wave gauges are tested and compared as shown in fig 8 the identifiers of wave gauges are 1 5 9 2 6 10 3 7 11 and 4 8 12 these configurations are represented by t 1 t 2 t 3 and t 4 in the following experimental study the measured wave force is taken as the target wave force to obtain e f and e p f 3 2 regular wave the comparisons of e f between experimental and theoretical results are shown in fig 9 with six different values of k r 0 in this figure the wave force amplitudes for each case are calculated by averaging the crest and trough amplitude in a wave period this allows several points to be obtained from a history curve of one test because the average values are independent of the mean value of the time history curve they have less dispersion than the results of crest amplitude or trough amplitude to provide a better validation of the theoretical results in fig 9 the average values are selected because t 2 and t 4 are symmetrical about the x axis their e f values calculated from the experimental data are similar it can be seen that the reconstructed results of e f by t 2 and t 4 are under less discreteness compared with the other two arrays it suggests that the reconstructed results of e f by t 2 and t 4 are more stable when fewer wave gauges are utilized to reconstruct wave force the reconstruction results are sensitive to the measured wave elevation at each site some unexpected disturbances like the nonlinear wave interactions and measurement errors can deteriorate the reconstructed results because the reconstructed results have different sensitivities on the data collected at different sites the dispersions of reconstructed results with the four configurations are also different for t 1 and t 3 a small disturbance on the measured wave elevation can highly affect the reconstructed results experimental and theoretical values for the phase error e p f are compared in fig 10 e p f is calculated by the instantaneous time of the crest and trough respectively good comparative results for e p f between the experimental points and theoretical curves can be found in this figure which also indicates the distribution of crest points is more discreteness than that of trough points in conclusion the trend of theoretical results with different β and k r 0 presented in 2 is well validated by the experimental results fig 11 compares the time history curves between experimental and reconstructed wave force with different configurations when twelve wave gauges are used eq 27 which is used in the study of liu et al 2018 is utilized to reconstruct the wave force the difference between the reconstructed results obtained from eqs 27 and 14 will be discussed in 4 comprehensively 27 f θ 0 t ρ g r 0 π 6 q 1 12 η θ q t cos θ q θ 0 in which θ q is the annular coordinate of wave gauge q fig 11 shows that the reconstructed force curves are much smoother and vary with time more like a trigonometric function than the measured data which have more high order vibration on the time history curves the reconstructed results by using twelve wave gauges agree well with the recorded data for the six cases as to the results of using three gauges the quality of reconstructed results is highly dependent on k r 0 and β some of the reconstructed results would overestimate the amplitude and some of them have large errors in the phase with decreasing wave number the reconstructed results gradually tend towards the measured curve when k r 0 0 586 which is in the reliable region of th 3 the reconstructed results for all configurations are acceptable compared with experimental results as shown in fig 11 f 3 3 irregular wave in this subsection the pierson moskowitz p m spectrum was adopted for generating the random wave field with a significant period of 0 8 s fig 12 a shows the wave force amplitude for corresponding measured and reconstructed results by using 12 wave gauges in this figure the crest amplitudes and trough amplitudes of reconstructed and experimental wave forces are compared all the results are made dimensionless by the maximum value of experimental amplitude comparative results show that large errors occur at the reconstructed results with large amplitudes the reconstructed wave forces in the positive wave propagation direction are underestimated with a small wave amplitude and overestimated with a large amplitude while the conclusion is opposite for the reconstructed results in the negative direction the main reason for it is the overestimation of the low frequency wave force which could enlarge the crest amplitude reconstruction and reduce the trough amplitude reconstruction by averaging the crest and trough amplitudes better comparative results can be obtained this is because the treatment of averaging is just like high pass filtering that reduces the low frequency disturbance another reason is that the wave pressure distribution in the linear wave theory is incorrect above the still water level and that has an impact on the reconstructed results when the wave height is large the phase errors for the crest point and trough point are presented in fig 12 b the average value of e p f is close to zero regardless of the force amplitude the distribution of e p f for the crest and trough amplitude is similar the spread of e p f for both crest and trough points decreases gradually with the increase of force amplitude fig 13 compares the measured and reconstructed force amplitudes for th 3 with four different configurations of wave gauges comparison in fig 12 shows that wave forces reconstructed from t 2 and t 4 have a similar trend to those using twelve wave gauges but show larger errors as to the results of t 1 and t 3 the reconstructed results tend to overestimate wave forces for both crests and troughs especially for crest wave forces reconstructed using t 3 configuration fig 14 shows the phase errors of the crest and trough points between the measured and reconstructed results in fig 14 a e p f is positive for most of the data indicating that the wave force reconstructed by t 1 would be hysteresis in the most time in fig 14 b and d the range of phase errors for t 2 and t 4 decreases with the increasing force amplitude a similar pattern to the one obtained with twelve wave gauges in fig 14 c e p f from the reconstruction by t 3 is typically zero on average different from the results obtained by twelve wave gauges e p f by t 3 has larger values with large force amplitude the wave force curves reconstructed by using the measured wave elevation are shown in fig 15 within the time interval of 0 40 s the reconstructed wave force using twelve wave gauges shows a good result compared with experimental results in comparison reconstruction using a th 3 configuration typically results in larger errors in wave force amplitude especially t 3 or larger errors in the phase especially t 1 fig 15 also indicates crest wave forces are overestimated and trough wave forces are underestimated for large wave force amplitude further analysis found that the overestimation of wave force in the low frequency region is one reason causing this phenomenon the corresponding power spectral density psd curves are shown in fig 16 indicating that high frequency components of the wave force are underestimated and the low frequency components are overestimated for all the wave gauge configurations the reason for this phenomenon is discussed in detail in the previous study of liu et al 2018 in the high frequency region all the results of th 3 are larger than the reconstructed results by using twelve wave gauges in the low frequency region t 1 configuration produced the lowest psd components but still much higher than the measured results therefore the deficiency of the linear reconstruction method can also be found in fewer wave gauges reconstruction although some of them can reduce the reconstruction error in the low frequency region they are not efficient and the improvement can be neglected as the errors of wave force magnitude and phase can be well predicted by using the theoretical method shown in 2 there is a possible way to amend the calculation process to obtain more accurate results for th 3 configurations when the wave propagation direction is unique and known the processed wave force elevation formula shown in eq 24 can be given by 28 η ˆ f θ t m 1 μ f ω m tanh k m h k m b m cos ω m t ϕ m ϕ f ω m where μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m are the amplitude correction function and phase correction function they are 29 μ f ω m 1 1 e f ω m 30 ϕ f ω m 2 π e p f ω m because of the overestimation in the low frequency region the linear method would overestimate the crest magnitude and underestimate the trough magnitude to reduce this error the frequency components smaller than 0 5 hz are eliminated by setting μ f ω m to be a very small constant in this region the time series for t 1 to t 4 of amended results are shown in fig 17 compared with the original reconstructed results fig 17 shows that the amended results reproduce the measured wave force more accurately than the originally reconstructed results the phase errors can also be ameliorated by introducing a phase correction function as shown in fig 17 c overall the amended method can accurately reconstruct the wave force time series by correcting both the amplitude and phase 4 further discussion in the above sections the errors of the linear reconstruction method are researched by comparing reconstructed wave forces with both analytical and experimental results two different ways are presented for the implementation of linear reconstruction method in the study of liu et al 2018 eq 27 is applied for the wave force reconstruction in the present study eq 14 is adopted with a restriction that the number of wave gauges is odd in this section a further discuss is conducted on the differences between the reconstructed results obtained from eq 27 and eq 14 symbols of method 1 and method 2 are used to represent the two different processes respectively the analysis presented in this study can be extended to an arbitrary cross section and the following formulae for the reconstructed method are therefore not restricted to a circular section the exact reconstructed wave force f θ 0 t on a cylinder with arbitrary cross section is given by 31 f θ 0 t s ρ g η f θ t n s n 0 ξ θ d θ where η f θ t is the exact processed wave elevation mentioned in 2 details of functions n s and ξ θ can be found in appendix d with n t o t a l wave gauges distributed at locations θ 1 θ 2 θ n t o t a l the wave force shown in eq 31 can be discretized as 32 f θ 0 t q 1 n t o t a l θ q δ θ q θ q δ θ q ψ θ t d θ in which n s is the unit vector on the surface of the cylinder θ q δ θ q θ q δ θ q where δ θ q θ q 1 θ q 2 and δ θ q θ q θ q 1 2 is the domain of wave gauge q as shown in fig 18 ψ θ t is 33 ψ θ t η f θ t w θ and 34 w θ ρ g n s n 0 ξ θ by expanding ψ θ t into a taylor series at θ θ q one obtains 35 ψ θ t ψ θ q t ψ θ q t θ θ q 1 2 ψ θ q t θ θ q 2 substituting eq 35 into eq 32 one can obtain 36 f θ 0 t q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q δ θ q q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q 3 δ θ q 3 6 where the first term on the right side of eq 36 is the linear reconstruction formulae for method 1 and the error e 1 θ 0 t of method 1 is therefore 37 e 1 θ 0 t q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 n t o t a l ψ θ q t δ θ q 3 δ θ q 3 6 when the distribution of wave gauges is uniform the first integral term of eq 37 equals to zero because δ θ q δ θ q π n t o t a l in this case the wave force calculated from eq 27 is of third order accuracy in space in 2 of this paper a different way to get the reconstructed wave force is performed by using η ˆ f θ t as shown by method 2 as n t o t a l should be odd for this method it has n t o t a l 2 n 1 n 1 2 the linear reconstructed force f ˆ θ 0 t calculated by η ˆ f θ t is then 38 f ˆ θ 0 t q 1 2 n 1 θ q δ θ q θ q δ θ q ψ ˆ θ t d θ where ψ ˆ θ t η ˆ f θ t w θ and can be expanded in a taylor series at θ θ q as 39 ψ ˆ θ t ψ ˆ θ q t ψ ˆ θ q t θ θ q 1 2 ψ ˆ θ q t θ θ q 2 by substituting eq 39 into eq 38 one can get 40 f ˆ θ 0 t q 1 2 n 1 ψ ˆ θ q t δ θ q δ θ q q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t δ θ q 3 δ θ q 3 6 by using the relationship η θ q t η ˆ θ q t the error e 2 θ 0 t for method 2 between f ˆ θ 0 t and f θ 0 t is 41 e 2 θ 0 t f ˆ θ 0 t f θ 0 t q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t δ θ q 2 δ θ q 2 2 q 1 2 n 1 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t δ θ q 3 δ θ q 3 6 the detail forms of ψ θ q t ψ θ q t and ψ θ q t ψ θ q t are 42 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t η f θ q t η f θ q t w θ q 43 ψ θ q t ψ θ q t η f θ q t η f θ q t w θ q 2 η f θ q t η f θ q t w θ q with the relation of η θ q t η ˆ θ q t and eq 16 one can obtain 44 c b n t m n b n 1 m n b c b t substituting eq 44 into eq 16 then 45 η f v θ q t η f v θ q t m b n v θ q m n b n 1 m n b m b v θ q c b t where v is the derivative order in terms of θ the absolute value of the term in the bracket of eq 45 is defined as 46 g n v θ q m b n v θ q m n b n 1 m n b m b v θ q where g n v θ q is a matrix having dimensions of 1 then using g n v n θ q to represent the term of g n v θ q corresponding to α n t which is the term of c b t when v 0 eq 46 reduces to g n v n θ q 0 for other values of v the results of g n v n θ q with a uniform distribution of wave gauges are 47 g n v n θ q m v n v where m n n 1 n 1 n and n is related to m by n m υ 2 n 1 in which υ is an integer υ z as derived in appendix e from eq 47 it is interesting to find that the value of g n v n θ q is unchanged with different θ q q 1 2 2 n 1 fig 19 a and b show the results of g n v n θ q for v 1 and v 2 respectively some features of g n v n θ q are evident in fig 19 g n v n θ q is symmetrical about n 0 and equals zero when n n as m is always smaller than n g n v n θ q n v if n is large enough fig 19 also suggests that g n v n θ q have a generally tends to increase in proportion to n v for all the cases of n for the nonuniform distribution the values of g n v n θ q are different among θ q q 1 2 2 n 1 but g n v n θ q follows a similar tendency to that of uniform distribution to evaluate the effect of η ˆ f v θ q t η f v θ q t one can consider the function of g n v n θ q d n where d n is the amplitude of α n t defined in 2 taking the case of a circular cylinder with uniform distribution as an example the results for g 1 v n θ q d n are shown in fig 20 with n 1 and six different k r 0 in this figure g n v n θ q d n converges to zero as n and only finite terms of g n v n θ q d n play an effective role the scope of the dominated region is broader with larger k r 0 fig 20 illustrates intuitively which part of α n t has a significant effect on the reconstruction error under different situations it also points that the part of α n t within n n would not cause any error in the reconstructed wave force comparison of e 1 θ 0 t and e 2 θ 0 t shows a difference between method 1 and method 2 as n the terms of both ψ θ q t ψ θ q t and ψ θ q t ψ θ q t convergence to zero which indicates that the convergence of method 2 is quicker than method 1 however the total number of wave gauges for method 2 must be odd while method 1 does not have such restriction although the linear reconstruction method has at least third order accuracy with a uniform distribution of wave gauges the error could also increase sharply when fewer wave gauges are used when wave exposure is known and unique the reconstructed errors can be reduced by introducing correction functions μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m for both amplitude and phase with n t o t a l μ f ω m 1 and ϕ f ω m 0 it seems that the functions of μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m always exist in theory for an arbitrary cross section the functions of μ f ω m and ϕ f ω m for a certain structure can be obtained from theory numerical method or experiment however when there are multi directional incident waves the amendment process cannot be performed and more wave gauges are still necessary to increase the accuracy and reduce the variability of reconstructed results when the incident wave exposure is unique but unknown the amendment process cannot be used either unless the direction of incident wave can be determined by using the wave elevation data 5 conclusion in this paper the amplitude and phase errors when few wave gauges are applied to reconstruct the wave force on a circular cylinder are researched a theoretical analysis was carried out with different numbers and distributions of wave gauges around the cylinder then a hydrodynamic experiment was performed on a circular cylinder to validate the theoretical results the major conclusions include 1 in theoretical analysis the amplitude and phase errors are highly dependent on the number and distribution of wave gauges as a general rule the more wave gauges are used the less error the reconstructed wave forces have the reliable range of k r 0 where the reconstruction errors are always less than 5 is 0 0 62 0 2 13 0 3 09 and 0 5 48 for th 3 th 5 th 7 and th 9 respectively 2 the reconstruction errors for th 3 obtained from regular wave tests are well predicted by the theoretical analysis especially for the configurations of t 2 and t 4 the errors in wave force magnitude for these two configurations also show less discreteness than that of t 1 and t 3 for the phase errors the experimental results of trough amplitude are more stable compared with the results of the crest amplitude 3 for the irregular wave tests the wave force in the direction of wave propagation would be underestimated with a small wave force magnitude and overestimated with a large magnitude the conclusion is opposite for the reconstructed results in the negative direction the test results also indicate that the phase errors are generally small with a large wave force 4 basing on the theoretical analysis an amendment program is performed to improve the reconstruction accuracy furthermore the overestimation of low frequency components of the wave force could cause some unexpected error on the amplitudes of the crest and trough respectively this inaccuracy can be ameliorated by reducing these low frequency components in the frequency domain 5 with a uniform distribution of wave gauges the linear reconstruction method is of at least third order accuracy when the number of wave gauges is even method 1 is suggested otherwise method 2 is preferred because of its quicker convergence acknowledgement the financial support from the national natural science foundation of china 51725801 u1834207 and china

potential function according to the bernoulli equation the hydrodynamic pressure around the cylinder is a2 p θ z t ρ re φ t ρ 2 re φ re φ the basic conception for deriving the reconstruction method is

phenomenon in hydraulic engineering when the local hydrostatic pressure drops below the saturated vapor pressure vapor cavities called cavitation bubbles will be formed in the liquid brennen 2013 when the local pressure recovers the cavitation bubbles will collapse inducing extremely high pressure and temperature alehossein and qin 2007 choi and chahine 2016 if a cavitation bubble collapses near a solid boundary it will also produce high speed micro jet toward the boundary philipp and lauterborn 1998 the micro jet along with the shock waves momma and lichtarowicz 1995 upon cavitation bubble collapse are believed to be responsible for the cavitation damage cavitation can cause permanent deformation pits and craters on metal surface hsiao et al 2014 pöhl et al 2015 it can also result in noise vibration and efficiency decline in hydraulic machinery arndt 1981 equipment such as pump turbine and propeller is easy to suffer from cavitation although it is unwanted in most hydraulic machinery cavitation is welcomed in submerged cavitation jet where the destructive power of cavitation bubble can be utilized to dispose organic waste water dindar 2016 clean marine pipelines improve drilling rate of petroleum wells break rocks gensheng et al 2005 and perform shotless peening soyama et al 2011 et al in submerged cavitation jet dissolved gas and tiny impurities in the working fluid in most cases water serve as the cavitation nuclei mørch 2007 when water flows through nozzle the hydrostatic pressure drops dramatically due to bernoulli s principle consequently cavitation bubbles are activated from the nuclei and travel downstream with the jet the cavitation bubbles expand in the jet shear layer where the local turbulence pressure can be extremely low massive cavitation bubbles can constitute visible coalesce called cavitation cloud when cavitation bubbles approach the target they collapse as the stagnation pressure is recovered releasing the damage power of cavitation since its emergence in the 1980s submerged cavitation jet has enjoyed extensive researches chahine et al 1987 guoyi et al 2016 hattori et al 2006 hutli et al 2017 hutli et al 2016 hutli and nedeljkovic 2008 kim et al 2014 li et al 2018 li et al 2017 li et al 2016a b li et al 2016c li et al 2015 peng et al 2018a peng and shimizu 2013 peng et al 2018b peng et al 2017 sato et al 2009 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 soyama et al 1995 watanabe et al 2016 wright et al 2013 which are generally concerned about the effects of hydraulic conditions upstream ambient pressures standoff distance cavitation number fluid temperature et al and nozzle geometries on the structural characteristics and erosion performance of submerged cavitation jet making the first attempt of using high speed photography to view submerged cavitation jet chahine et al 1987 revealed the periodic behavior of cavitation cloud which was composed of four stages including inception transition shedding and collapse hydraulic conditions had direct influence on the shedding frequency and volume of cavitation cloud soyama et al 1995 visualized submerged cavitation jet from conical cylindrical and horn nozzles and conformed that the shedding frequency of cavitation cloud decreased with increasing upstream pressure the inverse relationship between upstream pressure and shedding frequency was also found by hutli and nedeljkovic 2008 sato et al 2009 argued that the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud resulted from the re entrant jet wright et al 2013 investigated the traveling distance

number on the performance of submerged cavitation jet peng et al 2018b 2017 analyzed the erosion ability and cavitation intensity of submerged cavitation jet under high ambient pressure condition the present authors peng et al 2018a demonstrated that the cavitation erosion pattern was decided by the cavitation cloud structure of submerged cavitation jet through simultaneous high speed view and erosion test as is shown by the previous researches the performance of submerged cavitation jet is highly related to the cavitation intensity to improve the erosion ability of the jet it is necessary to enhance the cavitation intensity increasing the pump pressure upstream pressure is a common way to promote cavitation as it improves the turbulence level but increasing pump pressure requires additional power and is limited by the maximum pump capacity another option may be adding extra cavitation nuclei e g micro particles into the jet according to the heterogeneous nucleation theory apfel 1970 atchley and prosperetti 1989 harvey et al 1944 adding micro particles into purified water can drastically decrease the liquid tension required for cavitation inception borkent et al 2007 2009 mørch 2007 marschall et al 2003 by adding micro particles with diameter up to 76 μm into filtered water marschall et al 2003 managed to reduce the tensile strength of water down to 1 3 of the original value similar results were obtained by borkent et al 2007 and mørch 2007 moreover it was found in the ultrasonic cavitation experiments gu et al 2016 hu and zheng 2017 huang et al 1996 lian et al 2018 romero et al 2019 that the addition of micro particles could enhance the cavitation intensity and cavitation erosion under certain conditions this paper is going to investigate the feasibility of enhancing the cavitation intensity and erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet by adding silica sand micro particles as far as the authors know there has been few researches about the influence of micro particles on the cavitation intensity of submerged cavitation jet the added micro particles can lower the cavitation threshold and provide extra cavitation nucleation sites which are benefit for stimulating jet cavitation a series of experiments are conducted high speed filming is applied to view the cavitation cloud in the jet hydrophone is used to measure the cavitation noise and erosion test of sandstone is performed to demonstrate the improved erosion ability the results are compared with our previous findings peng et al 2018a in submerged cavitation jet the remaining content of this paper is as follows the experimental setup and data processing method are introduced in section 2 section 3 presents the results and analysis the disappearance of cavitation cloud periodicity the increase of cavitation region and cavitation noise and enhanced erosion of sandstone samples the conclusion will be given in section 4 it is expected that present work will provide a potential method to stimulate cavitation and improve the erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet without increasing upstream pressure 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were carried out at high pressure water jet laboratory of china university of petroleum beijing fig 1 schematically depicts the experimental setup a high pressure plunger pump kmt streamline sl v50 with an inbuilt bladder accumulator provided the upstream pressure a pressure gauge accuracy 0 3 fs was set at the pump outlet to show the output pressure the jet flow rate was measured by a turbine flowmeter accuracy 0 5 fs the micro particles were added into the jet in the form of suspension liquid through a hole drilled in the wall of the cylindrical nozzle fig 2 the entrainment effect of jet would suck in the suspension which was comprised of certain percentages by weight of distilled water guar increase viscosity and micro particles during the experiments an electric blender stirred the suspension to mix it and prevent the sediment of micro particles the purpose of using micro particle suspension is to preciously control its concentration by adjusting the rotating speed flow rate of the peristaltic pump which pumped the suspension from a sealed container the mass concentration of micro particles can be calculated from the flow rates of the jet and the peristaltic pump a transparent water vessel made of acrylic resin was used to produce the submerged condition the y coordinate was along the direction of jet ejection and the origin was set at the nozzle exit the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 ignoring the pressure loss from plunger pump to nozzle the upstream pressure was 50 mpa the acrylic water vessel was not lidded so the downstream pressure p downstream was equal to the atmospheric pressure due to the bladder accumulator that damped out pump pulsations the jet flow rate was relatively stable which slightly fluctuated around 0 96 l min during the experiments considering the accuracy of the flowmeter 0 5 fs the flow rate had a maximum deviation of 0 05 l min cavitation number σ p d o w n s t r e a m p v a p o r 0 5 ρ v t h r o a t 2 was 0 038 v thorat was calculated from the jet flow rate and nozzle throat diameter v thorat 226 35 m s tap water was stored and exposed to atmosphere in the water tank a day before the experiment to maintain a consistent water quality gas nuclei the temperature of tap water in tank was about 20 c it is well known that the massive collapses of cavitation bubbles in the jet will release a great amount of heat and the temperature of vessel water will constantly increase as the erosion test continues to avoid the thermal effect that would influence the erosion ability of cavitation jet dular 2016 hattori et al 2006 2012 the temperature of vessel water was measured every 30 s using an infrared thermometer resolution 0 5 c maximum error 1 c if the water temperature was more than 23 c the experiment paused the vessel was totally drained and refilled with fresh tank water then the erosion test restarted the time interval between two pauses ranged from 120 to 300 s depending on the experimental parameters in this way the water temperature was kept at 20 23 c during the experiment despite of the differences of experimental apparatus and conditions the erosion test followed the guidance of astm standard g 134 in terms of the calibration of nozzle preparation of test sample and test procedures a high speed camera phantom v310 lens af80 200mmf 2 8d was used to film the cavitation cloud in submerged cavitation jet which worked at a frame rate of 40 000 fps with a shutter time of 25 μs the initial image size was 256 256 pixels and one pixel equaled to about 0 3 mm a halogen lamp placed opposite to the camera provided the illumination cavitation cloud appeared as the dark part in the original high speed images each data set of high speed filming covered a time span of 5 s a hydrophone brüel kjær type 8105 was used to record the cavitation noise the hydrophone was composed of a flexible signal wire and a probe at tip to keep the hydrophone probe at a stable position in the vessel during the experiment part of the signal mire and the probe were attached to an l shape steel bar the l shape steel bar was not shown in fig 1 one end of the bar that is far from the probe was fixed at the edge of the acrylic vessel in this way the hydrophone probe was totally emerged in the water and it was not in contact with the wall of acrylic vessel under each experimental condition the high speed filming of cavitation cloud and the measurement of cavitation noise were repeated five times an uncertainty analysis of the repeated tests was performed and the standard deviations were calculated a comprehensive analysis for the source of error was not conducted 2 2 micro particles in this work silica sand was selected as the micro particles added into the jet for its hardness and easy availability silica sands of four sizes diameters were prepared 40 mesh 0 425 mm 80 mesh 0 18 mm 120 mesh 0 125 mm and 200 mesh 0 075 mm as shown in fig 3 microscopic views of the silica sands fig 4 reveal that the cubic micro particles have sharp edges and rough surfaces on one hand it is found that micro particles with rough surfaces are more favorable for inducing cavitation than micro particles with smooth surfaces borkent et al 2007 marschall et al 2003 on the other hand sharp edges are beneficial for improving the abrasion and impact of micro particles in the experiments five concentrations 0 56 1 12 1 53 2 25 and 3 05 wt were tested using the silica sand of 40 mesh 2 3 sandstone samples as we are interested in the application of submerged cavitation jet to the underground petroleum drilling sandstone was chosen to be the target material for erosion test which is a typical rock in petroleum engineering the mineral composition and mechanical properties of the sandstone samples are listed in tables 2 and 3 the samples were cut into cylinders with diameter of 25 mm and height of 50 mm the top and bottom surfaces were polished the initial surface roughness ra was less than 5 μm measured by a 3 d laser scanning microscope keyence vk x160k the weight was measured by an analytical balance with a resolution of 0 1 mg after erosion test the samples were dried before weighing in order to better view the radial movement of cavitation cloud in the high speed filming a disc shape metal target with diameter of 100 mm was placed on the holder in the cavitation noise measurement and the erosion test sandstone samples were always used 2 4 proper orthogonal decomposition before the image sets are further processed every image is subtracted by a corresponding background image that is taken before the start of the visualization experiment to remove possible interference from lens and illumination to highlight the cavitation region images are cut into proper sizes then they are transformed into gray scale images in which the cavitation cloud is shown as the bright area each pixel on the gray image owns a gray value between 0 black and 255 white same as our last work peng et al 2018a proper orthogonal decomposition pod is used to distinguish the spatial and temporary coherent structures of cavitation cloud in submerged cavitation jet the essential ideas of pod is introduced in this section while readers can find more details in chen et al 2013 peng et al 2018a the principle of pod is to decompose a time series of high speed filming images regarded as transient scalar fields that show the position and area of cavitation cloud into a linear combination of basic spatial modes and temporal coefficients 1 g k m 1 m c m k ϕ m where g k is the kth image of a total number of k high speed images m is the number of modes and m k ϕ m represents the mth pod mode c m k is the weighting coefficient that represents the contribution of mth mode to the reconstruction of kth image ϕ m contains spatial information while c m k contains temporal information about the filed in this work each data set contains 4000 high speed images corresponding to an observation time of 0 1 s m k 4000 each transformed high speed image can be regarded as a gray level field the energy fraction ef k e m is defined as 2 k e m k e m m 1 m k e m images can be reconstructed through equation 1 by summing the products of every mode and corresponding coefficients thus ef shows the relative importance of every mode in the reconstruction of all images modes are arranged with decreasing ef start from mode 1 which represent the compositions of the field large scale structures are highlighted in the low order modes in this paper modes show the fundamental compositions of the cavitation cloud in submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the pod of high speed images is realized through matlab code 3 results and discussion 3 1 behavior of cavitation cloud a set of raw high speed images are provided in fig 6 it shows the very first moments of submerged cavitation jet with micro particles arriving at the disc shape metal target the ejection of the jet cavitation cloud can be seen in the first few frames there are totally 19 images from the initiation of cavitation cloud not shown in fig 6 until the arrival of cavitation cloud at the sample surface the 15th image in fig 6 considering a maximum deviation of two frames the travel time of cavitation cloud before it reaches the target is 450 500 μs which means the average tip velocity of the cavitation cloud is 100 111 11 m s after the cavitation cloud arrives at the target it moves radially on the surface along with the radial flow of water jet the stagnation pressure will cause the collapse of cavitation bubbles resulting in cavitation erosion a detailed comparison between high speed images of submerged cavitation jet with and without micro particles under the same hydraulic condition is given in fig 7 during 0 0 9 ms the submerged cavitation jet fig 7 b undergoes a whole cycle from inception to collapse displaying a typical periodic behavior peng et al 2016 2018a watanabe et al 2016 wright et al 2013 during the same time submerged cavitation jet with micro particles does not show any sign of periodicity no shedding of cavitation cloud or subsequent periodic behavior can be observed in fig 7 a on the contrary the cavitation cloud always exists and only has some fluctuations in terms of area and position the disappearance of the periodic shedding of cavitation results from the reduced cavitation threshold caused by micro particles in submerged cavitation jet the unsteady behavior of cavitation cloud is mainly decided by the complex pressure gradient of the jet shear layer the re entrant motion hutli et al 2016 peng et al 2018a pointed by arrow a in fig 7 b clearly induces the shedding of cavitation cloud when the micro particles are added into the jet they are distributed within the entire jet and can locally nucleate more cavitation bubbles by reducing the minus pressure required for cavitation inception in this way even small turbulence pressure that cannot maintain cavitation bubbles in submerged cavitation jet may be able to sustain cavitation bubbles when there are micro particles the determining effects of shear layer structure and turbulence pressure are thus diminished and the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud will attenuate or even vanish when plentiful micro particles are present in the jet another prominent change is the tremendous expansion of cavitation area for example the maximum radial spreading of cavitation cloud on target surface is about 20 mm in fig 7 a while it is only about 10 mm in fig 7 b the evident expansion of cavitation cloud directly proves the effect of micro particles on promoting cavitation in submerged cavitation jet 3 2 pod analysis the relevance indexes chen et al 2013 of the first pod modes derived from different data sets of high speed images are always more than 0 9 which means from a statistical point of view the obtained pod modes highly resemble each others the results of high speed filming are repeatable and accurate the first 5 pod modes of submerged cavitation jet with micro particles 40 mesh 3 05 wt at five standoff distances 10 20 30 40 and 50 mm are illustrated in fig 8 in general the first five modes totally possess more than 90 of efs meaning they are the basic compositions of cavitation cloud in the jet at all standoff distances mode 1 usually has an ef larger than 80 they can be regarded as the ensemble average gray level fields that make up the basic frame of cavitation cloud the ef of mode 1 increases with standoff distance inferring that the jet is able to completely develop at larger standoff distances and the effect of bottom target wall radial flow becomes less important the cavitation area shown by mode 1 obviously increases after the micro particles are added all of the mode 1 in fig 8 show the direct contact of cavitation cloud with the target except when standoff distance is 50 mm while in the case of submerged cavitation jet figs 4 and 5 of peng et al 2018a the cavitation cloud can directly impact on the surface in mode 1 only when standoff distance is 10 mm the massive contact region shown in fig 8 means a large amount of cavitation bubbles arrive at and collapse on the target surface especially at small standoff distances however as will be shown in section 3 3 and 3 4 this does not ensure a noteworthy cavitation erosion capacity at all standoff distances in submerged cavitation jet without micro particles modes 2 5 are all organized in pairs peng et al 2018a these paired structures represent the same orthogonal component of the periodic cavitation cloud graftieaux et al 2001 and demonstrate the periodicity of cavitation cloud on the other side modes 2 5 in fig 8 are not paired they stand for the minor structures of cavitation cloud in general most of the modes are symmetrically distributed around the jet center line except for some higher modes at small standoff distances modes 3 5 at standoff distances of 10 and 20 mm are quite chaotic because the jet radial flow disturbs the movement of cavitation cloud as the wall effect attenuates with increasing standoff distance modes 3 5 become more ordered and symmetrically distribute around the jet fig 9 shows the effect of micro particle 40 mesh concentration on the pod modes at the same standoff distance of 40 mm as the micro particle concentration increases from 0 56 wt fig 9 a to 3 05 wt fig 9 e the cavitation area shown in mode 1 significantly increases suppose the gray level value is proportional to the vapor fraction so does the contact region between the cavitation cloud and the target an increased micro particle concentration means more heterogeneous nuclei for cavitation and thus the cavitation cloud expands it is interesting that there are apparent paired structures in modes 3 5 of fig 9 a mode 3 comprises two counter rotating lobe shape structures while modes 4 and 5 represent the same structures with spatial shift to the downstream that is to say a micro particle concentration of 0 56 wt is not sufficient to overcome the effect of shear layer structure and eliminate the periodic behavior of cavitation cloud two approximate paired structures are also visible in modes 4 and 5 of fig 9 b where the concentration rises to 1 12 wt more cavitation nuclei are still needed when the micro particle concentration increases to 1 53 wt and above no paired structures appear in modes 2 5 the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud is totally suppressed and the periodic behavior disappears fig 10 shows the effect of micro particle size on the pod modes under the same standoff distance of 50 mm and concentration of 1 53 wt the major cavitation area in mode 1 and the minor cavitation structures in modes 2 5 increase with decreasing micro particle size when the mass concentration is fixed the number of micro particles and cavitation nuclei is inversely proportional to their sizes in other words the concentration of small particles is higher than that of large particles on the other hand single micro particle with larger size is more beneficial for lowering the cavitation threshold and inducing cavitation borkent et al 2007 holl 1970 mørch 2007 however under present conditions the effect of higher concentration is superior to the reduced ability of promoting cavitation for smaller micro particles as a result the cavitation area increases with decreasing size of micro particles 3 3 cavitation noise when the cavitation bubbles collapse they create loud sound called cavitation noise therefore the magnitude of cavitation noise can be used to estimate the intensity of cavitation bubble collapse the hydrophone was placed at the same height with the nozzle exit and it received all the cavitation sound waves that were interfered and reflected in the vessel the recorded cavitation noise characterized the overall intensity of cavitation bubble collapse in the whole flow field for each measurement the background noise was subtracted from the original records the background noise resulted from the operations of experimental equipment plunger pump electric blender et al for measuring the background noise the nozzle was lifted out of the vessel and removed laterally to a different position so that the water jet would eject into air exclude cavitation noise then all the experimental equipment was switched on and the background noise was recorded by the hydrophone the hydrophone signals and acoustic power of cavitation noise at different standoff distances are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively in comparison with submerged cavitation jet peng et al 2018a the acoustic power has remarkable improvements in submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the minimum increase 33 85 takes place at standoff distance of 10 mm while the maximum increase 113 24 occurs at standoff distance of 30 mm cavitation noise has greater improvement at large standoff distances it is validated that the addition of micro particles helps to produce more cavitation bubbles whose collapses enhance the overall cavitation noise the deviations of cavitation noise acoustical power are explicitly expressed as error bars standard deviations in figs 12 14 the deviations are relatively small meaning good repeatability of the cavitation noise measurement for both cases with and without micro particles standoff distance has similar influence on the acoustic power which first increases and gradually converges with standoff distance recall that at a standoff distance of 10 mm a large scale distribution of cavitation cloud can be observed on the target surface in fig 8 however the collapse of cavitation bubble estimated from cavitation noise fig 12 is not intense at all the reason for this contraction is the premature size of cavitation bubbles at standoff distance of 10 mm individual cavitation bubbles moving with the jet do not have enough time to grow to the maximum size considering that the collapse intensity of cavitation bubble is proportional to its size the resulting cavitation noise is weak this indicates that the damage potential of cavitation bubbles are very limited at small standoff distances on the other hand the collapse of cavitation bubble is more destructive inferred by the stronger cavitation noise at large standoff distances as they have more time to grow into large sizes the influence of micro particle concentration on cavitation noise is shown in fig 13 the cavitation acoustic power is found to linearly increase with micro particle concentration under the current experimental condition the maximum concentration is 3 05 wt due to the capacity of the peristaltic pump it is theoretically predicted that the acoustic power will finally converge with increasing micro particle concentration once there are sufficient cavitation nuclei distributed in the jet as is stated in section 3 2 under the same mass concentration smaller micro particles can produce more cavitation bubbles this is verified by the change of cavitation noise shown in fig 14 where the caustic power of cavitation noise increases with decreasing micro particle diameter 3 4 mass loss erosion pattern and surface morphology of sandstone samples the mass loss of sandstone samples eroded by submerged cavitation jet with and without micro particles under various standoff distances and erosion times is given in fig 15 the erosion test is performed only once based on our previous experimental results of eroding sandstone the maximum deviation of mass loss should be less than 15 as standoff distance increases fig 15 a the mass loss of sandstone rapidly drops from the first peak then rises to the second peak and finally falls again this trend holds for both cases with and without micro particles the double peaks in mass loss curve are typical for submerged cavitation jet momma and lichtarowicz 1995 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 in present study the first peak of mass loss is attributed to the impact of high speed water jet in submerged cavitation jet without micro particles while in submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the abrasion and impact of solid particles also contribute to the erosion similar to abrasive jet the second mass loss peak mainly results from the cavitation bubble collapses as is shown in section 3 3 the intensity of cavitation bubble collapse increases with standoff distances however larger standoff distance means cavitation bubbles have to travel more distance to reach the target more bubbles are likely to collapse halfway and there will be less cavitation bubbles that collapse close to the target consequently the sample erosion at large standoff distances 40 and 50 mm declines the maximum cavitation erosion happens in an intermediate standoff distance of 30 mm where the bubble collapse intensity increases with standoff distance and the number of bubbles that can reach the target decreases with standoff distance are well balanced the addition of micro particles has lead to considerable improvements of mass loss the relative increase of sandstone mass loss ranges from 43 94 to 74 41 at standoff distances from 5 to 50 mm when standoff distance is 30 mm and above the relative increases of mass loss are much less than the increase percentages of cavitation noise fig 12 the reason is that the cavitation noise reflects the cavitation intensity of the whole flow filed in the vessel 3 d while the mass loss only reflects the cavitation intensity near the sandstone surface 2 d the mass loss with increasing erosion time is shown in fig 15 b the relative increase of mass loss ranges from 24 74 to 86 96 under erosion times between 120 and 960 s and the increase percentage drops when erosion time is more than 480 s the macroscopic erosion patterns of sandstone samples eroded under different standoff distances and erosion times are displayed in figs 16 and 17 there is a transient change of erosion pattern as standoff distance increases at small standoff distances of 5 and 10 mm an enormous central hole accounts for most of the mass loss it is either eroded by the water jet fig 16 a or the abrasive jet fig 16 b it is well known that micro particles can be accelerated by the water jet referred as macroscopic acceleration the high speed over 100 m s as measured in section 3 1 micro particles can cause drastic erosion by impacting and abrading the sandstone as a result the diameter and depth of the central hole are greatly improved fig 16 a standoff distance 5 and 10 mm however the macroscopic acceleration of micro particles and the subsequent abrasion effect take effect only at a short standoff distance it can be seen in fig 16 that the central holes are nearly of the same size when standoff distance rises to 20 mm beyond this standoff distance the macroscopic acceleration of micro particles is negligible as the surrounding water continually slows down the water jet and micro particles at small standoff distances of 5 and 10 mm the effect of cavitation on mass loss is insignificant for both cases with and without micro particles cavitation only slightly changes the surface morphology around the central hole fig 19 the minor cavitation erosion is consistent with the cavitation noise measurement at standoff distance of 10 mm at standoff distance of 20 mm fig 16 a and b cavitation erosion in the form of crater shape erosion zone with coarse surface starts to be observable when standoff distance rises to 30 mm the central hole is less important while the cavitation erosion zone around it becomes conspicuous at this standoff distance the cavitation erosion is most remarkable some of the cavitation pits are comparable to the central hole unlike the metal material peng et al 2018a there is no undamaged zone around the central hole on sandstone comparatively the cavitation erosion zone is wider and deeper for submerged cavitation jet with micro particles fig 16 b standoff distance 30 mm mainly due to the promoted cavitation another possible reason for the increased erosion is the microscopic acceleration of micro particles during the cavitation bubble nucleation arora et al 2004 borkent et al 2008 wu et al 2017 and collapse dunstan and li 2010 shengcai 2006 processes it is reported that during the nucleation an expanding cavitation bubble with maximum radius of 2 mm can eject a nearby suspending particle with radii 100 500 μm to a maximum velocity over 60 m s wu et al 2017 when a cavitation bubble collapses the micro jet can take in adjacent micro particles and accelerate them like a microscopic abrasive jet dunstan and li 2010 shengcai 2006 at proper direction the accelerated micro particles can impact on sandstone surface and enhance erosion in this sense submerged cavitation jet with micro particles benefits from the synergistic effect of micro particles and cavitation bubbles the added micro particles provide extra cavitation nuclei that will facilitate and stimulate cavitation the activated cavitation bubble will in turn accelerate the micro particles both stronger cavitation intensity and accelerated micro particles are in favor of improving the erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet as standoff distance further increases to 40 and 50 mm the central hole becomes less obvious due to the sharp attenuation of water jet the size of the cavitation erosion zone also decreases as fewer cavitation bubbles are able to reach the sandstone surface nevertheless the cavitation erosion is more visible in fig 16 b where the micro particles are added into the jet the erosion zones on sandstone samples at standoff distances of 50 mm are viewed by the laser scanning microscope fig 18 a and b the central hole deep blue color results from the water jet impingement while the surrounding regions light blue green and yellow color are the cavitation erosion zone from the measurements for sandstone eroded by submerged cavitation jet fig 18 a the volume of central hole is 2 09 mm3 12 58 of total erosion volume and the volume of cavitation erosion zone is 13 77 mm3 87 42 of total erosion volume for sandstone eroded by submerged cavitation jet with micro particles fig 18 b the two volumes are 21 85 mm3 91 87 and 1 93 mm3 8 13 in comparison the volume of cavitation erosion zone increases by 8 08 mm3 after the addition of micro particles while the volume of central hole barely changes note that the total erosion volumes measured from the laser microscope are less than the volumes calculated from the mass loss this is because the laser scanning microscope fails to cover the entire erosion zones considering that the unscanned area all belong to the cavitation erosion zone the actual volume and percentage of cavitation erosion zone should be even larger despite this deficiency it is still confident to conclude that the addition of micro particles helps to enhance the cavitation erosion of submerged cavitation jet on sandstone samples it is possible to improve the rock breaking efficiency of submerged cavitation jet in underground petroleum drilling by adding micro particles to the jet fig 17 shows the sandstone samples with increasing erosion times when the sandstone is eroded for 120 s only a very shallow crater is visible the surface around the crater becomes slightly rough due to cavitation no obvious difference can be seen between the sandstones eroded by jets with and without micro particles certain growth of the central hole and cavitation damage can be observed under the erosion time of 240 s as the erosion time increases to 480 s the cavitation pits around the central hole greatly develop forming a crater shape cavitation erosion zone the cavitation erosion zone further expands as erosion time increases to 720 s and 960 s the addition of micro particles broadly improves the size of the cavitation erosion zone which is also supported by the scanning results of sandstones fig 18 c and d compared with fig 18 c the cavitation erosion pits are larger and deeper in fig 18 d where micro particles are added the volumes of central hole and cavitation erosion zone are 13 40 mm3 22 31 and 46 65 mm3 77 69 for submerged cavitation jet while they are 11 58 mm3 15 66 and 62 36 mm3 84 34 for submerged cavitation jet with micro particles because of the heterogeneity of sandstone and the preference of cavitation bubbles to collect and collapse at protruding structures the degree of erosion is not uniform in the whole cavitation erosion zone some parts are more damaged than others and the difference becomes more recognizable with increasing erosion time e g fig 17 a b erosion time 960 s the microscopic surface morphology of sandstone samples is presented in figs 19 and 20 the measurements are conducted on cavitation erosion zones shown as red squares in figs 16 and 17 where the cavitation damage is mostly visible in general the addition of micro particles always increases the surface roughness of cavitation erosion zone which means the promotion of cavitation damage at standoff distance of 10 mm several ravine like craters appear in fig 19 a while the craters are broader in fig 19 b the relative small values of surface roughness suggest the low intensity of cavitation bubble collapse large cavitation pits can be found at cavitation erosion zones when standoff distance increases to 30 mm the inner faces of the cavitation pits are coarse and uneven when standoff distance rises to 50 mm the depths of cavitation pits decrease while the 2 d area holds fig 19 e or even increases a little fig 19 f as is shown in fig 16 the overall size of cavitation erosion zone decreases when standoff distance is 40 mm and above however it should also be noted that at standoff distance of 50 mm the remaining cavitation bubbles tend to locally concentrate due to the disappearance of the jet potential core and the closure of shear layer consequently the size of single cavitation pits can still be considerable fig 20 displays the microscopic evolution of cavitation erosion with increasing times at 240 s only isolated shallow cavitation pits can be seen in fig 20 a while the pits are more connected in fig 20 b some part of the surface is nearly intact again the addition of micro particles increases the surface roughness of sandstone the cavitation pits grow and the surface becomes more rugged as the erosion time increases for ductile metal material the cavitation damage follows the processes of plastic deformation and fatigue cavitation erosion develops because of the growth of single erosion pits and the connection of adjacent pits peng et al 2018a the development of erosion pits on brittle sandstone is different no plastic deformation happens in the erosion process and the erosion pits grow as the sediment minerals are continuously peeled off by cavitation as a result the inner surfaces of cavitation pits on sandstone are much coarser than those on metal materials the surface roughness of the cavitation orison zone can be used to represent the degree of cavitation damage each value of the surface roughness in fig 21 is averaged from the measurements of five different locations on the same sandstone sample and the corresponding standard deviations are given as error bars submerged cavitation jet with micro particles is able to increase the surface roughness by 37 47 128 28 at different standoff distances fig 21 a and 7 46 58 43 under different erosion times fig 21 b the improvement seems to recede with increasing standoff distance and erosion time major deviations of measured surface roughness can be found in the under large standoff distances and long erosion times 4 conclusion silica sand micro particles of diameters between 0 075 200 mesh and 0 425 mm 40 mesh are added into submerged cavitation jet in the form of suspension liquid the micro particles have sharp edges and rough surfaces which are proper cavitation nuclei for heterogeneous nucleation high speed visualization cavitation noise measurement and erosion test are conducted to validate the improved cavitation intensity and erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the high speed filming and pod analysis show two major changes after micro particles are added into the jet the disappearance of the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud and the tremendous expansion of cavitation region the size of cavitation cloud and the jet cavitation noise both increase with increasing micro particle concentration 0 3 05 wt and decreasing micro particle size 0 425 0 075 mm the acoustic power of cavitation noise rises by 33 85 113 24 at standoff distances of 10 50 mm with the addition of micro particles the erosion test of sandstone shows that submerged cavitation jet with micro particles can increase the mass loss by 43 94 74 41 at standoff distances of 5 50 mm 24 74 86 96 under erosion times of 120 960 s when standoff distance 20 mm the enhanced erosion mainly comes from the impact and abrasion of micro particles accelerated by the water jet when standoff distance 30 mm the enhanced erosion results from the synergistic effect of micro particles and cavitation bubbles the added micro particles provide extra cavitation nuclei that can facilitate and stimulate cavitation and the activated cavitation bubbles will in turn accelerate some of the micro particles both the promoted cavitation intensity and the impact of accelerated micro particles are in favor of improving the jet erosion ability the maximum cavitation erosion is achieved at a standoff distance of 30 mm where the bubble collapse intensity and the number of bubbles that can reach the sandstone are well balanced the addition of micro particles increases the surface roughness of the cavitation erosion zone by 37 47 128 28 at different standoff distances and 7 46 58 43 under different erosion times the above results lead to a unanimous conclusion under the same condition of pump pressure and nozzle geometry the addition of micro particles is able to enhance the cavitation intensity and the erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet it is more energy saving than increasing the pump pressure submerged cavitation jet with micro particles has potential applications in the drilling of petroleum wells credit authorship contribution statement chi peng conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing original

phenomenon in hydraulic engineering when the local hydrostatic pressure drops below the saturated vapor pressure vapor cavities called cavitation bubbles will be formed in the liquid brennen 2013 when the local pressure recovers the cavitation bubbles will collapse inducing extremely high pressure and temperature alehossein and qin 2007 choi and chahine 2016 if a cavitation bubble collapses near a solid boundary it will also produce high speed micro jet toward the boundary philipp and lauterborn 1998 the micro jet along with the shock waves momma and lichtarowicz 1995 upon cavitation bubble collapse are believed to be responsible for the cavitation damage cavitation can cause permanent deformation pits and craters on metal surface hsiao et al 2014 pöhl et al 2015 it can also result in noise vibration and efficiency decline in hydraulic machinery arndt 1981 equipment such as pump turbine and propeller is easy to suffer from cavitation although it is unwanted in most hydraulic machinery cavitation is welcomed in submerged cavitation jet where the destructive power of cavitation bubble can be utilized to dispose organic waste water dindar 2016 clean marine pipelines improve drilling rate of petroleum wells break rocks gensheng et al 2005 and perform shotless peening soyama et al 2011 et al in submerged cavitation jet dissolved gas and tiny impurities in the working fluid in most cases water serve as the cavitation nuclei mørch 2007 when water flows through nozzle the hydrostatic pressure drops dramatically due to bernoulli s principle consequently cavitation bubbles are activated from the nuclei and travel downstream with the jet the cavitation bubbles expand in the jet shear layer where the local turbulence pressure can be extremely low massive cavitation bubbles can constitute visible coalesce called cavitation cloud when cavitation bubbles approach the target they collapse as the stagnation pressure is recovered releasing the damage power of cavitation since its emergence in the 1980s submerged cavitation jet has enjoyed extensive researches chahine et al 1987 guoyi et al 2016 hattori et al 2006 hutli et al 2017 hutli et al 2016 hutli and nedeljkovic 2008 kim et al 2014 li et al 2018 li et al 2017 li et al 2016a b li et al 2016c li et al 2015 peng et al 2018a peng and shimizu 2013 peng et al 2018b peng et al 2017 sato et al 2009 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 soyama et al 1995 watanabe et al 2016 wright et al 2013 which are generally concerned about the effects of hydraulic conditions upstream ambient pressures standoff distance cavitation number fluid temperature et al and nozzle geometries on the structural characteristics and erosion performance of submerged cavitation jet making the first attempt of using high speed photography to view submerged cavitation jet chahine et al 1987 revealed the periodic behavior of cavitation cloud which was composed of four stages including inception transition shedding and collapse hydraulic conditions had direct influence on the shedding frequency and volume of cavitation cloud soyama et al 1995 visualized submerged cavitation jet from conical cylindrical and horn nozzles and conformed that the shedding frequency of cavitation cloud decreased with increasing upstream pressure the inverse relationship between upstream pressure and shedding frequency was also found by hutli and nedeljkovic 2008 sato et al 2009 argued that the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud resulted from the re entrant jet wright et al 2013 investigated the traveling distance velocity shedding frequency and area of cavitation cloud at various reynolds numbers in submerged cavitation jet guoyi et al 2016 numerically simulated the periodic behavior of submerged cavitation jet usta et al 2019 investigated cavitation noise and erosion characteristics of submerged cavitation jet the idea of using submerged cavitation jet for the erosion test was first proposed and implemented by lichtarowicz 1972 yamaguchi and shimizu 1987 momma 1991 momma and lichtarowicz 1995 and soyama et al 1998 have contributed to the erosion test of submerged cavitation jet with their successful studies of testing mechanism and applications hattori et al 2006 experimentally analyzed the influence of temperature on the erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet hutli et al 2017 proved that the ring shape erosion on target surface corresponded to the places of cavitation bubble collapse watanabe et al 2016 researched the changing characteristics of cavitation cloud and corresponding erosion distributions li et al 2018 2017 2016a b 2016c 2015 investigated the effects of nozzle inner roughness area discontinuity of nozzle inlet feeding pipe diameter and strouhal number on the performance of submerged cavitation jet peng et al 2018b 2017 analyzed the erosion ability and cavitation intensity of submerged cavitation jet under high ambient pressure condition the present authors peng et al 2018a demonstrated that the cavitation erosion pattern was decided by the cavitation cloud structure of submerged cavitation jet through simultaneous high speed view and erosion test as is shown by the previous researches the performance of submerged cavitation jet is highly related to the cavitation intensity to improve the erosion ability of the jet it is necessary to enhance the cavitation intensity increasing the pump pressure upstream pressure is a common way to promote cavitation as it improves the turbulence level but increasing pump pressure requires additional power and is limited by the maximum pump capacity another option may be adding extra cavitation nuclei e g micro particles into the jet according to the heterogeneous nucleation theory apfel 1970 atchley and prosperetti 1989 harvey et al 1944 adding micro particles into purified water can drastically decrease the liquid tension required for cavitation inception borkent et al 2007 2009 mørch 2007 marschall et al 2003 by adding micro particles with diameter up to 76 μm into filtered water marschall et al 2003 managed to reduce the tensile strength of water down to 1 3 of the original value similar results were obtained by borkent et al 2007 and mørch 2007 moreover it was found in the ultrasonic cavitation experiments gu et al 2016 hu and zheng 2017 huang et al 1996 lian et al 2018 romero et al 2019 that the addition of micro particles could enhance the cavitation intensity and cavitation erosion under certain conditions this paper is going to investigate the feasibility of enhancing the cavitation intensity and erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet by adding silica sand micro particles as far as the authors know there has been few researches about the influence of micro particles on the cavitation intensity of submerged cavitation jet the added micro particles can lower the cavitation threshold and provide extra cavitation nucleation sites which are benefit for stimulating jet cavitation a series of experiments are conducted high speed filming is applied to view the cavitation cloud in the jet hydrophone is used to measure the cavitation noise and erosion test of sandstone is performed to demonstrate the improved erosion ability the results are compared with our previous findings peng et al 2018a in submerged cavitation jet

cavitation cloud periodicity the increase of cavitation region and cavitation noise and enhanced erosion of sandstone samples the conclusion will be given in section 4 it is expected that present work will provide a potential method to stimulate cavitation and improve the erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet without increasing upstream pressure 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were carried out at high pressure water jet laboratory of china university of petroleum beijing fig 1 schematically depicts the experimental setup a high pressure plunger pump kmt streamline sl v50 with an inbuilt bladder accumulator provided the upstream pressure a pressure gauge accuracy 0 3 fs was set at the pump outlet to show the output pressure the jet flow rate was measured by a turbine flowmeter accuracy 0 5 fs the micro particles were added into the jet in the form of suspension liquid through a hole drilled in the wall of the cylindrical nozzle fig 2 the entrainment effect of jet would suck in the suspension which was comprised of certain percentages by weight of distilled water guar increase viscosity and micro particles during the experiments an electric blender stirred the suspension to mix it and prevent the sediment of micro particles the purpose of using micro particle suspension is to preciously control its concentration by adjusting the rotating speed flow rate of the peristaltic pump which pumped the suspension from a sealed container the mass concentration of micro particles can be calculated from the flow rates of the jet and the peristaltic pump a transparent water vessel made of acrylic resin was used to produce the submerged condition the y coordinate was along the direction of jet ejection and the origin was set at the nozzle exit the experimental conditions are listed in table 1 ignoring the pressure loss from plunger pump to nozzle the upstream pressure was 50 mpa the acrylic water vessel was not lidded so the downstream pressure p downstream was equal to the atmospheric pressure due to the bladder accumulator that damped out pump pulsations the jet flow rate was relatively stable which slightly fluctuated around 0 96 l min during the experiments considering the accuracy of the flowmeter 0 5 fs the flow rate had a maximum deviation of 0 05 l min cavitation number σ p d o w n s t r e a m p v a p o r 0 5 ρ v t h r o a t 2 was 0 038 v thorat was calculated from the jet flow rate and nozzle throat diameter v thorat 226 35 m s tap water was stored and exposed to atmosphere in the water tank a day before the experiment to maintain a consistent water quality gas nuclei the temperature of tap water in tank was about 20 c it is well known that the massive collapses of cavitation bubbles in the jet will release a great amount of heat and the temperature of vessel water will constantly increase as the erosion test continues to avoid the thermal effect that would influence the erosion ability of cavitation jet dular 2016 hattori et al 2006 2012 the temperature of vessel water was measured every 30 s using an infrared thermometer resolution 0 5 c maximum error 1 c if the water temperature was more than 23 c the experiment paused the vessel was totally drained and refilled with fresh tank water then the erosion test restarted the time interval between two pauses ranged from 120 to 300 s depending on the experimental parameters in this way the water temperature was kept at 20 23 c during the experiment despite of the differences of experimental apparatus and conditions the erosion test followed the guidance of astm standard g 134 in terms of the calibration of nozzle preparation of test sample and test procedures a high speed camera phantom v310 lens af80 200mmf 2 8d was used to film the cavitation cloud in submerged cavitation jet which worked at a frame rate of 40 000 fps with a shutter time of 25 μs the initial image size was 256 256 pixels and one pixel equaled to about 0 3 mm a halogen lamp placed opposite to the camera provided the illumination cavitation cloud appeared as the dark part in the original high speed images each data set of high speed filming covered a time span of 5 s a hydrophone brüel kjær type 8105 was used to record the cavitation noise the hydrophone was composed of a flexible signal wire and a probe at tip to keep the hydrophone probe at a stable position in the vessel during the experiment part of the signal mire and the probe were attached to an l shape steel bar the l shape steel bar was not shown in fig 1 one end of the bar that is far from the probe was fixed at the edge of the acrylic vessel in this way the hydrophone probe was totally emerged in the water and it was not in contact with the wall of acrylic vessel under each experimental condition the high speed filming of cavitation cloud and the measurement of cavitation noise were repeated five times an uncertainty analysis of the repeated tests was performed and the standard deviations were calculated a comprehensive analysis for the source of error was not conducted 2 2 micro particles in this work silica sand was selected as the micro particles added into the jet for its hardness and easy availability silica sands of four sizes diameters were prepared 40 mesh 0 425 mm 80 mesh 0 18 mm 120 mesh 0 125 mm and 200 mesh 0 075 mm as shown in fig 3 microscopic views of the silica sands fig 4 reveal that the cubic micro particles have sharp edges and rough surfaces on one hand it is found that micro particles with rough surfaces are more favorable for inducing cavitation than micro particles with smooth surfaces borkent et al 2007 marschall et al 2003 on the other hand sharp edges are beneficial for improving the abrasion and impact of micro particles in the experiments five concentrations 0 56 1 12 1 53 2 25 and 3 05 wt were tested using the silica sand of 40 mesh 2 3 sandstone samples as we are interested in the application of submerged cavitation jet to the underground petroleum drilling sandstone was chosen to be the target material for erosion test which is a typical rock in petroleum engineering the mineral composition and mechanical properties of the sandstone samples are listed in tables 2 and 3 the samples were cut into cylinders with diameter of 25 mm and height of 50 mm the top and bottom surfaces were polished the initial surface roughness ra was less than 5 μm measured by a 3 d laser scanning microscope keyence vk x160k the weight was measured by an analytical balance with a resolution of 0 1 mg after erosion test the samples were dried before weighing in order to better view the radial movement of cavitation cloud in the high speed filming a disc shape metal target with diameter of 100 mm was placed on the holder in the cavitation noise measurement and the erosion test sandstone samples were always used 2 4 proper orthogonal decomposition before the image sets are further processed every image is subtracted by a corresponding background image that is taken before the start of the visualization experiment to remove possible interference from lens and illumination to highlight the cavitation region images are cut into proper sizes then they are transformed into gray scale images in which the cavitation cloud is shown as the bright area each pixel on the gray image owns a gray value between 0 black and 255 white same as our last work peng et al 2018a proper orthogonal decomposition pod is used to distinguish the spatial and temporary coherent structures of cavitation cloud in submerged cavitation jet the essential ideas of pod is introduced in this section while readers can find more details in chen et al 2013 peng et al 2018a the principle of pod is to decompose a time series of high speed filming images regarded as transient scalar fields that show the position and area of cavitation cloud into a linear combination of basic spatial modes and temporal coefficients 1 g k m 1 m c m k ϕ m where g k is the kth image of a total number of k high speed images m is the number of modes and m k ϕ m represents the mth pod mode c m k is the weighting coefficient that represents the contribution of mth mode to the reconstruction of kth image ϕ m contains spatial information while c m k contains temporal information about the filed in this work each data set contains 4000 high speed images corresponding to an observation time of 0 1 s m k 4000 each transformed high speed image can be regarded as a gray level field the energy fraction ef k e m is defined as 2 k e m k e m m 1 m k e m images can be reconstructed through equation 1 by summing the products of every mode and corresponding coefficients thus ef shows the relative importance of every mode in the reconstruction of all images modes are arranged with decreasing ef start from mode 1 which represent the compositions of the field large scale structures are highlighted in the low order modes in this paper modes show the fundamental compositions of the cavitation cloud in submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the pod of high speed images is realized through matlab code 3 results and discussion 3 1 behavior of cavitation cloud a set of raw high speed images are provided in fig 6 it shows the very first moments of submerged cavitation jet with micro particles arriving at the disc shape metal target the ejection of the jet cavitation cloud can be seen in the first few frames there are totally 19 images from the initiation of cavitation cloud not shown in fig 6 until the arrival of cavitation cloud at the sample surface the 15th image in fig 6 considering a maximum deviation of two frames the travel time of cavitation cloud before it reaches the target is 450 500 μs which means the average tip velocity of the cavitation cloud is 100 111 11 m s after the cavitation cloud arrives at the target it moves radially on the surface along with the radial flow of water jet the stagnation pressure will cause the collapse of cavitation bubbles resulting in cavitation erosion a detailed comparison between high speed images of submerged cavitation jet with and without micro particles under the same hydraulic condition is given in fig 7 during 0 0 9 ms the submerged cavitation jet fig 7 b undergoes a whole cycle from inception to collapse displaying a typical periodic behavior peng et al 2016 2018a watanabe et al 2016 wright et al 2013 during the same time submerged cavitation jet with micro particles does not show any sign of periodicity no shedding of cavitation cloud or subsequent periodic behavior can be observed in fig 7 a on the contrary the cavitation cloud always exists and only has some fluctuations in terms of area and position the disappearance of the periodic shedding of cavitation results from the reduced cavitation threshold caused by micro particles in submerged cavitation jet the unsteady behavior of cavitation cloud is mainly decided by the complex pressure gradient of the jet shear layer the re entrant motion hutli et al 2016 peng et al 2018a pointed by arrow a in fig 7 b clearly induces the shedding of cavitation cloud when the micro particles are added into the jet they are distributed within the entire jet and can locally nucleate more cavitation bubbles by reducing the minus pressure required for cavitation inception in this way even small turbulence pressure that cannot maintain cavitation bubbles in submerged cavitation jet may be able to sustain cavitation bubbles when there are micro particles the determining effects of shear layer structure and turbulence pressure are thus diminished and the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud will attenuate or even vanish when plentiful micro particles are present in the jet another prominent change is the tremendous expansion of cavitation area for example the maximum radial spreading of cavitation cloud on target surface is about 20 mm in fig 7 a while it is only about 10 mm in fig 7 b the evident expansion of cavitation cloud directly proves the effect of micro particles on promoting cavitation in submerged cavitation jet 3 2 pod analysis the relevance indexes chen et al 2013 of the first pod modes derived from different data sets of high speed images are always more than 0 9 which means from a statistical point of view the obtained pod modes highly resemble each others the results of high speed filming are repeatable and accurate the first 5 pod modes of submerged cavitation jet with micro particles 40 mesh 3 05 wt at five standoff distances 10 20 30 40 and 50 mm are illustrated in fig 8 in general the first five modes totally possess more than 90 of efs meaning they are the basic compositions of cavitation cloud in the jet at all standoff distances mode 1 usually has an ef larger than 80 they can be regarded as the ensemble average gray level fields that make up the basic frame of cavitation cloud the ef of mode 1 increases with standoff distance inferring that the jet is able to completely develop at larger standoff distances and the effect of bottom target wall radial flow becomes less important the cavitation area shown by mode 1 obviously increases after the micro particles are added all of the mode 1 in fig 8 show the direct contact of cavitation cloud with the target except when standoff distance is 50 mm while in the case of submerged cavitation jet figs 4 and 5 of peng et al 2018a the cavitation cloud can directly impact on the surface in mode 1 only when standoff distance is 10 mm the massive contact region shown in fig 8 means a large amount of cavitation bubbles arrive at and collapse on the target surface especially at small standoff distances however as will be shown in section 3 3 and 3 4 this does not ensure a noteworthy cavitation erosion capacity at all standoff distances in submerged cavitation jet without micro particles modes 2 5 are all organized in pairs peng et al 2018a these paired structures represent the same orthogonal component of the periodic cavitation cloud graftieaux et al 2001 and demonstrate the periodicity of cavitation cloud on the other side modes 2 5 in fig 8 are not paired they stand for the minor structures of cavitation cloud in general most of the modes are symmetrically distributed around the jet center line except for some higher modes at small standoff distances modes 3 5 at standoff distances of 10 and 20 mm are quite chaotic because the jet radial flow disturbs the movement of cavitation cloud as the wall effect attenuates with increasing standoff distance modes 3 5 become more ordered and symmetrically distribute around the jet fig 9 shows the effect of micro particle 40 mesh concentration on the pod modes at the same standoff distance of 40 mm as the micro particle concentration increases from 0 56 wt fig 9 a to 3 05 wt fig 9 e the cavitation area shown in mode 1 significantly increases suppose the gray level value is proportional to the vapor fraction so does the contact region between the cavitation cloud and the target an increased micro particle concentration means more heterogeneous nuclei for cavitation and thus the cavitation cloud expands it is interesting that there are apparent paired structures in modes 3 5 of fig 9 a mode 3 comprises two counter rotating lobe shape structures while modes 4 and 5 represent the same structures with spatial shift to the downstream that is to say a micro particle concentration of 0 56 wt is not sufficient to overcome the effect of shear layer structure and eliminate the periodic behavior of cavitation cloud two approximate paired structures are also visible in modes 4 and 5 of fig 9 b where the concentration rises to 1 12 wt more cavitation nuclei are still needed when the micro particle concentration increases to 1 53 wt and above no paired structures appear in modes 2 5 the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud is totally suppressed and the periodic behavior disappears fig 10 shows the effect of micro particle size on the pod modes under the same standoff distance of 50 mm and concentration of 1 53 wt the major cavitation area in mode 1 and the minor cavitation structures in modes 2 5 increase with decreasing micro particle size when the mass concentration is fixed the number of micro particles and cavitation nuclei is inversely proportional to their sizes in other words the concentration of small particles is higher than that of large particles on the other hand single micro particle with larger size is more beneficial for lowering the cavitation threshold and inducing cavitation borkent et al 2007 holl 1970 mørch 2007 however under present conditions the effect of higher concentration is superior to the reduced ability of promoting cavitation for smaller micro particles as a result the cavitation area increases with decreasing size of micro particles 3 3 cavitation noise when the cavitation bubbles collapse they create loud sound called cavitation noise therefore the magnitude of cavitation noise can be used to estimate the intensity of cavitation bubble collapse the hydrophone was placed at the same height with the nozzle exit and it received all the cavitation sound waves that were interfered and reflected in the vessel the recorded cavitation noise characterized the overall intensity of cavitation bubble collapse in the whole flow field for each measurement the background noise was subtracted from the original records the background noise resulted from the operations of experimental equipment plunger pump electric blender et al for measuring the background noise the nozzle was lifted out of the vessel and removed laterally to a different position so that the water jet would eject into air exclude cavitation noise then all the experimental equipment was switched on and the background noise was recorded by the hydrophone the hydrophone signals and acoustic power of cavitation noise at different standoff distances are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively in comparison with submerged cavitation jet peng et al 2018a the acoustic power has remarkable improvements in submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the minimum increase 33 85 takes place at standoff distance of 10 mm while the maximum increase 113 24 occurs at standoff distance of 30 mm cavitation noise has greater improvement at large standoff distances it is validated that the addition of micro particles helps to produce more cavitation bubbles whose collapses enhance the overall cavitation noise the deviations of cavitation noise acoustical power are explicitly expressed as error bars standard deviations in figs 12 14 the deviations are relatively small meaning good repeatability of the cavitation noise measurement for both cases with and without micro particles standoff distance has similar influence on the acoustic power which first increases and gradually converges with standoff distance recall that at a standoff distance of 10 mm a large scale distribution of cavitation cloud can be observed on the target surface in fig 8 however the collapse of cavitation bubble estimated from cavitation noise fig 12 is not intense at all the reason for this contraction is the premature size of cavitation bubbles at standoff distance of 10 mm individual cavitation bubbles moving with the jet do not have enough time to grow to the maximum size considering that the collapse intensity of cavitation bubble is proportional to its size the resulting cavitation noise is weak this indicates that the damage potential of cavitation bubbles are very limited at small standoff distances on the other hand the collapse of cavitation bubble is more destructive inferred by the stronger cavitation noise at large standoff distances as they have more time to grow into large sizes the influence of micro particle concentration on cavitation noise is shown in fig 13 the cavitation acoustic power is found to linearly increase with micro particle concentration under the current experimental condition the maximum concentration is 3 05 wt due to the capacity of the peristaltic pump it is theoretically predicted that the acoustic power will finally converge with increasing micro particle concentration once there are sufficient cavitation nuclei distributed in the jet as is stated in section 3 2 under the same mass concentration smaller micro particles can produce more cavitation bubbles this is verified by the change of cavitation noise shown in fig 14 where the caustic power of cavitation noise increases with decreasing micro particle diameter 3 4 mass loss erosion pattern and surface morphology of sandstone samples the mass loss of sandstone samples eroded by submerged cavitation jet with and without micro particles under various standoff distances and erosion times is given in fig 15 the erosion test is performed only once based on our previous experimental results of eroding sandstone the maximum deviation of mass loss should be less than 15 as standoff distance increases fig 15 a the mass loss of sandstone rapidly drops from the first peak then rises to the second peak and finally falls again this trend holds for both cases with and without micro particles the double peaks in mass loss curve are typical for submerged cavitation jet momma and lichtarowicz 1995 soyama and lichtarowicz 1998 in present study the first peak of mass loss is attributed to the impact of high speed water jet in submerged cavitation jet without micro particles while in submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the abrasion and impact of solid particles also contribute to the erosion similar to abrasive jet the second mass loss peak mainly results from the cavitation bubble collapses as is shown in section 3 3 the intensity of cavitation bubble collapse increases with standoff distances however larger standoff distance means cavitation bubbles have to travel more distance to reach the target more bubbles are likely to collapse halfway and there will be less cavitation bubbles that collapse close to the target consequently the sample erosion at large standoff distances 40 and 50 mm declines the maximum cavitation erosion happens in an intermediate standoff distance of 30 mm where the bubble collapse intensity increases with standoff distance and the number of bubbles that can reach the target decreases with standoff distance are well balanced the addition of micro particles has lead to considerable improvements of mass loss the relative increase of sandstone mass loss ranges from 43 94 to 74 41 at standoff distances from 5 to 50 mm when standoff distance is 30 mm and above the relative increases of mass loss are much less than the increase percentages of cavitation noise fig 12 the reason is that the cavitation noise reflects the cavitation intensity of the whole flow filed in the vessel 3 d while the mass loss only reflects the cavitation intensity near the sandstone surface 2 d the mass loss with increasing erosion time is shown in fig 15 b the relative increase of mass loss ranges from 24 74 to 86 96 under erosion times between 120 and 960 s and the increase percentage drops when erosion time is more than 480 s the macroscopic erosion patterns of sandstone samples eroded under different standoff distances and erosion times are displayed in figs 16 and 17 there is a transient change of erosion pattern as standoff distance increases at small standoff distances of 5 and 10 mm an enormous central hole accounts for most of the mass loss it is either eroded by the water jet fig 16 a or the abrasive jet fig 16 b it is well known that micro particles can be accelerated by the water jet referred as macroscopic acceleration the high speed over 100 m s as measured in section 3 1 micro particles can cause drastic erosion by impacting and abrading the sandstone as a result the diameter and depth of the central hole are greatly improved fig 16 a standoff distance 5 and 10 mm however the macroscopic acceleration of micro particles and the subsequent abrasion effect take effect only at a short standoff distance it can be seen in fig 16 that the central holes are nearly of the same size when standoff distance rises to 20 mm beyond this standoff distance the macroscopic acceleration of micro particles is negligible as the surrounding water continually slows down the water jet and micro particles at small standoff distances of 5 and 10 mm the effect of cavitation on mass loss is insignificant for both cases with and without micro particles cavitation only slightly changes the surface morphology around the central hole fig 19 the minor cavitation erosion is consistent with the cavitation noise measurement at standoff distance of 10 mm at standoff distance of 20 mm fig 16 a and b cavitation erosion in the form of crater shape erosion zone with coarse surface starts to be observable when standoff distance rises to 30 mm the central hole is less important while the cavitation erosion zone around it becomes conspicuous at this standoff distance the cavitation erosion is most remarkable some of the cavitation pits are comparable to the central hole unlike the metal material peng et al 2018a there is no undamaged zone around the central hole on sandstone comparatively the cavitation erosion zone is wider and deeper for submerged cavitation jet with micro particles fig 16 b standoff distance 30 mm mainly due to the promoted cavitation another possible reason for the increased erosion is the microscopic acceleration of micro particles during the cavitation bubble nucleation arora et al 2004 borkent et al 2008 wu et al 2017 and collapse dunstan and li 2010 shengcai 2006 processes it is reported that during the nucleation an expanding cavitation bubble with maximum radius of 2 mm can eject a nearby suspending particle with radii 100 500 μm to a maximum velocity over 60 m s wu et al 2017 when a cavitation bubble collapses the micro jet can take in adjacent micro particles and accelerate them like a microscopic abrasive jet dunstan and li 2010 shengcai 2006 at proper direction the accelerated micro particles can impact on sandstone surface and enhance erosion in this sense submerged cavitation jet with micro particles benefits from the synergistic effect of micro particles and cavitation bubbles the added micro particles provide extra cavitation nuclei that will facilitate and stimulate cavitation the activated cavitation bubble will in turn accelerate the micro particles both stronger cavitation intensity and accelerated micro particles are in favor of improving the erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet as standoff distance further increases to 40 and 50 mm the central hole becomes less obvious due to the sharp attenuation of water jet the size of the cavitation erosion zone also decreases as fewer cavitation bubbles are able to reach the sandstone surface nevertheless the cavitation erosion is more visible in fig 16 b where the micro particles are added into the jet the erosion zones on sandstone samples at standoff distances of 50 mm are viewed by the laser scanning microscope fig 18 a and b the central hole deep blue color results from the water jet impingement while the surrounding regions light blue green and yellow color are the cavitation erosion zone from the measurements for sandstone eroded by submerged cavitation jet fig 18 a the volume of central hole is 2 09 mm3 12 58 of total erosion volume and the volume of cavitation erosion zone is 13 77 mm3 87 42 of total erosion volume for sandstone eroded by submerged cavitation jet with micro particles fig 18 b the two volumes are 21 85 mm3 91 87 and 1 93 mm3 8 13 in comparison the volume of cavitation erosion zone increases by 8 08 mm3 after the addition of micro particles while the volume of central hole barely changes note that the total erosion volumes measured from the laser microscope are less than the volumes calculated from the mass loss this is because the laser scanning microscope fails to cover the entire erosion zones considering that the unscanned area all belong to the cavitation erosion zone the actual volume and percentage of cavitation erosion zone should be even larger despite this deficiency it is still confident to conclude that the addition of micro particles helps to enhance the cavitation erosion of submerged cavitation jet on sandstone samples it is possible to improve the rock breaking efficiency of submerged cavitation jet in underground petroleum drilling by adding micro particles to the jet fig 17 shows the sandstone samples with increasing erosion times when the sandstone is eroded for 120 s only a very shallow crater is visible the surface around the crater becomes slightly rough due to cavitation no obvious difference can be seen between the sandstones eroded by jets with and without micro particles certain growth of the central hole and cavitation damage can be observed under the erosion time of 240 s as the erosion time increases to 480 s the cavitation pits around the central hole greatly develop forming a crater shape cavitation erosion zone the cavitation erosion zone further expands as erosion time increases to 720 s and 960 s the addition of micro particles broadly improves the size of the cavitation erosion zone which is also supported by the scanning results of sandstones fig 18 c and d compared with fig 18 c the cavitation erosion pits are larger and deeper in fig 18 d where micro particles are added the volumes of central hole and cavitation erosion zone are 13 40 mm3 22 31 and 46 65 mm3 77 69 for submerged cavitation jet while they are 11 58 mm3 15 66 and 62 36 mm3 84 34 for submerged cavitation jet with micro particles because of the heterogeneity of sandstone and the preference of cavitation bubbles to collect and collapse at protruding structures the degree of erosion is not uniform in the whole cavitation erosion zone some parts are more damaged than others and the difference becomes more recognizable with increasing erosion time e g fig 17 a b erosion time 960 s the microscopic surface morphology of sandstone samples is presented in figs 19 and 20 the measurements are conducted on cavitation erosion zones shown as red squares in figs 16 and 17 where the cavitation damage is mostly visible in general the addition of micro particles always increases the surface roughness of cavitation erosion zone which means the promotion of cavitation damage at standoff distance of 10 mm several ravine like craters appear in fig 19 a while the craters are broader in fig 19 b the relative small values of surface roughness suggest the low intensity of cavitation bubble collapse large cavitation pits can be found at cavitation erosion zones when standoff distance increases to 30 mm the inner faces of the cavitation pits are coarse and uneven when standoff distance rises to 50 mm the depths of cavitation pits decrease while the 2 d area holds fig 19 e or even increases a little fig 19 f as is shown in fig 16 the overall size of cavitation erosion zone decreases when standoff distance is 40 mm and above however it should also be noted that at standoff distance of 50 mm the remaining cavitation bubbles tend to locally concentrate due to the disappearance of the jet potential core and the closure of shear layer consequently the size of single cavitation pits can still be considerable fig 20 displays the microscopic evolution of cavitation erosion with increasing times at 240 s only isolated shallow cavitation pits can be seen in fig 20 a while the pits are more connected in fig 20 b some part of the surface is nearly intact again the addition of micro particles increases the surface roughness of sandstone the cavitation pits grow and the surface becomes more rugged as the erosion time increases for ductile metal material the cavitation damage follows the processes of plastic deformation and fatigue cavitation erosion develops because of the growth of single erosion pits and the connection of adjacent pits peng et al 2018a the development of erosion pits on brittle sandstone is different no plastic deformation happens in the erosion process and the erosion pits grow as the sediment minerals are continuously peeled off by cavitation as a result the inner surfaces of cavitation pits on sandstone are much coarser than those on metal materials the surface roughness of the cavitation orison zone can be used to represent the degree of cavitation damage each value of the surface roughness in fig 21 is averaged from the measurements of five different locations on the same sandstone sample and the corresponding standard deviations are given as error bars submerged cavitation jet with micro particles is able to increase the surface roughness by 37 47 128 28 at different standoff distances fig 21 a and 7 46 58 43 under different erosion times fig 21 b the improvement seems to recede with increasing standoff distance and erosion time major deviations of measured surface roughness can be found in the under large standoff distances and long erosion times 4 conclusion silica sand micro particles of diameters between 0 075 200 mesh and 0 425 mm 40 mesh are added into submerged cavitation jet in the form of suspension liquid the micro particles have sharp edges and rough surfaces which are proper cavitation nuclei for heterogeneous nucleation high speed visualization cavitation noise measurement and erosion test are conducted to validate the improved cavitation intensity and erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet with micro particles the high speed filming and pod analysis show two major changes after micro particles are added into the jet the disappearance of the periodic shedding of cavitation cloud and the tremendous expansion of cavitation region the size of cavitation cloud and the jet cavitation noise both increase with increasing micro particle concentration 0 3 05 wt and decreasing micro particle size 0 425 0 075 mm the acoustic power of cavitation noise rises by 33 85 113 24 at standoff distances of 10 50 mm with the addition of micro particles the erosion test of sandstone shows that submerged cavitation jet with micro particles can increase the mass loss by 43 94 74 41 at standoff distances of 5 50 mm 24 74 86 96 under erosion times of 120 960 s when standoff distance 20 mm the enhanced erosion mainly comes from the impact and abrasion of micro particles accelerated by the water jet when standoff distance 30 mm the enhanced erosion results from the synergistic effect of micro particles and cavitation bubbles the added micro particles provide extra cavitation nuclei that can facilitate and stimulate cavitation and the activated cavitation bubbles will in turn accelerate some of the micro particles both the promoted cavitation intensity and the impact of accelerated micro particles are in favor of improving the jet erosion ability the maximum cavitation erosion is achieved at a standoff distance of 30 mm where the bubble collapse intensity and the number of bubbles that can reach the sandstone are well balanced the addition of micro particles increases the surface roughness of the cavitation erosion zone by 37 47 128 28 at different standoff distances and 7 46 58 43 under different erosion times the above results lead to a unanimous conclusion under the same condition of pump pressure and nozzle geometry the addition of micro particles is able to enhance the cavitation intensity and the erosion ability of submerged cavitation jet it is more energy saving than increasing the pump pressure submerged cavitation jet with micro particles has potential applications in the drilling of petroleum wells credit authorship contribution statement chi peng conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing original

21802,this note aims to address the concerns and confusions raised by jakub et al 2020 on the article of zhang and meng published in ocean engineering in 2019 zhang and meng 2019 mainly proposed the probabilistic ship domain to capture the diverse navigational behaviors of captains based on the big ais data with less emphasies on how to assess ship collision risk using the probabilistic ship domain to achieve of the aim we first examine two concepts of ideal ship domain and practical ship domain we proceed to investigate the relationship between ship domain and ship collision risk using field data from restricted water in both singapore strait and fairway we finally discuss the onboard collision detection by using the probabilistic ship domain incorporating with the closest point of approach cpa this note not only clarifies some confusions or misunderstandings of the applicaion of probabilistic ship domain for ship collision risk assessment bust also exhibits the values and merits of the probabilistic ship domain keywords probabilistic ship domain collision risk assessment collision avoidance 1 introduction the ship domain has been used for ship collision risk assessment and safe navigation to capture the diverse navigational behaviors of navigators and navigational conditions which are reflected by ship trajectories zhang and meng 2019 proposed the probabilistic ship domain concept by focusing on the development of big ais data driven approach to determine the probabilistic ship domain they merely pointed out how to use the probabilistic ship domain to assess ship collision risk it should be pointed out that the probabilistic ship domain derived by the big ais data is a new concept and it is different from the traditional ship domains proposed in the ages when ship trajectory data are not available including fujii s model and goodwin s model fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 the study of ship domain can be dated back to over half century ago and since then several ship domains have been proposed with various shapes or different methods to determine them szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 wang et al 2009 the ship domain is also used as a key indicator to assess the navigational situation and the avoidance of ship collision playing a similar role as the closest point of approach cpa pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 for example pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 developed a fuzzy ship domain as a criterion of navigational safety assessment in an open sea area the fuzzy domain was calibrated based on the knowledge and experience of watch officers and captains considering different encounter situations weng and xue 2015 developed a ship collision risk frequency estimation method using the ship domain to evaluate the risk although the ship domain is extensively studied some challenges are reviewed by zhao et al 1993 and szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 there is no unified definition of ship domain the traditional studies define ship domain as the area the navigator wants to keep clear to other ships or objects from the psychological perspective of captains fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 zhao et al 1993 in practice more and more ship domains have been calibrated using field data that record what really happens rather than space a captain wants to clear these ship domains are named as the empirical ship domain by hansen et al 2013 or the effective ship domain by pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 in reality there are many factors affecting the shape and size of a ship domain such as the navigational conditions e g kang et al 2019a this problem is partially tackled with the aid of ship movement tracking technologies and data driven ship domain modelling approach nevertheless there are some confusions or misunderstandings of ship domain for collision risk assessment which may lead to misuse of the ship domain for ship collision avoidance jakub et al 2020 raies three concerns on the probabilistic ship domain including i the safe distance should be set according to the navigational conditions ii the cssd critical ship safety distance is usually referred to as cpa and it is not clear why the cssd should be considered critical and iii the probabilistic domain is much smaller than the minimum maneuvering space mms and would possibly result in the ship being at stake if the probabilistic ship domain is used for the onboard operations these concerns are important for applying ship domain to navigation operations e g davis et al 1980 zhao et al 1993 ship traffic flow modelling and capacity estimation e g kang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 and ship collision risk assessment jakub et al 2020 also gives many valuable suggestions for the application of the probabilistic ship domain in addtion to addressing the three concerns raised by jakub et al 2020 in this note we further seek answers for the following two questions i what is the relationship between the probabilistic domain and collision risk and ii does the probabilistic ship domain mean that it is safe if the vessel is outside the probabilistic ship domain the rest of this note is organized as follows the concepts of the ideal ship domain and practical ship domain are discussed in section 2 followed by the investigation of the relationship between practical ship domain and collision risk in section 3 a framework of applying the probabilistic ship domain to onboard collision risk assessment incorporated with cpa is proposed in section 4 we conclude the discussions 2 ideal ship domain and practical ship domain the ship domains can be divided into two types one type describes the area the navigator intends to maintain clear of other vessels called the ideal ship domain the other type depicts the area the navigator actually keeps clear of other vessels named as the practical ship domain it can be seen that the practical ship domain is defined as the area the navigators can achieve under certain navigational conditions the ideal ship domain is the space the navigator intends to keep under ideal navigational conditions which is larger than the practical ship domain in the restricted waters ideal ship domain cannot be kept because of the high ship traffic density or constrained by the navigable water area such as the narrow fairway for the ideal ship domain the size would be different from the perspectives of different stakeholders such as the navigators and watch officers in the traffic monitoring centers for the watch officers if the size of the ship domain is defined relatively large there will be many ship collision warnings to handle there are some concepts related to the ship domain that are essentially not ship domain for example the larger domain named arena by davis et al 1980 is defined as the distance where the navigator starts to take action to avoid the infringement of ship domain if the target vessel is outside the arena of the own ship the target vessel is considered as of no threat to the own ship according to the survey the decision distance is about 4 3nm or 5 6 nm davis et al 1980 in the restricted waters this would be different fig 1 a shows one study area in the fairway of singapore port the second busiest port in the world zhang et al 2019 the average width of this fairway shown in fig 1a is about 0 606 nm for two direction maritime traffic if we set the arena to 4 3nm suggested by davis et al 1980 fig 1b shows that the watch area is far larger than the fairway width as marked by the circle the watch area covers the anchorage area and even the land for the study area in the singapore strait on the bottom right side marked in green color whose average width is 1 231nm for the two direction ship traffic the watch area is also far larger than its width and covers the whole anchorage area in its north jakub et al 2020 considered that it is better to set the safe distance to 3 nautical miles nm rather than 2 nm which is mentioned by zhang and meng 2019 that l θ is a given non negative value and it is set to 2 nm which is the safe distance beyond which the target ship is not considered as a threat from the perspective of ship collision it is true that this distance should be determined considering the navigational conditions this distance is a parameter of the model which can be set according to different navigational conditions the probabilistic ship domain developed by zhang and meng 2019 is for the restricted water areas and the width of some part of the strait as illustrated in fig 1 is about 1 231 nm for the other water areas such as the open sea l θ could be set to larger values such as 3 nm as suggested moreover the main purpose of using distance l θ is to reduce the computational complexity of the approach to determine the probabilistic domain using the big ais data without setting the safe distance or watch area suppose that there are 500 vessels at any time instance the approach should do calculation between any pair of vessels and the resultant computing operations are about 500 500 250 000 if we scan the ship trajectory data every 5 seconds for the one year data the number of the operations is 250 000 12 24 365 2 628 10 once we set the watch area the computational budget drops significantly which is one of the main reasons the proposed method can handle the big trajectory data the value of the watch area arena must guarantee that all target ships located in the domain area must be included which are used to identify the out boundary of the probabilistic ship domain like the aforementioned analysis the watch area or arena is larger than the ship domain thus this threshold can guarantee that all the targets in the ship domain are included the watch area value is a parameter of the model and should be determined depending on the navigational situations 3 probabilistic ship domain and ship collision risk the probabilistic ship domain does not indicate the boundary at which the own ship must take action once the approaching target ship infringes its domain on the contrary it reflects the truth that under given navigational conditions what is the navigational behavior of most navigators for example the forbidden area vessel c shown in fig 2 a refers to an area that no vessel has ever enter under given navigational conditions based on the big historical data statistically this area represents an extremely high risky area for this vessel and wants to keep clear if some target vessel enters this area it can be considered as an abnormal event for the own vessel as the probability of this event is extremely low according to the big historical ais data if a target ship is located outside of the probabilistic ship domain it does not mean that there is no collision risk between the own ship and the target ship it means that at this time the ship domain of the own ship is not infringed let us further illustrate this point by a case shown in fig 2a at time t 1 there are two surrounding target ships ships a and b at time t 1 ship a is far from the ship domain area of the own ship while ship b is located within the ship domain for the onboard collision risk assessment it cannot be asserted that ship b has higher collision risk than ship a because the assessment of the risk is based on a time series event during one encounter and the navigator should make a judgment according to the process of the whole encounter till the target vessel is finally past and clear as mentioned by rule 8 in colreg zaccone et al 2019 if at time t 1 the navigator has no time to take action such as changing the course the collision would happen at time t 3 that means when the navigator finds that the ship domain will be infringed if the ship keeps the speed and course action much be taken before the ship domain is infringed if there is enough time to take action to avoid the collision risk is lower in other words the ship domain is used to judge the risk level when the risky encounter happens rather than when this will happen to uses the probabilistic ship domain for collision risk assessment the information on how soon the ship domain invasion will happen must be needed the probabilistic ship domain contains the navigation behavior information which reflects the navigator s judgment during encounters considering collision risk to maintain the navigation safe the ship must keep a safe distance between other vessels large ship trajectory data record how the navigators select a safe distance to pass by the other vessels the forbidden area in the probabilistic domain describes an area seldom invaded by target ships in the risk area of the probabilistic domain the number of the appearance of target vessels increases and the safe distance increases at the outer bounder distance most of the target vessel passes at this position which is normal behavior the probability of the appearance of the target ship reflects the risk based on the real operation data to better understand the relationship between the ship collision risk and probabilistic ship domain we demonstrate the navigation behavior by two cases in singapore strait on march 1 2017 in the singapore strait shown in fig 1b from 19 11 p m to 19 32 p m two vessels sail parallelly from westbound of singapore strait which has an average width of about 1 231 nm all these two vessels are chemical tankers with the mmsi of 372653000 and 249537000 respectively their lengths are 112m and 129m during their encounter ship 372653000 tried to overtake vessel 249537000 from fig 3 we can see that with the decrease in the instance between these two vessels the tcpa time at the closest point of approach dropped down fast below 2 min and dcpa distance at the closest point of approach also decrease to around one cable the smaller dcpa and tcpa indicate higher collision risk and thus the two vessels take actions to change the speed and course to avoid the potential collision the corresponding tcpa and dcpa increase sharply the vessel give way vessel is finally pass and clear another case is a crossing scenario that happened on the same day as case one in the same area as shown in fig 4 one chemical tanker sails from the singapore port and another bulk carrier sails from the westbound of the singapore strait the mmsis of the chemical vessel and bulk carrier are 574381000 and 354119000 respectively their lengths are 111m and 186 m these two vessels encountered at the crossing area and their dcpa and tcpa decrease sharply if the give way vessel from the north does not change the course properly the vessel will infringe the ship domain according to the colreg rules the give way vessel takes action to change the course to avoid the collision then the distance starts to increase and the two vessels are pass and clear finally it can be seen that the collision risk results in the action taken to avoid the risk in conclusion the fear of the threat of the ship domain infringement by approaching ships is the psychological stimulation that results in taking collision avoidance behaviors it is noted that not all historical records of the encounters are suitable for determining the probabilistic ship domain during the long time operations sometimes the domain of vessels may be infringed however the number of these cases would be very small as the number of the high risk encounters near miss cases or real accidents is usually low among the large ship trajectory data the number of these cases would be small which could be considered as abnormal cases these abnormal cases are not proper for the probabilistic domain determination to check the number of risky encounters we extract the encounters with d c p a 400 m and t c p a 7 min in the study area the same as the two cases during the whole day time on march 1 2017 there are only 22 cases detected the number is quite small and it can be eliminated as noise data by the algorithm presented by zhang and meng 2019 in the approach to determine the probabilistic ship domain zhang and meng 2019 mentioned the critical ship safety distance cssd which is defined as the smallest distance during the encounter of two ships jakub et al 2020 commented that in maritime nomenclature such distance is usually referred to as cpa distance to the closest point of approach however it is not clear from the commented paper why such distance shall be considered critical first the cssd is not defined as a criterion for the navigational situation assessment which is defined as the smallest distance which is recorded by the trajectory data zhang and meng 2019 for the approach to determine the probabilistic ship domain the cssd should not be the distance that is as critical as the ship domain is infringed the probabilistic domain extracts the distribution information of the distance at which two encountering vessels pass each other the abnormal one located within the forbidden area caused by the serious infringement of the ship domain or by the possible error in trajectory data will be removed as noise data during the ship domain determination process zhang et al 2018 zhang and meng 2019 second similar to the watch area discussed in the last section the main purpose of using the cssd is also to decrease the complexity of the calculation by using the cssd we scan the nearest vessels in each direction of the discretized relative bearing like a radar rather than all vessels in that direction which can significantly decrease the calculation complexity it is noted that to keep the accuracy the number of discretized relative bearings should not be too small as a side note the dcpa and tcpa depends on the navigational conditions and the navigational behaviors of captains e g kang et al 2019b jakub et al 2020 also commented that it is not proper to assert that it should be noted that the captain of the own ship only cares about the status of the nearest ship in one direction which is the most serious threat to its safety in fact this sentence does not mean that the captain only cares about the nearest ship around this own ship however it emphasizes the nearest ship in one direction which is a small discretized relative bearing just like radar in each direction the nearest ship is scanned first moreover the approach scans the vessels continually at each time interval to track the movement of the surrounding vessels in all directions base on the historical trajectory data as mentioned in the discussion paper it is true that both of the distance and time must be considered for the onboard collision risk assessment which will be discussed in the following section 4 onboard collision risk assessment using probabilistic domain and cpa jakub et al 2020 highlighted that the probabilistic domain cannot consider the vessel speed in the onboard collision risk assessment and the domain is much smaller than the minimum maneuvering space mms in fact similar to arena defined by davis et al 1980 and close quarters situation analyzed by wang et al 2017 the minimum maneuvering space mms would be much larger than the ship domain in fact ship domain and mms are two different concepts mms defines a boundary at which actions mush be taken to avoid the potential collision whereas ship domain is the area the infringement of which would result in navigators fear and taking actions to avoid the potential collision that is to say the threat of the infringement of the ship domain triggers the action of collision avoidance which would be taken before the ship domain is infringed as discussed in section 3 how soon will the ship domain infringement must be considered for the onboard collision risk assessment there are different application scenarios of the collision risk assessment which have different model frameworks and model parameters the collision risk could be real time for the onboard usage or offline based on the historical data for the maritime infrastructure planning purpose for the onboard usage a vessel movement prediction module is usually needed moreover the parameters for different stakeholders should be different for the watch officers they only give warnings to ships with relatively high risk while the navigators or the ship masters would prefer to detect all possible risks zhang et al 2019 only shows how to use the probabilistic ship domain to assess ship collision risk their method can be directly used for the off line ship risk assessment as the trajectory of the vessels during the whole encounter is known for example we can use the probabilistic ship domain to assess the collision risk in certain water areas based on the historical vessel trajectory data however if it is applied to the onboard navigation solution we need the other information which is how soon will the ship domain infringement happen the probabilistic ship domain should cooperate with a vessel movement forecasting module to provide an onboard navigation solution which is presented below the onboard ship collision warning approach should evaluate the real time collision risk continuously suppose the current status of the own vessel is s l n g l a t c o g v where l n g l a t c o g v are longitude latitude course of ground and speed of the own vessel respectively the navigational status of the surrounding target vessels is expressed by 1 s i s i l n g i l a t i c o g i v i i 1 n where n is the number of the surrounding target vessels the d c p a i and t c p a i can be calculated by 2 d c p a i d c p a s s i 3 t c p a i t c p a s s i where s and s i are the status vector of the own ship and the target ship i dcpa and tcpa are the cpa calculation functions the collision risk between the own ship and target ship i can be estimated using the probabilistic ship domain proposed by zhang and meng 2019 suppose the relative bearing between the own ship and target ship i is θ i the collision risk between them can be measured by the risk function r θ i d c p a i where the risk function r θ r is defined by 4 r θ r 1 1 r r min θ 1 0 r r min f δ θ ω d ω r min θ r l θ where r is the distance to the own ship r min θ is on the boundary of the forbidden area in sector θ and f θ x is the probability density function of δ θ at the distance x we cannot just quantify the collision risk between all its target vessels as r θ i d c p a i without considering the responding happening time t c p a i with the given risk threshold r and action time t the navigators can make decisions to avoid all possible collisions this approach solves the problem of the difficulty in judging the risk level based on dcpa hence the ship collision risk assessment results are more robust because it depends on the big ship trajectory data rather than the knowledge of experts one big difference between the traditional ship domain and probabilistic ship domain is that the boundary of the probabilistic ship domain can be adjusted by parameter α which is related to risk level zhang and meng 2019 thus the users can adjust the parameter α to get a different ship domain boundary under a given safety level for example if the watch officer has to decrease the warning number they just decrease the α if α 0 the ship domain boundary is the forbidden area boundary 5 conclusions the probabilistic ship domain derived from ais data is distinct from the traditional ideal ship domains the clarifications of the probabilistic ship domain are presented in table 1 in this note we pointed out the probabilistic ship domain is a type of practical domain which considers navigational conditions and navigators behavior reflected by the big historical ship trajectory data moreover without knowing how soon the ship domain invasion will happen the probabilistic ship domain cannot be directly used for ship collision risk assessment which is applicable for most practical ship domains we also proposed a ship collision warning approach cooperated with cpa to demonstrate how to use the probabilistic ship domain for onboard collision warning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21802,this note aims to address the concerns and confusions raised by jakub et al 2020 on the article of zhang and meng published in ocean engineering in 2019 zhang and meng 2019 mainly proposed the probabilistic ship domain to capture the diverse navigational behaviors of captains based on the big ais data with less emphasies on how to assess ship collision risk using the probabilistic ship domain to achieve of the aim we first examine two concepts of ideal ship domain and practical ship domain we proceed to investigate the relationship between ship domain and ship collision risk using field data from restricted water in both singapore strait and fairway we finally discuss the onboard collision detection by using the probabilistic ship domain incorporating with the closest point of approach cpa this note not only clarifies some confusions or misunderstandings of the applicaion of probabilistic ship domain for ship collision risk assessment bust also exhibits the values and merits of the probabilistic ship domain keywords probabilistic ship domain collision risk assessment collision avoidance 1 introduction the ship domain has been used for ship collision risk assessment and safe navigation to capture the diverse navigational behaviors of navigators and navigational conditions which are reflected by ship trajectories zhang and meng 2019 proposed the probabilistic ship domain concept by focusing on the development of big ais data driven approach to determine the probabilistic ship domain they merely pointed out how to use the probabilistic ship domain to assess ship collision risk it should be pointed out that the probabilistic ship domain derived by the big ais data is a new concept and it is different from the traditional ship domains proposed in the ages when ship trajectory data are not available including fujii s model and goodwin s model fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 the study of ship domain can be dated back to over half century ago and since then several ship domains have been proposed with various shapes or different methods to determine them szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 wang et al 2009 the ship domain is also used as a key indicator to assess the navigational situation and the avoidance of ship collision playing a similar role as the closest point of approach cpa pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 for example pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 developed a fuzzy ship domain as a criterion of navigational safety assessment in an open sea area the fuzzy domain was calibrated based on the knowledge and experience of watch officers and captains considering different encounter situations weng and xue 2015 developed a ship collision risk frequency estimation method using the ship domain to evaluate the risk although the ship domain is extensively studied some challenges are reviewed by zhao et al 1993 and szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 there is no unified definition of ship domain the traditional studies define ship domain as the area the navigator wants to keep clear to other ships or objects from the psychological perspective of captains fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 zhao et al 1993 in practice more and more ship domains have been calibrated using field data that record what really happens rather than space a captain wants to clear these ship domains are named as the empirical ship domain by hansen et al 2013 or the effective ship domain by pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 in reality there are many factors affecting the shape and size of a ship domain such as the navigational conditions e g kang et al 2019a this problem is partially tackled with the aid of ship movement tracking technologies and data driven ship domain modelling approach nevertheless there are some confusions or misunderstandings of ship

safe distance should be set according to the navigational conditions ii the cssd critical ship safety distance is usually referred to as cpa and it is not clear why the cssd should be considered critical and iii the probabilistic domain is much smaller than the minimum maneuvering space mms and would possibly result in the ship being at stake if the probabilistic ship domain is used for the onboard operations these concerns are important for applying ship domain to navigation operations e g davis et al 1980 zhao et al 1993 ship traffic flow modelling and capacity estimation e g kang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 and ship collision risk assessment jakub et al 2020 also gives many valuable suggestions for the application of the probabilistic ship domain in addtion to addressing the three concerns raised by jakub et al 2020 in this note we further seek answers for the following two questions i what is the relationship between the probabilistic domain and collision risk and ii does the probabilistic ship domain mean that it is safe if the vessel is outside the probabilistic ship domain the rest of this note is organized as follows the concepts of the ideal ship domain and practical ship domain are discussed in section 2 followed by the investigation of the relationship between practical ship domain and collision risk in section 3 a framework of applying the probabilistic ship domain to onboard collision risk assessment incorporated with cpa is proposed in section 4 we conclude the discussions 2 ideal ship domain and practical ship domain the ship domains can be divided into two types one type describes the area the navigator intends to maintain clear of other vessels called the ideal ship domain the other type depicts the area the navigator actually keeps clear of other vessels named as the practical ship domain it can be seen that the practical ship domain is defined as the area the navigators can achieve under certain navigational conditions the ideal ship domain is the space the navigator intends to keep under ideal navigational conditions which is larger than the practical ship domain in the restricted waters ideal ship domain cannot be kept because of the high ship traffic density or constrained by the navigable water area such as the narrow fairway for the ideal ship domain the size would be different from the perspectives of different stakeholders such as the navigators and watch officers in the traffic monitoring centers for the watch officers if the size of the ship domain is defined relatively large there will be many ship collision warnings to handle there are some concepts related to the ship domain that are essentially not ship domain for example the larger domain named arena by davis et al 1980 is defined as the distance where the navigator starts to take action to avoid the infringement of ship domain if the target vessel is outside the arena of the own ship the target vessel is considered as of no threat to the own ship according to the survey the decision distance is about 4 3nm or 5 6 nm davis et al 1980 in the restricted waters this would be different fig 1 a shows one study area in the fairway of singapore port the second busiest port in the world zhang et al 2019 the average width of this fairway shown in fig 1a is about 0 606 nm for two direction maritime traffic if we set the arena to 4 3nm suggested by davis et al 1980 fig 1b shows that the watch area is far larger than the fairway width as marked by the circle the watch area covers the anchorage area and even the land for the study area in the singapore strait on the bottom right side marked in green color whose average width is 1 231nm for the two direction ship traffic the watch area is also far larger than its width and covers the whole anchorage area in its north jakub et al 2020 considered that it is better to set the safe distance to 3 nautical miles nm rather than 2 nm which is mentioned by zhang and meng 2019 that l θ is a given non negative value and it is set to 2 nm which is the safe distance beyond which the target ship is not considered as a threat from the perspective of ship collision it is true that this distance should be determined considering the navigational conditions this distance is a parameter of the model which can be set according to different navigational conditions the probabilistic ship domain developed by zhang and meng 2019 is for the restricted water areas and the width of some part of the strait as illustrated in fig 1 is about 1 231 nm for the other water areas such as the open sea l θ could be set to larger values such as 3 nm as suggested moreover the main purpose of using distance l θ is to reduce the computational complexity of the approach to determine the probabilistic domain using the big ais data without setting the safe distance or watch area suppose that there are 500 vessels at any time instance the approach should do calculation between any pair of vessels and the resultant computing operations are about 500 500 250 000 if we scan the ship trajectory data every 5 seconds for the one year data the number of the operations is 250 000 12 24 365 2 628 10 once we set the watch area the computational budget drops significantly which is one of the main reasons the proposed method can handle the big trajectory data the value of the watch area arena must guarantee that all target ships located in the domain area must be included which are used to identify the out boundary of the probabilistic ship domain like the aforementioned analysis the watch area or arena is larger than the ship domain thus this threshold can guarantee that all the targets in the ship domain are included the watch area value is a parameter of the model and should be determined depending on the navigational situations 3 probabilistic ship domain and ship collision risk the probabilistic ship domain does not indicate the boundary at which the own ship must take action once the approaching target ship infringes its domain on the contrary it reflects the truth that under given navigational conditions what is the navigational behavior of most navigators for example the forbidden area vessel c shown in fig 2 a refers to an area that no vessel has ever enter under given navigational conditions based on the big historical data statistically this area represents an extremely high risky area for this vessel and wants to keep clear if some target vessel enters this area it can be considered as an abnormal event for the own vessel as the probability of this event is extremely low according to the big historical ais data if a target ship is located outside of the probabilistic ship domain it does not mean that there is no collision risk between the own ship and the target ship it means that at this time the ship domain of the own ship is not infringed let us further illustrate this point by a case shown in fig 2a at time t 1 there are two surrounding target ships ships a and b at time t 1 ship a is far from the ship domain area of the own ship while ship b is located within the ship domain for the onboard collision risk assessment it cannot be asserted that ship b has higher collision risk than ship a because the assessment of the risk is based on a time series event during one encounter and the navigator should make a judgment according to the process of the whole encounter till the target vessel is finally past and clear as mentioned by rule 8 in colreg zaccone et al 2019 if at time t 1 the navigator has no time to take action such as changing the course the collision would happen at time t 3 that means when the navigator finds that the ship domain will be infringed if the ship keeps the speed and course action much be taken before the ship domain is infringed if there is enough time to take action to avoid the collision risk is lower in other words the ship domain is used to judge the risk level when the risky encounter happens rather than when this will happen to uses the probabilistic ship domain for collision risk assessment the information on how soon the ship domain invasion will happen must be needed the probabilistic ship domain contains the navigation behavior information which reflects the navigator s judgment during encounters considering collision risk to maintain the navigation safe the ship must keep a safe distance between other vessels large ship trajectory data record how the navigators select a safe distance to pass by the other vessels the forbidden area in the probabilistic domain describes an area seldom invaded by target ships in the risk area of the probabilistic domain the number of the appearance of target vessels increases and the safe distance increases at the outer bounder distance most of the target vessel passes at this position which is normal behavior the probability of the appearance of the target ship reflects the risk based on the real operation data to better understand the relationship between the ship collision risk and probabilistic ship domain we demonstrate the navigation behavior by two cases in singapore strait on march 1 2017 in the singapore strait shown in fig 1b from 19 11 p m to 19 32 p m two vessels sail parallelly from westbound of singapore strait which has an average width of about 1 231 nm all these two vessels are chemical tankers with the mmsi of 372653000 and 249537000 respectively their lengths are 112m and 129m during their encounter ship 372653000 tried to overtake vessel 249537000 from fig 3 we can see that with the decrease in the instance between these two vessels the tcpa time at the closest point of approach dropped down fast below 2 min and dcpa distance at the closest point of approach also decrease to around one cable the smaller dcpa and tcpa indicate higher collision risk and thus the two vessels take actions to change the speed and course to avoid the potential collision the corresponding tcpa and dcpa increase sharply the vessel give way vessel is finally pass and clear another case is a crossing scenario that happened on the same day as case one in the same area as shown in fig 4 one chemical tanker sails from the singapore port and another bulk carrier sails from the westbound of the singapore strait the mmsis of the chemical vessel and bulk carrier are 574381000 and 354119000 respectively their lengths are 111m and 186 m these two vessels encountered at the crossing area and their dcpa and tcpa decrease sharply if the give way vessel from the north does not change the course properly the vessel will infringe the ship domain according to the colreg rules the give way vessel takes action to change the course to avoid the collision then the distance starts to increase and the two vessels are pass and clear finally it can be seen that the collision risk results in the action taken to avoid the risk in conclusion the fear of the threat of the ship domain infringement by approaching ships is the psychological stimulation that results in taking collision avoidance behaviors it is noted that not all historical records of the encounters are suitable for determining the probabilistic ship domain during the long time operations sometimes the domain of vessels may be infringed however the number of these cases would be very small as the number of the high risk encounters near miss cases or real accidents is usually low among the large ship trajectory data the number of these cases would be small which could be considered as abnormal cases these abnormal cases are not proper for the probabilistic domain determination to check the number of risky encounters we extract the encounters with d c p a 400 m and t c p a 7 min in the study area the same as the two cases during the whole day time on march 1 2017 there are only 22 cases detected the number is quite small and it can be eliminated as noise data by the algorithm presented by zhang and meng 2019 in the approach to determine the probabilistic ship domain zhang and meng 2019 mentioned the critical ship safety distance cssd which is defined as the smallest distance during the encounter of two ships jakub et al 2020 commented that in maritime nomenclature such distance is usually referred to as cpa distance to the closest point of approach however it is not clear from the commented paper why such distance shall be considered critical first the cssd is not defined as a criterion for the navigational situation assessment which is defined as the smallest distance which is recorded by the trajectory data zhang and meng 2019 for the approach to determine the probabilistic ship domain the cssd should not be the distance that is as critical as the ship domain is infringed the probabilistic domain extracts the distribution information of the distance at which two encountering vessels pass each other the abnormal one located within the forbidden area caused by the serious infringement of the ship domain or by the possible error in trajectory data will be removed as noise data during the ship domain determination process zhang et al 2018 zhang and meng 2019 second similar to the watch area discussed in the last section the main purpose of using the cssd is also to decrease the complexity of the calculation by using the cssd we scan the nearest vessels in each direction of the discretized relative bearing like a radar rather than all vessels in that direction which can significantly decrease the calculation complexity it is noted that to keep the accuracy the number of discretized relative bearings should not be too small as a side note the dcpa and tcpa depends on the navigational conditions and the navigational behaviors of captains e g kang et al 2019b jakub et al 2020 also commented that it is not proper to assert that it should be noted that the captain of the own ship only cares about the status of the nearest ship in one direction which is the most serious threat to its safety in fact this sentence does not mean that the captain only cares about the nearest ship around this own ship however it emphasizes the nearest ship in one direction which is a small discretized relative bearing just like radar in each direction the nearest ship is scanned first moreover the approach scans the vessels continually at each time interval to track the movement of the surrounding vessels in all directions base on the historical trajectory data as mentioned in the discussion paper it is true that both of the distance and time must be considered for the onboard collision risk assessment which will be discussed in the following section 4 onboard collision risk assessment using probabilistic domain and cpa jakub et al 2020 highlighted that the probabilistic domain cannot consider the vessel speed in the onboard collision risk assessment and the domain is much smaller than the minimum maneuvering space mms in fact similar to arena defined by davis et al 1980 and close quarters situation analyzed by wang et al 2017 the minimum maneuvering space mms would be much larger than the ship domain in fact ship domain and mms are two different concepts mms defines a boundary at which actions mush be taken to avoid the potential collision whereas ship domain is the area the infringement of which would result in navigators fear and taking actions to avoid the potential collision that is to say the threat of the infringement of the ship domain triggers the action of collision avoidance which would be taken before the ship domain is infringed as discussed in section 3 how soon will the ship domain infringement must be considered for the onboard collision risk assessment there are different application scenarios of the collision risk assessment which have different model frameworks and model parameters the collision risk could be real time for the onboard usage or offline based on the historical data for the maritime infrastructure planning purpose for the onboard usage a vessel movement prediction module is usually needed moreover the parameters for different stakeholders should be different for the watch officers they only give warnings to ships with relatively high risk while the navigators or the ship masters would prefer to detect all possible risks zhang et al 2019 only shows how to use the probabilistic ship domain to assess ship collision risk their method can be directly used for the off line ship risk assessment as the trajectory of the vessels during the whole encounter is known for example we can use the probabilistic ship domain to assess the collision risk in certain water areas based on the historical vessel trajectory data however if it is applied to the onboard navigation solution we need the other information which is how soon will the ship domain infringement happen the probabilistic ship domain should cooperate with a vessel movement forecasting module to provide an onboard navigation solution which is presented below the onboard ship collision warning approach should evaluate the real time collision risk continuously suppose the current status of the own vessel is s l n g l a t c o g v where l n g l a t c o g v are longitude latitude course of ground and speed of the own vessel respectively the navigational status of the surrounding target vessels is expressed by 1 s i s i l n g i l a t i c o g i v i i 1 n where n is the number of the surrounding target vessels the d c p a i and t c p a i can be calculated by 2 d c p a i d c p a s s i 3 t c p a i t c p a s s i where s and s i are the status vector of the own ship and the target ship i dcpa and tcpa are the cpa calculation functions the collision risk between the own ship and target ship i can be estimated using the probabilistic ship domain proposed by zhang and meng 2019 suppose the relative bearing between the own ship and target ship i is θ i the collision risk between them can be measured by the risk function r θ i d c p a i where the risk function r θ r is defined by 4 r θ r 1 1 r r min θ 1 0 r r min f δ θ ω d ω r min θ r l θ where r is the distance to the own ship r min θ is on the boundary of the forbidden area in sector θ and f θ x is the probability density function of δ θ at the distance x we cannot just quantify the collision risk between all its target vessels as r θ i d c p a i without considering the responding happening time t c p a i with the given risk threshold r and action time t the navigators can make decisions to avoid all possible collisions this approach solves the problem of the difficulty in judging the risk level based on dcpa hence the ship collision risk assessment results are more robust because it depends on the big ship trajectory data rather than the knowledge of experts one big difference between the traditional ship domain and probabilistic ship domain is that the boundary of the probabilistic ship domain can be adjusted by parameter α which is related to risk level zhang and meng 2019 thus the users can adjust the parameter α to get a different ship domain boundary under a given safety level for example if the watch officer has to decrease the warning number they just decrease the α if α 0 the ship domain boundary is the forbidden area boundary 5 conclusions the probabilistic ship domain derived from ais data is distinct from the traditional ideal ship domains the clarifications of the probabilistic ship domain are presented in table 1 in this note we pointed out the probabilistic ship domain is a type of practical domain which considers navigational conditions and navigators behavior reflected by the big historical ship trajectory data moreover without knowing how soon the ship domain invasion will happen the probabilistic ship domain cannot be directly used for ship collision risk assessment which is applicable for most practical ship domains we also proposed a ship collision warning approach cooperated with cpa to demonstrate how to use the probabilistic ship domain for onboard collision warning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21803,model testing of offshore floating wind turbines fowts needs to account for the hydrodynamics of the floater at the same time as the aerodynamics of the rotor and their interactions testers have followed two distinct paths to solve the challenge of modelling these two dissimilar physical phenomena one path has consisted of building physical models at basin scale that resembled the actual fowt a full approach with this approach every component of the model test needs to comply with froude scaling laws wind generators have been improved dedicated scaled turbines designed and a method known as performance scaling developed the second path consisted of mimicking the most relevant components of the wind turbine loads and applying them to the floater at the wind turbine tower top a simplified approach with this approach a specific experimental set up is designed to transfer the wind turbine loads which in the case of hybrid testing are calculated by an aerodynamic simulation code this article reviews the state of the art of testing fowts in basins with a focus on the most complete examples of each testing approach limitations similarities differences and complementarities between the approaches are described and discussed to continue improving testing techniques there is an acute need for more comparisons between different testing approaches and validation against full scale measurement campaigns keywords floating offshore wind turbine wind tunnel testing hardware in the loop testing hybrid testing model validation hydrodynamics 1 introduction the technical feasibility of multi megawatt offshore floating wind turbines fowts have already been demonstrated multiple times for diverse kinds of floaters hywind demo for a spar with a 2 mw turbine skaare et al 2007 myhr et al 2011 and hywind scotland with the first pilot farm made of five spars with a 6 mw turbine on top for each spar bbc 1652 windfloat for a three column semisubmersible with a 2 mw turbine roddier et al 2009 fukushima forward phase 1 for a compact four column semisubmersible with a 2 mw wind turbine consortium fukushima forward phase 2 for a v shape semisubmersible with a 7 mw turbine consortium a moon pool barge with a 2 mw wind turbine by ideol offshore 1493 the most immediate challenge for this pioneering industry is to show that floating wind is competitive against bottom fixed offshore wind finding the most efficient ways to reduce the levelized cost of energy lcoe of these technologies is a vital goal of pilot projects of pre commercial floating wind farms for instance equinor publicises the fact that they have the lcoe target of 40 60 euro mwh by 2030 for hywind equinor next to hywind scotland kincardine wind and windfloat atlantic edp four other pilot farms are planned for the coming years in france groix belle ile to be located in the atlantic ocean and golf du lion eolmed and provence grand large to be placed in the mediterranean sea next to the progress that floating wind has allowed with regards to installation and operation and maintenance designers of fowts are being pushed to explore more extreme solutions to further reduce the cost of floating foundations nowadays numerical tools and model tests are two key components of the design process of fowts as such these components need to support the design challenges of fowts code comparisons such as those carried out under iea wind task 23 and 30 robertson et al 2017 have contributed to the improvement of the efficiency and the accuracy of simulation tools for fowts research and development in physical modelling of fowts has led to major improvements in the way turbines are emulated during model tests in basins for example recent advances relate to the use of scale turbines and alternative systems where wind turbine loads calculated by software are directly transferred to the model of the fowt in contrast with what has almost become standard for numerical tools no major comparison of model testing techniques for fowts have been initiated with the exception of the ongoing wind round robin of marinet2 marinet2 as a result it can be difficult to know which techniques are available this paper builds on reviews of model testing options published in 2014 muler et al 2014 and 2015 sauder et al 2016 with a sharper focus on how the aerodynamic loads on the turbine are represented 2 motivations for model tests of fowts in a wave basin just a few full scale prototypes of fowts have been operated over multiple years in real conditions and to date limited data and feedback has been published on these experiences model tests in a basin are advantageous when compared to prototypes at sea because they provide data on the behaviour of the whole system but require less time resources and are less risky rare but critical conditions can be tested in a basin in contrast to open ocean conditions where the excitations wind waves and current are rarely present independently these components can be investigated in a basin on their own to better grasp the relative importance of their impact on fowts the way that these components interact can also be studied in a basin moreover model tests can be used to validate numerical tools for the simulation of fowts most of which have been developed less than a decade ago last but not least model testing is often the first opportunity to carry out a simplified but global assessment of the whole system i e modelling the moored floater and the turbine together 3 model testing strategies when testing novel structures such as fowts two distinct strategies can be used the first strategy the full approach involves designing experiments that are as close as possible to the real situation with all its complexity most of the time this results in testing a large number of variables the second strategy the simplified approach involves simplifying the experiment to the minimum number of variables which allow insight into the system s behaviour for fowts the full approach has led the testers to build model scale wind turbines and place them in scaled wind fields in basins although this approach is ambitious given all the scaling constraints involved de ridder et al 2014 it has the merit of minimizing pre conceived ideas that may interfere with the design of the experiment such model tests enable the tester to be first and foremost an observer during the model tests the greatest advantage of this approach is that it allows space for the unexpected for instance the revelation of interactions which may not have been suspected to be important one can think that this approach is preferable when very little is known about the behaviour of a structure a great cost associated with this approach is linked to the complex model test set up and non trivial interpretation of results due to the large number of variables at play the full approach has been implemented for all types of fowts in diverse basins table 1 provides a non exhaustive list of these tests for fowts the simplified approach has led the testers to replace the wind turbine with one or more actuators that directly apply loads representative of the turbine loads on the floater testing techniques used with this approach have also been significantly improved since the first applications initially a single constant tension winch cable pulling on the top of the tower would only represent the steady part of the thrust of the wind turbine at this time the objective of such tests was solely to account for the mean horizontal offset and the mean inclination of the floater caused by the thrust of the wind turbine then the focus was on the hydrodynamics and all other effects of the wind turbine were ignored nowadays the turbine loads are calculated as needed during the tests by a piece of software which is fed with the measured motions of the floater sauder et al 2016 the software in the loop sil element of the testing process the selection of the load components that are most relevant for the model tests is often supported by a prior numerical study of the tested fowt bachynski et al 2016 such numerical studies also inform the experimental design the selected load components are applied through a series of actuators to a superstructure mounted on the floater and these forces are controlled through a feed back loop the primary focus is to apply the dynamic thrust at its point of action correctly the simplified approach can be broadened to include other components but this has been achieved at the cost of increasing complexity of the experimental set up i e more actuators these techniques are referred to as hybrid testing because they involve a computer program that provides the targeted load values in real time although defining two distinct testing strategies helps to discuss model testing of fowts in a holistic way this categorization is artificial and may not embrace all testing techniques for instance tests using a drag disk to represent the wind loads on the turbine roddier et al 2009 meseguer and guanche 2019 can be seen as following the simplified approach because they target the sole representation of the thrust however they still require the generation of a wind field as in the full approach other categorizations such as pure physical testing versus testing with sil could have been considered in this review but they would still face the same challenge of encompassing the complete diversity of techniques nevertheless with the aim to discuss the state of the art of fowt testing two techniques currently stand out in terms of their completeness and are therefore often opposed to each other these are the use of a scaled turbine in a real wind field and the use of actuators commanded by sil noteably these two techniques have fundamental differences that can be conveniently explained using the categorization of the full approach and the simplified approach in this light the scaled rotor can be considered a representative example of the full approach while replacing the wind turbine by actuators can be considered a representative example of the simplified approach 4 wind generation in a basin the generation of physical wind in a basin has been practiced for a long time for testing offshore structures used by the oil and gas industry however the quality of the wind in terms of the level of turbulence and homogeneity has had to be greatly improved for testing wind turbines while testing oil and gas structures requires control over the loads integrated on the whole model testing fowts demands more detailed control over the loads applied locally to parts of the model e g the rotor blades the aerodynamic loads on the rotor blades are at the heart of the working principle of a wind turbine more specifically the creation of lift on the blade aerodynamic profile is the driving force behind the generation of torque in the drive train and eventually generation of electrical power however one can question what are the minimum levels of turbulence and homogeneity that are required for the testing of fowts in a basin stating that the primary goal of model tests in a basin is the study of the motions of moored structures the wind speed variation that should mainly matter are those happening at frequencies for which the structure is the most susceptible to move for oil and gas fixed and floating structures only the very low frequency variations of the wind loading are targeted during model tests for fowts the scope of wind generation remains limited to the low frequencies it is commonly accepted that wind variation at frequencies equal to or above the wave frequency range won t affect the motion of any floating structures even tension leg platforms vibrations caused by wind are therefore not in the scope of basin model tests with wind as a logical consequence there is no justification for including anything else than the mean wind speed and the low frequency gust component of the wind in the scope of a wind generator in a wave basin that said an initial technical challenge for testing fowts was the capacity of generating a steady wind with very little turbulence this challenge has been solved for wave basins in a similar way as it has been done for wind tunnels de ridder et al 2013 ohana et al 2014 courbois summarized the main solutions in his phd thesis courbois 2013 a second challenge was to achieve a low turbulent wind in a volume that is large enough to include the motion of the rotor of the wind turbine during all tests as well as the capacity of the wind generator this challenge requires the ability to predict and control the re circulation of the wind in a closed volume like most basins are mcelman et al 2016 although accurate wind sensors exist monitoring a wind field in a basin is currently a labor intensive and time consuming task figs 1 3 depict wind generators in the basins which they have been designed for see also kimball et al 2014 armesto et al 2017 5 scaling challenge to carry out model tests on fowts the total system must be scaled to a size that fits within the testing facilities as for other offshore structures the depth of the basin is often a limiting parameter buchner et al 1999 however solutions dealing with this limitation include the useage of an alternative equivalent mooring system amongst others moreover the size or the capacity of the subsystem chosen for the modelling of the aerodynamic loads on the turbine can also lead to strong constraints to study the effects of the excitation components wave current and wind on the dynamic response of a structure all loads have to be scaled in the same way froude scaling is typically employed to study how a large structure behaves in waves so that the ratio of inertia to gravity forces is preserved table 3 summarizes the relations between the main quantities for the fowt prototype at full scale and its model at the scale λ l under froude scaling one important drawback of following froude scaling laws is that drag and lift loads do not scale accordingly indeed these loads are better preserved when reynolds scaling is applied however reynolds and froude can only be used together at full scale fowts are exposed to lift and drag loads on several sides because they are often made of small elements relative to typical ocean wave lengths drag loads caused by waves on these elements can be important for the determination of the total load most importantly the aerodynamic loads acting on the whole structure and more precisely on the rotor consist of lift and drag loads burton et al 2001 to be consistent with the inertial wave and gravity loads the aerodynamic loads also need to be scaled according to froude there are several ways to do this this article first discusses the use of a scaled wind turbine see table 4 and second the use of a hybrid testing set up 6 state of the art of testing with a physical model of a wind turbine when using the full approach a physical model of the turbine is placed in the generated wind field ideally the characteristics of the rotor at model scale namely target thrust and power curves resemble those of the full scale rotor with the exception of model tests of that have been exclusively performed in a wind tunnel specific attention has not been paid to the unsteady aerodynamic behaviour of scaled rotors in practise obtaining a satisfying thrust is privileged over torque because the thrust has a much bigger impact on the motion of the fowt therefore obtaining the requested scaled thrust is the first target when scaling the rotor when the scaled rotor can deliver the requested thrust for wind velocities and rotor speed scaled according to froude laws the rotor is said to keep its performance at model scale the main parameters used to evaluate the performance of a rotor are the thrust coefficient c t and the power coefficient c p these coefficients are defined with eqs 1 and 2 in eqs 1 and 3 t denotes the total thrust applied on the turbine n a is the turbine swept area m2 u a is the velocity of the air or wind speed m s shear not taken into account ρ is the density of the air kg m3 q is the torque exerted by the aerodynamic forces around the wind direction at the hub and ω is the rotational speed rad s the rotor s characteristics curves c t c p are usually shown as a function of the tip speed ratio tsr which is the ratio of the rotation velocity of the blade tip to the wind speed as defined with eq 3 r is the radius of the rotor m note that τ is used in this article rather than the symbol λ usually adopted in wind turbine aerodynamics this has been done to avoid any confusion with the scaling factor in hydrodynamic testing that is usually denoted as λ see also kimball et al 2014 stewart and muskulus 2016 fowler et al 2017 1 c t t 0 5 ρ a u a 2 2 c p q ω 0 5 ρ a u a 3 3 τ t s r q r u w 6 1 performance scaling versus geometrical scaling performance scaling is the most well developed re design process for the purpose of model testing in a basin martin et al 2014 fowler et al 2013 performance scaling requires designing a blade aerodynamic profile that is suitable for the flow conditions of a froude scaled wind schunemann et al 2018 low reynolds aerofoils are typically used for this purpose also the chord of the aerofoil is often lengthened to increase the lift to drag ratio the thickness of the blade may be increased to ensure an acceptable robustness of the blade table 5 contains a few examples of performance scaled rotors which have been described in detail in the literature fig 4 shows the blade of the performance scaled turbine used by marin to represent a 5 mw wind turbine at scale 1 50 more scaled rotors have been used or developed but real performance test data are not always available make and vaz 2015 it has been noted that there is not one single way to performance scale a rotor muler et al 2014 and other scaling approaches have been applied however when the blade is geometrically scaled rather than performance scaled the model lacks a solution to prevent the lift substantially decreasing as a result of early stall make and vaz 2015 as a result the rotor will underperform and the thrust will be much lower than required for example basin tests carried out with a geometrically scale version of the 5 mw nrel rotor jonkman et al 2009 resulted in negative power in other words negative aero dynamic torque under the turbine s operating conditions the most common approach to deal with this problem is to increase the wind speed to match the level of thrust sought after hansen et al 2014 with this approach the main effect is that the drag goes up with the wind speed while the lift does not increase as a result the pursued value of thrust might be reached for a higher wind speed and inversely a smaller tsr but the power is very likely to remain small or even negative in this case the thrust as a function of tsr will be different at model scale than at full scale for situations when the desired thrust can only be reached by increasing the wind speed even with a re designed rotor a new adjusted scaling approach was introduced froude β scaling muler et al 2014 this scaling includes the increase of the wind velocity by a factor β in the froude scaling relations this alternative formulation is applicable to strict performance scaling when β 1 and it provides a practical solution to the mismatch between the target and achieved ct table 2 summarizes the relations between the main quantities of interest when β scaling is applied table 1 provides a non exhaustive list of model tests that used a physical wind turbine that was scaled using either performance scaling including β scaling or geometrical scaling 6 2 similarities and discrepancies accounting for the correct variation of the thrust when the rotor moves in the wind is directly related to the resemblance between the ct curve of the full rotor and that of the scaled rotor however the aerodynamic torque is likely to be smaller than what would be required to scale the torque and power properly as a consequence testers use an engine to control the rotor s rotation speed during testing in wind controlling the rotation speed at froude scale guarantees preservation of the correct rotor passing frequencies 1p np and gyroscopic moments which are properly phased with the motion of the floater despite this smaller aerodynamic torque the same principles for controlling wind turbines can be applied at full scale and at model scale as long as the power stays positive for a given range of tip speed ratio tsr and an equivalent blade pitch angle savenije first demonstrated that standard wind turbine control can be done with a performance scaled wind turbine savenije these testers showed that instability induced by the wrong controller actions could also be observed with a semisubmersible fowt tested under combined wind and waves in a basin basin tests of performance scaled fowts with wind turbine control have since been repeated multiple times goupee et al 2017 the tsr is only preserved with performance scaling β 1 on the other hand some quantities of the scale turbine will not correspond with those of the full scale turbine for example the aerodynamic torque and power the generator torque and its contribution to roll and pitch moments for non zero nacelle yaw and the amplitude of passing frequency excitations 1p np will likely differ between the scaled and the full scale turbine in summary a performance scaled wind turbine is a fully functional wind turbine that will experience the typical dynamic responses that one would expect from a full scale wind turbine however a scaled wind turbine with its purpose designed blades engine actuation system and sensors is specifically designed for model testing thus a scaled turbine should always be considered as a singular wind turbine different to the full scale commercial turbine that is envisaged for the actual fowt hence the tester should keep this difference in mind when the results of model tests are evaluated 6 3 aerodynamic characteristics of a scaled rotor a scaled wind turbine is most suitable for the study of interactions between the aerodynamics of the wind turbine and the hydrodynamics of the floater moreover tests with a scaled turbine can be used to validate coupled analysis numerical models however this requires that the scaled turbine and its performance can be adequately reproduced by the numerical models to this end multiple studies have been dedicated to the characterization of scaled turbines coulling et al 2013 gueydon et al 2015 for the characterization of performance scaled turbines the determination of proper sets of aerodynamic force coefficients c l c d on the rotor blade in low reynolds flow was key when using standard engineering aerodynamic tools such as blade element momentum theory bem based codes two main approaches for the characterization of performance scaled turbines have been successfully applied the first approach uses advanced numerical methods to calculate c t c p values that match those measured with a scaled turbine in a basin figs 5 and 6 these methods were developed because the assumptions used with traditional software to determine c l and c d are not always suitable for low reynolds flow moreover the presence of large 3 d effects around the rotor blade in froude scaled wind motivated the use of more sophisticated numerical tools such as unsteady reynolds average navier stokes solvers urans accounting for the actual 3d geometry of the blades this method has been proven useful for designing performance scaled rotors as urans blind prediction of c t and c p were found to match experimental data satisfactorily make and vaz 2015 carrying out 3d urans simulations of a scaled rotor is perceived to be a reliable way to determine aerodynamic force coefficients on froude scaled blades and by implication a robust way to derive c l c d from the integration of the pressure and shear forces around sections of the blade burmester et al 2016 nevertheless urans calculations are still rather expensive in terms of cpu and not easily accessible to most engineers therefore a second approach based on more standard engineering tools than urans was developed with this approach 2 d engineering tools provide an initial guess for c l c d from which an optimization scheme determines a set of coefficients that best matches the thrust and power of the measurements and the bemt based codes goupee et al 2015 this approach has made it possible to reproduce the c t c p of performance scaled turbines with bemt based codes while circumventing the possible shortcomings of 2 d tools at very low reynolds flow as well as numerical methods experiments have also been used to characterize scaled turbines experiments can be undertaken on 2 d profiles representing sections of a blade in a wind tunnel experiments can also be used to check rotor performance in a number of basins such experimentation is almost always done with the wind set up by mounting the turbine on a fixed support prior to the fowt tests de ridder et al 2013 interestingly towing the marin s 1 50 scaled 5 mw turbine resulted in similar c t c p gueydon and de ridder 2018 than when it was placed in a wind field generated in the offshore basin of marin see also kimball et al 2014 weikang et al 2016 7 state of the art of hybrid testing with sil the challenge of scaling the loads acting on wind turbines in wave basins is circumvented in the simplified approach by choosing to deliver loads directly rather than to model physically what is causing them i e the wind and the wind turbine this approach considerably simplifies the experimental set up as no physical wind and no physical wind turbine are needed hybrid testing involves data acquisition and processing force estimation motion and velocities observation and force actuation on a floating structure fig 7 some pre conceived knowledge on wind turbine loads is required with this approach hall et al 2014 and this knowledge is often based on detailed numerical studies done prior to testing bachynski et al 2015 during hybrid testing of fowts wind turbines are simulated with aerodynamic simulation software to supply the target loads the wave and current loads are physical while the loads acting on the turbine are numerical the motions and velocities of the virtual turbine are determined from measurements done on the model of the fowt these motions and velocities are scaled up to full scale and supplied to the software that in turn returns loads at full scale which are scaled down to match the wave excitation and partially applied to the model through actuators table 5 provides an overview of model tests for which hybrid testing with sil has been employed the content of this table is principally based on papers presented at conferences that are traditionally used as a forum for sharing new model testing techniques for fowts omae isope eera deepwind and more recently iowtc in summary the main limitations of hybrid testing techniques are of two kinds 1 the functionality of the software and its integration with the data acquisition system of the basin 2 the capacity of the actuators to transfer the requested load components 7 1 software important considerations in the choice of the software relate to its speed of execution chabaud et al 2013 stability and accuracy considering that it is common to acquire measurement data at a sampling frequency μ hz above 100hz the numerical assessment of the loads must be done faster than μ λ hz in the majority of hybrid systems bemt code is used bemt code is preferred because its algorithm is quick to solve the aerodynamic loads and it is well established in the industry for the simulation of horizontal axis wind turbines hawts bemt code is also stable at the required sampling frequencies other methods e g free vortex line solvers are substantially slower furthermore cpu capacity and stability must be re assessed when controllers or elasticity are accounted for in hybrid testing while no physical wind needs to be generated the wind loads on the floater the tower and the nacelle need to be calculated by the software wind field velocities are an important input of the wind turbine simulation software if computed beforehand these data must be available for the duration of the model test for a fine spatial distribution gust wind velocities can represent a large number of data which has to be dealt with by the software during the test such large amounts of data can alter the processing speed and become a limiting factor nevertheless none of these it issues rule out the applicability of hybrid testing at the most they can limit its application to given situations e g a minimum scale and load cases e g a limited complexity of the wind gust field most logically the software of hybrid testing relies on the state of the art for the simulation of wind turbines it is noteworthy that all implementations of hybrid testing listed in table 5 make use of aerodyn of nrel s fast program despite some concern that bemt as implemented in aerodyn does not adequately capture the dynamic of a rotor submitted to very large motions matha et al 2016 there seems to be no real alternative yet that can comply with the strict requirements of the integration with a standard data acquisition system of a basin in fact the first few validations of bemt codes against actual prototypes of fowt seem to balance this concern as no major discrepancies between simulations and measured data have been publicly reported roddier et al peiffer moreover the aerodynamics were recently calculated by aerodyn with satisfaction in two full scale validation studies more precisely fast was used for the hywind demo fowt driscoll et al 2016 and orcaflex fast was used for the windfloat portugal fowt cermelli et al 2018 roddier et al 2017 it is also expected that the software used in hybrid testing will follow the development of the state of the art in the coupled analysis of fowts 7 2 actuators the actuation of loads is the greatest constraint found in hybrid testing the actuators are selected to account for the most relevant wind turbine loads under the test conditions several considerations come into play when selecting actuators the number of degrees of freedom dof of the load actuation the load range and the actuator s response time the load range and actuation frequency is limited by mechanical and electrical characteristics of its components while the upper value of the range can be increased by increasing the size or number of actuators the lower value of the range poses a greater challenge and results in the exclusion of some of the smallest load components from hybrid tests a review of published hybrid tests table 6 shows that the gyroscopic and vertical loads have often been omitted from such tests additionally part of the rotor s torque and its contribution to the roll moment has often not been accounted for although these omissions may be justified on a case by case basis in regards to the small contributions of these loads it is often undermined that they are actually done by necessity as it would have been too difficult to design a system of actuators that can represent these components representation of the horizontal projection of the rotor s thrust and associated moment is the common ground of all hybrid testing systems for standard operating conditions of a hawt the level of these load components is much larger than those of other load components of the wind turbine hall et al 2014 bachynski et al 2015 the variations amplitudes and frequencies of load components also poses a challenge to representing the actuation frequency of loads indeed fowts react to small variations of turbine loads at inconvenient frequencies i e natural frequencies if actuators can t deliver these variations then the test may overlook possible resonant responses for example it is known that the variations of thrust have a major impact on the total damping of the system jonkman 2008 this effect was found to deteriorate the damping of a spar fowt when a standard onshore controller was used skaare et al 2007 if the objective of the model test is to observe and study the variations of thrust then the variations of this load component need to be accurately represented with the actuators for hybrid testing finding actuators able to account for small load variations over a broad enough frequency range is a possible bottleneck the test set up can also lead to unexpected effects due to the limitations in the response time of the actuators the load calculated by the software is a requested target that in some cases may not be realized when the contributions of all actuators are summed up differences between target and realized loads is inherent to all controlled systems in early hybrid tests bachynski et al 2016 surge and pitch decay tests as well as a few regular wave tests were used to characterize how well hybrid set ups performed one verification approach the zero load test involves comparing results from a first test where no loads are delivered with a second test that actively delivers the calculated loads the zero load test also called test in following mode is a credible indicator of the capacity of the set up to control the loads that it can deliver to the fowt to date zero load checks have provided better results for surge decays than for pitch decays these observations imply that the hybrid systems of these tests had a non desired influence on the motion of the fowt and that this interference varies with the frequency of the wind turbine motion this information has been accounted for in the verification program of more recent hybrid testing campaigns thys et al 2018 luan et al 2017 where tests in following mode were carried out in irregular wave e g in broad wave spectrum like pink noise waves a distinction can be made between different types of actuators namely fans or cables as each have distinct issues a fan can truly be set inactive by turning it off whereas a cable is to some extent always active as long as it is connected to the structure based on the scarce literature on hybrid testing using a fan the main bottle neck in such systems appears to be reaction speed a fan generally requires a longer time to reach the requested load level than a cable put into action with a winch this delay shown in azcona et al 2014 provides a limit to the frequency of the variation of loads that a fan can deliver a fan system may act as a low pass filter considering that the wind excitations are dominantly at low frequencies this may not pose an issue to the study of the interaction between low frequency platform motions with the wind turbine loads for spar type e g utsunomiya et al 2009 and semi type foundations however such a system may struggle to represent variations of higher frequencies like the ones related to wave motions another limitation within hybrid systems that is unique to each set up is that two ways interactions between the turbine and the floating foundation is only represented up to a given threshold a recent publication on a system using multi fans presented fast rates of change for the thrust meseguer and guanche 2019 azcona described in azcona et al 2014 a system of cener which uses a ducted fan for the actuations of the loads fig 8 sauder gave a detailed description of the method developed by sintef ocean sauder et al 2016 which uses cables for the actuation of the wind turbine loads fig 9 see also the most recent developments by marin fig 13 gueydon and bayati 2020 and cener fig 14 8 optimum usage of combined wind wave tests for floating wind both the full approach and the simplified approach rely on the same understanding of what is causing the floating foundation and the rotor to interact a large part of the challenge is that the aerodynamics and the hydrodynamics are strongly coupled for fowts in summary the thrust of a wind turbine varies under the actions of the wind turbine controller which reacts to the apparent wind velocities while inversely the motion of the floating turbine is influenced by the thrust despite the fact that the two approaches described in this article use distinct ways to represent the wind turbine loads these approaches have many similarities in both cases the wind turbine loads that are effectively transferred to the floater constitute the central element of the aero hydro coupling it therefore makes sense to measure these loads when testing using both approaches in term of the dynamic response of a fowt the variation of these loads is most interesting although the variation of the thrust may often be considered small relative to the variation of the wave loads for fowts with hawt e g semisubmersible with large displacement these variations may coincide with slow natural periods of the system and can result in appreciable motions for moored structures under these circumstances the accuracy of the representation of the wind turbine loads influences the response of fowts the resonance response of a floating structure can be sensitive to small perturbations whether these perturbations are physical and desired or undesired in both model testing approaches the acts of measuring and actuating may have undesired effects on the fowt the presence of instruments such as a model scale rna with hanging measurement and power cables robertson et al 2013 or the presence of actuators such as a system of tensioned cables gueydon et al 2018 may alter the motions of the fowt it is therefore imperative to document the model test set up in great detail and to use caution when interpreting results it is extremely challenging to manufacture a physical rotor that is robust precise and light enough to comply with a realistic weight distribution of an actual full scale turbine as a consequence a physical model of a fowt with a scale rotor often exhibits bigger roll and pitch inertia moments than desirable in this instance the deviation from design inertia of the prototype clearly requires a correction that can best be done separately in a numerical study gueydon 2016 at the risk of stating the obvious it must be emphasized that model test results are always the reflection of what was done in the basin for example the persistent underestimation of low frequency motions of a semisubmersible fowt in waves in the findings of the iea wind task oc5 study 10 shows that decisions made on the sole basis of simulations may be hazardous therefore a two step numerical process is recommended to complement results from modeltests 8 1 step 1 numerical model of the model first a software validation study consisting of a numerical study of the model as it was represented in the basin with the greatest possible level of details is recommended the numerical model of the model gueydon 2016 the primary goal of this first step is to prove that the simulation code properly accounts for the coupled aero hydro effects as they were represented in the model tests a secondary goal of this numerical check could be to investigate possible consequences of alterations of the motions inherent to the test set up e g effects of cables effects of excluding dof or load components many simulation tools that are capable of including as many components as the user is ready to model are available for the full approach this would consist of numerical simulations of the fowt with the model scale wind turbine and wind measurements for the simplified approach this would consist of numerical simulations of the fowt with the system that was used to emulate the wind turbine loads depending on the functionality of the tool these simulations would include the actuators and their control system or at least documented limitations of the system e g the same load components as during the tests for the hybrid system this is a similar study to that which was needed to support the design of the test set up bachynski et al 2015 8 2 step 2 numerical model of the prototype second it is recommended that the validated tool from step 1 is used to simulate the design fowt without any appendages from the test set up the numerical model of the prototype note that some adaptations to the numerical model used for the design study will be required to account for the up scaling of quantities that by nature don t comply with froude scaling i e damping coefficients and viscous drag will be different at full scale than at basin scale more advanced models e g rans can be particularly useful for this extrapolation from model scale to full scale burmester et al 2018 at this stage such a numerical study will capture many more load cases than what was tested in the basin for hybrid testing a large part of the input data for the turbine will be simply brought over from the first step whereas for the full approach these data will be different between steps one and two table 6 summarizes how numerical studies and model tests can complement each other in the design process of fowts 8 3 complementary hybrid testing another complementary application of the hybrid approach has been recently developed in an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel bayati et al 2018 where the relevant physics to be investigated was the aero servo aerodynamics of the wind turbine interacting with the motion of the floater similar to hybrid testing in an ocean basin where the main focus and reliability is on the hydrodynamics and the mooring system wind tunnel hybrid tests can be used to provide more accurate results for the loads and control of the wind turbine itself an advantage of using both hybrid approaches is that they each investigate the same problem from two different perspectives and can be used to optimize the design and study of the many components of fowts for example different control strategies or rotor blade aerodynamics for a given physical floating system can be explored in the basin while different hydrodynamic design and mooring system configurations for a given physical wind turbine can be explored in the wind tunnel hybrid testing of the same fowt in a wave basin and in a wind tunnel was carried out in the project life50 bayati et al 2018 thys et al 2019 9 combining approaches the full approach and hybrid testing are extremely complementary and reinforce each others value testing with a physical turbine provides data which can be used to validate coupled aero hydro software such a validation increases confidence in the ability of a numerical tool to deal with the conditions experienced by fowt which justifies its use as sil for hybrid testing the potential collaboration between these three techniques has not yet been fully explored fig 10 so far only a few comparisons between these different approaches can be found in the literature the authors are only aware of three projects where tests of the same model have been done with a physical turbine and with a hybrid set up as part of innwind stuttgart university tested a 10 mw semisubmersible fowt with a physical rotor and repeated some of these tests with a ducted fan hybrid testing solution of cener fig 8 in the same basin given the fact that these two campaigns did not use precisely the same floater or the same reference turbine the pertinence of a comparison is reduced as a result two distinct papers were published on the tests with the physical turbine borisade et al 2018 and the tests with the ducted fan azcona et al 2014 and no comparisons were shared in the literature the university of maine and the university of prince edward island tested the deepcwind oc4 semisubmersible with a 1 50 geometrically scaled version of the 5 mw nrel turbine the same scale turbine as used during the deepcwind model tests fowler et al 2013 and then repeated these tests with a 1 dof hybrid set up system this hybrid system was made of two cables pulling on the nacelle in opposite directions and therefore could only account for the thrust in this work the floater was identical for both approaches surge resonant response appeared to be equivalent in both approaches whereas the pitch resonant response was significantly different hall and goupee 2018 fig 11 for the rest the results obtained with these two methods agreed quite well with an overall deviation of 7 in standard deviation of pitch marin compared two methods to test a tlp fowt in combined waves and wind gueydon et al 2018 tests with a performance scaled rotor representing a 5 mw turbine at full scale were reproduced using a hybrid set up composed of five controlled tensioned cables fig 12 this hybrid set up accounted for the thrust and the pitch aerodynamic moment on the rotor in this campaign both the floater and the rotor characteristics were equivalent for the two approaches a good match over a broad range of frequencies was achieved in the comparison of the motion response of the tlp nevertheless small disparities in the phase of the pitch response were observed for a bandwidth of short wave excitations period 8 s which would significantly alter the tendon tensions during the tests with the hybrid set up marinet2 has planned a round robin campaign with a semisubmersible fowt in this new project the same floater will be tested in four different facilities with several ways of emulating the wind turbine fig 15 this project is running until 2021 last but not least several large and full scale prototypes have been monitored in real wave wind and current conditions all these prototypes underwent laboratory tests as part of their design process too even without sharing any real data it would be rewarding for researchers working on improving testing methodology for fowts to hear how these early developers look back at the tests that they have done and how they would approach new tests however for the time being this feedback is very limited matha et al 2016 10 conclusions significant progress in model testing of fowts in hydrodynamic basins under combined wind and waves have been made in the last decade today the state of the art enables testers to accounts for the main interactions between the wind turbine and the motions of the floating foundation and experiments including the wind turbine controller can be made despite significant achievements to date proven by multiple reports of successful implementations of testing techniques a number of unknowns and uncertainties remain in regards to the diversity of floating wind concepts that are envisaged to further reduce the lcoe of floating wind it is necessary to accumulate much more evidence on the validity and the limitations of testing methods based on the literature review done for this paper the authors believe that the limitations of turbine emulation techniques in a basin are not yet sufficiently known or remain undocumented the authors strongly recommend that hydrodynamic testing facilities engage with more critical comparisons of results obtained from all available fowt testing techniques namely modelling of physical turbines in basins as well as hybrid testing in basins and wind tunnels the complete characterization of the hardware limitations of the hybrid testing set up is strongly recommended to know which effects could be masked by these limitations lastly the feedback from early developers of prototypes is also essential to guide further development of model testing techniques 11 acknowledgments s gueydon acknowledges very interesting discussions during the floating wind turbine coupled analysis jip of dnvgl which has

21803,model testing of offshore floating wind turbines fowts needs to account for the hydrodynamics of the floater at the same time as the aerodynamics of the rotor and their interactions testers have followed two distinct paths to solve the challenge of modelling these two dissimilar physical phenomena one path has consisted of building physical models at basin scale that resembled the actual fowt a full approach with this approach every component of the model test needs to comply with froude scaling laws wind generators have been improved dedicated scaled turbines designed and a method known as performance scaling developed the second path consisted of mimicking the most relevant components of the wind turbine loads and applying them to the floater at the wind turbine tower top a simplified approach with this approach a specific experimental set up is designed to transfer the wind turbine loads which in the case of hybrid testing are calculated by an aerodynamic simulation code this article reviews the state of the art of testing fowts in basins with a focus on the most complete examples of each testing approach limitations similarities differences and complementarities between the approaches are described and discussed to continue improving testing techniques there is an acute need for more comparisons between different testing approaches and validation against full scale measurement campaigns keywords floating offshore wind turbine wind tunnel testing hardware in the loop testing hybrid testing model validation hydrodynamics 1 introduction the technical feasibility of multi megawatt offshore floating wind turbines fowts have already been demonstrated multiple times for diverse kinds of floaters hywind demo for a spar with a 2 mw turbine skaare et al 2007 myhr et al 2011 and hywind scotland with the first pilot farm made of five spars with a 6 mw turbine on top for each spar bbc 1652 windfloat for a three column semisubmersible with a 2 mw turbine roddier et al 2009 fukushima forward phase 1 for a compact four column semisubmersible with a 2 mw wind turbine consortium fukushima forward phase 2 for a v shape semisubmersible with a 7 mw turbine consortium a moon pool barge with a 2 mw wind turbine by ideol offshore 1493 the most immediate challenge for this pioneering industry is to show that floating wind is competitive against bottom fixed offshore wind finding the most efficient ways to reduce the levelized cost of energy lcoe of these technologies is a vital goal of pilot projects of pre commercial floating wind farms for instance equinor publicises the fact that they have the lcoe target of 40 60 euro mwh by 2030 for hywind equinor next to hywind scotland kincardine wind and windfloat atlantic edp four other pilot farms are planned for the coming years in france groix belle ile to be located in the atlantic ocean and golf du lion eolmed and provence grand large to be placed in the mediterranean sea next to the progress that floating wind has allowed with regards to installation and operation and maintenance designers of fowts are being pushed to explore more extreme solutions to further reduce the cost of floating foundations nowadays numerical tools and model tests are two key components of the design process of fowts as such these components need to support the design challenges of fowts code comparisons such as those carried out under iea wind task 23 and 30 robertson et al 2017 have contributed to the improvement of the efficiency and the accuracy of simulation tools for fowts research and development in physical modelling of fowts has led to major improvements in the way turbines are emulated during model tests in basins for example recent advances relate to the use of scale turbines and alternative systems where wind turbine loads calculated by software are directly transferred to the model of the fowt in contrast with what has almost become standard for numerical tools no major comparison of model testing techniques for fowts have been initiated with the exception of the ongoing wind round robin of marinet2 marinet2 as a result it can be difficult to know which techniques are available this paper builds on reviews of model testing options published in 2014 muler et al 2014 and 2015 sauder et al 2016 with a sharper focus on how the aerodynamic loads on the turbine are represented 2 motivations for model tests of fowts in a wave basin just a few full scale prototypes of fowts have been operated over multiple years in real conditions and to date limited data and feedback has been published on these experiences model tests in a basin are advantageous when compared to prototypes at sea because they provide data on the behaviour of the whole system but require less time resources and are less risky rare but critical conditions can be tested in a basin in contrast to open ocean conditions where the excitations wind waves and current are rarely present independently these components can be investigated in a basin on their own to better grasp the relative importance of their impact on fowts the way that these components interact can also be studied in a basin moreover model tests can be used to validate numerical tools for the simulation of fowts most of which have been developed less than a decade ago last but not least model testing is often the first opportunity to carry out a simplified but global assessment of the whole system i e modelling the moored floater and the turbine together 3 model testing strategies when testing novel structures such as fowts two distinct strategies can be used the first strategy the full approach involves designing experiments that are as close as possible to the real situation with all its complexity most of the time this results in testing a large number of variables the second strategy the simplified approach involves simplifying the experiment to the minimum number of variables which allow insight into the system s behaviour for fowts the full approach has led the testers to build model scale wind turbines and place them in scaled wind fields in basins although this approach is ambitious given all the scaling constraints involved de ridder et al 2014 it has the merit of minimizing pre conceived ideas that may interfere with the design of the experiment such model tests enable the tester to be first and foremost an observer during the model tests the greatest advantage of this approach is that it allows space for the unexpected for instance the revelation of interactions which may not have been suspected to be important one can think that this approach is preferable when very little is known about the behaviour of a structure a great cost associated with this approach is linked to the complex model test set up and non trivial interpretation of results due to the large number of variables at play the full approach has been implemented for all types of fowts in diverse basins table 1 provides a non exhaustive list of these tests for fowts the simplified approach has led the testers to replace the wind turbine with one or more actuators that directly apply loads representative of the turbine loads on the floater testing techniques used with this approach have also been significantly improved since the first applications initially a single constant tension winch cable pulling on the top of the tower would only represent the steady part of the thrust of the wind turbine at this time the objective of such tests was solely to account for the mean horizontal offset and the mean inclination of the floater caused by the thrust of the wind turbine then the focus was on the hydrodynamics and all other effects of the wind turbine were ignored nowadays the turbine loads are calculated as needed during the tests by a piece of software which is fed with the measured motions of the floater sauder et al 2016 the software in the loop sil element of the testing process the selection of the load components that are most relevant for the model tests is often supported by a prior numerical study of the tested fowt bachynski et al 2016 such numerical studies also inform the experimental design the selected load components are applied through a series of actuators to a superstructure mounted on the floater and these forces are controlled through a feed back loop the primary focus is to apply the dynamic thrust at its point of action correctly the simplified approach can be broadened to include other components but this has been achieved at the cost of increasing complexity of the experimental set up i e more actuators these techniques are referred to as hybrid testing because they involve a computer program that provides the targeted load values in real time although defining two distinct testing strategies helps to discuss model testing of fowts in a holistic way this categorization is artificial and may not embrace all testing techniques for instance tests using a drag disk to represent the wind loads on the turbine roddier et al 2009 meseguer and guanche 2019 can be seen as following the simplified approach because they target the sole representation of the thrust however they still require the generation of a wind field as in the full approach other categorizations such as pure physical testing versus testing with sil could have been considered in this review but they would still face the same challenge of encompassing the complete diversity of techniques nevertheless with the aim to discuss the state of the art of fowt testing two techniques currently stand out in terms of their completeness and are therefore often opposed to each other these are the use of a scaled turbine in a real wind field and the use of actuators commanded by sil noteably these two techniques have fundamental differences that can be conveniently explained using the categorization of the full approach and the simplified approach in this light the scaled rotor can be considered a representative example of the full approach while replacing the wind turbine by actuators can be considered a representative example of the simplified approach 4 wind generation in a basin the generation of physical wind in a basin has been practiced for a long time for testing offshore structures used by the oil and gas industry however the quality of the wind in terms of the level of turbulence and homogeneity has had to be greatly improved for testing wind turbines while testing oil and gas structures requires control over the loads integrated on the whole model testing fowts demands more detailed control over the loads applied locally to parts of the model e g the rotor blades the aerodynamic loads on the rotor blades are at the heart of the working principle of a wind turbine more specifically the creation of lift on the blade aerodynamic profile is the driving force behind the generation of torque in the drive train and eventually generation of electrical power however one can question what are the minimum levels of turbulence and homogeneity that are required for the testing of fowts in a basin stating that the primary goal of model tests in a basin is the study of the motions of moored structures the wind speed variation that should mainly matter are those happening at frequencies for which the structure is the most susceptible to move for oil and gas fixed and floating structures only the very low frequency variations of the wind loading are targeted during model tests for fowts the scope of wind generation remains limited to the low frequencies it is commonly accepted that wind variation at frequencies equal to or above the wave frequency range won t affect the motion of any floating structures even tension leg platforms vibrations caused by wind are therefore not in the scope of basin model tests with wind as a logical consequence there is no justification for including anything else than the mean wind speed and the low frequency gust component of the wind in the scope of a wind generator in a wave basin that said an initial technical challenge for testing fowts was the capacity of generating a steady wind with very little turbulence this challenge has been solved for wave basins in a similar way as it has been done for wind tunnels de ridder et al 2013 ohana et al 2014 courbois summarized the main solutions in his phd thesis courbois 2013 a second challenge was to achieve a low turbulent wind in a volume that is large enough to include the motion of the rotor of the wind turbine during all tests as well as the capacity of the wind generator this challenge requires the ability to predict and control the re circulation of the wind in a closed volume like most basins are mcelman et al 2016 although accurate wind sensors exist monitoring a wind field in a basin is currently a labor intensive and time consuming task figs 1 3 depict wind generators in the basins which they have been designed for see also kimball et al 2014 armesto et al 2017 5 scaling challenge to carry out model tests on fowts the total system must be scaled to a size that fits within the testing facilities as for other offshore structures the depth of the basin is often a limiting parameter buchner et al 1999 however solutions dealing with this limitation include the useage of an alternative equivalent mooring system amongst others moreover the size or the capacity of the subsystem chosen for the modelling of the aerodynamic loads on the turbine can also lead to strong constraints to study the effects of the excitation components wave current and wind on the dynamic response of a structure all loads have to be scaled in the same way froude scaling is typically employed to study how a large structure behaves in waves so that the ratio of inertia to gravity forces is preserved table 3 summarizes the relations between the main quantities for the fowt prototype at full scale and its model at the scale λ l under froude scaling one important drawback of following froude scaling laws is that drag and lift loads do not scale accordingly indeed these loads are better preserved when reynolds scaling is applied however reynolds and froude can only be used together at full scale fowts are exposed to lift and drag loads on several sides because they are often made of small elements relative to typical ocean wave lengths drag loads caused by waves on these elements can be important for the determination of the total load most importantly the aerodynamic loads acting on the whole structure and more precisely on the rotor consist of lift and drag loads burton et al 2001 to be consistent with the inertial wave and gravity loads the aerodynamic loads also need to be scaled according to froude there are several ways to do this this article first discusses the use of a scaled wind turbine see table 4 and second the use of a hybrid testing set up 6 state of the art of testing with a physical model of a wind turbine when using the full approach a physical model of the turbine is placed in the generated wind field ideally the characteristics of the rotor at model scale namely target thrust and power curves resemble those of the full scale rotor with the exception of model tests of that have been exclusively performed in a wind tunnel specific attention has not been paid to the unsteady aerodynamic behaviour of scaled rotors in practise obtaining a satisfying thrust is privileged over torque because the thrust has a much bigger impact on the motion of the fowt therefore obtaining the requested scaled thrust is the first target when scaling the rotor when the scaled rotor can deliver the requested thrust for wind velocities and rotor speed scaled according to froude laws the rotor is said to keep its performance at model scale the main parameters used to evaluate the performance of a rotor are the thrust coefficient c t and the power coefficient c p these coefficients are defined with eqs 1 and 2 in eqs 1 and 3 t denotes the total thrust applied on the turbine n a is the turbine swept area m2 u a is the velocity of the air or wind speed m s shear not taken into account ρ is the density of the air kg m3 q is the torque exerted by the aerodynamic forces around the wind direction at the hub and ω is the rotational speed rad s the rotor s characteristics curves c t c p are usually shown as a function of the tip speed ratio tsr which is the ratio of the rotation velocity of the blade tip to the wind speed as defined with eq 3 r is the radius of the rotor m note that τ is used in this article rather than the symbol λ usually adopted in wind turbine aerodynamics this has been done to avoid any confusion with the scaling factor in hydrodynamic testing that is usually denoted as λ see also kimball et al 2014 stewart and muskulus 2016 fowler et al 2017 1 c t t 0 5 ρ a u a 2 2 c p q ω 0 5 ρ a u a 3 3 τ t s r q r u w 6 1 performance scaling versus geometrical scaling performance scaling is the most well developed re design process for the purpose of model testing in a basin martin et al 2014 fowler et al 2013 performance scaling requires designing a blade aerodynamic profile that is suitable for the flow conditions of a froude scaled wind schunemann et al 2018 low reynolds aerofoils are typically used for this purpose also the chord of the aerofoil is often lengthened to increase the lift to drag ratio the thickness of the blade may be increased to ensure an acceptable robustness of the blade table 5 contains a few examples of performance scaled rotors which have been described in detail in the literature fig 4 shows the blade of the performance scaled turbine used by marin to represent a 5 mw wind turbine at scale 1 50 more scaled rotors have been used or developed but real performance test data are not always available make and vaz 2015 it has been noted that there is not one single way to performance scale a rotor muler et al 2014 and other scaling approaches have been applied however when the blade is geometrically scaled rather than performance scaled the model lacks a solution to prevent the lift substantially decreasing as a result of early stall make and vaz 2015 as a result the rotor will underperform and the thrust will be much lower than required for example basin tests carried out with a geometrically scale version of the 5 mw nrel rotor jonkman et al 2009 resulted in negative power in other words negative aero dynamic torque under the turbine s operating conditions the most common approach to deal with this problem is to increase the wind speed to match the level of thrust sought after hansen et al 2014 with this approach the main effect is that the drag goes up with the wind speed while the lift does not increase as a result the pursued value of thrust might be reached for a higher wind speed and inversely a smaller tsr but the power is very likely to remain small or even negative in this case the thrust as a function of tsr will be different at model scale than at full scale for situations when the desired thrust can only be reached by increasing the wind speed even with a re designed rotor a new adjusted scaling approach was introduced froude β scaling muler et al 2014 this scaling includes the increase of the wind velocity by a factor β in the froude scaling relations this alternative formulation is applicable to strict performance scaling when β 1 and it provides a practical solution to the mismatch between the target and achieved ct table 2 summarizes the relations between the main quantities of interest when β scaling is applied table 1 provides a non exhaustive list of model tests that used a physical wind turbine that was scaled using either performance scaling including β scaling or geometrical scaling 6 2 similarities and discrepancies accounting for the correct variation of the thrust when the rotor moves in the wind is directly related to the resemblance between the ct curve of the full rotor and that of the scaled rotor however the aerodynamic torque is likely to be smaller than what would be required to scale the torque and power properly as a consequence testers use an engine to control the rotor s rotation speed during testing in wind controlling the rotation speed at froude scale guarantees preservation of the correct rotor passing frequencies 1p np and gyroscopic moments which are properly phased with the motion of the floater despite this smaller aerodynamic torque the same principles for controlling wind turbines can be applied at full scale and at model scale as long as the power stays positive for a given range of tip speed ratio tsr and an equivalent blade pitch angle savenije first demonstrated that standard wind turbine control can be done with a performance scaled wind turbine savenije these testers showed that instability induced by the wrong controller actions could also be observed with a semisubmersible fowt tested under combined wind and waves in a basin basin tests of performance scaled fowts with wind turbine control have since been repeated multiple times goupee et al 2017 the tsr is only preserved with performance scaling β 1 on the other hand some quantities of the scale turbine will not correspond with those of the full scale turbine for example the aerodynamic torque and power the generator torque and its contribution to roll and pitch moments for non zero nacelle yaw and the amplitude of passing frequency excitations 1p np will likely differ between the scaled and the full scale turbine in summary a performance scaled wind turbine is a fully functional wind turbine that will experience the typical dynamic responses that one would expect from a full scale wind turbine however a scaled wind turbine with its purpose designed blades engine actuation system and sensors is specifically designed for model testing thus a scaled turbine should always be considered as a singular wind turbine different to the full scale commercial turbine that is envisaged for the actual fowt hence the tester should keep this difference in mind when the results of model tests are evaluated 6 3 aerodynamic characteristics of a scaled rotor a scaled wind turbine is most suitable for the study of interactions between the aerodynamics of the wind turbine and the hydrodynamics of the floater moreover tests with a scaled turbine can be used to validate coupled analysis numerical models however this requires that the scaled turbine and its performance can be adequately reproduced by the numerical models to this end multiple studies have been dedicated to the characterization of scaled turbines coulling et al 2013 gueydon et al 2015 for the characterization of performance scaled turbines the determination of proper sets of aerodynamic force coefficients c l c d on the rotor blade in low reynolds flow was key when using standard engineering aerodynamic tools such as blade element momentum theory bem based codes two main approaches for the characterization of performance scaled turbines have been successfully applied the first approach uses advanced numerical methods to calculate c t c p values that match those measured with a scaled turbine in a basin figs 5 and 6 these methods were developed because the assumptions used with traditional software to determine c l and c d are not always suitable for low reynolds flow moreover the presence of large 3 d effects around the rotor blade in froude scaled wind motivated the use of more sophisticated numerical tools such as unsteady reynolds average navier stokes solvers urans accounting for the actual 3d geometry of the blades this method has been proven useful for designing performance scaled rotors as urans blind prediction of c t and c p were found to match experimental data satisfactorily make and vaz 2015 carrying out 3d urans simulations of a scaled rotor is perceived to be a reliable way to determine aerodynamic force coefficients on froude scaled blades and by implication a robust way to derive c l c d from the integration of the pressure and shear forces around sections of the blade burmester et al 2016 nevertheless urans calculations are still rather expensive in terms of cpu and not easily accessible to most engineers therefore a second approach based on more standard engineering tools than urans was developed with this approach 2 d engineering tools provide an initial guess for c l c d from which an optimization scheme determines a set of coefficients that best matches the thrust and power of the measurements and the bemt based codes goupee et al 2015 this approach has made it possible to reproduce the c t c p of performance scaled turbines with bemt based codes while circumventing the possible shortcomings of 2 d tools at very low reynolds flow as well as numerical methods experiments have also been used to characterize scaled turbines experiments can be undertaken on 2 d profiles representing sections of a blade in a wind tunnel experiments can also be used to check rotor performance in a number of basins such experimentation is almost always done with the wind set up by mounting the turbine on a fixed support prior to the fowt tests de ridder et al 2013 interestingly towing the marin s 1 50 scaled 5 mw turbine resulted in similar c t c p gueydon and de ridder 2018 than when it was placed in a wind field generated in the offshore basin of marin see also kimball et al 2014 weikang et al 2016 7 state of the art of hybrid testing with sil the challenge of scaling the loads acting on wind turbines in wave basins is circumvented in the simplified approach by choosing to deliver loads directly rather than to model physically what is causing them i e the wind and the wind turbine this approach considerably simplifies the experimental set up as no physical wind and no physical wind turbine are needed hybrid testing involves data acquisition and processing force estimation motion and velocities observation and force actuation on a floating structure fig 7 some pre conceived knowledge on wind turbine loads is required with this approach hall et al 2014 and this knowledge is often based on detailed numerical studies done prior to testing bachynski et al 2015 during hybrid testing of fowts wind turbines are simulated with aerodynamic simulation software to supply the target loads the wave and current loads are physical while the loads acting on the turbine are numerical the motions and velocities of the virtual turbine are determined from measurements done on the model of the fowt these motions and velocities are scaled up to full scale and supplied to the software that in turn returns loads at full scale which are scaled down to match the wave excitation and partially applied to the model through actuators table 5 provides an overview of model tests for which hybrid testing with sil has been employed the content of this table is principally based on papers presented at conferences that are traditionally used as a forum for sharing new model testing techniques for fowts omae isope eera deepwind and more recently iowtc in summary the main limitations of hybrid testing techniques are of two kinds 1 the functionality of the software and its integration with the data acquisition system of the basin 2 the capacity of the actuators to transfer the requested load components 7 1 software important considerations in the choice of the software relate to its speed of execution chabaud et al 2013 stability and accuracy considering that it is common to acquire measurement data at a sampling frequency μ hz above 100hz the numerical assessment of the loads must be done faster than μ λ hz in the majority of hybrid systems bemt code is used bemt code is preferred because its algorithm is quick to solve the aerodynamic loads and it is well established in the industry for the simulation of horizontal axis wind turbines hawts bemt code is also stable at the required sampling frequencies other methods e g free vortex line solvers are substantially slower furthermore cpu capacity and stability must be re assessed when controllers or elasticity are accounted for in hybrid testing while no physical wind needs to be generated the wind loads on the floater the tower and the nacelle need to be calculated by the software wind field velocities are an important input of the wind turbine simulation software if computed beforehand these data must be available for the duration of the model test for a fine spatial distribution gust wind velocities can represent a large number of data which has to be dealt with by the software during the test such large amounts of data can alter the processing speed and become a limiting factor nevertheless none of these it issues rule out the applicability of hybrid testing at the most they can limit its application to given situations e g a minimum scale and load cases e g a limited complexity of the wind gust field most logically the software of hybrid testing relies on the state of the art for the simulation of wind turbines it is noteworthy that all implementations of hybrid testing listed in table 5 make use of aerodyn of nrel s fast program despite some concern that bemt as implemented in aerodyn does not adequately capture the dynamic of a rotor submitted to very large motions matha et al 2016 there seems to be no real alternative yet that can comply with the strict requirements of the integration with a standard data acquisition system of a basin in fact the first few validations of bemt codes against actual prototypes of fowt seem to balance this concern as no major discrepancies between simulations and measured data have been publicly reported roddier et al peiffer moreover the aerodynamics were recently calculated by aerodyn with satisfaction in two full scale validation studies more precisely fast was used for the hywind demo fowt driscoll et al 2016 and orcaflex fast was used for the windfloat portugal fowt cermelli et al 2018 roddier et al 2017 it is also expected that the software used in hybrid testing will follow the development of the state of the art in the coupled analysis of fowts 7 2 actuators the actuation of loads is the greatest constraint found in hybrid testing the actuators are selected to account for the most relevant wind turbine loads under the test conditions several considerations come into play when selecting actuators the number of degrees of freedom dof of the load actuation the load range and the actuator s response time the load range and actuation frequency is limited by mechanical and electrical characteristics of its components while the upper value of the range can be increased by increasing the size or number of actuators the lower value of the range poses a greater challenge and results in the exclusion of some of the smallest load components from hybrid tests a review of published hybrid tests table 6 shows that the gyroscopic and vertical loads have often been omitted from such tests additionally part of the rotor s torque and its contribution to the roll moment has often not been accounted for although these omissions may be justified on a case by case basis in regards to the small contributions of these loads it is often undermined that they are actually done by necessity as it would have been too difficult to design a system of actuators that can represent these components representation of the horizontal projection of the rotor s thrust and associated moment is the common ground of all hybrid testing systems for standard operating conditions of a hawt the level of these load components is much larger than those of other load components of the wind turbine hall et al 2014 bachynski et al 2015 the variations amplitudes and frequencies of load components also poses a challenge to representing the actuation frequency of loads indeed fowts react to small variations of turbine loads at inconvenient frequencies i e natural frequencies if actuators can t deliver these variations then the test may overlook possible resonant responses for example it is known that the variations of thrust have a major impact on the total damping of the system jonkman 2008 this effect was found to deteriorate the damping of a spar fowt when a standard onshore controller was used skaare et al 2007 if the objective of the model test is to observe and study the variations of thrust then the variations of this load component need to be accurately represented with the actuators for hybrid testing finding actuators able to account for small load variations over a broad enough frequency range is a possible bottleneck the test set up can also lead to unexpected effects due to the limitations in the response time of the actuators the load calculated by the software is a requested target that in some cases may not be realized when the contributions of all actuators are summed up differences between target and realized loads is inherent to all controlled systems in early hybrid tests bachynski et al 2016 surge and pitch decay tests as well as a few regular wave tests were used to characterize how well hybrid set ups performed one verification approach the zero load test involves comparing results from a first test where no loads are delivered with a second test that actively delivers the calculated loads the zero load test also called test in following mode is a credible indicator of the capacity of the set up to control the loads that it can deliver to the fowt to date zero load checks have provided better results for surge decays than for pitch decays these observations imply that the hybrid systems of these tests had a non desired influence on the motion of the fowt and that this interference varies with the frequency of the wind turbine motion this information has been accounted for in the verification program of more recent hybrid testing campaigns thys et al 2018 luan et al 2017 where tests in following mode were carried out in irregular wave e g in broad wave spectrum like pink noise waves a distinction can be made between different types of actuators namely fans or cables as each have distinct issues a fan can truly be set inactive by turning it off whereas a cable is to some extent always active as long as it is connected to the structure based on the scarce literature on hybrid testing using a fan the main bottle neck in such systems appears to be reaction speed a fan generally requires a longer time to reach the requested load level than a cable put into action with a winch this delay shown in azcona et al 2014 provides a limit to the frequency of the variation of loads that a fan can deliver a fan system may act as a low pass filter considering that the wind excitations are dominantly at low frequencies this may not pose an issue to the study of the interaction between low frequency platform motions with the wind turbine loads for spar type e g utsunomiya et al 2009 and semi type foundations however such a system may struggle to represent variations of higher frequencies like the ones related to wave motions another limitation within hybrid systems that is unique to each set up is that two ways interactions between the turbine and the floating foundation is only represented up to a given threshold a recent publication on a system using multi fans presented fast rates of change for the thrust meseguer and guanche 2019 azcona described in azcona et al 2014 a system of cener which uses a ducted fan for the actuations of the loads fig 8 sauder gave a detailed description of the method developed by sintef ocean sauder et al 2016 which uses cables for the actuation of the wind turbine loads fig 9 see also the most recent developments by marin fig 13 gueydon and bayati 2020 and cener fig 14 8 optimum usage of combined wind wave tests for floating wind both the full approach and the simplified approach rely on the same understanding of what is causing the floating foundation and the rotor to interact a large part of the challenge is that the aerodynamics and the hydrodynamics are strongly coupled for fowts in summary the thrust of a wind turbine varies under the actions of the wind turbine controller which reacts to the apparent wind velocities while inversely the motion of the floating turbine is influenced by the thrust despite the fact that the two approaches described in this article use distinct ways to represent the wind turbine loads these approaches have many similarities in both cases the wind turbine loads that are effectively transferred to the floater constitute the central element of the aero hydro coupling it therefore makes sense to measure these loads when testing using both approaches in term of the dynamic response of a fowt the variation of these loads is most interesting although the variation of the thrust may often be considered small relative to the variation of the wave loads for fowts with hawt e g semisubmersible with large displacement these variations may coincide with slow natural periods of the system and can result in appreciable motions for moored structures under these circumstances the accuracy of the representation of the wind turbine loads influences the response of fowts the resonance response of a floating structure can be sensitive to small perturbations whether these perturbations are physical and desired or undesired in both model testing approaches the acts of measuring and actuating may have undesired effects on the fowt the presence of instruments such as a model scale rna with hanging measurement and power cables robertson et al 2013 or the presence of actuators such as a system of tensioned cables gueydon et al 2018 may alter the motions of the fowt it is therefore imperative to document the model test set up in great detail and to use caution when interpreting results it is extremely challenging to manufacture a physical rotor that is robust precise and light enough to comply with a realistic weight distribution of an actual full scale turbine as a consequence a physical model of a fowt with a scale rotor often exhibits bigger roll and pitch inertia moments than desirable in this instance the deviation from design inertia of the prototype clearly requires a correction that can best be done separately in a numerical study gueydon 2016 at the risk of stating the obvious it must be emphasized that model test results are always the reflection of what was done in the basin for example the persistent underestimation of low frequency motions of a semisubmersible fowt in waves in the findings of the iea wind task oc5 study 10 shows that decisions made on the sole basis of simulations may be hazardous therefore a two step numerical process is recommended to complement results from modeltests 8 1 step 1 numerical model of the model first a software validation study consisting of a numerical study of the model as it was represented in the basin with the greatest possible level of details is recommended the numerical model of the model gueydon 2016 the primary goal of this first step is to prove that the simulation code properly accounts for the coupled aero hydro effects as they were represented in the model tests a secondary goal of this numerical check could be to investigate possible consequences of alterations of the motions inherent to the test set up e g effects of cables effects of excluding dof or load components many simulation tools that are capable of including as many components as the user is ready to model are available for the full approach this would consist of numerical simulations of the fowt with the model scale wind turbine and wind measurements for the simplified approach this would consist of numerical simulations of the fowt with the system that was used to emulate the wind turbine loads depending on the functionality of the tool these simulations would include the actuators and their control system or at least documented limitations of the system e g the same load components as during the tests for the hybrid system this is a similar study to that which was needed to support the design of the test set up bachynski et al 2015 8 2 step 2 numerical model of the prototype second it is recommended that the validated tool from step 1 is used to simulate the design fowt without any appendages from the test set up the numerical model of the prototype note that some adaptations to the numerical model used for the design study will be required to account for the up scaling of quantities that by nature don t comply with froude scaling i e damping coefficients and viscous drag will be different at full scale than at basin scale more advanced models e g rans can be particularly useful for this extrapolation from model scale to full scale burmester et al 2018 at this stage such a numerical study will capture many more load cases than what was tested in the basin for hybrid testing a large part of the input data for the turbine will be simply brought over from the first step whereas for the full approach these data will be different between steps one and two table 6 summarizes how numerical studies and model tests can complement each other in the design process of fowts 8 3 complementary hybrid testing another complementary application of the hybrid approach has been recently developed in an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel bayati et al 2018 where the relevant physics to be investigated was the aero servo aerodynamics of the wind turbine interacting with the motion of the floater similar to hybrid testing in an ocean basin where the main focus and reliability is on the hydrodynamics and the mooring system wind tunnel hybrid tests can be used to provide more accurate results for the loads and control of the wind turbine itself an advantage of using both hybrid approaches is that they each investigate the same problem from two different perspectives and can be used to optimize the design and study of the many components of fowts for example different control strategies or rotor blade aerodynamics for a given physical floating system can be explored in the basin while different hydrodynamic design and mooring system configurations for a given physical wind turbine can be explored in the wind tunnel hybrid testing of the same fowt in a wave basin and in a wind tunnel was carried out in the project life50 bayati et al 2018 thys et al 2019 9 combining approaches the full approach and hybrid testing are extremely complementary and reinforce each others value testing with a physical turbine provides data which can be used to validate coupled aero hydro software such a validation increases confidence in the ability of a numerical tool to deal with the conditions experienced by fowt which justifies its use as sil for hybrid testing the potential collaboration between these three techniques has not yet been fully explored fig 10 so far only a few comparisons between these different approaches can be found in the literature the authors are only aware of three projects where tests of the same model have been done with a physical turbine and with a hybrid set up as part of innwind stuttgart university tested a 10 mw semisubmersible fowt with a physical rotor and repeated some of these tests with a ducted fan hybrid testing solution of cener fig 8 in the same basin given the fact that these two campaigns did not use precisely the same floater or the same reference turbine the pertinence of a comparison is reduced as a result two distinct papers were published on the tests with the physical turbine borisade et al 2018 and the tests with the ducted fan azcona et al 2014 and no comparisons were shared in the literature the university of maine and the university of prince edward island tested the deepcwind oc4 semisubmersible with a 1 50 geometrically scaled version of the 5 mw nrel turbine the same scale turbine as used during the deepcwind model tests fowler et al 2013 and then repeated these tests with a 1 dof hybrid set up system this hybrid system was made of two cables pulling on the nacelle in opposite directions and therefore could only account for the thrust in this work the floater was identical for both approaches surge resonant response appeared to be equivalent in both approaches whereas the pitch resonant response was significantly different hall and goupee 2018 fig 11 for the rest the results obtained with these two methods agreed quite well with an overall deviation of 7 in standard deviation of pitch marin compared two methods to test a tlp fowt in combined waves and wind gueydon et al 2018 tests with a performance scaled rotor representing a 5 mw turbine at full scale were reproduced using a hybrid set up composed of five controlled tensioned cables fig 12 this hybrid set up accounted for the thrust and the pitch aerodynamic moment on the rotor in this campaign both the floater and the rotor characteristics were equivalent for the two approaches a good match over a broad range of frequencies was achieved in the comparison of the motion response of the tlp nevertheless small disparities in the phase of the pitch response were observed for a bandwidth of short wave excitations period 8 s which would significantly alter the tendon tensions during the tests with the hybrid set up marinet2 has planned a round robin campaign with a semisubmersible fowt in this new project the same floater will be tested in four different facilities with several ways of emulating the wind turbine fig 15 this project is running until 2021 last but not least several large and full scale prototypes have been monitored in real wave wind and current conditions all these prototypes underwent laboratory tests as part of their design process too even without sharing any real data it would be rewarding for researchers working on improving testing methodology for fowts to hear how these early developers look back at the tests that they have done and how they would approach new tests however for the time being this feedback is very limited matha et al 2016 10 conclusions significant progress in model testing of fowts in hydrodynamic basins under combined wind and waves have been made in the last decade today the state of the art enables testers to accounts for the main interactions between the wind turbine and the motions of the floating foundation and experiments including the wind turbine controller can be made despite significant achievements to date proven by multiple reports of successful implementations of testing techniques a number of unknowns and uncertainties remain in regards to the diversity of floating wind concepts that are envisaged to further reduce the lcoe of floating wind it is necessary to accumulate much more evidence on the validity and the limitations of testing methods based on the literature review done for this paper the authors believe that the limitations of turbine emulation techniques in a basin are not yet sufficiently known or remain undocumented the authors strongly recommend that hydrodynamic testing facilities engage with more critical comparisons of results obtained from all available fowt testing techniques namely modelling of physical turbines in basins as well as hybrid testing in basins and wind tunnels the complete characterization of the hardware limitations of the hybrid testing set up is strongly recommended to know which effects could be masked by these limitations lastly the feedback from early developers of prototypes is also essential to guide further development of model testing techniques 11 acknowledgments s gueydon acknowledges very interesting discussions during the floating wind turbine coupled analysis jip of dnvgl which has

21804,deep draft semi submersible platforms may present significant second order resonant motions in severe sea states evaluating the slow drift motions of such floating systems is important from the initial stages of their designs considering not only the offset requirement and mooring line load but also the air gap responses beneath the lower deck theories and corresponding applications for these second order resonant motions have been investigated for decades but the problem has not been solved completely considering the requirements of a model that is sufficiently accurate and expedient in this study high quality numerical simulations and model tests were conducted numerical calculations were carried out with the applications of full quadratic transfer function qtf matrices by means of commercial boundary element method bem code comparisons show perfect agreement between the wave frequency components obtained from both the model tests and the numerical calculations furthermore the results also indicate that the second order resonant motions can be to some extent estimated numerically by the second order potential theory and that deviations can still be observed compared with those motions obtained by the model tests keywords semi submersible full qtf slow drift motions nomenclature φ 1 first order velocity potential m2 s φ 2 second order velocity potential

considered and developed for floating production yilmaz and incecik 1996 and floating offshore wind turbines fowts simos et al 2018 exposed to severe sea conditions the natural periods of the motions in some degrees of freedom dofs are designed to be quite large to avoid resonance in energetic parts of the wave spectra typical natural periods of such deep draft semi submersibles can be 100 200 s in surge and sway 40 60 s in roll and pitch and approximately 20 s in heave therefore the first order motions excited by waves can be moderate and lie in the wave frequency range the large low frequency lf slow drift motions caused by nonlinear hydrodynamic forces can then play a significant role in motions with large natural periods compared with the main wave excitation force these second order forces are much smaller however large second order slow drift motions can be easily excited at low frequencies as there is little damping at low frequencies this phenomenon has been well known for ships and other floating structures for many decades and has recently attracted much attention in the context of fowts bayati et al 2014 lupton 2017 simos et al 2018 moreover significant lf components have been found in the roll and pitch motions of semi submersibles in irregular seas which may lead to non gaussian responses matos et al 2011b xiao et al 2009 these lf components in the pitch and roll directions can also contribute to nonlinearities in the air gap response dallinga et al 1988 pinkster 1979 the components are believed to be excited by the second order wave drift moments current and wind loads and surge pitch coupling from mooring lines and risers stansberg 2007 the linear motion response assumption seems invalid for a severe sea state when applied in hull and mooring line design stansberg et al 1998 the second order resonant motion responses should definitely be considered at the design stage the nonlinear wave diffraction problem up to second order has been investigated for decades reviews of the theoretical development for the second order wave force were provided by kim and yue 1989 1990 the formulation to calculate second order slow drift hydrodynamic loads was proposed by pinkster 1980 and can be written as follows 1 f 2 t s b ρ φ 2 t n 0 d s w l 1 2 ρ g ζ r 1 2 n 0 d l s b 1 2 ρ φ 1 φ 1 n 0 d s s b ρ x 1 φ 1 t n 0 d s m r 1 x 1 where φ 1 and φ 2 refer to the first and second order velocity potentials respectively and ρ and g are the fluid density and the acceleration of gravity respectively ζ r 1 indicates the wave elevation relative to the body axes along the body s waterline and x 1 and x 1 represent the first order body translation motions and their accelerations respectively wl refers to waterline the vector n represents the normal vector of the mean body surface s b while r 1 is the linearized rotation matrix corresponding to the angular motions it is clear from eq 1 that the slow drift hydrodynamic force is contributed by both the first and the second order potentials therefore both the first and the second order potentials should be calculated by the radiation diffraction theory solving the second order problem is regarded to be much more time consuming as not only the wet body surface but also the free surface needs to be solved moreover the contributions from the first order problem should be carefully calculated since the hydrodynamic force of the floater and the restoring force of the mooring lines are closely associated with the damping which should be given due attention in addition the slow drift force can be expressed by the sum of the pairs of sinusoidal wave components with frequencies of ω i and ω j 2 f k 2 t re i j a i a j q k ω i ω j exp i ω i ω j t θ i θ j where k represents the degrees of freedom a i and a j represent the wave amplitude and θ i and θ j are the corresponding phases q k ω i ω j is regarded as the quadratic transfer function qtf which is complex to represent the phase shift from the incident waves considering that calculation of the full qtf is quite time consuming several simplifications have been introduced to reduce the workload of the qtf computation or to propose approximations in force spectrum calculations matos et al 2011a among the approximations for the qtf calculations an approximation known as newman s approximation newman 1974 is used most frequently 3 q k ω i ω j 1 2 q k ω i ω i q k ω j ω j however the applications of newman s approximation for computing the slow drift motions in the vertical plane seem to be unaccommodating as the natural frequencies of the heave roll and pitch motions are not low enough to minimize the error aranha and fernandes 1995 numerical estimations of the motion responses for such floating systems are normally based on numerical potential solvers such as wamit by which both linear and second order problems can be considered however in addition to the basic theory of hydrodynamic calculations precise numerical estimation of the motion responses for the floating structures can still be a difficult task compared with the case of model tests aspects such as the higher order effects aksnes 2014 aksnes et al 2015 viscous hull damping and mooring line damping stansberg 2007 may influence the motion responses especially the responses to slow drift motions in this study we focus on the second order resonant motion responses of a deep draft semi submersible platform in a severe and random sea for this purpose model tests were performed in the deepwater ocean basin of shanghai jiao tong university irregular waves representative of a 100 yr and 1000 yr cyclone were used as the incident wave field the numerical calculations were carried out with the incident waves recorded from the wave calibration tests the corresponding results for evaluating the slow drift motions were considered and tested against the experimental measurements with a scale 1 60 model the details are discussed in section 3 following a description of the experimental setup in section 2 conclusions summarized through the model tests and numerical calculations are given in section 4 2 experimental setup to investigate the slow drift motion responses under irregular wave excitations a series of model tests was conducted for a semi submersible platform with deep draft in the deepwater wave basin at shanghai jiao tong university the tests were run at a model scale of 1 60 in a large wave basin with a size of 50 0 m in length 40 0 m in width and 10 0 m in maximum effective depth 2 1 model description a multi column structure typical of a semi submersible platform is used in this study at the prototype scale the main dimension of the semi submersible is 91 5 m in width with four columns each of which is 21 m in width and the pontoon height is 9 m presented in table 1 the design draft is 37 m from the keel resulting in an initial air gap distance between the calm water surface and the deck also called the freeboard of 22 m a schematic view of the structure is illustrated in fig 1 the model was fabricated with geometric error within 1 of the target value prior to the tests the inertia parameters e g the centre of gravity cog roll and pitch radius gyration were adjusted to have an error of less than 2 against the target value the mass properties of the semi submersible and the measured values after mass adjustment are presented in table 2 2 2 mooring in the test the semi submersible hull was moored through four taut mooring lines with each passing through the column corners while the other end of each mooring line was attached to a foundation point on the basin floor as shown in fig 2 each line consisted of a platform chain polyester rope and pile chain with the specified properties summarized in table 3 and table 4 the mooring line models were fabricated by using small steel chains and wire ropes with the specified properties the axial stiffness was achieved through springs additional lead weight elements were evenly distributed along the mooring line models to match the specified mass in water note that the mooring line configuration is not symmetric due to the variability of the bathymetry and the directionality of the wave and wind spectra 2 3 wave generation undisturbed irregular wave fields were generated based on the jonswap spectra with different significant wave heights spectral peak periods and spectral factors considering the survival capability in severe sea state and the sensitivity to the wave periods six wave conditions were applied in this study as presented in table 5 fig 3 shows an example of the time history of the generated irregular waves measured at the model position for the 100 yr cyclone normal tp the corresponding spectrum is then compared with the theoretical spectrum in fig 4 a another comparison of spectra is shown in fig 4 b for the 1000 yr cyclone normal tp all the spectra of irregular waves in this study show very good agreement 2 4 data acquisition the 6 dof platform motions can be captured by means of optical devices and the tensions on the mooring lines can be measured through conventional load cells during the wave tests the data acquisition system starts collecting the required data signals after the model motions reach a steady state to avoid transient effects the irregular wave was generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase corresponded to 23 24 min at laboratory scale corresponding to 3 h at full scale all data signals were collected at a sampling frequency of 60 hz in the laboratory 3 results and discussion 3 1 static test results prior to the irregular wave tests decay and offset tests were carried out to check the experimental setup by analysing the natural frequency of each dof the damping coefficients and the stiffness of the mooring system for the slow drift motions of a moored floater the viscous damping which can be obtained in still water decay tests should be taken into consideration the natural frequencies of the surge heave and pitch motions are measured to be 0 033 rad s 0 272 rad s and 0 140 rad s respectively with damping coefficients of 3 6 3 1 and 3 4 the mooring lines should be manufactured as designed so that the whole floating system can respond precisely under the wave excitations and the numerical model can be validated by the model tests as shown in fig 5 the curve of the restoring force and single line forces versus the horizontal offset of the overall mooring system was recorded and compared with the calculated curves the mooring system has a nearly linear stiffness within the offset range in the tests good agreement is observed in the comparison which can sufficiently validate the mooring line fabrication 3 2 experiment based slow drift motions the same wave paddle signs as in section 2 3 were regenerated with the model in place to investigate the slow drift motions of the deep draft semi submersible regarding the wave conditions the 100 yr cyclone wave in the south china sea considered in this section is first represented by the spectrum of case 2 shown in table 5 as only bow wave conditions were implemented the results comprise only the surge heave and pitch motions shown in figs 6 8 only the time histories from 5000 s to 7500 s are demonstrated in the figures a digital filter was used to decompose the lf ω 0 2 r a d s and wave frequency ω 0 2 r a d s components of the motion responses large slow drift motions are observed from the surge and pitch motions while those associated with the heave motion are relatively small compared with the wave frequency components of the surge motion the corresponding slow drift components are much larger in contrast the lf components of the heave motion are relatively small and may be neglected the large slow drift motions are observed in the pitch direction as well similar to the case of the wave frequency components 3 3 response spectra and statistics in irregular wave tests the motion spectra were then obtained from the time histories measured in the model tests as shown in fig 9 the spectra of the incident waves were plotted on different scales for comparison for the surge and pitch motions obvious slow drift components can be found while no such lf motion appears in the heave direction it is clear from the figures that the slow drift motions for the surge and pitch motions become much more pronounced at their corresponding natural frequencies of approximately 0 033 rad s and 0 140 rad s respectively a similar peak of the motion responses is also reflected in the heave spectrum where a protuberance appears at a frequency of approximately 0 272 rad s moreover 100 yr and 1000 yr typhoon wave conditions with varying t p were applied to investigate the motion responses sensitivity with t p under severe sea conditions the response spectra of the surge heave and pitch motions under the irregular incident waves were shown in fig 10 it is clear from the figures that the slow drift dynamics of the surge and pitch motions become more pronounced as the t p decreases or the h s increases this result is expected because the steepness of the incident waves becomes stronger with decreasing t p or increasing h s the spectra of the wave frequency responses are closely related to the peak period and the first order transfer function therefore the wave frequency spectra for the surge motion show a growing trend with the decreasing peak period as the transfer function for surge motion shown in fig 12 a monotonically decreases with increasing frequency in the frequency range of the incident waves the shapes of the transfer function for heave and pitch motions are much more complex and no such obvious trends appear in the spectra to further investigate the effects of the incident waves on the second order slow drift motion responses it could be more objective to compare the characteristic amplitudes associated with the second order response spectra in this section we employ the mean amplitudes of the second order surge and pitch motions computed as 4 a w l 2 0 ω l w s 2 ω d ω where s 2 ω represents the spectra of the second order slow drift motions for the corresponding motion fig 11 presents the mean amplitudes of second order motions normalized by the variation in the incident waves against the peak periods the results clearly illustrate that the slow drift responses tend to increase as the peak period decreases the slow drift responses are found to be positively correlated to the wave heights of the incident waves which can be to some extent confirmed by the formula of the second order force shown in eq 2 moreover sea conditions with short t p show a remarkable enhancement on the slow drift surge and pitch motions these may lead to the unexpected extreme mooring tensions for the steep wave conditions steeper wave may also cause the more violent run up airgap responses which should be taken into account in engineering practice for such a deep draft semi submersible platform the appearance of severe second order slow drift motions leads to challenges for mooring lines risers and air gap responses in practice reliable numerical methods are therefore needed to predict the hydrodynamic performance of such floating structures precisely in the design phase 3 4 numerical investigation in this study the commercial software ansys aqwa was applied to solve the frequency domain and time domain problems the full qtf was calculated numerically using a second order potential solver so that all hydrodynamic external couplings could be considered the second order slow drift force could then be obtained as all the external forces from the wave excitation mooring lines and slow drift force were estimated numerically the motion responses of the platform could be calculated accordingly based on the linear dynamic motion equation faltinsen 1993 first we conducted a numerical simulation under the excitation of the white noise wave to calculate the response amplitude operators raos of the platform and to compare them with those obtained by a frequency domain calculation and the model test under irregular waves shown in fig 12 the raos of the surge heave and pitch motions obtained from the model test are plotted only in the frequency range 0 25 rad s ω 1 5 rad s in keeping with the spectral range of the incident waves shown in fig 4 as expected the peaks observed in the raos of the heave and pitch motions appear at their natural frequencies at the wave frequency range the raos for heave motions obtained by all three methods coincide well with each other the raos for surge and pitch motions estimated by time domain analysis agree well with those from the model test while discrepancies are found in comparison to those predicted by frequency analysis the shapes of the rao curves for the surge and pitch motions are similar to those predicted by frequency domain calculation and those obtained by the other two approaches the frequency shifts appear at the second peaks at approximately 0 8 rad s and 0 5 rad s for which the mooring lines prominently affect the natural frequencies of the whole floating system moreover simulations of motion responses were calculated considering the time series recorded from the wave probe in the wave calibration tests as the incident waves instead of applying a random wave train based on the specific joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum shown in table 5 by following this procedure the incident wave spectra and the random phases of the wave trains employed in the model tests and numerical simulations can be made consistent with each other the discrepancies in the inputs between the model tests and numerical simulations thus remain low the surge heave and pitch motions computed by the full qtf for case 2 are illustrated in fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 respectively the wave frequency components were extracted with the application of the digital filter at ω 0 2 rad s it is clear from fig 13 b fig 14 b and fig 15 b that the wave frequency components of the surge heave and pitch motions predicted numerically show good agreement with those predicted by the model tests moreover the heave motion is very similar to its wave frequency components which coincides with the findings in fig 7 a as shown in fig 13 a the surge motion estimated numerically agrees relatively well with that measured by the model tests although some small discrepancies can be observed in contrast the agreement for the pitch motion obtained by numerical simulation and model tests is not as good as expected due to the discrepancies in the lf slow drift motion shown in fig 15 we are ultimately interested in the resonant motions of such deep draft semi submersible motions that are induced by lf second order load under severe irregular wave conditions to evaluate the statistics of resonant motions in random seas the peak to peak distributions of the surge heave and pitch motions were investigated as shown in fig 16 the distributions are compared with their corresponding rayleigh distributions which can be estimated by 5 e r a y l ξ h exp h 2 8 m 0 where m 0 represents the spectral moment of the motions 6 m 0 0 s ω d ω deviations from the rayleigh distribution are observed for the surge and pitch motion responses showing that their dynamic processes are non gaussian due to the second order resonant responses the distribution of the heave motion coincides well with the corresponding rayleigh distribution because the first order wave frequency components dominate the heave response the distributions of the surge heave and pitch motions obtained by numerical calculation and model tests are compared in fig 16 deviations for both the surge and the pitch motions are found while the distribution for the pitch motion shows larger differences in the area of the extreme responses probability of exceedance 10 2 due to the importance of predicting the slow drift pitch motion in industrial practice such as the operation requirement and the air gap estimation one should carefully pay attention to the differences that appear in the distribution of the pitch motion comparisons of the response spectra between the experiment and numerical simulation are presented in fig 17 the wave frequency motions agree well with each other as discussed previously while the slow drift responses for the surge and pitch motions are underestimated by numerical approach note that the dynamic behaviour of the lf slow drift motions is known to be closely related to the characteristics of the mooring lines it is not easy to perfectly simulate all the properties of the mooring lines such as the diameters of every segment and the shape of the chains which are associated with the dynamic response moreover the damping of the mooring lines varies throughout the lines while it is regarded as constant in the numerical simulations in addition the effects caused by the higher order nonlinear interactions may also play a role these aspects are neglected by the second order potential flow approach resulting in underestimation of the slow drift motions based on potential flow drift forces 4 conclusions a series of model tests and numerical estimations in irregular waves were conducted to investigate the second order slow drift motions of a deep draft semi submersible platform numerical modelling was carried out with commercial frequency domain and time domain solvers and the corresponding results for evaluating the slow drift motions were considered and tested against the experimental measurements with a scale 1 60 model based on the results obtained in this work the following conclusions can be remarked experimental results show that extremely large slow drift surge motions occur under severe irregular waves which is regarded as an important feature for the design of mooring lines and risers for a floating platform and has been considered in the oil and gas industry for decades the second order resonant pitch motions are found to be prominent compared with the first order wave frequency motions which could have a significant influence on the evaluations of the air gap responses dnvgl 2017 therefore when considering the hydrodynamic responses for a floating structure of the type applied in this study newman s approximation seems to be inappropriate for estimating the second order pitch motions the results of the slow drift motions obtained by experiments and numerical estimations reveal that the wave frequency motions calculated numerically exhibit good agreement with those from the model tests however although these aspects are to some extent well studied in traditional floating offshore structures deviations of the slow drift motions estimated using the full qtf matrix can still be observed compared with those obtained by the experiments credit authorship contribution statement da li writing original draft wenyue lu methodology writing review editing xin li conceptualization

21804,deep draft semi submersible platforms may present significant second order resonant motions in severe sea states evaluating the slow drift motions of such floating systems is important from the initial stages of their designs considering not only the offset requirement and mooring line load but also the air gap responses beneath the lower deck theories and corresponding applications for these second order resonant motions have been investigated for decades but the problem has not been solved completely considering the requirements of a model that is sufficiently accurate and expedient in this study high quality numerical simulations and model tests were conducted numerical calculations were carried out with the applications of full quadratic transfer function qtf matrices by means of commercial boundary element method bem code comparisons show perfect agreement between the wave frequency components obtained from both the model tests and the numerical calculations furthermore the results also indicate that the second order resonant motions can be to some extent estimated numerically by the second order potential theory and that deviations can still be observed

considered and developed for floating production yilmaz and incecik 1996 and floating offshore wind turbines fowts simos et al 2018 exposed to severe sea conditions the natural periods of the motions in some degrees of freedom dofs are designed to be quite large to avoid resonance in energetic parts of the wave spectra typical natural periods of such deep draft semi submersibles can be 100 200 s in surge and sway 40 60 s in roll and pitch and approximately 20 s in heave therefore the first order motions excited by waves can be moderate and lie in the wave frequency range the large low frequency lf slow drift motions caused by nonlinear hydrodynamic forces can then play a significant role in motions with large natural periods compared with the main wave excitation force these second order forces are much smaller however large second order slow drift motions can be easily excited at low frequencies as there is little damping at low frequencies this phenomenon has been well known for ships and other floating structures for many decades and has recently attracted much attention in the context of fowts bayati et al 2014 lupton 2017 simos et al 2018 moreover significant lf components have been found in the roll and pitch motions of semi submersibles in irregular seas which may lead to non gaussian responses matos et al 2011b xiao et al 2009 these lf components in the pitch and roll directions can also contribute to nonlinearities in the air gap response dallinga et al 1988 pinkster 1979 the components are believed to be excited by the second order wave drift moments current and wind loads and surge pitch coupling from mooring lines and risers stansberg 2007 the linear motion response assumption seems invalid for a severe sea state when applied in hull and mooring line design stansberg et al 1998 the second order resonant motion responses should definitely be considered at the design stage the nonlinear wave diffraction problem up to second order has been investigated for decades reviews of the theoretical development for the second order wave force were provided by kim and yue 1989 1990 the formulation to calculate second order slow drift hydrodynamic loads was proposed by pinkster 1980 and can be written as follows 1 f 2 t s b ρ φ 2 t n 0 d s w l 1 2 ρ g ζ r 1 2 n 0 d l s b 1 2 ρ φ 1 φ 1 n 0 d s s b ρ x 1 φ 1 t n 0 d s m r 1 x 1 where φ 1 and φ 2 refer to the first and second order velocity potentials respectively and ρ and g are the fluid density and the acceleration of gravity respectively ζ r 1 indicates the wave elevation relative to the body axes along the body s waterline and x 1 and x 1 represent the first order body translation motions and their accelerations respectively wl refers to waterline the vector n represents the normal vector of the mean body surface s b while r 1 is the linearized rotation matrix corresponding to the angular motions it is clear from eq 1 that the slow drift hydrodynamic force is contributed by both the first and the second order potentials therefore both the first and the second order potentials should be calculated by the radiation diffraction theory solving the second order problem is regarded to be much more time consuming as not only the wet body surface but also the free surface needs to be solved moreover the contributions from the first order problem should be carefully calculated since the hydrodynamic force of the floater and the restoring force of the mooring lines are closely associated with the damping which should be given due attention in addition the slow drift force can be expressed by the sum of the pairs of sinusoidal wave components with frequencies of ω i and ω j 2 f k 2 t re i j a i a j q k ω i ω j exp i ω i ω j t θ i θ j where k represents the degrees of freedom a i and a j represent the wave amplitude and θ i and θ j are the corresponding phases q k ω i ω j is regarded as the quadratic transfer function qtf which is complex to represent the phase shift from the incident waves considering that calculation of the full qtf is quite time consuming several simplifications have been introduced to reduce the workload of the qtf computation or to propose approximations in force spectrum calculations matos et al 2011a among the approximations for the qtf calculations an approximation known as newman s approximation newman 1974 is used most frequently 3 q k ω i ω j 1 2 q k ω i ω i q k ω j ω j however the applications of newman s approximation for computing the slow drift motions in the vertical plane seem to be unaccommodating as the natural frequencies of the heave roll and pitch motions are not low enough to minimize the error aranha and fernandes 1995 numerical estimations of the motion responses for such floating systems are normally based on numerical potential solvers such as wamit by which both linear and second order problems can be considered however in addition to the basic theory of hydrodynamic calculations precise numerical estimation of the motion responses for the floating structures can still be a difficult task compared with the case of model tests aspects such as the higher order effects aksnes 2014 aksnes et al 2015 viscous hull damping and mooring line damping stansberg 2007 may influence the motion responses especially the responses to slow drift motions in this study we focus on the second order resonant motion responses of a deep draft semi submersible platform in a severe and random sea for this purpose model tests were performed in the deepwater ocean basin of shanghai jiao tong university irregular waves representative of a 100 yr and 1000 yr cyclone were used as the incident wave field the numerical calculations were carried out with the incident waves recorded from the wave calibration tests the corresponding results for evaluating the slow drift motions were considered and tested against the experimental measurements with a scale 1 60 model the details are discussed in section 3 following a description of the experimental setup in section 2 conclusions summarized through the model tests and numerical calculations are given in section 4 2 experimental setup to investigate the slow drift motion responses under irregular wave excitations a series of model tests was conducted for a semi submersible platform with deep draft in the deepwater wave basin at shanghai jiao tong university the tests were run at a model scale of 1 60 in a large wave basin with a size of 50 0 m in length 40 0 m in width and 10 0 m in maximum effective depth 2 1 model description a multi column structure typical of a semi submersible platform is used in this study at the prototype scale the main dimension of the semi submersible is 91 5 m in width with four columns each of which is 21 m in width and the pontoon height is 9 m presented in table 1 the design draft is 37 m from the keel resulting in an initial air gap distance between the calm water surface and the deck also called the freeboard of 22 m a schematic view of the structure is illustrated in fig 1 the model was fabricated with geometric error within 1 of the target value prior to the tests the inertia parameters e g the centre of gravity cog roll and pitch radius gyration were adjusted to have an error of less than 2 against the target value the mass properties of the semi submersible and the measured values after mass adjustment are presented in table 2 2 2 mooring in the test the semi submersible hull was moored through four taut mooring lines with each passing through the column corners while the other end of each mooring line was attached to a foundation point on the basin floor as shown in fig 2 each line consisted of a platform chain polyester rope and pile chain with the specified properties summarized in table 3 and table 4 the mooring line models were fabricated by using small steel chains and wire ropes with the specified properties the axial stiffness was achieved through springs additional lead weight elements were evenly distributed along the mooring line models to match the specified mass in water note that the mooring line configuration is not symmetric due to the variability of the bathymetry and the directionality of the wave and wind spectra 2 3 wave generation undisturbed irregular wave fields were generated based on the jonswap spectra with different significant wave heights spectral peak periods and spectral factors considering the survival capability in severe sea state and the sensitivity to the wave periods six wave conditions were applied in this study as presented in table 5 fig 3 shows an example of the time history of the generated irregular waves measured at the model position for the 100 yr cyclone normal tp the corresponding spectrum is then compared with the theoretical spectrum in fig 4 a another comparison of spectra is shown in fig 4 b for the 1000 yr cyclone normal tp all the spectra of irregular waves in this study show very good agreement 2 4 data acquisition the 6 dof platform motions can be captured by means of optical devices and the tensions on the mooring lines can be measured through conventional load cells during the wave tests the data acquisition system starts collecting the required data signals after the model motions reach a steady state to avoid transient effects the irregular wave was generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase corresponded to 23 24 min at laboratory scale corresponding to 3 h at full scale all data signals were collected at a sampling frequency of 60 hz in the laboratory 3 results and discussion 3 1 static test results prior to the irregular wave tests decay and offset tests were carried out to check the experimental setup by analysing the natural frequency of each dof the damping coefficients and the stiffness of the mooring system for the slow drift motions of a moored floater the viscous damping which can be obtained in still water decay tests should be taken into consideration the natural frequencies of the surge heave and pitch motions are measured to be 0 033 rad s 0 272 rad s and 0 140 rad s respectively with damping coefficients of 3 6 3 1 and 3 4 the mooring lines should be manufactured as designed so that the whole floating system can respond precisely under the wave excitations and the numerical model can be validated by the model tests as shown in fig 5 the curve of the restoring force and single line forces versus the horizontal offset of the overall mooring system was recorded and compared with the calculated curves the mooring system has a nearly linear stiffness within the offset range in the tests good agreement is observed in the comparison which can sufficiently validate the mooring line fabrication 3 2 experiment based slow drift motions the same wave paddle signs as in section 2 3 were regenerated with the model in place to investigate the slow drift motions of the deep draft semi submersible regarding the wave conditions the 100 yr cyclone wave in the south china sea considered in this section is first represented by the spectrum of case 2 shown in table 5 as only bow wave conditions were implemented the results comprise only the surge heave and pitch motions shown in figs 6 8 only the time histories from 5000 s to 7500 s are demonstrated in the figures a digital filter was used to decompose the lf ω 0 2 r a d s and wave frequency ω 0 2 r a d s components of the motion responses large slow drift motions are observed from the surge and pitch motions while those associated with the heave motion are relatively small compared with the wave frequency components of the surge motion the corresponding slow drift components are much larger in contrast the lf components of the heave motion are relatively small and may be neglected the large slow drift motions are observed in the pitch direction as well similar to the case of the wave frequency components 3 3 response spectra and statistics in irregular wave tests the motion spectra were then obtained from the time histories measured in the model tests as shown in fig 9 the spectra of the incident waves were plotted on different scales for comparison for the surge and pitch motions obvious slow drift components can be found while no such lf motion appears in the heave direction it is clear from the figures that the slow drift motions for the surge and pitch motions become much more pronounced at their corresponding natural frequencies of approximately 0 033 rad s and 0 140 rad s respectively a similar peak of the motion responses is also reflected in the heave spectrum where a protuberance appears at a frequency of approximately 0 272 rad s moreover 100 yr and 1000 yr typhoon wave conditions with varying t p were applied to investigate the motion responses sensitivity with t p under severe sea conditions the response spectra of the surge heave and pitch motions under the irregular incident waves were shown in fig 10 it is clear from the figures that the slow drift dynamics of the surge and pitch motions become more pronounced as the t p decreases or the h s increases this result is expected because the steepness of the incident waves becomes stronger with decreasing t p or increasing h s the spectra of the wave frequency responses are closely related to the peak period and the first order transfer function therefore the wave frequency spectra for the surge motion show a growing trend with the decreasing peak period as the transfer function for surge motion shown in fig 12 a monotonically decreases with increasing frequency in the frequency range of the incident waves the shapes of the transfer function for heave and pitch motions are much more complex and no such obvious trends appear in the spectra to further investigate the effects of the incident waves on the second order slow drift motion responses it could be more objective to compare the characteristic amplitudes associated with the second order response spectra in this section we employ the mean amplitudes of the second order surge and pitch motions computed as 4 a w l 2 0 ω l w s 2 ω d ω where s 2 ω represents the spectra of the second order slow drift motions for the corresponding motion fig 11 presents the mean amplitudes of second order motions normalized by the variation in the incident waves against the peak periods the results clearly illustrate that the slow drift responses tend to increase as the peak period decreases the slow drift responses are found to be positively correlated to the wave heights of the incident waves which can be to some extent confirmed by the formula of the second order force shown in eq 2 moreover sea conditions with short t p show a remarkable enhancement on the slow drift surge and pitch motions these may lead to the unexpected extreme mooring tensions for the steep wave conditions steeper wave may also cause the more violent run up airgap responses which should be taken into account in engineering practice for such a deep draft semi submersible platform the appearance of severe second order slow drift motions leads to challenges for mooring lines risers and air gap responses in practice reliable numerical methods are therefore needed to predict the hydrodynamic performance of such floating structures precisely in the design phase 3 4 numerical investigation in this study the commercial software ansys aqwa was applied to solve the frequency domain and time domain problems the full qtf was calculated numerically using a second order potential solver so that all hydrodynamic external couplings could be considered the second order slow drift force could then be obtained as all the external forces from the wave excitation mooring lines and slow drift force were estimated numerically the motion responses of the platform could be calculated accordingly based on the linear dynamic motion equation faltinsen 1993 first we conducted a numerical simulation under the excitation of the white noise wave to calculate the response amplitude operators raos of the platform and to compare them with those obtained by a frequency domain calculation and the model test under irregular waves shown in fig 12 the raos of the surge heave and pitch motions obtained from the model test are plotted only in the frequency range 0 25 rad s ω 1 5 rad s in keeping with the spectral range of the incident waves shown in fig 4 as expected the peaks observed in the raos of the heave and pitch motions appear at their natural frequencies at the wave frequency range the raos for heave motions obtained by all three methods coincide well with each other the raos for surge and pitch motions estimated by time domain analysis agree well with those from the model test while discrepancies are found in comparison to those predicted by frequency analysis the shapes of the rao curves for the surge and pitch motions are similar to those predicted by frequency domain calculation and those obtained by the other two approaches the frequency shifts appear at the second peaks at approximately 0 8 rad s and 0 5 rad s for which the mooring lines prominently affect the natural frequencies of the whole floating system moreover simulations of motion responses were calculated considering the time series recorded from the wave probe in the wave calibration tests as the incident waves instead of applying a random wave train based on the specific joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum shown in table 5 by following this procedure the incident wave spectra and the random phases of the wave trains employed in the model tests and numerical simulations can be made consistent with each other the discrepancies in the inputs between the model tests and numerical simulations thus remain low the surge heave and pitch motions computed by the full qtf for case 2 are illustrated in fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 respectively the wave frequency components were extracted with the application of the digital filter at ω 0 2 rad s it is clear from fig 13 b fig 14 b and fig 15 b that the wave frequency components of the surge heave and pitch motions predicted numerically show good agreement with those predicted by the model tests moreover the heave motion is very similar to its wave frequency components which coincides with the findings in fig 7 a as shown in fig 13 a the surge motion estimated numerically agrees relatively well with that measured by the model tests although some small discrepancies can be observed in contrast the agreement for the pitch motion obtained by numerical simulation and model tests is not as good as expected due to the discrepancies in the lf slow drift motion shown in fig 15 we are ultimately interested in the resonant motions of such deep draft semi submersible motions that are induced by lf second order load under severe irregular wave conditions to evaluate the statistics of resonant motions in random seas the peak to peak distributions of the surge heave and pitch motions were investigated as shown in fig 16 the distributions are compared with their corresponding rayleigh distributions which can be estimated by 5 e r a y l ξ h exp h 2 8 m 0 where m 0 represents the spectral moment of the motions 6 m 0 0 s ω d ω deviations from the rayleigh distribution are observed for the surge and pitch motion responses showing that their dynamic processes are non gaussian due to the second order resonant responses the distribution of the heave motion coincides well with the corresponding rayleigh distribution because the first order wave frequency components dominate the heave response the distributions of the surge heave and pitch motions obtained by numerical calculation and model tests are compared in fig 16 deviations for both the surge and the pitch motions are found while the distribution for the pitch motion shows larger differences in the area of the extreme responses probability of exceedance 10 2 due to the importance of predicting the slow drift pitch motion in industrial practice such as the operation requirement and the air gap estimation one should carefully pay attention to the differences that appear in the distribution of the pitch motion comparisons of the response spectra between the experiment and numerical simulation are presented in fig 17 the wave frequency motions agree well with each other as discussed previously while the slow drift responses for the surge and pitch motions are underestimated by numerical approach note that the dynamic behaviour of the lf slow drift motions is known to be closely related to the characteristics of the mooring lines it is not easy to perfectly simulate all the properties of the mooring lines such as the diameters of every segment and the shape of the chains which are associated with the dynamic response moreover the damping of the mooring lines varies throughout the lines while it is regarded as constant in the numerical simulations in addition the effects caused by the higher order nonlinear interactions may also play a role these aspects are neglected by the second order potential flow approach resulting in underestimation of the slow drift motions based on potential flow drift forces 4 conclusions a series of model tests and numerical estimations in irregular waves were conducted to investigate the second order slow drift motions of a deep draft semi submersible platform numerical modelling was carried out with commercial frequency domain and time domain solvers and the corresponding results for evaluating the slow drift motions were considered and tested against the experimental measurements with a scale 1 60 model based on the results obtained in this work the following conclusions can be remarked experimental results show that extremely large slow drift surge motions occur under severe irregular waves which is regarded as an important feature for the design of mooring lines and risers for a floating platform and has been considered in the oil and gas industry for decades the second order resonant pitch motions are found to be prominent compared with the first order wave frequency motions which could have a significant influence on the evaluations of the air gap responses dnvgl 2017 therefore when considering the hydrodynamic responses for a floating structure of the type applied in this study newman s approximation seems to be inappropriate for estimating the second order pitch motions the results of the slow drift motions obtained by experiments and numerical estimations reveal that the wave frequency motions calculated numerically exhibit good agreement with those from the model tests however although these aspects are to some extent well studied in traditional floating offshore structures deviations of the slow drift motions estimated using the full qtf matrix can still be observed compared with those obtained by the experiments credit authorship contribution statement da li writing original draft wenyue lu methodology writing review editing xin li conceptualization
