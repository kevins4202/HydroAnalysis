8260,study region the study area is the river basin upstream of the kariba dam located in the zambezi river at the border of zambia and zimbabwe study focus during the dry season of 2019 in sub saharan africa extremely low water levels occurred in the zambezi according to news media locals perceived this drought as the worst in several decades we analyzed the 2019 drought in the zambezi river basin upstream of the kariba dam to determine whether it indeed was the longest most intense and severe drought in terms of precipitation total water storage and reservoir water level observations over recent decades new hydrological insights for the region data analysis indicates that the 2019 drought indeed had the lowest basin averaged annual rainfall most severe local rainfall deficit in the north of the basin and lowest reservoir level since 1995 however the rainfall deficit was more severe in 2002 both basin wide and locally in the south of the basin the total storage deficit was more severe in 2004 both basin wide and locally in the central part of the basin however as the available storage data did not cover the entire deficit for 2019 its final duration and severity remain unknown therefore it depends on the drought characteristic hydrological variable and location within the basin whether the 2019 drought was indeed the most extreme over recent decades keywords zambezi drought satellite data semi arid data scarce 1 introduction during the dry season of 2019 in sub saharan africa extremely low river water levels were observed this was especially visible in the zambezi river at victoria falls extremely low water levels were also observed in the reservoir upstream of the kariba hydropower dam which was down to 10 of usable water for hydro power generation according to locals and the news media this resulted in frequent power cuts of up to 18 h per day for at least 3 months starting in november 2020 carlowicz 2019 matiashe 2019 tshili 2019 250 km further upstream of the kariba reservoir the victoria falls which is known as one of the biggest waterfalls in the world was reduced from a 1 7 km wide falls to multiple small waterfalls childs 2019 henson 2019 the zambezi river basin is characterized by one distinct wet and one dry season it exhibits high temporal and spatial variability in water availability and demand such that the dry season demand frequently exceeds water availability resulting in water stressed areas in 1995 and 2005 severe droughts in multiple sub saharan countries caused reduced crop production libanda et al 2019 the world bank 2010 between 2000 and 2009 about 12 5 million people were affected by droughts in mozambique zambia and zimbabwe zamcom et al 2015 however according to popular news media locals perceived the drought in 2019 as the worst in several decades brown 2019 edel 2019 or even a century carlowicz 2019 henson 2019 drought is one of the most damaging natural hazards in the world with widespread impacts on society economy and ecology mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 in general droughts are classified into meteorological droughts related to precipitation deficits hydrological droughts related to water deficits on the sub surface and groundwater droughts related to decreased groundwater levels mishra and singh 2010 van loon et al 2014 wilhite and glantz 1985 many previous studies have focused for example on 1 quantifying and predicting droughts in terms of intensity duration severity or spatial extent using drought indices bayissa et al 2018 hao and singh 2015 hellwig and stahl 2018 kumar et al 2016 naresh kumar et al 2009 van loon et al 2017 2 analysing the impact of drought on society economy or ecology haile et al 2019 he et al 2019 mishra and singh 2010 stahl

loon et al 2016 some of these studies focused on analysing droughts in sub saharan regions such as the zambezi river basin e g dutra et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 tirivarombo and hughes 2011 in addition previous studies illustrated discrepancies between people s perception of dry conditions and data analyses results e g foguesatto et al 2020 simelton et al 2013 solano hernandez et al 2020 for instance foguesatto et al 2020 showed multiple farmers in africa and asia perceived decreased rainfall amounts which was not reflected in meteorological records they argued that these discrepancies can often be a result of economic and psychological stress factors in another study taylor et al 1988 showed that farmers in the united states remembered the most recent drought and individual extreme drought events but largely forgot intermediate droughts similarly viglione et al 2014 and collenteur et al 2015 illustrated that the memory of specific flood events decreases in time affecting community actions in addition di baldassarre et al 2017 and albertini et al 2020 provide evidence that the lack of preparation for droughts after extreme flood events can intensify the resulting impacts in several sub saharan countries there was an extreme flood event due to the tropical cyclones idai and kenneth in march and april 2019 united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha 2019 which thus may have impacted the local perception of the 2019 drought in the zambezi river basin many previous studies compared local perceptions of drought events to rainfall observations e g giordano et al 2013 iqbal et al 2018 osgood et al 2018 ovuka and lindqvist 2000 solano hernandez et al 2020 however these studies did not incorporate satellite based total water storage and reservoir water level observations to provide additional information on drought events in addition the drought of 2019 in the zambezi river basin has not yet been fully analyzed as it occurred recently therefore the objective of this study was to analyze the drought of 2019 in the zambezi river basin upstream of the kariba reservoir using multiple satellite observations to determine whether it was indeed the most extreme drought in at least 20 years as perceived by locals 2 site description the zambezi river the fourth longest river in africa is shared by the countries zambia 42 of the basin area angola 18 zimbabwe 16 mozambique 12 malawi 7 5 tanzania 2 botswana 1 5 and namibia 1 kling et al 2014 the river has a basin area of 1 37 million km2 is about 2 660 km long and has an average discharge of 4 134 m3 s 1 at the outlet in mozambique the world bank 2010 there is a distinct wet season from september april and dry season from may august in this semi arid basin the potential evaporation 2000 mm year 1 exceeds the precipitation 1000 mm year 1 especially during dry seasons schleiss and matos 2016 two large hydropower dams are located in the main zambezi river which are the cahora bassa dam 2075 mw in mozambique and further upstream the kariba dam 2130 mw at the border of zambia and zimbabwe the latter is one of the main power sources for both countries according to the local power supply companies kesselring 2017 the maximum water depth above the minimum operating level in the kariba reservoir is 13 m according to the zambezi river authority http www zambezira org 3 data availability in this study satellite observations were used to estimate precipitation total water storage anomalies actual and potential evaporation and reservoir water levels table 1 as the available ground observations were very limited within the zambezi river basin e g hulsman et al 2020 monthly precipitation data was obtained from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps and monthly actual evaporation from water productivity open access portal wapor as wapor was only available since 2009 table 1 monthly satellite based temperature data obtained from 5th generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis dataset era5 and averaged over the kariba reservoir were used to estimate the potential evaporation with the hargreaves method hargreaves and allen 2003 hargreaves and samani 1985 which was assumed to be equal to the total actual evaporation from this open water body total water storage anomaly observations were obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace grace observations describe variations in the earths gravity field which are related to regional mass changes that are dominated by terrestrial water storage variations landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 readily available and pre processed grace observations were generated by jet propulsion laboratory jpl and downloaded from the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov the jpl pre processed the data to remove atmospheric mass changes systematic errors and noise and subtract the 2004 2009 time mean baseline to obtain total water storage anomalies landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 wahr et al 1998 note that grace observations were missing for several months among which july 2017 may 2018 and august september 2018 since the grace mission was ended in october 2017 and the mission grace follow on grace fo was launched in may 2018 kornfeld et al 2019 satellite based lake water levels i e altimetry observations were extracted from the platform database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti for the kariba reservoir altimetry observations estimate the water level relative to a reference ellipsoid the distance between the satellite and earth surface is estimated by sending a radar signal in nadir direction towards the earth and measuring the time difference between sending and receiving the reflected signal with this distance and the known satellite position the surface level relative to a reference ellipsoid is estimated calmant et al 2008 Å‚yszkowicz and bernatowicz 2017 at the kariba reservoir the following satellite missions were used to create a time series envisat jason 1 2 3 and topex poseidon schwatke et al 2015 depending on the satellite mission the temporal resolution is 10 and 35 days cnes accessed 2018 esa 2018 schwatke et al 2015 in this study the temporal variability of remotely sensed precipitation total water storage actual and potential evaporation and reservoir water levels at kariba were compared for the time period 1992 2020 as grace and wapor data were only available since 2002 and 2009 respectively any comparison with these variables comprised the time period 2002 2020 and 2009 2020 respectively annual values for the precipitation and evaporation were calculated from monthly observations considering hydrological years starting in august rather than calendar years there were no discharge data available in the vicinity of the kariba reservoir after 2018 in the global discharge database global runoff data centre grdc so this variable was not included in this study 4 approach the temporal variability of all individual variables was analyzed and compared using basin averaged time series for the gridded observations considering the basin upstream of the kariba hydropower dam dark grey area in fig 1 potential evaporation at kariba reservoir however was averaged over the open water body during this analysis basin averaged actual evaporation was calculated as this variable directly influences the total water storage similarly potential evaporation at kariba reservoir was included in this analysis since it influences the reservoir water levels the precipitation actual evaporation and potential evaporation time series were analyzed on an annual timescale to detect multi annual changes in contrast grace and altimetry observations were analyzed on the same timescale for which the data was available to use as much data as possible for the drought analysis and as both variables account for effects of preceding months in addition multiple drought indices were calculated using precipitation grace and altimetry data as explained in section 4 1 with these indices the associated drought severities durations and intensities were estimated and analyzed as explained in section 4 2 then the spatial variability of the minimum deficit index drought intensity and severity were compared for the most severe drought and the 2019 drought with respect to precipitation and grace 4 1 drought indices remotely sensed precipitation data was used to estimate the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which is typically used to quantify meteorological droughts the spi was calculated for each month using monthly precipitation time series accumulated over the 12 preceding months to reflect short and long term effects this time series was fitted to the gamma probability density function to compute the corresponding cumulative distribution function which was then transformed to a normal distribution function to estimate spi values this approach was applied to the basin averaged precipitation time series and to each individual grid cell for the latter each grid cell was fitted to the gamma probability density function separately total water storage observations according to grace were used to estimate the grace based total storage deficit index tsdi nie et al 2018 this was calculated by first estimating the total storage deficit tsd using eq 1 to remove seasonal variations to allow comparisons of tsd between different seasons and then standardizing tsd using eq 2 to obtain tsdi nie et al 2018 1 t s d i j s i j s a v g j s m a x j s m i n j 2 t s d i i j t s d i j Î¼ Ïƒ with sij mm total water storage in month j and year i s avg j mm long term mean total water

was estimated using basin averaged total water storage time series and gridded data for all months for which data was available reservoir altimetry observations were used to estimate the corresponding drought index which was called water level deficit index wldi in this study this index was calculated for all data points for which data was available for this purpose eqs 1 and 2 were used similar to the calculation of grace based tsdi as reservoir water level and total water storage observations both already account for effects of preceding months that is why the altimetry and grace time series were not accumulated when calculating the corresponding drought indices as done when estimating spi bloomfield and marchant 2013 van loon et al 2017 4 2 drought characteristics the three individual drought indices were used to characterize droughts in terms of minimum deficit index drought duration intensity and severity the minimum deficit index dimin Î¸ is the lowest index value in a drought for drought index Î¸ the drought duration d d Î¸ months was defined as the number of consecutive months with Î¸ below zero drought intensity d i Î¸ month 1 as average Î¸ over consecutive months with Î¸ below zero and drought severity d s Î¸ as the accumulated Î¸ over consecutive months with Î¸ below zero huang et al 2016 this was applied for all drought indices used in this study such that Î¸ spi tsdi or wldi 5 results 5 1 precipitation the annual precipitation varied between 642 mm year 1 in 2019 and 1024 mm year 1 in 2008 fig 2 a in other words in 2019 the annual rainfall was lowest since at least 27 years which was the duration of the available rainfall data considerably low rainfall amounts were also observed in 1995 670 mm year 1 2002 728 mm year 1 2005 710 mm year 1 and 2015 733 mm year 1 consecutive wet years with above average rainfall amounts 871 mm year 1 were observed in 2006 2011 and 2017 2018 whereas in 1997 2001 the annual rainfall amounts were more than 800 mm year 1 fig 2a according to the precipitation based drought index spi there have been multiple droughts in the kariba basin colored areas in fig 2b of which five droughts are characterized by spimin 1 5 table 2 and can hence be classified as severe meteorological drought according to the drought categories as defined by mckee et al 1993 these droughts started in 1994 2002 2005 and 2019 their minimum deficit indices were dimin spi 1 5 1 7 their severities were d s spi 14 1 44 0 their durations were d d spi 13 37 months and their intensities were d i spi 1 0 1 5 month 1 table 2 based on these results the longest and most severe meteorological drought with the lowest deficit index occurred in 1994 d d spi 37 months d s spi 44 0 and dimin spi 1 7 whereas the most intense drought was in 2019 d i spi 1 5 month 1 table 2 5 2 total water storage the total water storage varied seasonally and on average 271 mm in contrast the long term the annual minimum storage varied between 217 mm and 26 mm fig 2c in 2005 and 2019 the total water storage decreased to 217 mm and 215 mm respectively which were both dry years when considering the annual rainfall 710 mm year 1 and 642 mm year 1 respectively the decreased total water storage in 2019 was likely also a result of the above average actual total evaporation in the basin 1030 mm year 1 fig 3 a resulting in increased water releases from the soil and hence decreased total water storage values in contrast the total water storage remained relatively high in 2015 despite the low rainfall 733 mm year 1 with an annual minimum storage of 80 mm fig 2a and c during that year the basin averaged annual evaporation was below average 902 mm year 1 fig 3a resulting in less water being released from the sub surface and hence higher total water storage values therefore the high total water storage in 2015 can plausibly be due to the below average actual evaporation according to the grace based tsdi water storage deficits occurred multiple times the droughts starting in 2004 and 2018 had tsdimin 1 5 table 2 and fig 2d their minimum deficit indices were equal to dimin tsdi 1 8 their drought severities were d s tsdi 23 7 32 9 their durations were d d tsdi 19 41 months and their intensities were d i tsdi 0 8 1 3 month 1 in contrast to these droughts the low rainfall in 2015 did not result in tsdi 1 5 based on these results the longest and most severe drought in total water storage occurred in 2004 d d tsdi 41 months and d s tsdi 32 9 whereas the most intense total storage related drought began in 2019 d i tsdi 1 3 month 1 table 2 note the tsdi remained below zero towards the end of the available time series in june 2020 fig 2d meaning the total storage deficit was still ongoing thereby affecting the final duration severity and intensity for this specific drought 5 3 reservoir water level as illustrated in fig 2e the water level in kariba reservoir changed both seasonally and inter annually while the seasonal variability was on average 2 8 m the inter annual variability ranged up to 10 2 m as the annual minima ranged between 475 1 m 1996 and 485 3 m 1999 the highest level was observed in 2000 487 2 m and the lowest in 1996 475 1 m during the dry season of 2019 the reservoir level decreased to 476 2 m before increasing again with the new rains in other words the lowest reservoir level was observed in 1996 the long term variations in the altimetry often coincided with the annual precipitation amounts according to chirps fig 2a for example the water levels decreased significantly in 1995 2005 2015 and 2019 when the annual rainfall was low similarly the water levels increased in 1997 1999 2007 2011 and 2016 2018 during consecutively wet years fig 2a and e in contrast the annual rainfall was lower in 2002 728 mm year 1 which was not reflected as strongly in the altimetry observations compared to the other dry years fig 2a and e this can be due to decreased outflow as a consequence of reservoir operation considerations or decreased evaporation from the open water body however in 2002 the evaporation was high 1320 mm year 1 compared to preceding and following years fig 3b therefore the high altimetry observations in 2002 despite the low rainfall amount were more likely a result of reservoir operation decisions according to the reservoir altimetry based wldi significant water deficits continuing for more than a year started in 1992 2005 2015 and 2019 colored areas in fig 2f their minimum deficit indices were dimin wldi 1 6 to 2 0 their severities were d s wldi 20 1 to 79 6 their durations were d d wldi 17 69 months and their intensities were d i wldi 0 7 to 1 2 month 1 table 2 based on these results the longest most severe and most intense deficit with the lowest deficit index occurred between 1992 and 1998 d d wldi 69 months d s wldi 79 6 d i wldi 1 2 month 1 and dimin wldi 2 0 table 2 note the wldi remained below zero towards the end of the time series in june 2020 fig 2f meaning the reservoir water deficit was still ongoing duration and severity of this specific drought as reported here are thus to be interpreted as lower bounds 5 4 spatial variability in the previous sections the basin averaged drought characteristics were analyzed using precipitation grace and altimetry data in this section the spatial variability of the minimum deficit index drought intensity and severity were compared for the most severe drought and the 2019 drought with respect to precipitation and grace for which gridded data was available the most severe basin averaged precipitation deficit occurred in 1994 while the most severe total water storage deficit occurred in 2004 table 2 5 4 1 precipitation the precipitation deficit in 1994 resulted in a minimum index value of dimin spi 0 6 1 9 with low values in the central and western parts of the basin fig 4 a in 2019 the minimum index value was dimin spi 0 0 to 1 9 with considerably more low values in the northern parts of the basin fig 4b therefore according to the minimum deficit index the drought was more extreme in 2019 or 1994 depending on the location within the basin fig 4a and b the drought intensity was d i spi 0 3 to 1 6 month 1 in 1994 and exhibited pronounced spatial contrasts with the lowest values in the central parts of the basin fig 5 a however in 2019 the intensity was d i spi 0 0 to 1 8 month 1 with the lowest values in the north west fig 5b comparison between 1994 and 2019 further suggests that the 2019 drought was locally considerably more intense the drought severity in 1994 was d s spi 5 4 to 69 3 and with the lowest values in the central and southern parts of the basin fig 6 a in 2019 the drought severity was d s spi 0 0 to 28 1 with the lowest values in the north west of the basin fig 6b therefore the drought was significantly more severe in 1994 compared to 2019 throughout large parts of the basin whereas in other regions in the north of the basin the drought was more severe in 2019 it depended on the location within the basin whether or not the drought of 2019 was the most severe or intense in at least 20 years in the northern part of the basin the drought of 2019 was the most severe intense and had the lowest deficit index values fig 7 a c and e for at least 20 years however in the southern parts of the basin the drought of 2019 was the most severe and had the lowest deficit index values in less than 10 years 5 4 2 total water storage the grace based minimum deficit index was dimin tsdi 1 2 to 1 7 in 2004 with the lowest values in the western part of the basin fig 4c in 2019 the minimum deficit index was dimin tsdi 0 7 to 1 7 with more high values in the central part of the basin compared to 2004 fig 4d as a result according to the minimum deficit index the drought was more extreme in 1994 or 2019 depending on the location within the basin fig 4c and d the drought intensity was d i tsdi 0 7 to 1 3 month 1 in 2004 with the lowest values in the south east fig 5c however in 2019 it was d i tsdi 0 5 to 1 4 month 1 with the lowest values in the north west fig 5d therefore the drought was more intense in 2004 for example south east of the basin or 2019 for example north west of the basin depending on the location within the basin the drought severity was d s tsdi 4 6 to 23 8 in 2004 with the lowest values in the central part of the basin fig 6c in 2019 the severity was d s tsdi 1 4 to 19 9 with the lowest values in the south east fig 6d therefore depending on the location within the basin as of june 2020 the drought was more severe in 2004 in the central parts of the basin and in 2019 in the south east of the basin similar to precipitation related drought it depended on the location within the basin as to whether or not the water storage related drought of 2019 was the most severe and intense in at least 20 years in the western parts of the basin the drought of 2019 was the most severe intense and with the lowest deficit index values in less than 10 years fig 7b d and f however the drought of 2019 was the most severe and intense for at least 17 years the duration of the available grace data in the south of the basin 6 discussion while locals perceived the drought of 2019 as the most severe in at least 20 years data indicated this differed depending on the drought characteristic hydrological variable and the location within the basin the drought of 2019 was characterized by the lowest basin averaged annual rainfall for at least 27 years the most intense rainfall deficit for at least 25 years the most severe local rainfall deficit in the northern part of the basin for at least 20 years and the lowest reservoir water level since 1995 this supports the local perception that the drought of 2019 was the most extreme in more than 20 years however the rainfall deficit was more severe in 2002 with respect to the basin average and locally in the south of the basin also reservoir water level deficit was more severe in 2015 and total storage deficit was more severe in 2004 with respect to the basin average and locally in the south of the basin this contradicts the local perception however the available data did not cover the entire water level and total storage deficit for 2019 such that the tsdi and wldi remained below zero towards the end of the available time series in june 2020 thus the final duration and severity of the drought of 2019 remains unknown the water levels at kariba reservoir not only depended on precipitation which largely dominates the inflow to the reservoir but also on evaporation from the open water body and reservoir operation determining the amount of water leaving the reservoir that is why low annual rainfall amounts do not necessarily result in low reservoir water levels for example reservoir operation is likely to explain the relatively high reservoir water levels in 2002 despite the very low rainfall and high evaporation in that year figs 2a 2e and 3b the results in this study are sensitive to uncertainties in the satellite observations previous studies illustrated satellite based precipitation observations were sensitive to bias kimani et al 2017 le coz and van de giesen 2020 uncertainties in total water storage anomalies are a result of data post processing including data smoothing using a radius of 300 km which affects the spatial variability blazquez et al 2018 landerer and swenson 2012 note that grace observations were missing for several months as mentioned in section 3 which resulted in missing tsdi values and hence an irregular temporal pattern in fig 2c and d potential and actual evaporation data are prone to uncertainties related to the underlying estimation method and input data feng et al 2019 hobbins et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 altimetry uncertainties for open water bodies range between 0 04 m and 0 36 m depending on the lake size and climate conditions crÃ©taux and birkett 2006 schwatke et al 2015 these uncertainties can affect long term fluctuations in these variables therefore we recommend that these satellite observations are tested against ground observations this step was outside the scope of this study due to the limited in situ data availability previous studies have discussed various reasons for discrepancies between local perception of droughts and satellite based observations first locals often perceive droughts through non climatic factors such as reservoir water level or lack of electricity which is more clearly visible compared to rainfall or total water storage amounts iqbal et al 2018 urquijo and de stefano 2016 second locals often remember most recent and extreme drought events but forget intermediate droughts taylor et al 1988 third local perceptions are often influenced by economic losses such as significant reductions in the expected crop production bola et al 2014 foguesatto et al 2020 meze hausken 2004 hence farmers who experienced large crop failures often relate this to droughts even though the rainfall remained constant they may also fail to take into account that they have expanded their crop production in the past such that the water demand increased in contrast to previous studies this study illustrated the local perception was partially supported and partially contradicted by satellite observations depending on the drought characteristic hydrological variable and location within the basin in other words the simple statement the drought of 2019 was the worst in several decades mentioned in the news media brown 2019 edel 2019 cannot be generalised for example locals in the west of the basin are more likely to consider the drought of 2019 as the most severe in at least 20 years if they mainly rely on rainwater fig 7e instead of groundwater sources fig 7f note that monthly grace observations are dominated by slow processes which include changes in the groundwater system and seasonal variations in all storage components in future studies it would be interesting to include local observations such as the inflow to kariba reservoir reservoir operation reservoir water levels and precipitation data to validate satellite observations in addition the opinions of local experts who are familiar with the region and interview results on local perception should be included as this may vary spatially and could depend on occupation or age in this study the spi was calculated using 12 preceding months section 4 1 to identify extreme droughts since short duration droughts of 3 or 6 months occur more frequently fig 8 however it would be interesting to analyze whether a different drought duration in the spi calculation would reflect the local perception better at a specific location and if so why 7 conclusion the objective of this study was to analyze the drought of 2019 in the zambezi river basin upstream of the kariba reservoir using multiple satellite observations to determine whether it was the most extreme drought in at least 20 years as locally perceived for this purpose we analyzed the drought duration intensity and severity spatially averaged and locally using precipitation total water storage and reservoir water level observations data analysis indicated that the drought of 2019 was the most extreme for at least 24 years when considering the basin averaged annual rainfall local precipitation based drought severity in the north of the basin and reservoir water level however the 2019 drought was the most extreme only in recent decades when considering the basin averaged drought severity according to the precipitation total water storage and reservoir water level note that as the available data did not cover the entire water level and total storage deficit for 2019 the final duration and severity of the drought of 2019 remains unknown therefore it depends on the drought characteristic the hydrological variable considered and the location within the basin whether the drought of 2019 was indeed the most extreme over the last decades as perceived by local people data availability all satellite observations used in this study were obtained from publicly available

visible in the zambezi river at victoria falls extremely low water levels were also observed in the reservoir upstream of the kariba hydropower dam which was down to 10 of usable water for hydro power generation according to locals and the news media this resulted in frequent power cuts of up to 18 h per day for at least 3 months starting in november 2020 carlowicz 2019 matiashe 2019 tshili 2019 250 km further upstream of the kariba reservoir the victoria falls which is known as one of the biggest waterfalls in the world was reduced from a 1 7 km wide falls to multiple small waterfalls childs 2019 henson 2019 the zambezi river basin is characterized by one distinct wet and one dry season it exhibits high temporal and spatial variability in water availability and demand such that the dry season demand frequently exceeds water availability resulting in water stressed areas in 1995 and 2005 severe droughts in multiple sub saharan countries caused reduced crop production libanda et al 2019 the world bank 2010 between 2000 and 2009 about 12 5 million people were affected by droughts in mozambique zambia and zimbabwe zamcom et al 2015 however according to popular news media locals perceived the drought in 2019 as the worst in several decades brown 2019 edel 2019 or even a century carlowicz 2019 henson 2019 drought is one of the most damaging natural hazards in the world with widespread impacts on society economy and ecology mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 in general droughts are classified into meteorological droughts related to precipitation deficits hydrological droughts related to water deficits on the sub surface and groundwater droughts related to decreased groundwater levels mishra and singh 2010 van loon et al 2014 wilhite and glantz 1985 many previous studies have focused for example on 1 quantifying and predicting droughts in terms of intensity duration severity or spatial extent using drought indices bayissa et al 2018 hao and singh 2015 hellwig

addition previous studies illustrated discrepancies between people s perception of dry conditions and data analyses results e g foguesatto et al 2020 simelton et al 2013 solano hernandez et al 2020 for instance foguesatto et al 2020 showed multiple farmers in africa and asia perceived decreased rainfall amounts which was not reflected in meteorological records they argued that these discrepancies can often be a result of economic and psychological stress factors in another study taylor et al 1988 showed that farmers in the united states remembered the most recent drought and individual extreme drought events but largely forgot intermediate droughts similarly viglione et al 2014 and collenteur et al 2015 illustrated that the memory of specific flood events decreases in time affecting community actions in addition di baldassarre et al 2017 and albertini et al 2020 provide evidence that the lack of preparation for droughts after extreme flood events can intensify the resulting impacts in several sub saharan countries there was an extreme flood event due to the tropical cyclones idai and kenneth in march and april 2019 united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha 2019 which thus may have impacted the local perception of the 2019 drought in the zambezi river basin many previous studies compared local perceptions of drought events to rainfall observations e g giordano et al 2013 iqbal et al 2018 osgood et al 2018 ovuka and lindqvist 2000 solano hernandez et al 2020 however these studies did not incorporate satellite based total water storage and reservoir water level observations to provide additional information on drought events in addition the drought of 2019 in the zambezi river basin has not yet been fully analyzed as it occurred recently therefore the objective of this study was to analyze the drought of 2019 in the zambezi river basin upstream of the kariba reservoir using multiple satellite observations to determine whether it was indeed the most extreme drought in at least 20 years as perceived by locals 2 site description the zambezi river the fourth longest river in africa is shared by the countries

precipitation with station data chirps and monthly actual evaporation from water productivity open access portal wapor as wapor was only available since 2009 table 1 monthly satellite based temperature data obtained from 5th generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis dataset era5 and averaged over the kariba reservoir were used to estimate the potential evaporation with the hargreaves method hargreaves and allen 2003 hargreaves and samani 1985 which was assumed to be equal to the total actual evaporation from this open water body total water storage anomaly observations were obtained from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace grace observations describe variations in the earths gravity field which are related to regional mass changes that are dominated by terrestrial water storage variations landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 readily available and pre processed grace observations were generated by jet propulsion laboratory jpl and downloaded from

temporal resolution is 10 and 35 days cnes accessed 2018 esa 2018 schwatke et al 2015 in this study the temporal variability of remotely sensed precipitation total water storage actual and potential evaporation and reservoir water levels at kariba were compared for the time period 1992 2020 as grace and wapor data were only available since 2002 and 2009 respectively any comparison with these variables comprised the time period 2002 2020 and 2009 2020 respectively annual values for the precipitation and evaporation were calculated from monthly observations considering hydrological years starting in august rather than calendar years there were no discharge data available in the vicinity of the kariba reservoir after 2018 in the global discharge database global runoff data centre grdc so this variable was not included in this study 4 approach the temporal variability of all individual variables was analyzed and compared using basin averaged time series for the gridded observations considering the basin upstream of the kariba hydropower dam dark grey area in fig 1 potential evaporation at kariba reservoir however was averaged over the open water body during this analysis basin averaged actual evaporation was calculated as this variable directly influences the total water storage similarly potential evaporation at kariba reservoir was included in this analysis since it influences the reservoir water levels the precipitation actual evaporation and potential evaporation time series were analyzed on an annual timescale to detect multi annual changes in contrast grace and altimetry observations were analyzed on the same timescale for which the data was available to use as much data as possible for the drought analysis and as both variables account for effects of preceding months in addition multiple drought indices were calculated using precipitation grace and altimetry data as explained in section 4 1 with these indices the associated drought severities durations and intensities were estimated and analyzed as explained in section 4 2 then the spatial variability of the minimum deficit index drought intensity and severity were compared for the most severe drought and the 2019 drought with respect to precipitation and grace 4 1 drought indices remotely sensed precipitation data was used to estimate the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which is typically used to quantify meteorological droughts the spi was calculated for each month using monthly precipitation time series accumulated over the 12 preceding months to reflect short and long term effects this time series was fitted to the gamma probability density function to compute the corresponding cumulative distribution function which was then transformed to a normal distribution function to estimate spi values this approach was applied to the basin averaged precipitation time series and to each individual grid cell for the latter each grid cell was fitted to the gamma probability density function separately total water storage observations according to grace were used to estimate the grace based total storage deficit index tsdi nie et al 2018 this was calculated by first estimating the total storage deficit tsd using eq 1 to remove seasonal variations to allow comparisons of tsd between different seasons and then standardizing tsd using eq 2 to obtain tsdi nie et al 2018 1 t s d i j s i j s a v g j s m a x j s m i n j 2 t s d i i j t s d i j Î¼ Ïƒ with sij mm total water storage in month j and year i s avg j mm long term mean total water

was estimated using basin averaged total water storage time series and gridded data for all months for which data was available reservoir altimetry observations were used to estimate the corresponding drought index which was called water level deficit index wldi in this study this index was calculated for all data points for which data was available for this purpose eqs 1 and 2 were used similar to the calculation of grace based tsdi as reservoir water level and total water storage observations both already account for effects of preceding months that is why the altimetry and grace time series were not accumulated when calculating the corresponding drought indices as done when estimating spi bloomfield and marchant 2013 van loon et al 2017 4 2 drought characteristics the three individual drought indices were used to characterize droughts in terms of minimum deficit index drought duration intensity and severity the minimum deficit index dimin Î¸ is the lowest index value in a drought for drought index Î¸ the drought duration d d Î¸ months was defined as the number of consecutive months with Î¸ below zero drought intensity d i Î¸ month 1 as average Î¸ over consecutive months with Î¸ below zero and drought severity d s Î¸ as the accumulated Î¸ over consecutive months with Î¸ below zero huang et al 2016 this was applied for all drought indices used in this study such that Î¸ spi tsdi or wldi 5 results 5 1 precipitation the annual precipitation varied between 642 mm year 1 in 2019 and 1024 mm year 1 in 2008 fig 2 a in other words in 2019 the annual rainfall was lowest since at least 27 years which was the duration of the available rainfall data considerably low rainfall amounts were also observed in 1995 670 mm year 1 2002 728 mm year 1 2005 710 mm year 1 and 2015 733 mm year 1 consecutive wet years with above average rainfall amounts 871 mm year 1 were observed in 2006 2011 and 2017 2018 whereas in 1997 2001 the annual rainfall amounts were more than 800 mm year 1 fig 2a according to the precipitation based drought index spi there have been multiple droughts in the kariba basin colored areas in fig 2b of which five droughts are characterized by spimin 1 5 table 2 and can hence be classified as severe meteorological drought according to the drought categories as defined by mckee et al 1993 these droughts started in 1994 2002 2005 and 2019 their minimum deficit indices were dimin spi 1 5 1 7 their severities were d s spi 14 1 44 0 their durations were d d spi 13 37 months and their intensities were d i spi 1 0 1 5 month 1 table 2 based on these results the longest and most severe meteorological drought with the lowest deficit index occurred in 1994 d d spi 37 months d s spi 44 0 and dimin spi 1 7 whereas the most intense drought was in 2019 d i spi 1 5 month 1 table 2 5 2 total water storage the total water storage varied seasonally and on average 271 mm in contrast the long term the annual minimum storage varied between 217 mm and 26 mm fig 2c in 2005 and 2019 the total water storage decreased to 217 mm and 215 mm respectively which were both dry years when considering the annual rainfall 710 mm year 1 and 642 mm year 1 respectively the decreased total water storage in 2019 was likely also a result of the above average actual total evaporation in the basin 1030 mm year 1 fig 3 a resulting in increased water releases from the soil and hence decreased total water storage values in contrast the total water storage remained relatively high in 2015 despite the low rainfall 733 mm year 1 with an annual minimum storage of 80 mm fig 2a and c during that year the basin averaged annual evaporation was below average 902 mm year 1 fig 3a resulting in less water being released from the sub surface and hence higher total water storage values therefore the high total water storage in 2015 can plausibly be due to the below average actual evaporation according to the grace based tsdi water storage deficits occurred multiple times the droughts starting in 2004 and 2018 had tsdimin 1 5 table 2 and fig 2d their minimum deficit indices were equal to dimin tsdi 1 8 their drought severities were d s tsdi 23 7 32 9 their durations were d d tsdi 19 41 months and their intensities were d i tsdi 0 8 1 3 month 1 in contrast to these droughts the low rainfall in 2015 did not result in tsdi 1 5 based on these results the longest and most severe drought in total water storage occurred in 2004 d d tsdi 41 months and d s tsdi 32 9 whereas the most intense total storage related drought began in 2019 d i tsdi 1 3 month 1 table 2 note the tsdi remained below zero towards the end of the available time series in june 2020 fig 2d meaning the total storage deficit was still ongoing thereby affecting the final duration severity and intensity for this specific drought 5 3 reservoir water level as illustrated in fig 2e the water level in kariba reservoir changed both seasonally and inter annually while the seasonal variability was on average 2 8 m the inter annual variability ranged up to 10 2 m as the annual minima ranged between 475 1 m 1996 and 485 3 m 1999 the highest level was observed in 2000 487 2 m and the lowest in 1996 475 1 m during the dry season of 2019 the reservoir level decreased to 476 2 m before increasing again with the new rains in other words the lowest reservoir level was observed in 1996 the long term variations in the altimetry often coincided with the annual precipitation amounts according to chirps fig 2a for example the water levels decreased significantly in 1995 2005 2015 and 2019 when the annual rainfall was low similarly the water levels increased in 1997 1999 2007 2011 and 2016 2018 during consecutively wet years fig 2a and e in contrast the annual rainfall was lower in 2002 728 mm year 1 which was not reflected as strongly in the altimetry observations compared to the other dry years fig 2a and e this can be due to decreased outflow as a consequence of reservoir operation considerations or decreased evaporation from the open water body however in 2002 the evaporation was high 1320 mm year 1 compared to preceding and following years fig 3b therefore the high altimetry observations in 2002 despite the low rainfall amount were more likely a result of reservoir operation decisions according to the reservoir altimetry based wldi significant water deficits continuing for more than a year started in 1992 2005 2015 and 2019 colored areas in fig 2f their minimum deficit indices were dimin wldi 1 6 to 2 0 their severities were d s wldi 20 1 to 79 6 their durations were d d wldi 17 69 months and their intensities were d i wldi 0 7 to 1 2 month 1 table 2 based on these results the longest most severe and most intense deficit with the lowest deficit index occurred between 1992 and 1998 d d wldi 69 months d s wldi 79 6 d i wldi 1 2 month 1 and dimin wldi 2 0 table 2 note the wldi remained below zero towards the end of the time series in june 2020 fig 2f meaning the reservoir water deficit was still ongoing duration and severity of this specific drought as reported here are thus to be interpreted as lower bounds 5 4 spatial variability in the previous sections the basin averaged drought characteristics were analyzed using precipitation grace and altimetry data in this section the spatial variability of the minimum deficit index drought intensity and severity were compared for the most severe drought and the 2019 drought with respect to precipitation and grace for which gridded data was available the most severe basin averaged precipitation deficit occurred in 1994 while the most severe total water storage deficit occurred in 2004 table 2 5 4 1 precipitation the precipitation deficit in 1994 resulted in a minimum index value of dimin spi 0 6 1 9 with low values in the central and western parts of the basin fig 4 a in 2019 the minimum index value was dimin spi 0 0 to 1 9 with considerably more low values in the northern parts of the basin fig 4b therefore according to the minimum deficit index the drought was more extreme in 2019 or 1994 depending on the location within the basin fig 4a and b the drought intensity was d i spi 0 3 to 1 6 month 1 in 1994 and exhibited pronounced spatial contrasts with the lowest values in the central parts of the basin fig 5 a however in 2019 the intensity was d i spi 0 0 to 1 8 month 1 with the lowest values in the north west fig 5b comparison between 1994 and 2019 further suggests that the 2019 drought was locally considerably more intense the drought severity in 1994 was d s spi 5 4 to 69 3 and with the lowest values in the central and southern parts of the basin fig 6 a in 2019 the drought severity was d s spi 0 0 to 28 1 with the lowest values in the north west of the basin fig 6b therefore the drought was significantly more severe in 1994 compared to 2019 throughout large parts of the basin whereas in other regions in the north of the basin the drought was more severe in 2019 it depended on the location within the basin whether or not the drought of 2019 was the most severe or intense in at least 20 years in the northern part of the basin the drought of 2019 was the most severe intense and had the lowest deficit index values fig 7 a c and e for at least 20 years however in the southern parts of the basin the drought of 2019 was the most severe and had the lowest deficit index values in less than 10 years 5 4 2 total water storage the grace based minimum deficit index was dimin tsdi 1 2 to 1 7 in 2004 with the lowest values in the western part of the basin fig 4c in 2019 the minimum deficit index was dimin tsdi 0 7 to 1 7 with more high values in the central part of the basin compared to 2004 fig 4d as a result according to the minimum deficit index the drought was more extreme in 1994 or 2019 depending on the location within the basin fig 4c and d the drought intensity was d i tsdi 0 7 to 1 3 month 1 in 2004 with the lowest values in the south east fig 5c however in 2019 it was d i tsdi 0 5 to 1 4 month 1 with the lowest values in the north west fig 5d therefore the drought was more intense in 2004 for example south east of the basin or 2019 for example north west of the basin depending on the location within the basin the drought severity was d s tsdi 4 6 to 23 8 in 2004 with the lowest values in the central part of the basin fig 6c in 2019 the severity was d s tsdi 1 4 to 19 9 with the lowest values in the south east fig 6d therefore depending on the location within the basin as of june 2020 the drought was more severe in 2004 in the central parts of the basin and in 2019 in the south east of the basin similar to precipitation related drought it depended on the location within the basin as to whether or not the water storage related drought of 2019 was the most severe and intense in at least 20 years in the western parts of the basin the drought of 2019 was the most severe intense and with the lowest deficit index values in less than 10 years fig 7b d and f however the drought of 2019 was the most severe and intense for at least 17 years the duration of the available grace data in the south of the basin 6 discussion while locals perceived the drought of 2019 as the most severe in at least 20 years data indicated this differed depending on the drought characteristic hydrological variable and the location within the basin the drought of 2019 was characterized by the lowest basin averaged annual rainfall for at least 27 years the most intense rainfall deficit for at least 25 years the most severe local rainfall deficit in the northern part of the basin for at least 20 years and the lowest reservoir water level since 1995 this supports the local perception that the drought of 2019 was the most extreme in more than 20 years however the rainfall deficit was more severe in 2002 with respect to the basin average and locally in the south of the basin also reservoir water level deficit was more severe in 2015 and total storage deficit was more severe in 2004 with respect to the basin average and locally in the south of the basin this contradicts the local perception however the available data did not cover the entire water level and total storage deficit for 2019 such that the tsdi and wldi remained below zero towards the end of the available time series in june 2020 thus the final duration and severity of the drought of 2019 remains unknown the water levels at kariba reservoir not only depended on precipitation which largely dominates the inflow to the reservoir but also on evaporation from the open water body and reservoir operation determining the amount of water leaving the reservoir that is why low annual rainfall amounts do not necessarily result in low reservoir water levels for example reservoir operation is likely to explain the relatively high reservoir water levels in 2002 despite the very low rainfall and high evaporation in that year figs 2a 2e and 3b the results in this study are sensitive to uncertainties in the satellite observations previous studies illustrated satellite based precipitation observations were sensitive to bias kimani et al 2017 le coz and van de giesen 2020 uncertainties in total water storage anomalies are a result of data post processing including data smoothing using a radius of 300 km which affects the spatial variability blazquez et al 2018 landerer and swenson 2012 note that grace observations were missing for several months as mentioned in section 3 which resulted in missing tsdi values and hence an irregular temporal pattern in fig 2c and d potential and actual evaporation data are prone to uncertainties related to the underlying estimation method and input data feng et al 2019 hobbins et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 altimetry uncertainties for open water bodies range between 0 04 m and 0 36 m depending on the lake size and climate conditions crÃ©taux and birkett 2006 schwatke et al 2015 these uncertainties can affect long term fluctuations in these variables therefore we recommend that these satellite observations are tested against ground observations this step was outside the scope of this study due to the limited in situ data availability previous studies have discussed various reasons for discrepancies between local perception of droughts and satellite based observations first locals often perceive droughts through non climatic factors such as reservoir water level or lack of electricity which is more clearly visible compared to rainfall or total water storage amounts iqbal et al 2018 urquijo and de stefano 2016 second locals often remember most recent and extreme drought events but forget intermediate droughts taylor et al 1988 third local perceptions are often influenced by economic losses such as significant reductions in the expected crop production bola et al 2014 foguesatto et al 2020 meze hausken 2004 hence farmers who experienced large crop failures often relate this to droughts even though the rainfall remained constant they may also fail to take into account that they have expanded their crop production in the past such that the water demand increased in contrast to previous studies this study illustrated the local perception was partially supported and partially contradicted by satellite observations depending on the drought characteristic hydrological variable and location within the basin in other words the simple statement the drought of 2019 was the worst in several decades mentioned in the news media brown 2019 edel 2019 cannot be generalised for example locals in the west of the basin are more likely to consider the drought of 2019 as the most severe in at least 20 years if they mainly rely on rainwater fig 7e instead of groundwater sources fig 7f note that monthly grace observations are dominated by slow processes which include changes in the groundwater system and seasonal variations in all storage components in future studies it would be interesting to include local observations such as the inflow to kariba reservoir reservoir operation reservoir water levels and precipitation data to validate satellite observations in addition the opinions of local experts who are familiar with the region and interview results on local perception should be included as this may vary spatially and could depend on occupation or age in this study the spi was calculated using 12 preceding months section 4 1 to identify extreme droughts since short duration droughts of 3 or 6 months occur more frequently fig 8 however it would be interesting to analyze whether a different drought duration in the spi calculation would reflect the local perception better at a specific location and if so why 7 conclusion the objective of this study was to analyze the drought of 2019 in the zambezi river basin upstream of the kariba reservoir using multiple satellite observations to determine whether it was the most extreme drought in at least 20 years as locally perceived for this purpose we analyzed the drought duration intensity and severity spatially averaged and locally using precipitation total water storage and reservoir water level observations data analysis indicated that the drought of 2019 was the most extreme for at least 24 years when considering the basin averaged annual rainfall local precipitation based drought severity in the north of the basin and reservoir water level however the 2019 drought was the most extreme only in recent decades when considering the basin averaged drought severity according to the precipitation total water storage and reservoir water level note that as the available data did not cover the entire water level and total storage deficit for 2019 the final duration and severity of the drought of 2019 remains unknown therefore it depends on the drought characteristic the hydrological variable considered and the location within the basin whether the drought of 2019 was indeed the most extreme over the last decades as perceived by local people data availability all satellite observations used in this study were obtained from publicly available

areas of algeria tunisia and libya a transboundary cooperation through the sahara and sahel observatory oss was launched between these countries in the mid 90 s nijsten et al 2018 several scientific programmes have been developed to improve the understanding of the hydrologic functions of the nwsas and provide sustainable management scenarios of this resource besbes et al 2003 oss 2003 unesco 1972 one of the pivotal parameters to be defined for sustainability analysis is the estimation of the groundwater budget of the system in particular the recharge rates of the ct and ci aquifers for the nwsas several approaches have been used to assess the recharge including rate localization and mean residence time such as hydrogeological modelling baba sy 2005 baba sy et al 2007 gonÃ§alvÃ¨s et

quality is also pivotal to the elaboration of a sustainable water resource management programme particularly in areas where high salinities are observed several studies have focused on processes controlling the mineralization of groundwater either of the ct or the ci aquifers mainly in algeria and tunisia abdelali et al 2020 abid et al 2009 2010 2012a 2012b ben alaya et al 2014 edmunds et al

chemical and isotopic and residence times of groundwater in these aquifer systems significantly differ lithology geometry and tectonic edmunds et al 2003 guendouz 1985 guendouz and michelot 2006 hadj ammar et al 2014 moulla et al 2012 petersen et al 2018 although all these studies cover a significant part of the nwsas the region that extends between the great occidental and oriental erg sub basins fig 1 has received much less attention than the south western part of the great occidental erg sub basin or the great oriental erg sub basin however this region is important in the global functioning of these aquifers because it corresponds to the mzab ridge see geomorphological units in fig 1 which marks the groundwater divide between these sub basins baba sy 2005 in addition the ci is the principal water resource in ghardaia and el golea regions achour 2013 which during the last decades has become a preferred area for intensive agricultural investments by combining geochemical and isotopic methods the objective is to identify processes governing the hydrochemistry of ci groundwater and explain the spatial variations in groundwater quality in the mzab ridge and surrounding regions here we present major elemental analyses to describe dominant geochemical processes stable isotopic analyses Î´18o and Î´2h to discuss the origin of groundwater and no3 stable isotope analyses to identify the sources of high nitrate concentration in ci groundwaters for the sake of obtaining a complete overview of the ci groundwater characteristics in the north of algerian sahara available data from edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 and darling et al 2018 were also combined with groundwater chemistry and isotopic data collected in the studied area finally in the scope of our investigations the implementation of a multivariate statistical analysis using the self organizing maps soms method is targeted kohonen 1995 peeters et al 2007 2 geographical geological and hydrogeological contexts of the study area the study area is located between 2 8 and 6 1 e longitude and between 30 1 and 33 1 n latitude in the north of the algerian sahara between the towns of ghardaia and el golea fig 1 it covers the mzab ridge and partially the basins located on either side the great occidental and oriental ergs temperatures range between a minimum of 5 c in january and a maximum of 50 c in july annual rainfall is less than 65 mm on average fao climwat 2006 and the rainfall is very irregularly distributed between months and years from a geological point of view the study area is located northwest of the saharan platform domain which extends over the algerian sahara and corresponds to thick phanerozoic sub horizontal and quasi monotonic sedimentary formations 1000 8000 m askri et al 1995 fabre et al 2005 the continental intercalaire term was introduced for the first time by kilian 1931 the meaning has evolved throughout history currently it designates the lower cretaceous shaly sand and sandstone formations from barremian to albian wrapped by clay formations of the upper jurassic below and upper cretaceous above these clastic deposits are continuous over the whole basin figs 1 and 2 from the saharan atlas in the north to the tinrhert plateau in the south and further to the tassili mountains of the hoggar and west to east from the guir saoura valley in western algeria to the libyan desert edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 oss 2003 it has a thickness of 350 m in average varying from 0 m in its southern border to 1000 m under the oriental erg and towards southern tunisia oss 2003 the a a cross section in fig 1 modified from chettih 1995 shows that the south atlas flexure separates the ci layers outcropping in the saharan atlas from their equivalent in the saharan platform in the south where ci layers are buried at great depths askri et al 1995 so hydraulic continuity between these two parts of the ci aquifer is unexpected oss 2003 the b b cross section in fig 1 is situated within the study area which is a part of the saharan platform it was obtained by a simple interpolation between the geological data given in busson 1970 completed by geophysical logging unesco 1972 in the same boreholes piezometric heads for year 2000 were given in the sass project oss 2003 from a lithological point of view heterogeneities can be observed within the ci aquifer in the south el golea it is mainly composed of detrital materials and sandstones sometimes cemented by carbonate minerals however it is clay rich in the northwest ghardaia guerrara towards the northeast touggourt the lithology progressively changes to limestone but in the study area limestone deposits are not so important compared to the rest of the eastern algerian sahara busson 1970 in the great oriental erg sub basin busson 1970 reported that the albian layers contain gypsum and anhydrite in various forms cement fine crystallized intercalations etc the first regional piezometric map was established during the eress project conducted by unesco in 1972 and then it was updated in 2000 as part of the sass project accomplished by the oss in 2003 the latter was added as background for most of our figures it shows that the main recharge area of the ci aquifer is the saharan atlas in the great occidental erg sub basin baba sy 2005 which is the origin of two groundwater flow directions in the great oriental erg sub basin groundwater flows from the west to the east until gabes gulf in tunisia and in the great occidental erg sub basin from north to south and southwest until adrar region baba sy 2005 showed that the ci aquifer is partially unconfined in the great occidental erg sub basin and shallow towards the southwest fig 2 where it is one of the discharge areas the ci aquifer is confined in the other areas of its extension over the algerian sahara and south tunisia the equipotential lines are almost orthogonal to the outcrops of ci layers in the saharan atlas in the north laghouat and biskra regions which means that there is no ongoing flux through the northern limit of the ci aquifer as discussed in the b b cross section fig 1 transmissivity values range from 10 to 40 10 3 m2 s in el golea region south and from 3 to 5 10 3 m2 s in ghardaia ouargla and el oued regions north unesco 1972 this is reflected by the hydraulic gradient which is bigger in the north piezometric curves are closer in addition the hydrochemistry of the ci groundwater is significantly affected by this variation in the lithology this is discussed below the lithological variations and their impact on hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater have led to the definition of useful reservoir b b cross section in fig 1 it corresponds to the parts of the ci aquifer where sandstones and shaly sandstone strata are dominating 50 of shale and contain fresh groundwater dry residue 6 mg l unesco 1972 hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the ci aquifer in algeria have been primarily investigated by edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 and darling et al 2018 they demonstrated that the ci aquifer is hydraulically continuous from west to the east in the great oriental erg sub basin in accordance with the piezometric map using stable isotopes of water they observed large variations between different regions and gave some conclusions that are mentioned and discussed below it can be observed that the heterogeneities are more pronounced within the unconfined ci area than in the confined ci area both for hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics however the causes in differences of the chemical characteristics of ci groundwater throughout the algerian sahara particularly between the north and the south of the mzab ridge have not been explicitly discussed in a previous work we focused on the north of ghardaia region where high concentrations of no3 hakimi dedjell et al 2019 were noticed for the present work nitrate content in the ci groundwater ranges from 0 to 58 mg l which is high for such confined aquifer system to identify the nitrate content origin we analysed no3 stable isotopes 3 groundwater sampling and analysis campaign the sampling campaign took place from february to may 2017 as the first detailed work addressing this problem of developing a high density sampling network in the northwest of the algerian sahara ghardaia and el golea regions a total of 58 wells public and private agricultural farms were sampled fig 2 some localities such as hassi fehal had been never covered before in addition many samples have been taken from recently drilled boreholes a subset of 20 wells were also sampled for the analysis of stable isotopes Î´18o h2o Î´2h h2o Î´18o no3 and Î´15n no3 these wells were selected along groundwater flow directions 2 w e transects in the north and 1 n s transects in the south while two intermediate samples were situated in the middle of the mzab ridge the temperature and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater were measured in the field using a portable multiparameter ysi 556 mps ph measurements were not performed in the field due to technical issues groundwater samples were collected in 200 ml polyethylene vials for the analyses of major and minor ions and in 140 ml polyethylene vials for the determination of dissolved iron and manganese the second bottle was filtered using a 0 45 Î¼m membrane and acidified in the field for water molecule isotope Î´18o no3 and Î´15n no3 analyses 60 ml polyethylene bottles were filled and filtered in the field using a 0 20 Î¼m membrane to eliminate bacterial activity and avoid no3 transformation before analysis analyses were performed by ion chromatography for major elements and atomic absorption spectrometry for trace elements at the aqueous phase analysis laboratory of the university of liÃ¨ge stable isotope analyses were accomplished by the stable isotope laboratory of the helmholtz centre for environmental research in halle germany Î´18o h2o and Î´2h h2o analyses were carried out using a laser cavity ring down spectrometer Î´15n no3 and Î´ 18o no3 isotopes of no3 were determined by the denitrifier method which converts all sampled no3 to n2o jurado et al 2018 and are measured by a delta v plus irms coupled to the thermo scientific gasbench ii the results are expressed in delta Î´ notation and reported in per mil relative to the corresponding vienna international standards the standard mean ocean water vsmow for Î´18o h2o Î´2h h2o and Î´18o no3 and air n2 for Î´15n no3 saturation indices sis were calculated using phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 self organizing maps were generated using the som matlab toolbox vesanto et al 1999 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical and chemical characteristics of ci groundwaters in the sass project oss 2003 it was postulated to divide the ci groundwater samples from the mzab ridge between the great oriental and occidental erg sub basins with the hassi fehal locality as the limit in this paper this hypothesis has been considered as well for consistency with these previous works so the samples from the north of the mzab ridge mainly ghardaia region are considered in conjunction with those from the other localities in the east ouargla touggourt and el oued as the oriental group and those from its south hassi fehal and el golea regions as the occidental group in the next sections our samples together with those from edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 and darling et al 2018 belonging to the confined ci were compiled and discussed but represented in figures with a different symbology that is respected throughout the table containing all data added as a supplementary material the oriental group contained 72 samples and the occidental group contained 28 ec ranges from 340 to 960 Î¼s cm for samples belonging to the occidental group and from 1010 to 3500 Î¼s cm for the oriental group fig 3 temperature values range between 25 34 c and between 25 56 c respectively as can be seen for both parameters the values are lower in the occidental group than in the oriental one the central region hassi fehal is characterized with intermediate values for both parameters fig 3 shows increasing temperature and ec along the we transect which was also demonstrated by edmunds et al 2003 the electrical conductivity increases along the main groundwater flow directions the in situ temperature increases with depth see b b cross section in fig 1 for the oriental group ca concentrations range from 80 to 280 mg l mg from 25 to 100 mg l na from 15 to 630 mg l and k from 2 to 50 mg l regarding anions hco3 concentrations range from 100 to 250 mg l so4 from 80 to 1000 mg l cl from 65 to 650 mg l for the occidental group ca mg na and k range from 30 5 25 and 5 mg l to 80 85 115 and 15 mg l respectively hco3 so4 and cl range from 80 30 and 10 mg l to 240 200 and 140 mg l fig 4 in el golea region the ec ranges around 450 100 Î¼s cm however the ec of the sample hg02 is 1300 Î¼s cm it is characterized by the highest concentrations for all ions compared to other samples in el golea this can be seen in the box plot of the occidental group where the maxima values which represent hg02 characteristics are much bigger than the 3rd quartile in addition hg02 is situated close to the el golea lake this probably indicates that there are some leaks in this well from the shallow aquifer draining the evaporated water from the lake for instance no3 exceeds the who standard guideline for drinking water fixed at 50 mg l who 2017 fig 3 presents the spatial repartition of chemical type according to the degree of mineralization using a stiff diagram stiff 1951 there are two main water types for the oriental group the samples can be characterized as so4 cl na type and for the occidental group they predominantly belong to the hco3 so4 cl ca type in order to better describe the interaction between groundwater and the geological matrix there are multiple approaches allowing a better understanding of the origin of mineralization and even to deduce which minerals are present in the aquifer the most common are saturation indices si as defined by alley 1993 and plummer et al 1976 the si values range from 8 1 to 5 2 for halite from 2 5 to 0 6 for gypsum anhydrite in same range and from 0 4 to 0 6 for calcite aragonite in same range therefore the ci groundwater is undersaturated with respect to halite and gypsum and in equilibrium with respect to calcite fig 5 it can also be observed that si values of the occidental group el golea are smaller than those reported in the oriental group ghardaia ouargla and el oued for all minerals the new data shows clearly the variations in hydrochemical characteristics of ci groundwater between both sides of the mzab ridge this difference is due to either lithological characteristics of the aquifer and or to residence time and groundwater age as explained in section 2 the ci aquifer is more sand enriched so more conductive in el golea region such low values of saturation indices for halite and gypsum seem to indicate their absence in the geological matrix however the logarithmic tendency curve of their si s are strongly correlated with ec rÂ² 0 9 si is calculated with logarithmic equation actually tellam 1995 has calculated si for saline groundwater in permo triassic sandstone aquifer he found that in samples with gypsum and halite si s equal to 0 5 and 1 respectively so4 and cl concentrations were approximately 3600 and 10 000 mg l respectively clearly extremely high concentrations are necessary to approach equilibrium with respect to gypsum and halite thus we deduce that the existence of evaporitic minerals in the ci aquifer can be supposed even in small proportion those results show the major contribution of evaporitic minerals in ci groundwater mineralization all over its extension but their concentrations in groundwater are diluted however the bicarbonate type in el golea region can be explained by the interaction of ci groundwater with the calcite cement of sandstone to verify this hypothesis molar ratios using minor elements such as strontium and bromide are widely used in the literature to deduce the aquifer lithology alcalÃ¡ and custodio 2008 ben alaya et al 2014 bouchaou et al 2008 hem 1985 herczeg et al 1991 nÃ©grel and petelet giraud 2005 ouhamdouch et al 2017 sr ca ratios range from 0 2 to 2 5 fig 5 according to edmunds et al 2003 this ratio is almost constant in the great oriental erg sub basin which should imply the dissolution of gypsum this is in good agreement with the aforementioned geological data in addition bromide is a good conservative anion behaving similarly as chloride most of the samples have a br cl ratio less than 0 15 fig 5 which is the lower limit for seawater salinization herczeg and edmunds 2000 so ci groundwater salinity is derived from dissolution of continental halite that is contained in the aquifer 4 2 stable isotopes of water molecule stable isotopes of the water molecule Î´18o vs Î´2h are presented in fig 6 the isotopic composition of ci groundwater in algeria and tunisia ranges from 9 2 to 2 3 for Î´18o and from 69 2 to 34 8 for Î´2h most of the samples from the ci aquifer lay below both the gmwl of craig craig 1961 and sfax local meteoric lines south tunisia defined by maliki et al 2000 and abid et al 2009 the closest dataset for rainwater available in the literature the scatter plot of ci groundwater situated inside of the sass basin in algeria follows the trendline Î´2h 3 01 Î´18o 36 70 showing that the ci groundwater has undergone evaporative processes in addition the samples from bordering regions saharan atlas and saoura valley follow the trendline Î´2h 3 07 Î´18o 31 39 groundwater from the confined and unconfined ci aquifer show different behaviours on the one hand groundwater from the confined part except for the samples from south of el golea are the most depleted Î´18o 6 while Î´18o for groundwater from the unconfined part of the aquifer is more variable from 8 to 2 5 despite the big distances separating samples from the confined ci situated in the great oriental erg sub basin their isotopic composition is more homogeneous than that from the unconfined ci situated in the great occidental erg sub basin this has been reported since the first studies on the stable isotope composition of the ci groundwaters conrad and fontes 1970 gonfiantini et al 1974 they concluded that more variability in isotopic composition induces more variation in groundwater origins and recharge conditions and vice versa gonfiantini et al 1974 and edmunds et al 2003 confirmed that ci isotopic composition under the great oriental erg sub basin is the initial signature of an old recharge because the ci groundwater there is protected from the external input or evaporation using tritium content moulla et al 2012 highlight the existence of modern recharge in saoura valley shallow aquifer which shows also an evaporative signature moreover gonfiantini et al 1974 and edmunds et al 2003 showed that ci groundwater contains around 55 pmc of 14c in gourara region and the saharan atlas successively where the ci layers are unconfined these activities indicate the ingoing of relatively modern recharge in those regions so the trendline equation Î´2h 3 07Î´18o 31 39 which includes the samples from the unconfined aquifer should represent modern saharan groundwater in addition the ci groundwater isotopic signature is significantly depleted relative to weighted mean modern rainfall in sahara Î´18o 5 1 Î´2h 26 calculated by edmunds et al 2003 so the ci groundwater cannot be in any way derived from the actual rainfall as concluded by darling et al 2018 according to rozanski et al 1993 these depleted values seem to indicate that ci groundwaters were infiltrated under a cooler and or wetter climate regime than today this is in agreement with recharge temperatures calculated by guendouz et al 1997 using noble gases which were 2 3 c cooler than the present mean annual temperature of 21 c moreover several studies have showed that the most important recharge occurred during the late pleistocene when the paleoclimate in the north sahara and sahel regions was wetter than today e g beyerle et al 2003 edmunds 2009 knowing that the ci aquifer under the great occidental erg sub basin is unconfined and sometimes covered by pervious layers of mio plio quaternary almost dunes the samples from el golea region should be more exposed to evaporation and more enriched in stable isotopes this corroborates with the work of gonfiantini et al 1974 who concluded that ci groundwaters in the great occidental erg sub basin indicate an evaporation mechanism probably peculiar to the dune systems which gives rise to heavy isotope enrichment compared with the recharge of other types of formations however samples situated downgradient in the south of el golea region hassi gara and krechba where ci is confined are the most enriched samples of all over the confined ci Î´18o 6 these groundwaters could be the result of a mixture between old groundwater and recently evaporated water another possible explanation is that the recharge area for ci in el golea region is different between the north el golea city and the south hassi gara and krechba in summary end members of the scatter plot correspond to the most depleted samples from the confined ci under the great oriental erg ouargla el oued and the most enriched samples from the occidental basin gourara region finally edmunds et al 2003 concluded that there is no correlation between Î´18o and Î´2h of ci groundwater and its age in the great oriental erg sub basin however this global vision demonstrates that there is an isotopic depletion that is proportional to the distance from the recharge area and thus to the age of groundwater the most enriched groundwaters are situated in the great occidental erg sub basin where ci is partially unconfined to verify the hypotheses and the conclusions of this section it is likely that the use of radioactive isotopes and noble gases would provide more clarification it is the next step of our research project 4 3 multivariate analysis with a self organizing map som the self organizing map som technique is an artificial neural network ann algorithm based on unsupervised learning it is a powerful tool for exploring and clustering large and multivariate datasets kohonen 1995 this technique has been widely applied is various fields of groundwater quality e g hong and rosen 2001 jurado et al 2018 tobiszewski et al 2012 the main objective of som is to reduce the dimensionality of datasets for easier visualization of their variability first all samples are normalized and introduced as input vectors and then the algorithm runs an iterative training process to join each sample to one node of the artificially created network corresponding to output vectors the euclidean distance between these two vectors should be as small as possible unlike ordinary multivariate statistical techniques som is able to consider non linear relationships between variables and run with missing data as a result the som produces two kinds of outputs 1 a u matrix showing the observation s position and defining clusters using k mean clustering methods where the number is chosen by the user the closer the two individuals are the more they look alike 2 the 2d component planes showing the values of each variable according to the precedent matrix the observation of the component planes allows deductive relationships and correlations between variables based on their similarities or dissimilarities peeters et al 2007 we chose the som technique to discuss two phenomena fig 7 i first defining redox conditions at the captive part of the ci aquifer using results of the available indicators of these processes namely no3 and fe mn ii in addition we included other susceptible variables to explain the evolution of fluoride concentrations in ci groundwater a distribution of the samples into two distinct groups oriental and occidental was clearly shown by the u matrix the ocd cluster groups the samples belonging to the great occidental erg sub basin in addition a set of clusters or1 4 includes the samples belonging to the great oriental erg sub basin with an arrangement according to the direction of flow mentioned by the arrows the component matrix shows that Î´18o of the ci groundwater is inversely correlated with the electrical conductivities ecs as demonstrated in the previous section the enrichment of Î´18o is inversely correlated with the residence time as well as with ec samples from the occidental cluster ocd are the most enriched and the less mineralized no3 concentrations range between 3 and 75 mg l for ocd or1 or2 and or3 clusters and they are less than 1 mg l in or4 cluster it can be noticed that they significantly decrease downgradient the component matrix shows that fe mn is inversely correlated with no3 these elements have the highest concentrations in the downgradient or4 cluster this corresponds to residence time and the predominance of reduced conditions downgradient of the confined ci actually after consuming of no3 by denitrification fe and mn become the terminal electron acceptors they are reduced and solubilized in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 this is in agreement with the results of edmunds et al 2003 who showed that even if the oxidizing conditions dominate in the captive part of the ci south of laghouat rd samples and approximately on the whole region of ghardaia samples br gr gd and zf they begin reducing in the east of the sub basin of grand erg oriental samples tg og and od it can be noted that no3 concentrations are higher upgradient of the oriental clusters or1 2 than the occidental clusters ocd that are also characterized by a depletion in Î´18o the previous section had already concluded that the palaeoclimatic conditions of the ci recharge were wetter and colder in the great oriental erg sub basin than in the great occidental erg in a similar context edmunds and gaye 1997 studying high nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the sahel countries concluded there is also evidence that high ratios relate to wetter and low values to more arid climatic periods another phenomenon is the decrease in fluoride concentrations downgradient from 1 4 to 0 4 mg l within the clusters of the oriental clusters or1 4 paradoxically this decrease is not accompanied by an increase in the saturation index of fluorite the main mineral controlling its concentration in water this would thus indicate an evolution towards the precipitation of this mineral in contrast there was a decrease from 0 6 to 1 7 which implies a tendency towards dissolution if the mineral would have been present moreover in the literature fluoride mobility is considered a ph dependent process the fixation of f following anionic exchange induces the release of oh which would increase the ph paradoxically for the oriental clusters a decrease in ph can be observed downgradient with a decrease in f concentrations thus the hypothesis of anionic f oh change as a cause of decrease in f levels can be excluded the negative correlation of the f with Î´18o is also observable in our dataset this reinforces the hypothesis of edmunds et al 2003 that f contents are influenced by palaeoclimatic conditions during recharge samples located upgradient of the oriental clusters or1 and or2 were exposed to more intense evaporation than those located downgradient or4 on the other hand the lowest levels were observed in the occidental cluster ocd whereas the stable isotope data show that these waters are the most evaporated according to edmunds and smedley 2013 these concentrations are specific to the rainfall signature and their variations are related to evaporation 4 4 nitrate origin fig 8 shows that Î´15n no3 ranges from 1 9 to 9 5 and that Î´18o no3 ranges from 2 6 to 12 6 except for three samples hg03 gr01 and og02 fig 8 based on the classification of mayer 2005 which is an updated version of that of kendall 1998 such low values reflect soil nitrification processes a natural origin of no3 although reported concentrations are high og01 and tg01 samples contain less than 0 3 mg l of no3 which is not enough to analyse the no3 isotopes they are situated downgradient northeast of the study area in the reducing zone according to edmunds et al 2003 therefore such low concentrations can be explained by an ongoing denitrification process of reaction until now many studies have reported high values of no3 in the sandstone aquifers of arid zones in australia barnes et al 1992 in sahelian countries edmunds and gaye 1997 and in the kalahari desert heaton et al 1983 stadler et al 2008 2012 they concluded by using different methods that nitrates originate from natural sources some studies have also proven that soil can contain naturally high values of no3 in arid zones schwiede et al 2005 stone and edmunds 2014 walvoord et al 2003 gr01 and og02 samples were strongly enriched in both Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 knowing that their no3 concentrations are 2 7 and 3 9 mg l respectively and they are situated downgradient close to og01 and tg01 their positions in the plot show that they are situated in the denitrification trajectory sample hg03 was strongly enriched in Î´18o no3 with isotope signatures close to no3 derived from synthetic nitrate containing fertilizers the sampled borehole was located on agricultural land and was used for irrigation where pollution may have occurred the position of sample hg02 in the boxes representing the origin of no3 with respect to the isotopic composition confirms that its high mineralization is due to a mixing with natural evaporated water that does not originate from polluted groundwater the oriental group is more enriched in no3 isotopes than the occidental group this is most likely to be due to partial denitrification occurring in this part of the study area or to differences in recharge conditions 5 conclusions this paper fills the gap in the knowledge of continental intercalaire aquifer hydrogeochemistry on both sides of the mzab ridge immediate vicinity it can be concluded that groundwater in the confined area of the ci aquifer under the mzab ridge and the great oriental erg sub basin behaves differently than that in the unconfined zone in the great occidental erg sub basin in the first area the characteristics are primarily controlled by water rock interactions that involve residence time but in the second zone some external factors disturb those interactions using classical methods of hydrochemistry isotope evidence and classification techniques ci groundwater in the confined area is proven to belongs to two different groups according to their geographical location namely oriental ghardaia ouargla and el oued regions and occidental hassi fehal and el golea regions groups with distinct and specific hydrochemical characteristics for each region the observed divide between these two groups is not strict the samples obtained from locations situated between 31 55 and 31 57 n latitude hf01 and hf02 represent a transitional member from the hydrochemical and the isotopic perspective this finding corroborates the observations from the regional piezometric map suggesting a groundwater divide situated in this zone it was clear that the variations in hydrochemistry of the ci groundwater were largely attributed to the impact of aquifer lithology moreover as could be expected in such vast transboundary aquifer the residence time also has a pronounced influence on the one hand in the great occidental erg sub basin the ci aquifer is sand enriched and the groundwater flowing through is poorly mineralized mainly it could be attributed to the hco3 ca water type though it becomes progressively enriched in so4 and cl downgradient to the south on the other hand in the great oriental erg sub basin the ci aquifer is clay and gypsum enriched here the groundwater is highly mineralized and predominantly belongs to the so4 cl na water type minor element ratios indicate that the salinization originates from dissolution of continental evaporates no3 stable isotope analysis shows that the high nitrate content has a predominantly natural origin of soil nitrification however the denitrification processes are insignificant in the study area even though the ci aquifer is confined except downgradient in the northeastern part of the study area stable isotopes of water molecules from the ci groundwater have shown that the most depleted samples Î´18o 6 are those situated in the confined area within the great oriental erg sub basin including north of the mzab ridge and south tunisia their isotopic composition is homogeneous representing apparently the older meteoric water infiltrated under palaeoclimatic regime cooler and wetter than the present day climate moreover the most enriched and heterogeneous samples are those belonging to unconfined ci mainly the great occidental erg sub basin the ci groundwater lies along the mixing line Î´2h 3 01 Î´18o 36 70 the end members correspond to the most depleted groundwater from the confined ci under the great oriental erg ouargla el oued in one side and in another side to the most enriched samples from gourara region in the great occidental erg sub basin in el golea some samples are relatively enriched in both Î´18o and Î´2h which suggested the existence of mixing of the typical old ci groundwater with younger and evaporated water infiltrated under the dune of the great occidental erg as a follow up for this work we are planning to use cosmogenic isotopes 14c 36cl to determine the residence time of the ci groundwater and noble gases to understand the climatic conditions during its recharge in order to verify some of the abovementioned hypotheses more generally we recommend placing greater focus on the extreme northwestern zone near the recharge area el bayadh region both from the quantitative and the qualitative viewpoint this would allow a better understanding of modern recharge reinforcing thus the strategies aiming at a sustainable exploitation of this invaluable resource credit authorship contribution statement youcef hakimi conceptualization data curation

8261,study region north of sahara algeria study focus the effects of water rock interactions and hydrodynamic conditions on the characteristics of groundwater in the continental intercalaire aquifer ci are demonstrated using hydrochemical and isotopic data from the mzab ridge new hydrological insights the results confirm that ci groundwater in the oriental basin is highly mineralized 1010 ec 3500 Î¼s cm and is of the so4 cl na type however it is poorly mineralized 340 ec 960 in the occidental basin and predominantly belongs to the hco3 ca type the important contribution of evaporite minerals has been deduced using saturation indices and minor element ratios of sr ca and br cl this is explained by lithological heterogeneities within the ci aquifer and corroborates the observations from regional piezometric features which suggest a groundwater divide located between 31 55 and 31 57 n latitude Î´18o no3 and Î´15n no3 analyses show that no3 has a predominantly natural origin which is soil nitrification even for the high concentrations exceeding 50 mg l ci groundwaters are highly depleted in both Î´18o and Î´2h compared to modern rainfall isotopic signatures the most depleted ones are those situated in the great oriental erg sub basin isotopic values as low as Î´18o 6 can be taken as the limit for groundwater that is typically old in the el golea region isotopic enrichment seems to indicate mixing between old groundwater and evaporation affected groundwater infiltrating through the dunes of the great occidental erg keywords north western sahara aquifer system continental intercalaire aquifer mzab ridge hydrogeochemistry water stable isotopes som 1 introduction the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas is one of the largest transboundary aquifer tba systems and the second in size in the world after the nubian sandstone igrac 2015 shared between algeria tunisia and libya the nwsas covers an area of more than 1 million kmÂ² oss 2003 important groundwater reserves of this multilayer aquifer estimated to be 31 000 109 m3 baba sy 2005 are divided into two aquifers the lower continental intercalaire ci and the upper complexe terminal ct castany 1982 excessive groundwater mining from these aquifers mainly for irrigated oasis agriculture has led to a general piezometric head decline as well as groundwater quality degradation oss 2003 in many parts of the aquifer system groundwater shows high salinities above the quality guidelines for domestic or irrigation uses because of its strategic importance for the remote semi arid and arid areas of algeria tunisia and libya a transboundary cooperation through the sahara and sahel observatory oss was launched between these countries in the mid 90 s nijsten et al 2018 several scientific programmes have been developed to improve the understanding of the hydrologic functions of the nwsas and provide sustainable management scenarios of this resource besbes et al 2003 oss 2003 unesco 1972 one of the pivotal parameters to be defined for sustainability analysis is the estimation of the groundwater budget of the system in particular the recharge rates of the ct and ci aquifers for the nwsas several approaches have been used to assess the recharge including rate localization and mean residence time such as hydrogeological modelling baba sy 2005 baba sy et al 2007 gonÃ§alvÃ¨s et

2015 gonfiantini et al 1974 guendouz and michelot 2006 matsumoto et al 2020 petersen et al 2013 2018 trabelsi et al 2009 the identification of geochemical processes affecting groundwater chemistry and quality is also pivotal to the elaboration of a sustainable water resource management programme particularly in areas where high salinities are observed several studies have focused on processes controlling the mineralization of groundwater either of the ct or the ci aquifers mainly in algeria and tunisia abdelali et al 2020 abid et al 2009 2010 2012a 2012b ben alaya et al 2014 edmunds et al

chemical and isotopic and residence times of groundwater in these aquifer systems significantly differ lithology geometry and tectonic edmunds et al 2003 guendouz 1985 guendouz and michelot 2006 hadj ammar et al 2014 moulla et al 2012 petersen et al 2018 although all these studies cover a significant part of the nwsas the region that extends between the great occidental and oriental erg sub basins fig 1 has received much less attention than the south western part of the great occidental erg sub basin or the great oriental erg sub basin however this region is important in the global functioning of these aquifers because it corresponds to the mzab ridge see geomorphological units in fig 1 which marks the groundwater divide between these sub basins baba sy 2005 in addition the ci is the principal water resource in ghardaia and el golea regions achour 2013 which during the last decades has become a preferred area for intensive agricultural investments by combining geochemical and isotopic methods the objective is to identify processes governing the hydrochemistry of ci groundwater and explain the spatial variations in groundwater quality in the mzab ridge and surrounding regions here we present major elemental analyses to describe dominant geochemical processes stable isotopic analyses Î´18o and Î´2h to discuss the origin of groundwater and no3 stable isotope analyses to identify the sources of high nitrate concentration in ci groundwaters for the sake of obtaining a complete overview of the ci groundwater characteristics in the north of algerian sahara available data from edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 and darling et al 2018 were also combined with groundwater chemistry and isotopic data collected in the studied area finally in the scope of our investigations the implementation of a multivariate statistical analysis using the self organizing maps soms method is targeted kohonen 1995 peeters et al 2007 2 geographical geological and hydrogeological contexts of the study area the study area is located between 2 8 and 6 1 e longitude and between 30 1 and 33 1 n latitude in the north of the algerian sahara between the towns of ghardaia and el golea fig 1 it covers the mzab ridge and partially the basins located on either side the great occidental and oriental ergs temperatures range between a minimum of 5 c in january and a maximum of 50 c in july annual rainfall is less than 65 mm on average fao climwat 2006 and the rainfall is very irregularly distributed between months and years from a geological point of view the study area is located northwest of the saharan platform domain which extends over the algerian sahara and corresponds to thick phanerozoic sub horizontal and quasi monotonic sedimentary formations 1000 8000 m askri et al 1995 fabre et al 2005 the continental intercalaire term was introduced for the first time by kilian 1931 the meaning has evolved throughout history currently it designates the lower cretaceous shaly sand and sandstone formations from barremian to albian wrapped by clay formations of the upper jurassic below and upper cretaceous above these clastic deposits are continuous over the whole basin figs 1 and 2 from the saharan atlas in the north to the tinrhert plateau in the south and further to the tassili mountains of the hoggar and west to east from the guir saoura valley in western algeria to the libyan desert edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 oss 2003 it has a thickness of 350 m in average varying from 0 m in its southern border to 1000 m under the oriental erg and towards southern tunisia oss 2003 the a a cross section in fig 1 modified from chettih 1995 shows that the south atlas flexure separates the ci layers outcropping in the saharan atlas from their equivalent in the saharan platform in the south where ci layers are buried at great depths askri et al 1995 so hydraulic continuity between these two parts of the ci aquifer is unexpected oss 2003 the b b cross section in fig 1 is situated within the study area which is a part of the saharan platform it was obtained by a simple interpolation between the geological data given in busson 1970 completed by geophysical logging unesco 1972 in the same boreholes piezometric heads for year 2000 were given in the sass project oss 2003 from a lithological point of view heterogeneities can be observed within the ci aquifer in the south el golea it is mainly composed of detrital materials and sandstones sometimes cemented by carbonate minerals however it is clay rich in the northwest ghardaia guerrara towards the northeast touggourt the lithology progressively changes to limestone but in the study area limestone deposits are not so important compared to the rest of the eastern algerian sahara busson 1970 in the great oriental erg sub basin busson 1970 reported that the albian layers contain gypsum and anhydrite in various forms cement fine crystallized intercalations etc the first regional piezometric map was established during the eress project conducted by unesco in 1972 and then it was updated in 2000 as part of the sass project accomplished by the oss in 2003 the latter was added as background for most of our figures it shows that the main recharge area of the ci aquifer is the saharan atlas in the great occidental erg sub basin baba sy 2005 which is the origin of two groundwater flow directions in the great oriental erg sub basin groundwater flows from the west to the east until gabes gulf in tunisia and in the great occidental erg sub basin from north to south and southwest until adrar region baba sy 2005 showed that the ci aquifer is partially unconfined in the great occidental erg sub basin and shallow towards the southwest fig 2 where it is one of the discharge areas the ci aquifer is confined in the other areas of its extension over the algerian sahara and south tunisia the equipotential lines are almost orthogonal to the outcrops of ci layers in the saharan atlas in the north laghouat and biskra regions which means that there is no ongoing flux through the northern limit of the ci aquifer as discussed in the b b cross section fig 1 transmissivity values range from 10 to 40 10 3 m2 s in el golea region south and from 3 to 5 10 3 m2 s in ghardaia ouargla and el oued regions north unesco 1972 this is reflected by the hydraulic gradient which is bigger in the north piezometric curves are closer in addition the hydrochemistry of the ci groundwater is significantly affected by this variation in the lithology this is discussed below the lithological variations and their impact on hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater have led to the definition of useful reservoir b b cross section in fig 1 it corresponds to the parts of the ci aquifer where sandstones and shaly sandstone strata are dominating 50 of shale and contain fresh groundwater dry residue 6 mg l unesco 1972 hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the ci aquifer in algeria have been primarily investigated by edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 and darling et al 2018 they demonstrated that the ci aquifer is hydraulically continuous from west to the east in the great oriental erg sub basin in accordance with the piezometric map using stable isotopes of water they observed large variations between different regions and gave some conclusions that are mentioned and discussed below it can be observed that the heterogeneities are more pronounced within the unconfined ci area than in the confined ci area both for hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics however the causes in differences of the chemical characteristics of ci groundwater throughout the algerian sahara particularly between the north and the south of the mzab ridge have not been explicitly discussed in a previous work we focused on the north of ghardaia region where high concentrations of no3 hakimi dedjell et al 2019 were noticed for the present work nitrate content in the ci groundwater ranges from 0 to 58 mg l which is high for such confined aquifer system to identify the nitrate content origin we analysed no3 stable isotopes 3 groundwater sampling and analysis campaign the sampling campaign took place from february to may 2017 as the first detailed work addressing this problem of developing a high density sampling network in the northwest of the algerian sahara ghardaia and el golea regions a total of 58 wells public and private agricultural farms were sampled fig 2 some localities such as hassi fehal had been never covered before in addition many samples have been taken from recently drilled boreholes a subset of 20 wells were also sampled for the analysis of stable isotopes Î´18o h2o Î´2h h2o Î´18o no3 and Î´15n no3 these wells were selected along groundwater flow directions 2 w e transects in the north and 1 n s transects in the south while two intermediate samples were situated in the middle of the mzab ridge the temperature and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater were measured in the field using a portable multiparameter ysi 556 mps ph measurements were not performed in the field due to technical issues groundwater samples were collected in 200 ml polyethylene vials for the analyses of major and minor ions and in 140 ml polyethylene vials for the determination of dissolved iron and manganese the second bottle was filtered using a 0 45 Î¼m membrane and acidified in the field for water molecule isotope Î´18o no3 and Î´15n no3 analyses 60 ml polyethylene bottles were filled and filtered in the field using a 0 20 Î¼m membrane to eliminate bacterial activity and avoid no3 transformation before analysis analyses were performed by ion chromatography for major elements and atomic absorption spectrometry for trace elements at the aqueous phase analysis laboratory of the university of liÃ¨ge stable isotope analyses were accomplished by the stable isotope laboratory of the helmholtz centre for environmental research in halle germany Î´18o h2o and Î´2h h2o analyses were carried out using a laser cavity ring down spectrometer Î´15n no3 and Î´ 18o no3 isotopes of no3 were determined by the denitrifier method which converts all sampled no3 to n2o jurado et al 2018 and are measured by a delta v plus irms coupled to the thermo scientific gasbench ii the results are expressed in delta Î´ notation and reported in per mil relative to the corresponding vienna international standards the standard mean ocean water vsmow for Î´18o h2o Î´2h h2o and Î´18o no3 and air n2 for Î´15n no3 saturation indices sis were calculated using phreeqc code parkhurst and appelo 2013 self organizing maps were generated using the som matlab toolbox vesanto et al 1999 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical and chemical characteristics of ci groundwaters in the sass project oss 2003 it was postulated to divide the ci groundwater samples from the mzab ridge between the great oriental and occidental erg sub basins with the hassi fehal locality as the limit in this paper this hypothesis has been considered as well for consistency with these previous works so the samples from the north of the mzab ridge mainly ghardaia region are considered in conjunction with those from the other localities in the east ouargla touggourt and el oued as the oriental group and those from its south hassi fehal and el golea regions as the occidental group in the next sections our samples together with those from edmunds et al 2003 moulla et al 2012 and darling et al 2018 belonging to the confined ci were compiled and discussed but represented in figures with a different symbology that is respected throughout the table containing all data added as a supplementary material the oriental group contained 72 samples and the occidental group contained 28 ec ranges from 340 to 960 Î¼s cm for samples belonging to the occidental group and from 1010 to 3500 Î¼s cm for the oriental group fig 3 temperature values range between 25 34 c and between 25 56 c respectively as can be seen for both parameters the values are lower in the occidental group than in the oriental one the central region hassi fehal is characterized with intermediate values for both parameters fig 3 shows increasing temperature and ec along the we transect which was also demonstrated by edmunds et al 2003 the electrical conductivity increases along the main groundwater flow directions the in situ temperature increases with depth see b b cross section in fig 1 for the oriental group ca concentrations range from 80 to 280 mg l mg from 25 to 100 mg l na from 15 to 630 mg l and k from 2 to 50 mg l regarding anions hco3 concentrations range from 100 to 250 mg l so4 from 80 to 1000 mg l cl from 65 to 650 mg l for the occidental group ca mg na and k range from 30 5 25 and 5 mg l to 80 85 115 and 15 mg l respectively hco3 so4 and cl range from 80 30 and 10 mg l to 240 200 and 140 mg l fig 4 in el golea region the ec ranges around 450 100 Î¼s cm however the ec of the sample hg02 is 1300 Î¼s cm it is characterized by the highest concentrations for all ions compared to other samples in el golea this can be seen in the box plot of the occidental group where the maxima values which represent hg02 characteristics are much bigger than the 3rd quartile in addition hg02 is situated close to the el golea lake this probably indicates that there are some leaks in this well from the shallow aquifer draining the evaporated water from the lake for instance no3 exceeds the who standard guideline for drinking water fixed at 50 mg l who 2017 fig 3 presents the spatial repartition of chemical type according to the degree of mineralization using a stiff diagram stiff 1951 there are two main water types for the oriental group the samples can be characterized as so4 cl na type and for the occidental group they predominantly belong to the hco3 so4 cl ca type in order to better describe the interaction between groundwater and the geological matrix there are multiple approaches allowing a better understanding of the origin of mineralization and even to deduce which minerals are present in the aquifer the most common are saturation indices si as defined by alley 1993 and plummer et al 1976 the si values range from 8 1 to 5 2 for halite from 2 5 to 0 6 for gypsum anhydrite in same range and from 0 4 to 0 6 for calcite aragonite in same range therefore the ci groundwater is undersaturated with respect to halite and gypsum and in equilibrium with respect to calcite fig 5 it can also be observed that si values of the occidental group el golea are smaller than those reported in the oriental group ghardaia ouargla and el oued for all minerals the new data shows clearly the variations in hydrochemical characteristics of ci groundwater between both sides of the mzab ridge this difference is due to either lithological characteristics of the aquifer and or to residence time and groundwater age as explained in section 2 the ci aquifer is more sand enriched so more conductive in el golea region such low values of saturation indices for halite and gypsum seem to indicate their absence in the geological matrix however the logarithmic tendency curve of their si s are strongly correlated with ec rÂ² 0 9 si is calculated with logarithmic equation actually tellam 1995 has calculated si for saline groundwater in permo triassic sandstone aquifer he found that in samples with gypsum and halite si s equal to 0 5 and 1 respectively so4 and cl concentrations were approximately 3600 and 10 000 mg l respectively clearly extremely high concentrations are necessary to approach equilibrium with respect to gypsum and halite thus we deduce that the existence of evaporitic minerals in the ci aquifer can be supposed even in small proportion those results show the major contribution of evaporitic minerals in ci groundwater mineralization all over its extension but their concentrations in groundwater are diluted however the bicarbonate type in el golea region can be explained by the interaction of ci groundwater with the calcite cement of sandstone to verify this hypothesis molar ratios using minor elements such as strontium and bromide are widely used in the literature to deduce the aquifer lithology alcalÃ¡ and custodio 2008 ben alaya et al 2014 bouchaou et al 2008 hem 1985 herczeg et al 1991 nÃ©grel and petelet giraud 2005 ouhamdouch et al 2017 sr ca ratios range from 0 2 to 2 5 fig 5 according to edmunds et al 2003 this ratio is almost constant in the great oriental erg sub basin which should imply the dissolution of gypsum this is in good agreement with the aforementioned geological data in addition bromide is a good conservative anion behaving similarly as chloride most of the samples have a br cl ratio less than 0 15 fig 5 which is the lower limit for seawater salinization herczeg and edmunds 2000 so ci groundwater salinity is derived from dissolution of continental halite that is contained in the aquifer 4 2 stable isotopes of water molecule stable isotopes of the water molecule Î´18o vs Î´2h are presented in fig 6 the isotopic composition of ci groundwater in algeria and tunisia ranges from 9 2 to 2 3 for Î´18o and from 69 2 to 34 8 for Î´2h most of the samples from the ci aquifer lay below both the gmwl of craig craig 1961 and sfax local meteoric lines south tunisia defined by maliki et al 2000 and abid et al 2009 the closest dataset for rainwater available in the literature the scatter plot of ci groundwater situated inside of the sass basin in algeria follows the trendline Î´2h 3 01 Î´18o 36 70 showing that the ci groundwater has undergone evaporative processes in addition the samples from bordering regions saharan atlas and saoura valley follow the trendline Î´2h 3 07 Î´18o 31 39 groundwater from the confined and unconfined ci aquifer show different behaviours on the one hand groundwater from the confined part except for the samples from south of el golea are the most depleted Î´18o 6 while Î´18o for groundwater from the unconfined part of the aquifer is more variable from 8 to 2 5 despite the big distances separating samples from the confined ci situated in the great oriental erg sub basin their isotopic composition is more homogeneous than that from the unconfined ci situated in the great occidental erg sub basin this has been reported since the first studies on the stable isotope composition of the ci groundwaters conrad and fontes 1970 gonfiantini et al 1974 they concluded that more variability in isotopic composition induces more variation in groundwater origins and recharge conditions and vice versa gonfiantini et al 1974 and edmunds et al 2003 confirmed that ci isotopic composition under the great oriental erg sub basin is the initial signature of an old recharge because the ci groundwater there is protected from the external input or evaporation using tritium content moulla et al 2012 highlight the existence of modern recharge in saoura valley shallow aquifer which shows also an evaporative signature moreover gonfiantini et al 1974 and edmunds et al 2003 showed that ci groundwater contains around 55 pmc of 14c in gourara region and the saharan atlas successively where the ci layers are unconfined these activities indicate the ingoing of relatively modern recharge in those regions so the trendline equation Î´2h 3 07Î´18o 31 39 which includes the samples from the unconfined aquifer should represent modern saharan groundwater in addition the ci groundwater isotopic signature is significantly depleted relative to weighted mean modern rainfall in sahara Î´18o 5 1 Î´2h 26 calculated by edmunds et al 2003 so the ci groundwater cannot be in any way derived from the actual rainfall as concluded by darling et al 2018 according to rozanski et al 1993 these depleted values seem to indicate that ci groundwaters were infiltrated under a cooler and or wetter climate regime than today this is in agreement with recharge temperatures calculated by guendouz et al 1997 using noble gases which were 2 3 c cooler than the present mean annual temperature of 21 c moreover several studies have showed that the most important recharge occurred during the late pleistocene when the paleoclimate in the north sahara and sahel regions was wetter than today e g beyerle et al 2003 edmunds 2009 knowing that the ci aquifer under the great occidental erg sub basin is unconfined and sometimes covered by pervious layers of mio plio quaternary almost dunes the samples from el golea region should be more exposed to evaporation and more enriched in stable isotopes this corroborates with the work of gonfiantini et al 1974 who concluded that ci groundwaters in the great occidental erg sub basin indicate an evaporation mechanism probably peculiar to the dune systems which gives rise to heavy isotope enrichment compared with the recharge of other types of formations however samples situated downgradient in the south of el golea region hassi gara and krechba where ci is confined are the most enriched samples of all over the confined ci Î´18o 6 these groundwaters could be the result of a mixture between old groundwater and recently evaporated water another possible explanation is that the recharge area for ci in el golea region is different between the north el golea city and the south hassi gara and krechba in summary end members of the scatter plot correspond to the most depleted samples from the confined ci under the great oriental erg ouargla el oued and the most enriched samples from the occidental basin gourara region finally edmunds et al 2003 concluded that there is no correlation between Î´18o and Î´2h of ci groundwater and its age in the great oriental erg sub basin however this global vision demonstrates that there is an isotopic depletion that is proportional to the distance from the recharge area and thus to the age of groundwater the most enriched groundwaters are situated in the great occidental erg sub basin where ci is partially unconfined to verify the hypotheses and the conclusions of this section it is likely that the use of radioactive isotopes and noble gases would provide more clarification it is the next step of our research project 4 3 multivariate analysis with a self organizing map som the self organizing map som technique is an artificial neural network ann algorithm based on unsupervised learning it is a powerful tool for exploring and clustering large and multivariate datasets kohonen 1995 this technique has been widely applied is various fields of groundwater quality e g hong and rosen 2001 jurado et al 2018 tobiszewski et al 2012 the main objective of som is to reduce the dimensionality of datasets for easier visualization of their variability first all samples are normalized and introduced as input vectors and then the algorithm runs an iterative training process to join each sample to one node of the artificially created network corresponding to output vectors the euclidean distance between these two vectors should be as small as possible unlike ordinary multivariate statistical techniques som is able to consider non linear relationships between variables and run with missing data as a result the som produces two kinds of outputs 1 a u matrix showing the observation s position and defining clusters using k mean clustering methods where the number is chosen by the user the closer the two individuals are the more they look alike 2 the 2d component planes showing the values of each variable according to the precedent matrix the observation of the component planes allows deductive relationships and correlations between variables based on their similarities or dissimilarities peeters et al 2007 we chose the som technique to discuss two phenomena fig 7 i first defining redox conditions at the captive part of the ci aquifer using results of the available indicators of these processes namely no3 and fe mn ii in addition we included other susceptible variables to explain the evolution of fluoride concentrations in ci groundwater a distribution of the samples into two distinct groups oriental and occidental was clearly shown by the u matrix the ocd cluster groups the samples belonging to the great occidental erg sub basin in addition a set of clusters or1 4 includes the samples belonging to the great oriental erg sub basin with an arrangement according to the direction of flow mentioned by the arrows the component matrix shows that Î´18o of the ci groundwater is inversely correlated with the electrical conductivities ecs as demonstrated in the previous section the enrichment of Î´18o is inversely correlated with the residence time as well as with ec samples from the occidental cluster ocd are the most enriched and the less mineralized no3 concentrations range between 3 and 75 mg l for ocd or1 or2 and or3 clusters and they are less than 1 mg l in or4 cluster it can be noticed that they significantly decrease downgradient the component matrix shows that fe mn is inversely correlated with no3 these elements have the highest concentrations in the downgradient or4 cluster this corresponds to residence time and the predominance of reduced conditions downgradient of the confined ci actually after consuming of no3 by denitrification fe and mn become the terminal electron acceptors they are reduced and solubilized in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 this is in agreement with the results of edmunds et al 2003 who showed that even if the oxidizing conditions dominate in the captive part of the ci south of laghouat rd samples and approximately on the whole region of ghardaia samples br gr gd and zf they begin reducing in the east of the sub basin of grand erg oriental samples tg og and od it can be noted that no3 concentrations are higher upgradient of the oriental clusters or1 2 than the occidental clusters ocd that are also characterized by a depletion in Î´18o the previous section had already concluded that the palaeoclimatic conditions of the ci recharge were wetter and colder in the great oriental erg sub basin than in the great occidental erg in a similar context edmunds and gaye 1997 studying high nitrate concentrations in groundwater in the sahel countries concluded there is also evidence that high ratios relate to wetter and low values to more arid climatic periods another phenomenon is the decrease in fluoride concentrations downgradient from 1 4 to 0 4 mg l within the clusters of the oriental clusters or1 4 paradoxically this decrease is not accompanied by an increase in the saturation index of fluorite the main mineral controlling its concentration in water this would thus indicate an evolution towards the precipitation of this mineral in contrast there was a decrease from 0 6 to 1 7 which implies a tendency towards dissolution if the mineral would have been present moreover in the literature fluoride mobility is considered a ph dependent process the fixation of f following anionic exchange induces the release of oh which would increase the ph paradoxically for the oriental clusters a decrease in ph can be observed downgradient with a decrease in f concentrations thus the hypothesis of anionic f oh change as a cause of decrease in f levels can be excluded the negative correlation of the f with Î´18o is also observable in our dataset this reinforces the hypothesis of edmunds et al 2003 that f contents are influenced by palaeoclimatic conditions during recharge samples located upgradient of the oriental clusters or1 and or2 were exposed to more intense evaporation than those located downgradient or4 on the other hand the lowest levels were observed in the occidental cluster ocd whereas the stable isotope data show that these waters are the most evaporated according to edmunds and smedley 2013 these concentrations are specific to the rainfall signature and their variations are related to evaporation 4 4 nitrate origin fig 8 shows that Î´15n no3 ranges from 1 9 to 9 5 and that Î´18o no3 ranges from 2 6 to 12 6 except for three samples hg03 gr01 and og02 fig 8 based on the classification of mayer 2005 which is an updated version of that of kendall 1998 such low values reflect soil nitrification processes a natural origin of no3 although reported concentrations are high og01 and tg01 samples contain less than 0 3 mg l of no3 which is not enough to analyse the no3 isotopes they are situated downgradient northeast of the study area in the reducing zone according to edmunds et al 2003 therefore such low concentrations can be explained by an ongoing denitrification process of reaction until now many studies have reported high values of no3 in the sandstone aquifers of arid zones in australia barnes et al 1992 in sahelian countries edmunds and gaye 1997 and in the kalahari desert heaton et al 1983 stadler et al 2008 2012 they concluded by using different methods that nitrates originate from natural sources some studies have also proven that soil can contain naturally high values of no3 in arid zones schwiede et al 2005 stone and edmunds 2014 walvoord et al 2003 gr01 and og02 samples were strongly enriched in both Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 knowing that their no3 concentrations are 2 7 and 3 9 mg l respectively and they are situated downgradient close to og01 and tg01 their positions in the plot show that they are situated in the denitrification trajectory sample hg03 was strongly enriched in Î´18o no3 with isotope signatures close to no3 derived from synthetic nitrate containing fertilizers the sampled borehole was located on agricultural land and was used for irrigation where pollution may have occurred the position of sample hg02 in the boxes representing the origin of no3 with respect to the isotopic composition confirms that its high mineralization is due to a mixing with natural evaporated water that does not originate from polluted groundwater the oriental group is more enriched in no3 isotopes than the occidental group this is most likely to be due to partial denitrification occurring in this part of the study area or to differences in recharge conditions 5 conclusions this paper fills the gap in the knowledge of continental intercalaire aquifer hydrogeochemistry on both sides of the mzab ridge immediate vicinity it can be concluded that groundwater in the confined area of the ci aquifer under the mzab ridge and the great oriental erg sub basin behaves differently than that in the unconfined zone in the great occidental erg sub basin in the first area the characteristics are primarily controlled by water rock interactions that involve residence time but in the second zone some external factors disturb those interactions using classical methods of hydrochemistry isotope evidence and classification techniques ci groundwater in the confined area is proven to belongs to two different groups according to their geographical location namely oriental ghardaia ouargla and el oued regions and occidental hassi fehal and el golea regions groups with distinct and specific hydrochemical characteristics for each region the observed divide between these two groups is not strict the samples obtained from locations situated between 31 55 and 31 57 n latitude hf01 and hf02 represent a transitional member from the hydrochemical and the isotopic perspective this finding corroborates the observations from the regional piezometric map suggesting a groundwater divide situated in this zone it was clear that the variations in hydrochemistry of the ci groundwater were largely attributed to the impact of aquifer lithology moreover as could be expected in such vast transboundary aquifer the residence time also has a pronounced influence on the one hand in the great occidental erg sub basin the ci aquifer is sand enriched and the groundwater flowing through is poorly mineralized mainly it could be attributed to the hco3 ca water type though it becomes progressively enriched in so4 and cl downgradient to the south on the other hand in the great oriental erg sub basin the ci aquifer is clay and gypsum enriched here the groundwater is highly mineralized and predominantly belongs to the so4 cl na water type minor element ratios indicate that the salinization originates from dissolution of continental evaporates no3 stable isotope analysis shows that the high nitrate content has a predominantly natural origin of soil nitrification however the denitrification processes are insignificant in the study area even though the ci aquifer is confined except downgradient in the northeastern part of the study area stable isotopes of water molecules from the ci groundwater have shown that the most depleted samples Î´18o 6 are those situated in the confined area within the great oriental erg sub basin including north of the mzab ridge and south tunisia their isotopic composition is homogeneous representing apparently the older meteoric water infiltrated under palaeoclimatic regime cooler and wetter than the present day climate moreover the most enriched and heterogeneous samples are those belonging to unconfined ci mainly the great occidental erg sub basin the ci groundwater lies along the mixing line Î´2h 3 01 Î´18o 36 70 the end members correspond to the most depleted groundwater from the confined ci under the great oriental erg ouargla el oued in one side and in another side to the most enriched samples from gourara region in the great occidental erg sub basin in el golea some samples are relatively enriched in both Î´18o and Î´2h which suggested the existence of mixing of the typical old ci groundwater with younger and evaporated water infiltrated under the dune of the great occidental erg as a follow up for this work we are planning to use cosmogenic isotopes 14c 36cl to determine the residence time of the ci groundwater and noble gases to understand the climatic conditions during its recharge in order to verify some of the abovementioned hypotheses more generally we recommend placing greater focus on the extreme northwestern zone near the recharge area el bayadh region both from the quantitative and the qualitative viewpoint this would allow a better understanding of modern recharge reinforcing thus the strategies aiming at a sustainable exploitation of this invaluable resource credit authorship contribution statement youcef hakimi conceptualization data curation

8262,study region the nullarbor is one of the largest contiguous karst plains in the world despite the absence of surface relict karst features and arid climate the subterranean flooded cave systems are among the largest in the world the cave waters are usually brackish and their temperatures vary over a large range 18 6 23 7 c suggesting potential input of warm groundwater to some of the caves the studied weebubbie cave of total length 500 m penetrates to 140 m below ground and 40 m below sea level study focus temperature loggers were deployed in the water at various depths and distances from the entry lake to detect potential warm water inputs in three different years the stable hydrogen oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of water have been analysed to detect potential hydrochemical differences in inflowing water and to investigate the origin of the cave water new hydrological insights for the region the thermal irregularity at the air dome of weebubbie with water temperatures 0 9 c higher than in all other cave sections confirms some heat transfer or an inflow of warmer water the stable isotope results suggest the cave water originates from partially evaporated up to 20 modern infrequent large precipitation events despite the relatively high salinity 23 3 ms cm 1 of the cave water water hydrochemistry and stable isotope composition suggest that direct large ocean water contribution to the cave is unlikely keywords subterranean ecosystem water temperature stable isotopes flooded cave western australia 1 introduction flooded subterranean caves in remote arid regions lacking surface water provide a great window to access groundwater allowing various studies these caves frequently host unique ecosystems contos et al 2001 gibson et al 2019 tetu et al 2013 are prone to fast pollution dispersal in the karst environment emmett and telfer 1994 williams et al 2014 and are vulnerable to climate change talÃ  et al 2021 they are therefore subject to conservation efforts boulton et al 2003 lewis 2019 white et al 2020 to understand and manage these subterranean ecosystems a thorough understanding of water origin recharge rates nutrients budget and water physical parameters especially temperature is required however sampling fully underwater sections of caves is extremely difficult and requires highly specialised diving skills therefore compared with marine caves flooded subterranean caves are rarely comprehensively studied as evidenced by the relative dearth of published research describing these environments underwater investigations by cave divers have great potential to provide insight into ecological speleogenetic and hydrogeological processes by gathering information largely unavailable to non diving karst scientists arid and semi arid zones are bounded by the latitudes of 10 35 poleward of the inter tropical convergence zone though not all land between these latitudes is arid or semi arid arid or semi arid land covers about one third of the world s total land surface area mcknight and hess 2000 many caves are located in these zones in the karst regions of central spain north africa arabian peninsula israel iran western china southwestern usa namibia chile mexico and australia however only a limited number of them are separated from surface ecosystems and filled with groundwater not associated with direct inflow from surface features such as rivers streams lakes or oceans webb and white 2013 in caves in regions lacking surface water groundwater is replenished by diffuse recharge influenced by local factors climate geology soil thickness vegetation geomorphology and especially preferential flow paths markowska et al 2016 therefore despite several common features reflecting regional conditions each flooded cave region is unique and the caves in these zones allow direct access to their groundwater environment that would otherwise be accessible only through bores the most common characteristics of water in these flooded caves and groundwater in general in arid climates are warm temperatures elevated salinity relatively old age and episodically infrequent recharge gee and hillel 1988 herczeg and leaney 2011 these features make caves in arid regions significantly different from more frequently studied caves in wetter and colder climates where cave water is usually fresh and cold frequently remaining in equilibrium with precipitation schwarz et al 2009 and is constantly replenished by rivers with underground sections calligaris et al 2018 or by direct seepage of river water vysokÃ¡ et al 2019 australia s largest flooded subterranean caves are located at the southern end of the nullarbor limestone plain in western australia james et al 2012 these cave systems are unique in the world and rare in scale with some to the extent of 36 km of mostly dry passage up to 6 5 km of flooded passage and up to 50 m water depth j bicanic personal communication 3rd september 2020 bicanic 2017 webb and james 2006 the nullarbor is a flat plain with relief less than 10 m surface water is absent and there are no defined river channels that could supply the cave system sheetwash erosion processes occur only during flooding initiated by infrequent intense rainfall events and during these unpredictable events runoff or flows are extremely difficult to quantify gillieson and spate 1992 although plausible hypotheses exist speleogenesis of the nullarbor caves remains largely undescribed current hypotheses suggest that rainfall saturated with biogenic carbon dioxide from the monsoonal woodland during the relatively warm and wet oligocene 34 23 ma infiltrated and dissolved shallow phreatic passages along tectonic and lithological discontinuities bedding interfaces and fractures were preferentially enlarged leading to the formation of larger passages and eventually feeding springs along the coastal cliffs then during the late oligocene rising seawater replaced freshwater in these passages slowing their karstic processes erosion and further cavity development webb and james 2006 one main hypothesis is that these large conduit passages were then buried by roof collapse during the uplift of the nullarbor karst during the late miocene when seawater hydrostatic support was withdrawn aided thereafter by gypsum and halite crystal wedging gillieson and spate 1992 webb and james 2006 since the mid miocene the nullarbor has experienced primarily an arid to semi arid climate except for a relatively brief pliocene wet phase 5 3 ma gregoric et al 2014 during the arid semi arid phases the region was geologically and hydrologically stable as evidenced by high retention of the original sedimentary rock substrate and lack of river flow in the south gregoric et al 2014 richards 1971 webb and james 2006 therefore nullarbor plain is very flat and relict karst surfaces are absent gillieson and spate 1992 given the lack of watercourse relief and limited identification of apparently phreatic features within diveable nullarbor caves the precise character of any water flow along the gentle coastward gradient remains unidentified limited groundwater resources and high salinity has historically limited investment into groundwater research in the region therefore little is known about nullarbor hydrogeology and hydrochemistry australian water resources assessment 2012 south western platea flooded nullarbor caves that are of sufficient size and depth to be diveable developed in three limestone units with nullarbor limestone at the surface abrakurrie limestone below that and willson bluff limestone the deepest the majority of caverns developed in the latter webb and james 2006 large sections of these caves are below the groundwater table 10 m a s l to 40 m b s l therefore groundwater likely plays a major role in the current formation of subterranean caves in the nullarbor plain by eroding karst along conduits of least resistance moreover water temperature is a significant factor in water density viscosity mineral solubility and in consequence water hydrochemistry kaufmann et al 2014 significant differences between cave water temperatures 18 6 23 7 c have been recorded across the nullarbor plain in addition long term temporal changes in water temperature were suggested as a response to seismic activity buzzacott 2011a and may suggest some thermal water inputs or heat transfer from below the nullarbor plain therefore this study aimed 1 to characterise spatially and temporally the water temperature in one of the nullarbor caves weebubbie cave n2 and 2 to attempt verification of the cave water origin using stable isotope methods the results were compared with other large caves in the region murra el

cancelled in 1930 poulter 1987 future technological developments for example in agriculture or engineering may see renewed interest in utilising water from weebubbie cave after e g desalisation 2 2 logger calibration the temperature in the cave was recorded using sensus ultra loggers operational to the depth of 150 m and at temperatures between 20 c and 40 c the pressure resolution was 1 mbar and accuracy 30 mbar equivalent to 30 cm change in depth whilst immersed in seawater temperature was resolved to 0 01 c and accurate to 0 8 c wilk 2006 the logger sampling rate was at 10 s intervals and the loggers were automatically activated at 1111 mbar pressure approximating the pressure at 1 m depth wilk 2006 to assess the inter logger variability before first visiting weebubbie cave 2011 the 15 loggers were evenly distributed along a rod suspended below a single pivot and taken to 10 m depth in 20 c water after one hour of immersion the mean recorded temperatures estimated depths and standard deviations between loggers over 90 s 10 samples were 20 0 c sd 0 18 and 10 0 m sd 0 05 confirming inter logger differences much lower than factory specified accuracy prior to the second visit to weebubbie cave 2012 the loggers were again suspended on a rod below a single pivot and taken to depth for inter logger variance measurement they were left at 6 m for 1 h to equilibrate with the water after equilibration the standard deviation within each logger over 90 s recording interval was 2 cm depth and 0 1 c the relative difference between all 14 loggers was lower than 0 1 c low inter logger variability gives a reliability measure that is appropriate for comparison between locations following retrieval each logger was downloaded to a laptop computer and stored using software

depths means with standard deviations in parentheses are reported 2 3 temperature measurement and logger emplacement weebubbie cave was studied over three visits in october 2011 november 2012 and october 2013 during the first visit 2011 loggers were attached to the guideline running from the main sump into the railway tunnel see fig 2 spaced approximately every 15 m for a total length of 210 m the loggers were left overnight and retrieved after no less than 16 h in situ during the second visit 2012 five of the same loggers were attached to a vertical line suspended between a float and a weight in the main lake at 15 m in front of the entrance to the flooded passage they were left in place in the main lake for 80 min an additional logger was worn by one of the divers who re visited the main sump swimming along the passage where a semi permanent guideline is installed see fig 2 before surfacing in the air dome a year later a third field trip 2013 was undertaken both to measure the perceived temperature gradient underneath the air dome and to collect water samples for analysis sensus loggers were again placed along the guideline that runs from the main sump through the railway tunnel but this time two additional loggers were also suspended beneath a float in the air dome and two loggers were suspended 0 5 m above the floor of the cave beneath the air dome fig 2 2 4 collection and analyses of water for stable hydrogen oxygen and carbon isotope compositions during the october 2013 trip water samples were collected underwater from inside the railway tunnel at

syringe with tubing to reach the vial bottom and capped sealed vials were kept in an electric refrigerator engel distribution pty ltd perth australia set to a few degrees celsius above freezing during transportation to west australian geochemistry centre at the university of western australia in addition for comparison with weebubbie cave water samples for stable isotope analyses were also collected from cocklebiddy cave in january 2012 and from two other caves in october 2013 tommy graham s and murra el elevyn rainwater monthly samples have been collected at maryland loo 33 47 s 121 07

glm was used to assess the relationships between temperature depth distance and trip eq 1 1 temperature Î± Î²1depth Î²2distance Î²3trip where Î± is the intercept and Î²1 3 are the parameter estimates for the respective independent variables in addition samples of ten data recorded by the logger worn by the diver in the second trip 2012 in the entry lake the main sump ascending and descending in the air dome and back in the entry lake were each pairwise tested for a significant difference to the samples recorded by the static loggers in the railway tunnel during 2011 and 2013 again using a general linear model proc glm local water meteoric line lmwl was calculated using monthly precipitation and following the recommendation of international atomic energy agency fig 5 grÃ¶ning 2011 lmwl

evaporation hughes and crawford 2012 local evaporation line lel and mixing lines fig 5 were calculated using an ordinary least squares regression olsr which gives equal weighting to all data points 3 results mean water temperature recorded by the static loggers installed in weebubbie cave from the main sump across the railway tunnel were not significantly different between the three different years 2011 2012 and 2013 and varied between 18 6 and 18 7 c table 1 the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum from the main sump and throughout the railway tunnel 210 m length and the water column 29 5 m depth during each year was within a 0 5 c range sd 0 1 c fig 3 water temperature recorded by static loggers during the first two field trips 2011 and 2012 was not significantly correlated with either trip year p 0 58 or with distance into the cave p 0 96 but was significantly correlated with depth p 0 01 however the temperature change with depth was small decreasing by 0 05 c for every increase in depth of 10 m fig 3 tab s1 supplementary materials therefore in practical terms the water from the main sump into the railway tunnel may be considered homogenous regardless of depth or distance from the cave entrance lake contrastingly higher temperatures were detected in 2012 during temperature mobile measurements in the passage leading to the air dome two divers entered the main sump passed underneath the rock arch at 12 m depth and ascended to the air dome fig 2 the divers remained in the air dome for 20 min before exiting via the same route directly under the arch

retrieving the static loggers was commensurate with the mean water temperature recorded by them 18 8 c vs 18 6 c this confirmed the validity of the recording of relatively warmer water in the air dome table 2 the temperature data recorded by the logger worn by the diver in 2012 was confirmed by two static loggers installed at the air dome in 2013 mean recorded water temperatures mean of 10 consecutive samples recorded at 10 s intervals were lower at 18 8 c sd 0 00 below the air dome at depth 14 7 m sd 0 00 and higher at 19 3 c sd 0 01 near the air dome at depth 5 2 m sd 0 00 fig 2 the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o were highly homogeneous and the difference between the main sump the air dome and the railway tunnel was insignificant all results for Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o varied in the range expected for the analytical uncertainty with an average of 31 1 1 2 and 4 34 0 05 respectively fig 5 also the stable carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon was highly homogenous with an average Î´ 13c dic of 0 4 0 1 4 discussion 4 1 temperature of cave water cave air and water temperatures vary with respect to multiple factors including local mean air temperature above the ground seasonal changes in flooding or infiltrating water volume and temperature cave depth geothermal gradient geomorphology and cave to atmosphere heat exchange lachniet 2009 rau et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 in many caves the air temperature reflects the long term mean air temperature and groundwater temperature largely reflects the temperature of the season contributing the most to the groundwater recharge jasechko et al 2017 rau et al 2015 therefore caves located in the same region are characterised usually by similar temperatures however in nullarbor caves located within a 15 km radius there was considerable variation in water temperatures cocklebiddy 19 5 c tommy graham s 23 4 c murra el elevyn 18 9 c in 2009 buzzacott 2011a b contos et al 2001 holmes et al 2001 moreover seismic activities the last local earthquake was in 1992 have been hypothesised as a reason for water temperature long term trends leading to a decrease of the cave water temperature by 4 8 c in murra el elevyn between 1999 and 2009 buzzacott 2011a the water temperature of 18 9 c 22 m depth reported earlier contos et al 2001 for weebubbie cave in either 1999 or 2000 although the sampling methodology remains undescribed is consistent with temperatures recorded during this study mean water temperature 18 6 c sd 0 1 in the main sump and the railway tunnel was consistent over three years 2011 2012 2013 and uniform over the length of 210 m with the maximum spatial difference of 0 5 c figs 2 and 3 however during the second field trip in 2012 a warm pool of water at 19 5 c was confirmed at the air dome with temperatures 0 9 c higher than in the main sump and the railway tunnel fig 4 this statistically significant difference was confirmed in 2013 by installing static loggers in the passage leading to the air dome fig 2 given that the only observable way for water to flow into and out of the air dome would be underneath an arch at 12 m depth it appears that warmer water entering the cave is being trapped in the passage leading to the air dome if this is a stable phenomenon then the heat capacity of this water determined by its temperature volume relationship must be sufficient to maintain the water at this elevated temperature assisted by relatively low atmospheric exposure within the air dome surface area 300 m2 though the source of the warmer water in the air dome has not yet been identified the possibility must be considered that warm water is entering the cave or heat is transferred to the cave through the floor or walls and rising into the air dome where it is trapped by the rock arch at 12 m another possibility could be that warmer water may be entering weebubbie cave at other as yet unidentified locations and while mixing with the ambient water move towards the passage to the air dome the air dome chamber is located 90 100 m below the ground surface and it is unknown at this stage if it has direct contact with the atmosphere through cracks or an unidentified blowhole allowing movement of air between the cave and the atmosphere due to daily pressure changes also the direction the water flows in the cave has not been studied yet the mean cave water temperature 18 6 c is commensurate with the mean annual air temperature recorded at eucla weather station www bom gov au site 011003 period 1930 2010 of 19 0 c mean at 9 00 am and 19 7 c mean at 3 00 pm slightly lower temperatures of cave water compared to mean air temperature can be explained by higher contribution from precipitation occurring during the cold season april to august 60 of precipitation to the groundwater recharge the similarity between groundwater temperature and the mean annual air temperature is a typical phenomenon observed world wide and ambient cave temperature is within the range expected for local groundwater jasechko et al 2017 however as suggested above higher temperatures at the air dome 19 5 c may suggest some local input of warmer water or heat transfer without the physical input of water to the cave to investigate a possible local source of warmer water we analysed the stable isotope composition of water and dissolved inorganic carbon 4 2 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of cave water the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water in the weebubbie cave main sump and the railway tunnel Î´ 18o 4 34 0 09 and Î´ 2h 31 1 2 2 is highly homogenous and not different from the water composition in the passage leading to the air dome where the thermal anomaly was observed table s1 fig 2 this lack of detectable differences suggests heat transfer rather than the physical inflow of warm water if the inflow of warm water at the air dome is present then the inflowing warm water would have to have a stable isotope composition very similar to water in other parts of the cave the direct inflow cannot be excluded at this stage of the study however geothermal water often has different hydrochemistry and stable isotope composition especially if it is associated with deep circulation awaleh et al 2020 burnside et al 2016 fusari et al 2017 therefore heat transfer is inferred the origin of water in the cave and potential contributions from different sources were verified using the stable isotope composition and linear regression models the position of the cave water Î´ values was analysed in relation to local meteoric water line lmwl and mixing lines for potential end members fig 5ab three end members potentially contributing to the cave water were considered 1 weighed by

000 km to the north and perth about 1 200 km to the west considering large distances between the gnip stations and the cave likely considerably contributing to uncertainty in interpolation more local results from the same coast but from shorter time series were obtained may 2015 april 2016 table s2 the weighted by volume annual means as directly observed at maryland loo near esperance 33 47 s 121 07 e about 700 km to the west run by west australian biogeochemistry centre the university of western australia were very similar Î´ 18o 4 75 Î´ 2h 24 2 to the interpolated values for weebubbie cave this consistency in the values confirms that even though shorter the local time series is representative of the local conditions at weebubbie cave in contrast to the weighted by volume mean annual precipitation large volume precipitation events tend to have more negative stable isotope compositions than mean weighted by volume precipitation dogramaci et al 2012 skrzypek et al 2019 also at maryland loo monthly mean values for the wet season which are dominated by large precipitation events are much lower than weighed by volume mean precipitation for example Î´ 18o 7 24 and Î´ 2h 41 1 were observed for june 2015 47 mm and Î´ 18o 8 32 and Î´ 2h 47 1 for july 2015 51 mm a single one day 91 mm storm on 10 02 2017 had even lower values at Î´ 18o 8 86 and Î´ 2h 57 3 table s2 the mean stable isotope composition of shallow ocean water has significantly more positive Î´ values compared with rainfall and it is characterized by low spatial variability legrande and schmidt 2006 in this study we used local Î´ 18o 0 72 and Î´ 2h 2 63 for the southern ocean coast calculating means from the data set collected by rv falkor the schmidt ocean institute during a hydrochemical survey on the continental shelf at bremer bay 34 30 s 119 30 e trotter et al 2020 the stable isotope composition of the potential end members listed above cave waters and precipitation allowed construction of four linear regression models fig 5ab lmwl Î´ 2h 7 25 Î´ 18o 10 27 was calculated for maryland loo using monthly means and the pwlsr method hughes and crawford 2012 the local cave water line lcwl was calculated using all cave water results Î´ 2h 5 40 Î´ 18o 7 32 mixing line 1 was calculated using two end members mean precipitation and ocean water mixing line 2 was calculated using also two end members large volume precipitation and ocean water fig 5 ab lcwl is significantly different from potential mixing lines therefore it is likely reflecting the evaporation trend rather than mixing and can be similar to the local evaporation line lel lmwl mixing line 1 and 2 create a mixing triangle that covers the whole range of potential stable isotope compositions which could result from mixing the three end members considered a b c and grey triangle on fig 5ab the mean cave water Î´ 18o 4 34 0 09 is slightly more positive and Î´ 2h 31 1 2 2 more negative compared with the weighted by volume mean local meteoric precipitation the point representing weebubbie cave water is located far to the right of the lmwl and outside the mixing triangle the Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o values for weebubbie cave water are below the hypothetical mixing lines between local ocean water and mean precipitation mix 1 or large volume precipitation mix 2 fig 5ab these stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures suggest that contribution of the ocean water is unlikely despite the cave location being only 11 km from the southern ocean coastline the cave depth down to 40 m below sea level and very low mean annual precipitation of 275 mm this may suggest a large continental groundwater discharge to the southern ocean despite the arid climate of this part of the continent haynes et al 2007 lamontagne et al 2015 stewart et al 2015 more negative than in precipitation Î´ 2h signatures of the cave water signature is located below lmwl fig 5 and the mean d excess of 3 6 defined as d Î´ 2h 8 Î´ 18o suggest the primary origin of the cave water is from partially evaporated infrequent large volume precipitation events with more negative Î´ 18o and Î´ 2h values fig 5 rather than direct recharge from mean annual precipitation skrzypek et al 2015 this conclusion could be confirmed further by calculation of the crossing point between lmwl and lcwl Î´ 18o 8 88 and Î´ 2h 55 3 which defines the initial composition of water fellman et al 2011 the value of the crossing point point a on fig 5a is exactly in the range observed for large precipitation events at maryland loo and almost exactly the same as the largest observed precipitation event of 91 mm Î´ 18o 8 86 and Î´ 2h 57 3 suggesting that the value at the lmwl lcwl crossing point is the same as the initial stable isotope composition of water contributing to the cave hence the lcwl can be considered the lel reflecting the progress of evaporation of water before recharging to the caves or from the caves directly using the craig gordon model stable isotope hydrocalculator skrzypek et al 2015 and assuming the same mean temperature as the cave water 18 6 c expected relative humidity during evaporation 60 85 and initial water composition as for the calculated crossing point 8 88 and 55 3 the cave water in weebubbie cave 4 34 and 31 1 lost to evaporation is 16 to 20 of the initial volume delivered from large precipitation events this range of evaporative losses is similar to those estimated for groundwater in other semi arid regions in western australia skrzypek et al 2019 tugwell wootton et al 2020 high spatial homogeneity of cave water as found in weebubbie was also observed in other caves in the region and reflected in low standard deviations murra el elevyn Î´ 18o 3 85 sd 0 07 Î´ 2h 28 7 sd 0 5 n 14 in october 2013 and cocklebiddy Î´ 18o 4 85 sd 0 05 Î´ 2h 32 9 sd 1 7 n 14 in january 2012 however mean values were significantly different likely reflecting the difference in evaporative losses between the caves due to different geomorphology and local recharge conditions contrastingly the cave water in tommy graham s where a halocline was reported at 20 m contos et al 2001 displayed large spatial stable isotope heterogeneity Î´ 18o 3 12 sd 0 40 Î´ 2h 23 4 sd 3 5 n 6 in october 2013 associated with two major water masses with very different composition fig 5b among the four compared caves the highest Î´ 18o and Î´ 2h were in tommy graham s and can be attributed to the highest evaporative losses the greater losses may be associated with the higher water temperature in this cave 23 4 c in 2009 which is about 4 c above the local mean atmospheric temperature www bom gov au site 011003 the period 1930 2010 however the input of ocean water cannot be ruled out in tommy graham s cave at this stage of our investigation 4 3 stable carbon isotope composition and salinity of cave water the stable carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon across weebubbie cave was also very homogenous with Î´ 13c dic varying in a very narrow range between 0 2 and 0 5 these Î´ 13c dic values are significantly above the range expected for surface freshwater 10 e g siebers et al 2020 they are also below the values observed for the southern ocean 1 2 1 5 at 5 m depth in bremer bay in 2020 trotter et al 2020 implying a lack of a direct exchange with ocean water the Î´ 13c dic values can be dominated by the dissolution of the marine carbonates that form the nullarbor platform and is not indicative of a potential geothermal or juvenile co2 input which is usually characterised by very low Î´ 13c values bergfeld et al 2001 dogramaci and skrzypek 2015b janik and mclaren 2010 mather et al 2018 the salinity of water in weebubbie cave 23 3 ms cm was also uniform contos et al 2001 holmes et al 2001 with total dissolved solids below half of what is typical for the ocean water 35 g l in contrast to water which according to the stable isotope evidence originates from precipitation the major ion ratios suggest that some solutes have ocean origin e g cl so4 ratio 0 11 ratio as meq l this cl so4 ratio is in the range of precipitation typical for coastal locations and seawater 0 10 0 15 ratio as meq l dogramaci and skrzypek 2015a hingston and gailitis 1976 however bicarbonates concentration was relatively low 89 mg l and contrastingly nitrates extremely high 100 mg l and far above values expected for ocean water contos et al 2001 price et al 2012 this hydrochemical composition also does not imply direct interaction with ocean water high groundwater and cave water salinity could be the result of sea salt transported with precipitation or sea spray accumulated and recycled over millennia as described in other arid regions of western australia skrzypek et al 2013 2016 5 conclusion previous research has identified thermoclines in nullarbor caves but resulting from the ingress of rainwater in this study we propose an entirely different thermal phenomenon the hydrochemical and stable isotope analyses suggest that thermal irregularity at the air dome of weebubbie cave is rather associated with heat transfer than the inflow of warm water the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions also confirm that the cave water originates from partially evaporated modern local large precipitation events despite the relatively high salinity of water 23 3 ms cm and the location of the flooded cave sections below sea level direct ocean water contribution to the cave system seems unlikely the stable isotope composition of the cave water adds new perspectives on the discharge recharge cycle suggesting that only very large infrequent precipitation events with very negative Î´ values are contributing to the water in weebubbie cave further thermal and hydrochemical research in weebubbie and other flooded nullarbor caves is needed to confirm the origin of the heat transfer and understand processes contributing to observed water hydrochemistry such research may help verify speleogenesis hypotheses of large nullarbor caves which are the largest in australia better understand discharge recharge in karstic aquifers and to recognize the significance of the hydrochemistry of

8262,study region the nullarbor is one of the largest contiguous karst plains in the world despite the absence of surface relict karst features and arid climate the subterranean flooded cave systems are among the largest in the world the cave waters are usually brackish and their temperatures vary over a large range 18 6 23 7 c suggesting potential input of warm groundwater to some of the caves the studied weebubbie cave of total length 500 m penetrates to 140 m below ground and 40 m below sea level study focus temperature loggers were deployed in the water at various depths and distances from the entry lake to detect potential warm water inputs in three different years the stable hydrogen oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of water have been analysed to detect potential hydrochemical differences in inflowing water and to investigate the origin of the cave water new hydrological insights for the region the thermal irregularity at the air dome of weebubbie with water temperatures 0 9 c higher than in all other cave sections confirms some heat transfer or an inflow of warmer water the stable isotope results suggest the cave water originates from partially evaporated up to 20 modern infrequent large precipitation events despite the relatively high salinity 23 3 ms cm 1 of the cave water water hydrochemistry and stable isotope composition suggest that direct large ocean water contribution to the cave is unlikely keywords subterranean ecosystem water temperature stable isotopes flooded cave western australia 1 introduction flooded subterranean caves in remote arid regions lacking surface water provide a great window to access groundwater allowing various studies these caves frequently host unique ecosystems contos et al 2001 gibson et al 2019 tetu et al 2013 are prone to fast pollution dispersal in the karst environment emmett and telfer 1994 williams et al 2014 and are vulnerable to climate change talÃ  et al 2021 they are therefore subject to conservation efforts boulton et al 2003 lewis 2019 white et al 2020 to understand and manage these subterranean ecosystems a thorough understanding of water origin recharge rates nutrients budget and water physical parameters especially temperature is required however sampling fully underwater sections of caves is extremely difficult and requires highly specialised diving skills therefore compared with marine caves flooded subterranean caves are rarely comprehensively studied as evidenced by the relative dearth of published research describing these environments underwater investigations by cave divers have great potential to provide insight into ecological speleogenetic and hydrogeological processes by gathering information largely unavailable to non diving karst scientists arid and semi arid zones are bounded by the latitudes of 10 35 poleward of the inter tropical convergence zone though not all land between these latitudes is arid or semi arid arid or semi arid land covers about one third of the world s total land surface area mcknight and hess 2000 many caves are located in these zones in the karst regions of central spain north africa arabian peninsula israel iran western china southwestern usa namibia chile mexico and australia however only a limited number of them are separated from surface ecosystems and filled with groundwater not associated with direct inflow from surface features such as rivers streams lakes or oceans webb and white 2013 in caves in regions lacking surface water groundwater is replenished by diffuse recharge influenced by local factors climate geology soil thickness vegetation geomorphology and especially preferential flow paths markowska et al 2016 therefore despite several common features reflecting regional conditions each flooded cave region is unique and the caves in these zones allow direct access to their groundwater environment that would otherwise be accessible only through bores the most common characteristics of water in these flooded caves and groundwater in general in arid climates are warm temperatures elevated salinity relatively old age and episodically infrequent recharge gee and hillel 1988 herczeg and leaney 2011 these features make caves in arid regions significantly different from more frequently studied caves in wetter and colder climates where cave water is usually fresh and cold frequently remaining in equilibrium with precipitation schwarz et al 2009 and is constantly replenished by rivers with underground sections calligaris et al 2018 or by direct seepage of river water vysokÃ¡ et al 2019 australia s largest flooded subterranean caves are located at the southern end of the nullarbor limestone plain in western australia james et al 2012 these cave systems are unique in the world and rare in scale with some to the extent of 36 km of mostly dry passage up to 6 5 km of flooded passage and up to 50 m water depth j bicanic personal communication 3rd september 2020 bicanic 2017 webb and james 2006 the nullarbor is a flat plain with relief less than 10 m surface water is absent and there are no defined river channels that could supply the cave system sheetwash erosion processes occur only during flooding initiated by infrequent intense rainfall events and during these unpredictable events runoff or flows are extremely difficult to quantify gillieson and spate 1992 although plausible hypotheses exist speleogenesis of the nullarbor caves remains largely undescribed current hypotheses suggest that rainfall saturated with biogenic carbon dioxide from the monsoonal woodland during the relatively warm and wet oligocene 34 23 ma infiltrated and dissolved shallow phreatic passages along tectonic and lithological discontinuities bedding interfaces and fractures were preferentially enlarged leading to the formation of larger passages and eventually feeding springs along the coastal cliffs then during the late oligocene rising seawater replaced freshwater in these passages slowing their karstic processes erosion and further cavity development webb and james 2006 one main hypothesis is that these large conduit passages were then buried by roof collapse during the uplift of the nullarbor karst during the late miocene when seawater hydrostatic support was withdrawn aided thereafter by gypsum and halite crystal wedging gillieson and spate 1992 webb and james 2006 since the mid miocene the nullarbor has experienced primarily an arid to semi arid climate except for a relatively brief pliocene wet phase 5 3 ma gregoric et al 2014 during the arid semi arid phases the region was geologically and hydrologically stable as evidenced by high retention of the original sedimentary rock substrate and lack of river flow in the south gregoric et al 2014 richards 1971 webb and james 2006 therefore nullarbor plain is very flat and relict karst surfaces are absent gillieson and spate 1992 given the lack of watercourse relief and limited identification of apparently phreatic features within diveable nullarbor caves the precise character of any water flow along the gentle coastward gradient remains unidentified limited groundwater resources and high salinity has historically limited investment into groundwater research in the region therefore little is known about nullarbor hydrogeology and hydrochemistry australian water resources assessment 2012 south western platea flooded nullarbor caves that are of sufficient size and depth to be diveable developed in three limestone units with nullarbor limestone at the surface abrakurrie limestone below that and willson bluff limestone the deepest the majority of caverns developed in the latter webb and james 2006 large sections of these caves are below the groundwater table 10 m a s l to 40 m b s l therefore groundwater likely plays a major role in the current formation of subterranean caves in the nullarbor plain by eroding karst along conduits of least resistance moreover water temperature is a significant factor in water density viscosity mineral solubility and in consequence water hydrochemistry kaufmann et al 2014 significant differences between cave water temperatures 18 6 23 7 c have been recorded across the nullarbor plain in addition long term temporal changes in water temperature were suggested as a response to seismic activity buzzacott 2011a and may suggest some thermal water inputs or heat transfer from below the nullarbor plain therefore this study aimed 1 to characterise spatially and temporally the water temperature in one of the nullarbor caves weebubbie cave n2 and 2 to attempt verification of the cave water origin using stable isotope methods the results were compared with other large caves in the region murra el

logger calibration the temperature in the cave was recorded using sensus ultra loggers operational to the depth of 150 m and at temperatures between 20 c and 40 c the pressure resolution was 1 mbar and accuracy 30 mbar equivalent to 30 cm change in depth whilst immersed in seawater temperature was resolved to 0 01 c and accurate to 0 8 c wilk 2006 the logger sampling rate was at 10 s intervals and the loggers were automatically activated at 1111 mbar pressure approximating the pressure at 1 m depth wilk 2006 to assess the inter logger variability before first visiting weebubbie cave 2011 the 15 loggers were evenly distributed along a rod suspended below a single pivot and taken to 10 m depth in 20 c water after one hour of immersion the mean recorded temperatures estimated depths and standard deviations between loggers over 90 s 10 samples were 20 0 c sd 0 18 and 10 0 m sd 0 05 confirming inter logger differences much lower than factory specified accuracy prior to the second visit to weebubbie cave 2012 the loggers were again suspended on a rod below a single pivot and taken to depth for inter logger variance measurement they were left at 6 m for 1 h to equilibrate with the water after equilibration the standard deviation within each logger over 90 s recording interval was 2 cm depth and 0 1 c the relative difference between all 14 loggers was lower than 0 1 c low inter logger variability gives a reliability measure that is appropriate for comparison between locations following retrieval each logger was downloaded to a laptop computer and stored using software supplied by the logger manufacturer reefnet mississauga canada wilk 2006 in all three visits 10 samples of 10 s measurements were averaged from each logger reflecting 90 s mean water temperatures and

october 2013 during the first visit 2011 loggers were attached to the guideline running from the main sump into the railway tunnel see fig 2 spaced approximately every 15 m for a total length of 210 m the loggers were left overnight and retrieved after no less than 16 h in situ during the second visit 2012 five of the same loggers were attached to a vertical line suspended between a float and a weight in the main lake at 15 m in front of the entrance to the flooded passage they were left in place in the main lake for 80 min an additional logger was worn by one of the divers who re visited the main sump swimming along the passage where a semi permanent guideline is installed see fig 2 before surfacing in the air dome a year later a third field trip 2013 was undertaken both to measure the perceived temperature gradient underneath the air dome and to collect water samples for analysis sensus loggers were again placed along the guideline that runs from the main sump through the railway tunnel but this time two additional loggers were also suspended beneath a float in the air dome and two loggers were suspended 0 5 m above the floor of the cave beneath the air dome fig 2 2 4 collection and analyses of water for stable hydrogen oxygen and carbon isotope compositions during the october 2013 trip water samples were collected underwater from inside the railway tunnel at

syringe with tubing to reach the vial bottom and capped sealed vials were kept in an electric refrigerator engel distribution pty ltd perth australia set to a few degrees celsius above freezing during transportation to west australian geochemistry centre at the university of western australia in addition for comparison with weebubbie cave water samples for stable isotope analyses were also collected from cocklebiddy cave in january 2012 and from two other caves in october 2013 tommy graham s and murra el elevyn rainwater monthly samples have been collected at maryland loo 33 47 s 121 07

for the respective independent variables in addition samples of ten data recorded by the logger worn by the diver in the second trip 2012 in the entry lake the main sump ascending and descending in the air dome and back in the entry lake were each pairwise tested for a significant difference to the samples recorded by the static loggers in the railway tunnel during 2011 and 2013 again using a general linear model proc glm local water meteoric line lmwl was calculated using monthly precipitation and following the recommendation of international atomic energy agency fig 5 grÃ¶ning 2011 lmwl

evaporation hughes and crawford 2012 local evaporation line lel and mixing lines fig 5 were calculated using an ordinary least squares regression olsr which gives equal weighting to all data points 3 results mean water temperature recorded by the static loggers installed in weebubbie cave from the main sump across the railway tunnel were not significantly different between the three different years 2011 2012 and 2013 and varied between 18 6 and 18 7 c table 1 the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum from the main sump and throughout the railway tunnel 210 m length and the water column 29 5 m depth during each year was within a 0 5 c range sd 0 1 c fig 3 water temperature recorded by static loggers during the first two field trips 2011 and 2012 was not significantly correlated with either trip year p 0 58 or with distance into the cave p 0 96 but was significantly correlated with depth p 0 01 however the temperature change with depth was small decreasing by 0 05 c for every increase in depth of 10 m fig 3 tab s1 supplementary materials therefore in practical terms the water from the main sump into the railway tunnel may be considered homogenous regardless of depth or distance from the cave entrance lake contrastingly higher temperatures were detected in 2012 during temperature mobile measurements in the passage leading to the air dome two divers entered the main sump passed underneath the rock arch at 12 m depth and ascended to the air dome fig 2 the divers remained in the air dome for 20 min before exiting via the same route directly under the arch

retrieving the static loggers was commensurate with the mean water temperature recorded by them 18 8 c vs 18 6 c this confirmed the validity of the recording of relatively warmer water in the air dome table 2 the temperature data recorded by the logger worn by the diver in 2012 was confirmed by two static loggers installed at the air dome in 2013 mean recorded water temperatures mean of 10

stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o were highly homogeneous and the difference between the main sump the air dome and the railway tunnel was insignificant all results for Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o varied in the range expected for the analytical uncertainty with an average of 31 1 1 2 and 4 34 0 05 respectively fig 5 also the stable carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon was highly homogenous with an average Î´ 13c dic of 0 4 0 1 4 discussion 4 1 temperature of cave water cave air and water temperatures vary with respect to multiple factors including local mean air temperature above the ground seasonal changes in flooding or infiltrating water volume and temperature cave depth geothermal gradient geomorphology and cave to atmosphere heat exchange lachniet 2009 rau et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 in many caves the air temperature reflects the long term mean air temperature and groundwater temperature largely reflects the temperature of the season contributing the most to the groundwater recharge jasechko et al 2017 rau et al 2015 therefore caves located in the same region are characterised usually by similar temperatures however in nullarbor caves located within a 15 km radius there was considerable variation in water temperatures cocklebiddy 19 5 c tommy graham s 23 4 c murra el elevyn 18 9 c in 2009 buzzacott 2011a b contos et al 2001 holmes et al 2001 moreover seismic activities the last local earthquake was in 1992 have been hypothesised as a reason for water temperature long term trends leading to a decrease of the cave water temperature by 4 8 c in murra el elevyn between 1999 and 2009 buzzacott 2011a the water temperature of 18 9 c 22 m depth reported earlier contos et al 2001 for weebubbie cave in either 1999 or 2000 although the sampling methodology remains undescribed is consistent with temperatures recorded during this study mean water temperature 18 6 c sd 0 1 in the main sump and the railway tunnel was consistent over three years 2011 2012 2013 and uniform over the length of 210 m with the maximum spatial difference of 0 5 c figs 2 and 3 however during the second field trip in 2012 a warm pool of water at 19 5 c was confirmed at the air dome with temperatures 0 9 c higher than in the main sump and the railway tunnel fig 4 this statistically significant difference was confirmed in 2013 by installing static loggers in the passage leading to the air dome fig 2 given that the only observable way for water to flow into and out of the air dome would be underneath an arch at 12 m depth it appears that warmer water entering the cave is being trapped in the passage leading to the air dome if this is a stable phenomenon then the heat capacity of this water determined by its temperature volume relationship must be sufficient to maintain the water at this elevated temperature assisted by relatively low atmospheric exposure within the air dome surface area 300 m2 though the source of the warmer water in the air dome has not yet been identified the possibility must be considered that warm water is entering the cave or heat is transferred to the cave through the floor or walls and rising into the air dome where it is trapped by the rock arch at 12 m another possibility could be that warmer water may be entering weebubbie cave at other as yet unidentified locations and while mixing with the ambient water move towards the passage to the air dome the air dome chamber is located 90 100 m below the ground surface and it is unknown at this stage if it has direct contact with the atmosphere through cracks or an unidentified blowhole allowing movement of air between the cave and the atmosphere due to daily pressure changes also the direction the water flows in the cave has not been studied yet the mean cave water temperature 18 6 c is commensurate with the mean annual air temperature recorded at eucla weather station www bom gov au site 011003 period 1930 2010 of 19 0 c mean at 9 00 am and 19 7 c mean at 3 00 pm slightly lower temperatures of cave water compared to mean air temperature can be explained by higher contribution from precipitation occurring during the cold season april to august 60 of precipitation to the groundwater recharge the similarity between groundwater temperature and the mean annual air temperature is a typical phenomenon observed world wide and ambient cave temperature is within the range expected for local groundwater jasechko et al 2017 however as suggested above higher temperatures at the air dome 19 5 c may suggest some local input of warmer water or heat transfer without the physical input of water to the cave to investigate a possible local source of warmer water we analysed the stable isotope composition of water and dissolved inorganic carbon 4 2 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of cave water the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of water in the weebubbie cave main sump and the railway tunnel Î´ 18o 4 34 0 09 and Î´ 2h 31 1 2 2 is highly homogenous and not different from the water composition in the passage leading to the air dome where the thermal anomaly was observed table s1 fig 2 this lack of detectable differences suggests heat transfer rather than the physical inflow of warm water if the inflow of warm water at the air dome is present then the inflowing warm water would have to have a stable isotope composition very similar to water in other parts of the cave the direct inflow cannot be excluded at this stage of the study however geothermal water often has different hydrochemistry and stable isotope composition especially if it is associated with deep circulation awaleh et al 2020 burnside et al 2016 fusari et al 2017 therefore heat transfer is inferred the origin of water in the cave and potential contributions from different sources were verified using the stable isotope composition and linear regression models the position of the cave water Î´ values was analysed in relation to local meteoric water line lmwl and mixing lines for potential end members fig 5ab three end members potentially contributing to the cave water were considered 1 weighed by volume local mean annual precipitation 2 high volume precipitation events only and 3 ocean water the stable isotope composition of weighted by volume annual mean local precipitation Î´ 18o 4 51 and Î´ 2h 23 5 was initially calculated for the geographic coordinates and altitude of weebubbie cave using the online isotopes in precipitation calculator bowen and revenaugh 2003 and based on long term observation from australian global network of isotopes in precipitation stations gnip iaea however the closest gnip stations are very far from the cave adelaide 1 100 km to the east alice springs 1 000 km to the north and perth about 1 200 km to the west considering large distances between the gnip stations and the cave likely considerably contributing to uncertainty in interpolation more local results from the same coast but from shorter time series were obtained may 2015 april 2016 table s2 the weighted by volume annual means as directly observed at maryland loo near esperance 33 47 s 121 07 e about 700 km to the west run by west australian biogeochemistry centre the university of western australia were very similar Î´ 18o 4 75 Î´ 2h 24 2 to the interpolated values for weebubbie cave this consistency in the values confirms that even though shorter the local time series is representative of the local conditions at weebubbie cave in contrast to the weighted by volume mean annual precipitation large volume precipitation events tend to have more negative stable isotope compositions than mean weighted by volume precipitation dogramaci et al 2012 skrzypek et al 2019 also at maryland loo monthly mean values for the wet season which are dominated by large precipitation events are much lower than weighed by volume mean precipitation for example Î´ 18o 7 24 and Î´ 2h 41 1 were observed for june 2015 47 mm and Î´ 18o 8 32 and Î´ 2h 47 1 for july 2015 51 mm a single one day 91 mm storm on 10 02 2017 had even lower values at Î´ 18o 8 86 and Î´ 2h 57 3 table s2 the mean stable isotope composition of shallow ocean water has significantly more positive Î´ values compared with rainfall and it is characterized by low spatial variability legrande and schmidt 2006 in this study we used local Î´ 18o 0 72 and Î´ 2h 2 63 for the southern ocean coast calculating means from the data set collected by rv falkor the schmidt ocean institute during a hydrochemical survey on the continental shelf at bremer bay 34 30 s 119 30 e trotter et al 2020 the stable isotope composition of the potential end members listed above cave waters and precipitation allowed construction of four linear regression models fig 5ab lmwl Î´ 2h 7 25 Î´ 18o 10 27 was calculated for maryland loo using monthly means and the pwlsr method hughes and crawford 2012 the local cave water line lcwl was calculated using all cave water results Î´ 2h 5 40 Î´ 18o 7 32 mixing line 1 was calculated using two end members mean precipitation and ocean water mixing line 2 was calculated using also two end members large volume precipitation and ocean water fig 5 ab lcwl is significantly different from potential mixing lines therefore it is likely reflecting the evaporation trend rather than mixing and can be similar to the local evaporation line lel lmwl mixing line 1 and 2 create a mixing triangle that covers the whole range of potential stable isotope compositions which could result from mixing the three end members considered a b c and grey triangle on fig 5ab the mean cave water Î´ 18o 4 34 0 09 is slightly more positive and Î´ 2h 31 1 2 2 more negative compared with the weighted by volume mean local meteoric precipitation the point representing weebubbie cave water is located far to the right of the lmwl and outside the mixing triangle the Î´ 2h and Î´ 18o values for weebubbie cave water are below the hypothetical mixing lines between local ocean water and mean precipitation mix 1 or large volume precipitation mix 2 fig 5ab these stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures suggest that contribution of the ocean water is unlikely despite the cave location being only 11 km from the southern ocean coastline the cave depth down to 40 m below sea level and very low mean annual precipitation of 275 mm this may suggest a large continental groundwater discharge to the southern ocean despite the arid climate of this part of the continent haynes et al 2007 lamontagne et al 2015 stewart et al 2015 more negative than in precipitation Î´ 2h signatures of the cave water signature is located below lmwl fig 5 and the mean d excess of 3 6 defined as d Î´ 2h 8 Î´ 18o suggest the primary origin of the cave water is from partially evaporated infrequent large volume precipitation events with more negative Î´ 18o and Î´ 2h values fig 5 rather than direct recharge from mean annual precipitation skrzypek et al 2015 this conclusion could be confirmed further by calculation of the crossing point between lmwl and lcwl Î´ 18o 8 88 and Î´ 2h 55 3 which defines the initial composition of water fellman et al 2011 the value of the crossing point point a on fig 5a is exactly in the range observed for large precipitation events at maryland loo and almost exactly the same as the largest observed precipitation event of 91 mm Î´ 18o 8 86 and Î´ 2h 57 3 suggesting that the value at the lmwl lcwl crossing point is the same as the initial stable isotope composition of water contributing to the cave hence the lcwl can be considered the lel reflecting the progress of evaporation of water before recharging to the caves or from the caves directly using the craig gordon model stable isotope hydrocalculator skrzypek et al 2015 and assuming the same mean temperature as the cave water 18 6 c expected relative humidity during evaporation 60 85 and initial water composition as for the calculated crossing point 8 88 and 55 3 the cave water in weebubbie cave 4 34 and 31 1 lost to evaporation is 16 to 20 of the initial volume delivered from large precipitation events this range of evaporative losses is similar to those estimated for groundwater in other semi arid regions in western australia skrzypek et al 2019 tugwell wootton et al 2020 high spatial homogeneity of cave water as found in weebubbie was also observed in other caves in the region and reflected in low standard deviations murra el elevyn Î´ 18o 3 85 sd 0 07 Î´ 2h 28 7 sd 0 5 n 14 in october 2013 and cocklebiddy Î´ 18o 4 85 sd 0 05 Î´ 2h 32 9 sd 1 7 n 14 in january 2012 however mean values were significantly different likely reflecting the difference in evaporative losses between the caves due to different geomorphology and local recharge conditions contrastingly the cave water in tommy graham s where a halocline was reported at 20 m contos et al 2001 displayed large spatial stable isotope heterogeneity Î´ 18o 3 12 sd 0 40 Î´ 2h 23 4 sd 3 5 n 6 in october 2013 associated with two major water masses with very different composition fig 5b among the four compared caves the highest Î´ 18o and Î´ 2h were in tommy graham s and can be attributed to the highest evaporative losses the greater losses may be associated with the higher water temperature in this cave 23 4 c in 2009 which is about 4 c above the local mean atmospheric temperature www bom gov au site 011003 the period 1930 2010 however the input of ocean water cannot be ruled out in tommy graham s cave at this stage of our investigation 4 3 stable carbon isotope composition and salinity of cave water the stable carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon across weebubbie cave was also very homogenous with Î´ 13c dic varying in a very narrow range between 0 2 and 0 5 these Î´ 13c dic values are significantly above the range expected for surface freshwater 10 e g siebers et al 2020 they are also below the values observed for the southern ocean 1 2 1 5 at 5 m depth in bremer bay in 2020 trotter et al 2020 implying a lack of a direct exchange with ocean water the Î´ 13c dic values can be dominated by the dissolution of the marine carbonates that form the nullarbor platform and is not indicative of a potential geothermal or juvenile co2 input which is usually characterised by very low Î´ 13c values bergfeld et al 2001 dogramaci and skrzypek 2015b janik and mclaren 2010 mather et al 2018 the salinity of water in weebubbie cave 23 3 ms cm was also uniform contos et al 2001 holmes et al 2001 with total dissolved solids below half of what is typical for the ocean water 35 g l in contrast to water which according to the stable isotope evidence originates from precipitation the major ion ratios suggest that some solutes have ocean origin e g cl so4 ratio 0 11 ratio as meq l this cl so4 ratio is in the range of precipitation typical for coastal locations and seawater 0 10 0 15 ratio as meq l dogramaci and skrzypek 2015a hingston and gailitis 1976 however bicarbonates concentration was relatively low 89 mg l and contrastingly nitrates extremely high 100 mg l and far above values expected for ocean water contos et al 2001 price et al 2012 this hydrochemical composition also does not imply direct interaction with ocean water high groundwater and cave water salinity could be the result of sea salt transported with precipitation or sea spray accumulated and recycled over millennia as described in other arid regions of western australia skrzypek et al 2013 2016 5 conclusion previous research has identified thermoclines in nullarbor caves but resulting from the ingress of rainwater in this study we propose an entirely different thermal phenomenon the hydrochemical and stable isotope analyses suggest that thermal irregularity at the air dome of weebubbie cave is rather associated with heat transfer than the inflow of warm water the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions also confirm that the cave water originates from partially evaporated modern local large precipitation events despite the relatively high salinity of water 23 3 ms cm and the location of the flooded cave sections below sea level direct ocean water contribution to the cave system seems unlikely the stable isotope composition of the cave water adds new perspectives on the discharge recharge cycle suggesting that only very large infrequent precipitation events with very negative Î´ values are contributing to the water in weebubbie cave further thermal and hydrochemical research in weebubbie and other flooded nullarbor caves is needed to confirm the origin of the heat transfer and understand processes contributing to observed water hydrochemistry such research may help verify speleogenesis hypotheses of large nullarbor caves which are the largest in australia better understand discharge recharge in karstic aquifers and to recognize the significance of the hydrochemistry of

8263,study region africa study focus african rainfall shows significant year to year natural fluctuations that in part are linked to teleconnections associated with modes of variability in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans a better understanding of african rainfall variability and potential drivers would help to better prepare african societies for anticipated droughts and floods by taking early precautionary action here we are presenting the first continent wide analysis of african rainfall variability on a month by month and country by country basis we have calculated pearson r values for smoothed monthly rainfall data of 49 african countries over the period 1901 2017 which we compared to six potential climatic drivers of natural variability namely amo nao enso el niÃ±o southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation pdo indian ocean dipole iod and solar activity changes we allowed time lags of up to 11 months for each potential driver 66 months for solar activity new hydrological insights for the region the dynamic temporal spatial evolution of the seasonal pearson correlations was mapped out across the continent tracking the gradual or abrupt expansion displacement and subsequent waning of the various effects over the course of the year relationships are complicated by characteristic time lags non stationary correlations and occasional phase shifts our empirical results may help to further improve short to midterm rainfall prognoses in africa and provide important calibration data for the further improvement of climate models keywords

rainfall varies significantly on year to year to multi decadal time scales in some years an over abundance of rain causes dangerous floods whilst in other years the same region may suffer from drought conditions water forms the basis for life as it provides both drinking water and irrigation for agricultural food production water resources management and protection efforts against hydrological natural hazards require a good understanding of natural variability of rainfall and its potential drivers significant efforts have been made over the past 25 years to unravel the systematics behind african rainfall dynamics and its relation with oceanic modes of variability in combination with anthropogenic and other natural forcings e g nicholson 2000 2014 some of the first order influence factors are now well known for example the negative phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao normally leads to increased rainfall in morocco lamb and peppler 1987 the positive phase of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo results in above average rainfall in the sahel zone zhang and delworth 2006 and la niÃ±a negative el niÃ±o southern oscillation enso is typically associated with drought conditions in parts of east africa lott et al 2013 it has also been recognized that relationships between rainfall and oceanic modes of variability differ greatly from region to region and from season to season different variability indices influence rainfall during different times of the year a time dependent non stationary character is symptomatic for many of the observed relations nicholson 2017 correlations that were strong over several decades may suddenly weaken or disappear occasional phase reversals as well as multi months to multi year time lags between climatic triggers and rainfall add further complexity in this contribution we are attempting to identify the most important correlations of rainfall with six potential climatic drivers of natural variability namely amo nao enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo indian ocean dipole iod and solar activity changes sun regionally mapped out across africa separately for all 12 months of the year the trend mapping is based on lag optimized pearson r values that were calculated for monthly rainfall over the period 1901 2017 for 49 african countries the monthly analysis has been shown to be particularly sensitive to seasonally variable influences of potential climatic drivers on rain laurenz et al 2019 and temperature lÃ¼decke et al 2020 although not used much in the recent past the method reaches back to ogallo 1988 who found monthly rainfall in east africa highly correlated with lag zero southern oscillation index soi our empirical results may help to improve short to midterm rainfall prognoses in africa and provide important calibration data for the further improvement of climate models in many cases simulations still struggle to replicate the observed rainfall trends e g mackellar et al 2014 masih et al 2014 nouaceur and murarescu 2016 rowell et al 2015 2 hydroclimate of africa and rainfall trends large parts of north africa southern africa and the horn of africa are dominated by hot arid desert and steppe climates kÃ¶ppen 1918 the equatorial region of africa has humid tropical climates whilst parts of southern africa are under the influence of temperate climates as part of the yearly monsoon cycle the rain belt moves from west africa and the sahel in boreal summer to southern africa in austral summer in equatorial coastal east africa there are two rainy seasons namely the long rains which occur between march and may and the short rains which start in september and peak in october and november although the daily mean rainfall during the short rains is lower than that during the long rains the short rains exhibit greater interannual variability black 2005 there are also two rainy seasons along the gulf of guinea coast january march and july september the southwestern tip of south africa receives rain in austral winter only a few significant long term rainfall trends are evident in africa over the past decades and century nicholson et al 2018 west africa and the sahel experienced severe droughts during the 1970s and 1980s with a regime shift towards increased rainfall around 1992 badou et al 2017 park et al 2016 different trends were reported from equatorial eastern africa for the short and long rainfall seasons cattani et al 2018 gitau et al 2017 there are no trends in regionally aggregated rainfall in south africa mackellar et al 2014 the african

nicholson and kim 1997 fig 1 as well as solar activity changes e g van loon et al 2004 in the following sections 3 1 to 3 7 we are summarizing previously reported relationships between rainfall and natural drivers in addition to natural drivers precipitation is also thought to be influenced by anthropogenic drivers e g lott et al 2013 otto et al 2018 which however are outside the scope of this contribution for reasons of focus and length 3 1 north atlantic oscillation nao the nao was discovered through several studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries see overview in stephenson et al 2003 and is based on the surface sea level pressure difference between the subtropical azores high and the subpolar icelandic low hurrell et al 2003 boreal winter rainfall in morocco and northwestern algeria is negatively correlated with the nao knippertz et al 2003a lamb and peppler 1987 marchane et al 2016 taibi et al 2017 in contrast winter rainfall in libya and northern egypt has been reported to be positively correlated with the nao brandimarte et al 2011 lÃ³pez moreno et al 2011 on seasonal interannual timescales the rainfall in northwestern africa can be influenced by a north atlantic sea surface temperature sst tripole and the influence may be asymmetric with respect to the sign of the sst and also seasonally dependent li et al 2003 boreal winter rainfall in uganda shows negative correlations with the nao mchugh and rogers 2001 the west african summer monsoon rainfall is negatively correlated with boreal spring nao li et al 2012 3 2 atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the amo was first described by schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 and represents a low frequency ocean cycle with an estimated period of 60 80 years kerr 2000 the amo is based upon the average anomalies of sst in the north atlantic basin between 0 60 n from which the long term warming signal is removed by detrending trenberth and shea 2006 the sahel boreal summer rain is strongly positively correlated with the amo berntell et al 2018 diatta and fink 2014 folland et al 1986 martin et al 2014 o reilly et al 2017 shanahan et al 2009 zhang and delworth 2006 zhang et al 2019 a negative correlation of boreal summer autumn rainfall and amo was reported for central equatorial africa diem et al 2014 martin and thorncroft 2014 published rainfall maps which show positive amo correlations along the atlantic coast in october december ond and in east africa in january march jfm negative amo correlations were reported by these authors for the southeastern african indian ocean coastline and madagascar taye and willems 2012 suggested a positive correlation of ethiopian rainfall during the dry season october may with amo 3 3 indian ocean dipole iod the indian ocean dipole iod is defined as the difference between the sst in the western and eastern equatorial indian ocean saji et al 1999 the iod is linked to enso through an extension of the walker circulation to the west and associated indonesian throughflow the short rain season in east africa in october to december ond is strongly positively correlated to the iod black 2005 black et al 2003 clark et al 2003 liebmann et al 2014 marchant et al 2007 saji et al 1999 ummenhofer et al 2009 it is thought that the iod alters the local walker circulation tierney et al 2013 floods in east africa are more frequent during the positive phase of the iod ogwang et al 2015 whilst droughts are more common when the iod turns negative lim and hendon 2017 mpelasoka et al 2018 the long rain season in east africa in march to may mam is not significantly correlated with the iod owiti et al 2008 a positive iod typically boosts september november rainfall not only in east africa but also in a wide corridor towards the angolan atlantic coast as well as in western west africa bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2005 at the same time rainfall in central africa and southeastern africa is suggested to be reduced pointing to the existence of iod dipoles bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2003 positive iod correlations have been reported in southern africa for the austral spring summer transition october december although the correlation is non stationary and apparently deteriorated significantly after 1997 manatsa et al 2012 in the majority of southern africa peak rainfall occurs in the austral summer december february whereby precipitation is influenced by a complex interaction of iod with enso manatsa and mukwada 2012 reason 2001 according to hoell et al 2017 the phase of the iod can disrupt or enhance the southern africa precipitation response to enso depending on whether iod and enso are in the same or opposite phases a weakly negative correlation with iod has been reported for the boreal summer rain in the westernmost sahel zone diatta and fink 2014 3 4 pacific decadal oscillation pdo the pacific decadal oscillation pdo is a long lived el niÃ±o like oscillatory pattern of climate variability based on switching ocean temperature anomalies in the northeast and tropical pacific ocean mantua et al 1997 in the 20th century the oscillation had two general periodicities one from 15 to 25 years and the other from 50 to 70 years mantua and hare 2002 boreal summer rainfall in ethiopia taye and willems 2012 the sahel diatta and fink 2014 mohino et al 2011 ogou et al 2019 and the gulf of guinea coast diatta and fink 2014 is negatively correlated with the pdo 3 5 el niÃ±o southern oscillation enso the el niÃ±o southern oscillation enso is a naturally occurring phenomenon in which central and eastern equatorial pacific sst fluctuate between two states namely warmer el niÃ±o and colder la niÃ±a enso is attributed to have complex effects on african rainfall that differ greatly regionally and seasonally kiladis and diaz 1989 mason and goddard 2001 nicholson and kim 1997 ropelewski and halpert 1987 several authors have reported negative enso correlations with rainfall in morocco northwest algeria and tunisia knippertz et al 2003b meddi et al 2010 ouachani et al 2013 rodÃ³ et al 1997 zeroual et al 2016 however other studies struggled to document significant enso correlations in northwest africa e g bougara et al 2020 probably because the coupling between enso and rain has repeatedly weakened over a few decades knippertz et al 2003b and because some of the correlations involved time lags of 2 years ouachani et al 2013 according to biasutti 2019 sahel rain reduces during el niÃ±o phases influence of enso on rainfall in west africa is complex dezfuli and nicholson 2013 the same sst pattern may enhance rainfall in one season but reduce it in the following season balas et al 2007 discharge of the congo river as a comprehensive integrator of rainfall over central africa is reported to be weakly and negatively correlated with enso amarasekera et al 1997 summer rainfall in ethiopia is negatively correlated with enso abtew et al 2009 eltahir 1996 korecha and barnston 2007 segele et al 2009 zaroug et al 2014 except in the easternmost part of the country and somalia from where a positive enso correlation has been reported funk 2011 hutchinson 1992 korecha and barnston 2007 rains in east africa are correlated both positively hoell et al 2014 lott et al 2013 lyon and dewitt 2012 and negatively funk et al 2018 indeje et al 2000 with enso depending on the region and season rainfall partly lags by 1 year indeje et al 2000 the enso correlation of the east african short rains in october december ond is highly time dependent over the past 140 years with an alternation of multidecade intervals of good and poor correlations clark et al 2003 nicholson 2015 rainfall modulation in the region is typically dependent on both enso and iod hoell and funk 2014 austral summer rainfall in southern africa is negatively correlated with enso interacting with the iod funk et al 2018 hoell et al 2015 2017 kane 2009 in contrast austral winter rain in south africa shows a positive enso correlation philippon et al 2012 3 6 solar activity changes solar correlations to african rainfall have been reported on time scales ranging from decadal to multi centennial the solar schwabe cycle 11 years was identified in east african gachari et al 2014 central african van loon et al 2004 and south african currie 1993 rainfall as well as in lake level changes in lake victoria alexander et al 2007 the solar magnetic hale cycle 22 years is manifested in hydrometeorological data of south africa alexander 2005 alexander et al 2007 according to mason and tyson 1992 the solar effect on rainfall in southern africa is modulated by the phase of the quasi biennial oscillation qbo the solar gleissberg cycle 90 years was found in the nile discharge ruzmaikin et al 2006 the solar suess de vries cycle 200 years occurs in both nile discharge and moroccan palaeohydroclimate ait brahim et al 2018 ruzmaikin et al 2006 other multi centennial solar effects on holocene rainfall were suggested for east africa hennekam et al 2014 junginger et al 2014 stager et al 2003 verschuren et al 2000 and southern africa heine and vÃ¶lkel 2011 since solar activity influences most oceanic modes of variability it therefore likely contributes indirectly in a non linear way to changes in african rainfall a link to solar activity changes has been reported for nao helama and holopainen 2012 kodera 2002 thiÃ©blemont et al 2015 amo knudsen et al 2014 malik et al 2018 muthers et al 2016 otterÃ¥ et al 2010 wang et al 2017a iod kodera et al 2007 nugroho 2007 pdo maruyama et al 2017 yamakawa

strongly influenced the atlantic sst gradient and caused sahelian drought three of the four driest sahelian summers between 1900 2010 were apparently preceded by substantial northern hemisphere volcanic eruptions haywood et al 2013 3 8 interdependence of drivers the potential drivers of african precipitation are physically not fully independent a large body of research is devoted to how and with what time lag they interact with each other and with other atmospheric and oceanic events li et al 2013 wyatt et al 2012 however such considerations are beyond the scope of this paper in the methods section of our paper we briefly address the question of whether statistical intercorrelations are present that could affect the interpretation of the bivariate correlations between each potential driver and rainfall in african countries as analyzed in this paper 4 material and methods 4 1 data monthly rainfall data for 49 african countries covering the period 1901 2017 were downloaded from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia dataset cru cy v4 02 country averages pre the monthly nao data were sourced from the cru the amo and iod data from noaa and pdo and enso data from the knmi climate explorer the solar activity data sun is based on sunspot number version 2 0 from the royal observatory of belgium in brussels sunspot index and long term solar observations silso clette et al 2015 web addresses and dates of access are listed in supplement chapter 2 4 2 statistical processing 4 2 1 preprocessing in order to limit the influence of outliers we smoothed the monthly series of both the precipitation and the potential drivers using a savitzky golay filter sgf the sgf is a method of filtering the data for increasing the signal to noise ratio the fundamental method is mathematical convolution riley et al 2006 by fitting successive subsets of close by data points with a polynomial by the linear least squares method luo et al 2005 savitzky and golay 1964 the sgf used here has a frame size of 11 and a polynomial order of 5 please note that the simple moving average sma of e g 3 months which is frequently used for smoothing was not appropriate in our approach as we focused on monthly time series fig s19 shows a smoothed and an unsmoothed time series for comparison 4 2 2 effect assessment the effect of each potential driver nao amo iod pdo enso and sun on the monthly precipitation in each country was assessed with lag optimized linear least squares regression the rainfall series of each month in each country across the n 117 years was linearly predicted from the monthly values of the potential driver that preceded the rainfall by 0 1 11 months i e lagged it by 0 11 months please note that predicted and prediction are used here solely in terms of the general linear model glm and must not be confused with forecasts the absolute maximum linear correlation r was recorded together with its sign or and the respective time lag and served as a measure of the positive or negative impact of this potential driver in this month and country for sun the optimization ran across lags of up to 66 months i e about half a schwabe cycle 4 2 3 significance testing in order to ascertain the statistical reliability of the maximized r values we needed the distribution of these values under the null hypothesis h0 stating that for all lags i e 0 to 11 for nao amo iod pdo enso and 0 to 66 for sun rainfall and potential driver are uncorrelated for each month and each driver we generated 10 000 monte carlo mc rainfall series under h0 by independently drawing n 117 random values from a standard normal distribution note that mean and standard deviation do not matter because the correlation is invariant under linear transformation the normality assumption was justified by the observation that the real monthly rainfall series across the years 1901 2017 showed almost no autocorrelation the mean of hurst exponents was h 0 52 Ïƒ 0 06 denoting nearly white noise kantelhardt et al 2001 each mc rainfall series was then subjected to the same analysis as the real data i e smoothed with the sgf and linearly correlated with the same set of lags of the driver under consideration the maximum absolute correlation rmc across the lags was recorded for each month each country and each driver we rejected h0 at significance level p 0 05 p 0 01 or p 0 001 if the empirical r exceeded the 0 95 0 99 or 0 999 quantile of the respective rmc distribution note that these upper quantiles of rmc served as critical r values for maximum positive as well as negative r because the random variable rmc is symmetrically distributed about zero to avoid any filter artefacts we repeated all correlation calculations and significance tests for the unsmoothed data table 1 shows the range of critical r values obtained for all months and potential drivers both for smoothed and unsmoothed data although effect sizes were larger for the smoothed data significance decisions turned out to be more conservative because the mc simulated random rainfall series had to be smoothed in the same way thus the original data yielded even more significant results whilst the main paper is based on the smoothed data a comparative analysis of smoothed and unsmoothed data can be found in the supplement table s7 figs s19 s20 4 2 4 alternative significance testing the mc method requires specifying a distribution from which n random values are drawn in each run due to the lack of autocorrelation we assumed normality however some empirical rainfall distributions were markedly skewed e g for ethiopia in february to validate our mc significance tests we carried out a bootstrapping test efron and tibshirani 1993 for 11 exemplary cases from these only 4 were found significant p 0 05 with the mc method but 9 with the bootstrap method in particular every mc significance was confirmed by bootstrap but not vice versa we are therefore confident that the normality assumption in our mc simulations has not systematically inflated the false positive rate but rather resulted in too conservative decisions 4 2 5 multiple tests with 12 months 49 countries and 6 potential drivers i e altogether 3528 significance tests at a local significance level of p 0 05 0 05 or 0 001 we are well aware that probably a certain amount of false positives are among our results the only remedy would be to lower the individual significance level so much that the probability of even a single false positive was less than 5 or that the rate of false positives was limited however all available correction routines for multiple tests inflate the false negative rate and this even more the stronger the tests are interdependent mcdonald 2014 257 261 in the present research not only tests for consecutive months but also for neighbouring countries are highly interdependent the false positive rate is therefore likely to be much lower than the local significance level multiplied with the number of tests and the false negative rate would increase excessively if corrected since this is a continent wide exploratory hypothesis generating study we decided against a correction and would like to emphasize as a precaution that the present results will require detailed confirmation in future research 4 2 6 interdependence of drivers the six potential drivers considered here are not fully independent for every rainfall series we computed a 6 6 correlation matrix of the six drivers each with the lag that was found to optimize the linear prediction correlation of the rainfall in the respective country and month with 49 countries x 12 months we obtained 588 unsmoothed and 588 smoothed correlation matrices correlations were mostly spurious in some cases however substantial linear relationships between drivers could be observed in particular in cases in which more than one driver significantly predicted the rainfall exemplary correlation matrices are shown in the supplement tables s14 s17 however in none of the cases a significant r value between the rainfall series and a driver was exceeded by an r value between two drivers statistical intercorrelations between drivers do not question the interpretation of the bivariate correlations between drivers and rainfall as mapped out and discussed in the present paper notably we do not interpret our r values as indicators of direct causal physical effects however they do point to relationships that are practically relevant for forecasting rainfall and theoretically worth further physical analysis mediating moderating and suppressing effects need to be investigated in future work so that more complex models can be built however this is beyond the scope of the present paper 4 3 visualization of results the tables s1 s6 in the supplement show all 3528 lag optimized linear correlation coefficients r together with the respective lag information calculated for the six potential rainfall drivers in 49 countries and 12 months of the year all r values exceeding the p 0 05 significance level for the respective driver and month are highlighted in red positive r or blue colour negative r even though table 1 provides only the interval in which the individually obtained critical r values for the 6 drivers and 12 months lie it can be used to evaluate which correlations exceed a more rigorous significance level p 0 01 oder p 0 001 with the upper bounds of the critical r intervals given in table 1 one is on the safe side for all countries and months a detailed list of the critical r values for all potential drivers and months is provided in the supplement table s8 the r values were regionally mapped out using a colour coded approach of five different numerical ranges the colour code is based on absolute r values and not on statistical significance in order to allow comparison of effect sizes not only across countries and drivers but also with the literature please note that the first category yellow denoting r values between 0 30 0 39 does not ensure statistical significance it has been included in the maps since these r values at least contain the possibility of a relationship marginal statistical significance with p 0 10 and could thus be interesting for further research for the same reason the maps not only show the maximum absolute r for each country each month and each driver as specified above but also separately the most positive left side and the most negative r right side the resulting 144 maps figs s1 s6 example in fig 2 are grouped into 24 panels that consist of 6 maps each allowing direct visual comparison of best positive and negative r values for a given potential rainfall driver e g nao within a season the maps also contain lag information for the best correlations key regional correlation patterns of at least moderate effect size r 0 40 were captured in simplified form on results maps that inventorize the most important relationships between rainfall and potential drivers in a differentiated manner for all 12 months fig 3 countries with r values of 0 50 or better large effect size were shaded in the colour of their respective potential driver nao blue amo green iod orange enso red pdo purple solar activity yellow black the phase relationship with rainfall is indicated as a polarity sign e g nao or nao meaning positive or negative correlation with rainfall respectively comparative time series are shown in figs 4 and s7 18 in addition some second order relationships were explored through cross wavelets one example for each potential driver is depicted in fig 5 wavelet transforms time series into time frequency space and can therefore find localized intermittent periodicities grinsted et al 2004 a colour code is generated that highlights not only the best agreement correlation of the oscillating pattern of the rainfall and the driver but also the main frequencies of this common oscillation which can be variable along the years 1901 2017 the relative phase relationship is shown as arrows with same phase pointing right anti phase pointing left from such intermittently synchronous and significant frequencies conclusions might be drawn about a possible common cause modulating the correlation between potential driver and rain 5 results in the following we are summarizing all correlations with an effect size of at least r 0 40 moderate effect which are mostly statistically significant although a small percentage might also be false positives due to multiple testing see above the results are sorted by season and respective driver statistical results are listed in supplement tables s2 s4 s6 s8 s10 and s12 which are mapped out in supplement figs s1 s6

fig s7 5 4 2 amo moderate to strong amo correlations occur in both september and october lags mostly 8 to 9 but not in november september rain is positively correlated to amo in a belt stretching from

exploratory cross wavelet transform for the sun shows that over the entire time series there is significant common power in the frequency band corresponding to a period of about 10 12 years which is the length of the schwabe cycle fig 5 for every other potential driver nao amo iod pdo and enso there is also significant common power in this frequency range however not continuously but intermittently for example the iod correlation between october rain in kenia middle right panel computed across the entire time series was r 0 55 lag 1 however the wavelet transform reveals that in the time window between 1940 1980 both time series oscillate with a common period of roughly 8 years whereas between 1940 1960 there is a second significant frequency band corresponding to a period of about 14 years similar patterns were obtained for the other potential drivers 6 discussion the lag optimized correlation analysis demonstrates that african rainfall is correlated with a diverse set of potential drivers characterized by a clear seasonal month by month evolution and complex lag relationships in the following we are discussing some of the key correlation patterns that were identified in our lag optimizing cross correlation analysis and compare them to previously reported findings 6 1 nao we confirmed that boreal autumn and winter rainfall in morocco is strongly negatively correlated with the nao fig 3 because a negative nao diverts the moisture laden westerly winds southwards to iberia and northwest africa knippertz et al 2003a the effect fades away in march as also confirmed by marchane et al 2016 because the phase relationship between nao and rainfall becomes more unstable over time whilst march is still dominated by a weak negative correlation r 0 38 lag 0 april rain in morocco shows multidecadal intervals with both negative and positive nao correlations knippertz et al 2003b turki et al 2016 fig s7 the non stationary relationship with repeated phase reversals results in an apparent overall non correlation of april rain when considering the last 117 years we further found positive nao correlations in central and eastern north africa namely tunisia libya october libya egypt january and tunisia february fig 3 this north african west east nao rainfall dipole matches with previous analyses of modern precipitation data brandimarte et al 2011 lÃ³pez moreno et al 2011 and is also known from palaeoclimatic studies covering multicentennial timescales nieto moreno et al 2015 roberts et al 2012 sÃ¡nchez lÃ³pez et al 2016 the dipole axis is located within algeria whereby winter rainfall in northwestern algeria is still negatively correlated with nao whereas the northeastern part of the country does not show systematic nao influence taibi et al 2017 linderholm et al 2009 suggested a negative nao correlation of sahel rainfall in july and august which however we could not fully replicate in our analysis possibly due to mismatches in sahel rainfall datasets berntell et al 2018 an exception is algerian rainfall in july which is dominated by the sahel rain in southernmost algeria here we found a negative nao correlation in line with the findings of linderholm et al 2009 a strongly positive nao correlation occurs in june in chad in the subsequent month of july the correlation weakens a bit in chad but expands greatly southward to form a 4000 km long belt reaching to angola with a particulary well developed nao correlation in the central african republic fig 3 a strong nao correlation also occurs in december in mali and burkina faso forming a dipole with a pronounced nao correlation in morocco fig 3 during march rainfall in a 4000 km long west east belt stretching from guinea to the central african republic correlates negatively with the nao this partly matches with the findings of li et al 2012 who suggested that the west african summer monsoon is negatively correlated with boreal spring nao however we identified a more direct linkage of march nao with march rain without involving major time lags fig 3 s7 table s2 the reason for the discrepancy may be the shorter time interval studied by li et al 2012 i e 1979 2010 vs our time interval of 1901 2017 potentially involving non stationary correlation effects the strongest apparent influence of nao on east african rainfall occurs in january when a negative correlation is registered over the entire northern part of the region a similar relation was already previously reported by mchugh and rogers 2001 and mpelasoka et al 2018 uganda shows the greatest r values for january in our analysis with a more moderate correlation for the long rains in april fig s7 in contrast some of the boreal autumn rains in the region correlate positively with nao as evidenced in ethiopia september and uganda october highlighting the need for detailed seasonal differentiation in rainfall and drought analyses this is also further illustrated by the austral winter rain in south africa that is initially correlated positively with nao in june but changes into a negative correlation by august fig s1 further differentiation of south african rainfall trends on a province level would be necessary to better understand regional details 6 2 amo among the most prominent and best studied relationships is the positive amo correlation with summer sahel rain e g folland et al 1986 o reilly et al 2017 shanahan et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 which our analysis fully agrees with the correlation slowly begins to form in june expands over the entire sahel in july and peaks in intensity in august fig 3 it still covers a large area in september although less intense and begins to regionally disintegrate in october fig 3 the best positive correlation of amo and sahel rainfall has a time lag of about 7 months fig s2 comparison of rain and amo without lag instantaneous correlation yields significantly poorer correlations in addition non stationary effects occur as correlations in the first half of the 20th century were partly negative or absent diatta and fink 2014 fig s8 notably a variety of different sahel rain datasets exist which partly conflict with each other berntell et al 2018 many simulation studies still fail to fully replicate the scale of the relationship between sahel rain and amo knight et al 2006 martin et al 2014 some authors have reported an equatorial belt to the south of the sahel with regions of summer autumn negative amo correlations diem et al 2014 o reilly et al 2017 ogou et al 2019 zhang and delworth 2006 zhang et al 2019 which could not be detected by our analysis possibly due to weaker correlation intensities and limited areal extent it may also be a result of non stationary correlations according to losada et al 2012 an anti correlation between rainfall anomalies in the sahel and the gulf of guinea coast existed before the 1970 s forming a dipole negative amo correlation e g in equatorial guinea in august fig s2 however the dipole pattern almost disappeared after that date losada et al 2012 our study identified positive amo correlations in central africa during two months namely in the greater congo basin in march and along the atlantic coast from gabon to angola in december fig 3 october rainfall in madagascar is characterized by a negative amo correlation similar correlations were already reported by martin and thorncroft 2014 taye and willems 2012 reported a strong positive correlation in the ethiopian blue nile basin of october february rainfall with amo we could not detect this correlation in our study probably because the blue nile basin is located in the northwestern part of the country and rainfall in other parts of ethiopia may have different relationships with amo based on countrywide data we only found a weakly positive amo correlation in december fig s2 the importance of high resolution seasonal differentiation is underlined by the rainfall anomalies in zimbabwe whilst rain is negatively correlated with amo in may the correlation turns positive in june the amo area in may extends eastwards into mozambique the amo area in june extends westwards with a strongly positive amo correlation in botswana fig s8 our results newly suggest amo relationships in march characterized by a negative correlation in north africa and sudan and a positive one in the congo basin resulting in a dipole axis in south sudan 6 3 iod the iod plays a major role for african rainfall during most months of the year the best known and most pronounced influence occurs during the short rain season in east africa in september to november when rainfall is strongly positively correlated to the iod e g black 2005 marchant et al 2007 saji et al 1999 in our analysis the effect initially appears in kenya uganda in september with moderate correlation strength and subsequently intensifies and expands north and southwards in october by november most of east and central africa are positively correlated with iod bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2005 with a strong core area along the uganda tanzania axis fig 3 during that month a major iod rainfall dipole forms with west africa which is negatively correlated with the iod bahaga et al 2015 diatta and fink 2014 the typical iod correlation occasionally flips to iod as seen in an october time series for tanzania where such inversions occurred in the 1920s and 1980s clark et al 2003 owiti et al 2008 fig s9 the effect could be due to an interference with the solar activity signal that in the same country and month shows significant correlation with rainfall r 0 40 lag 34 figs 3 s6 also other authors report non stationary iod correlations of various kinds with the east african short rains manatsa and behera 2013 strong and or widespread negative iod correlations also occur in sudan in february in march and april in various places in the interior of africa in june in large parts of west and northwest africa diatta and fink 2014 and in december along the gulf of guinea coast fig 3 iod rainfall dipoles occur in northwest and west africa during july and august bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2003 fig 3 in south africa the only month with iod influence is september when rainfall shows an overall moderate negative correlation with iod behera et al 2003 although the correlation is very much non stationary when inspecting the time series in detail fig s9 manatsa et al 2012 in the same month an iod correlation also occurs in malawi forming a potential dipole with the iod correlation observed in northern east africa bahaga et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 fig 3 rainfall in southern africa during january and february does not yield any moderate or strong correlations with iod over the past 115 years however visual analysis of the january and february time series of south africa and lesotho show that positive and negative correlations alternated on a decadal to multi decadal basis fig s9 highlighting significant non stationary iod relationships manatsa et al 2012 most likely as a response to enso interaction manatsa and mukwada 2012 cross wavelet analyses as explored in fig 5 could capture this effect 6 4 pdo the pdo correlates with african rainfall somewhere on the continent in all months of the year except in june in most cases rainfall is negatively correlated with the pdo during the period july october rainfall in the sahel and sub saharan northern equatorial belt is correlated to both amo and pdo whereby their respective regions of correlation are partly overlapping or adjacent to each other diatta and fink 2014 mohino et al 2011 mpelasoka et al 2018 ogou et al 2019 taye and willems 2012 fig 3 negative pdo correlations occur in western central africa repeatedly over the year namely in january march october and november whilst they are recorded in northwest africa during april and december fig 3 positive pdo correlations exist only in east africa in february and may during may a dipole forms with mozambique where rainfall is strongly negatively correlated with the pdo in november the negative iod correlation extends from gabon across the entire continent to madagascar where the relation is the strongest 6 5 enso we found negative enso correlations with african rainfall occurring in march southwest africa may congo basin july central africa august and september northern east africa october gabon equatorial guinea and december south africa lesotho and r congo the only significant positive enso correlation is recorded in may in cameroon which forms a dipole with the negative enso correlation in dr congo fig 3 the enso relationship to seasonal east african rainfall is a well known general feature e g fer et al 2017 funk et al 2018 hoell et al 2014 indeje et al 2000 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1987 williams and funk 2011 nevertheless the occasional link up of droughts and la niÃ±a conditions in parts of east africa i e a positive enso correlation lott et al 2013 lyon and dewitt 2012 was not detected in our study as a longterm anomaly over the past 117 years of data the reason may be because the enso correlation of the east african short rains in september november is highly time dependent over the past 140 years with an alternation of multidecadal intervals of good and poor correlations clark et al 2003 nicholson 2015 furthermore rainfall modulation in the region is believed to be dependent on both enso and iod black et al 2003 hoell and funk 2014 mpelasoka et al 2018 and the iod signal appears in our study very prominently in the east african short rain season overshadowing the enso contribution fig 3 a negative enso correlation with summer rainfall in ethiopia has been widely reported e g korecha and barnston 2007 zaroug et al 2014 but only weakly negative correlations in august were found in our study fig s5 table s10 this is most probably because the easternmost part of ethiopia is known to correlate positively with enso e g funk 2011 korecha and barnston 2007 resulting in a heterogeneous overall enso response in ethiopia on a country wide scale korecha and barnston 2007 we did neither detect significant enso correlations with rainfall in west africa nor the sahel biasutti 2019 except for july rain in burkina faso which shows a moderate negative correlation in contrast rainfall in central africa is primarily negatively correlated to enso during several months of the year as a consequence discharge of the congo river is also negatively correlated with enso amarasekera et al 1997 an enso dipole occurs in may with a positive enso correlation in cameroon and a negative correlation in dr congo fig 3 the complexity of arguments for enso influence on rainfall in the region was already pointed out by balas et al 2007 and dezfuli and nicholson 2013 negative enso correlations in march of angola and zambia are associated with a rainfall lag of 5 months and the correlations in july of angola and dr congo with lags of 10 and 6 months respectively fig s5 table s10 there is no instantaneous response of rainfall to enso in these regions and months we have also explored longer lag times of up to 36 months the only case in which this resulted in a significant improvement was june rainfall of equatorial guinea which shows a moderate negative correlation with enso with a lag of 27 whilst lags up to 11 months did not yield a convincing relationship we confirmed earlier results that austral summer rainfall in southern africa is negatively correlated with enso funk et al 2018 hoell et al 2015 2017 kane 2009 mason and goddard 2001 december rainfall in south africa is moderately negatively correlated with enso and rain in lesotho even strongly negatively correlated fig 3 the choice of longer lags of up to 36 months does not bring further improvement for enso correlation indices except for the comoros in march r 0 40 with lag 36 no correlation with shorter lags up to 11 months several authors have reported negative enso correlations with rainfall in morocco northwest algeria and tunisia knippertz et al 2003b meddi et al 2010 ouachani et al 2013 rodÃ³ et al 1997 zeroual et al 2016 we did not detect any significant enso correlation within the chosen 11 months lag time window fig s5 inspired by ouachani et al 2013 who reported time lags of 2 years between enso signal and rain in northwest africa we have experimented with lag times of up to 36 months this indeed produced moderate negative correlations although just for the dry boreal summer month of august with insignificant total rainfall e g morocco 0 44 lag 35 algeria 0 40 lag 33 tunisia 0 41 lag 21 also other studies struggled to document significant enso correlations in northwest africa e g bougara et al 2020 most likely because the coupling between enso and rain has repeatedly weakened over a few decades knippertz et al 2003b clearly the key driver of winter rainfall in the region is the nao whilst iod plays a role for rainfall during the summer months fig 3 6 6 sun in agreement with previous studies highlighting a solar influence on african rainfall e g ait brahim et al 2018 alexander et al 2007 gachari et al 2014 van loon et al 2004 we identified moderate to strong solar correlations with rainfall in at least some locations in many months of the year except during april september and november fig 3 the strongest solar correlations occur in ethiopia in february in kenya and burundi in june and in botswana in july these are all low rainfall months suggesting that strong solar influence in these cases controls rare rain showers in the dry season cross wavelets for february rain in ethiopia correspondingly show a distinct 11 year cyclicity across the entire time series fig 5 more moderate solar correlations were also found in the high rainfall season namely for a large area in northwest africa in february and in botswana in february fig 3 in some months the solar correlations are regionally overlapping or adjacent to nao correlations e g in east africa in january or in northwest africa in february fig 3 in our study we allowed lags up to 66 months in explorative time series plots up to 120 months in order to account for the sinusoidal nature of the 11 year solar schwabe cycle non trivial phase relationships and delayed solar forced rainfall response the identified solar correlations are characterized by a diverse range of lags reflecting multi year response delays and or complex phase relationships in some cases relative amplitudes of solar signal and rainfall anomaly match best when considering long lags of 9 years e g ethiopia in february namibia in september figs s12 very rarely optimal solar correlations involve zero lag relationships e g in the central african republic in december fig s6 in some cases there are both significant positive and negative solar correlations for lags shifted by a half cycle e g dr congo in december east africa in june namibia in october fig s21 due to the nearly sinusoidal nature of the solar schwabe cycle as stated in the theoretical section 3 6 and backed up with comprehensive literature solar activity influences most oceanic modes of variability and is therefore likely to contribute indirectly in a non linear way to changes in african rainfall our exemplary and explorative cross wavelet analysis in fig 5 supports this notion in every potential oceanic driver a temporally intermittent common oscillatory period of roughly 10 12 years between oceanic driver and rainfall is seen it suggests that a physical cause oscillating with the common significant period might intermittently influence the oceanic oscillation which in turn drives the rainfall since in all six pictures the intermittently significant common power has a period of roughly about 10 12 years part of the cause might be the sun however more research is needed on this topic 6 7 mid term forecasting potential based on the empirical relationships mapped out in this contribution and reported in the literature rainfall prognoses in africa can be attempted based on three main pillars firstly a large number of established correlations involve a delayed rainfall response with regards to their potential drivers this offers forecasting potential with an advance notice of the respective time lag once the value of the potential driver has been measured secondly several modes of climate variability are now being forecast one month to more than a year ahead e g enso he et al 2019 petersik and dijkstra 2020 nao dunstone et al 2016 scaife et al 2014 smith et al 2016 wang et al 2017b and iod lim and hendon 2017 these forecasts allow rainfall prognoses also for relationships in which potential drivers and rainfall are instantaneously coupled without time lags thirdly rainfall prognoses are possible based on quasi cyclical potential drivers such as the 60 year periods of amo kerr 2000 ting et al 2014 and pdo e g easterbrook 2016 as well as the 11 year cyclicity of the solar schwabe cycle e g hamid and marzouk 2018 hathaway and upton 2016 this group of forecasts involves time horizons of several years or in the case of amo and pdo even of a few decades although only with coarser multi year resolution the expected decline of the amo in the coming years hermanson et al 2014 keenlyside et al 2008 klÃ¶wer et al 2014 sutton and dong 2012 will most likely reduce the amount of rainfall in the sahel similar as in the 1960s 80 s berntell et al 2018 zhang and delworth 2006 however correlations can be non stationary it is therefore always necessary to verify on time series or in shorter term pearson correlations that the established long term relationship is currently valid or whether the correlation has recently flipped or failed due to these variations empirically driven rainfall prognoses can be made with a certain probability but never with full certainty explaining and forecasting are two different aims in research toulmin 1961 in contrast to the attempt to establish structural relationships as in the present research for forecasting monthly rainfall the unsmoothed time series of both precipitation and potential driver should be used as an example fig s19 shows that even if the unsmoothed data do not fully capture the amplitude of precipitation resulting in lower r values they mimic the variability from year to year with astonishing accuracy 6 8 limitations and outlook correlation coefficients presented here refer to the period 1901 2017 therefore averaging over a more than a century long time span during which phase relationships between rainfall and the potential driver may have changed in cases of non stationary correlations the pearson r values depend on the chosen time period furthermore some correlations can only be detected when time lags are taken into consideration more sophisticated statistical methods like cross wavelets multiple linear regression including lag optimization or path analysis will be necessary in order to detect second order relationships in our approach we have chosen to smooth the data in order to better detect decadal and multidecadal trends the detection of higher frequency interannual variability requires the use of unfiltered data for which we provide statistical results in supplement tables s1 s3 s5 s7 s9 s11 and s20 7 conclusions african rainfall shows significant year to year natural fluctuations that in part are linked to teleconnections associated with modes of variability in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans several of these relations have already been documented in the literature e g the link between the amo and sahel rains the connection between the nao and moroccan precipitation as well as the influence of the iod on the short rain season in east africa the present paper provides the first continent wide analysis of the influence of six potential climatic drivers of natural variability namely amo nao iod pdo enso and solar activity changes on african rainfall on a month by month basis we calculated pearson r values for smoothed monthly rainfall data of 49 african countries over the period 1901 2017 with the six potential climatic drivers in the search for the best correlations we allowed time lags of up to 11 months for each potential driver 66 months for solar activity the lag optimized pearson coefficients were regionally mapped out across africa separately for each of the 12 months of the year for each of the five oceanic climate drivers we found specific temporal and geographical patterns of influence on rainfall variability the monthly approach was particularly suited to capture the dynamic of this influence over the year we showed further that solar activity influences rainfall in a linear way in smaller scale regions during certain seasons with extraordinary strength an explorative wavelet analysis revealed that the solar schwabe cycle left its imprint in the spectra of all five ocean cycles this points to second order relationships that require further research whilst our study is based on statistical correlations we do not interpret our r values as indicators of direct causal physical effects future investigations will have to thoroughly analyze the meteorological processes behind the correlations in order to physically validate these teleconnections and integrate and replicate them in climate models our empirical results may help to further improve short to midterm rainfall prognoses in africa and provide important calibration data for the continuous improvement of climate models a better understanding of african rainfall variability and potential natural drivers would

8263,study region africa study focus african rainfall shows significant year to year natural fluctuations that in part are linked to teleconnections associated with modes of variability in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans a better understanding of african rainfall variability and potential drivers would help to better prepare african societies for anticipated droughts and floods by taking early precautionary action here we are presenting the first continent wide analysis of african rainfall variability on a month by month and country by country basis we have calculated pearson r values for smoothed monthly rainfall data of 49 african countries over the period 1901 2017 which we compared to six potential climatic drivers of natural variability namely amo nao enso el niÃ±o southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation pdo indian ocean dipole iod and solar activity changes we allowed time lags of up to 11 months for each potential driver 66 months for solar activity new hydrological insights for the region the dynamic temporal spatial evolution of the seasonal pearson correlations was mapped out across the continent tracking the gradual or abrupt expansion displacement and subsequent waning of the various effects over the course of the year relationships are complicated by characteristic time lags non stationary correlations and occasional phase shifts

rainfall varies significantly on year to year to multi decadal time scales in some years an over abundance of rain causes dangerous floods whilst in other years the same region may suffer from drought conditions water forms the basis for life as it provides both drinking water and irrigation for agricultural food production water resources management and protection efforts against hydrological natural hazards require a good understanding of natural variability of rainfall and its potential drivers significant efforts have been made over the past 25 years to unravel the systematics behind african rainfall dynamics and its relation with oceanic modes of variability in combination with anthropogenic and other natural forcings e g nicholson 2000 2014 some of the first order influence factors are now well known for example the negative phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao normally leads to increased rainfall in morocco lamb and peppler 1987 the positive phase of the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo results in above average rainfall in the sahel zone zhang and delworth 2006 and la niÃ±a negative el niÃ±o southern oscillation enso is typically associated with drought conditions in parts of east africa lott et al 2013 it has also been recognized that relationships between rainfall and oceanic modes of variability differ greatly from region to region and from season to season different variability indices influence rainfall during different times of the year a time dependent non stationary character is symptomatic for many of the observed relations nicholson 2017 correlations that were strong over several decades may suddenly weaken or disappear occasional phase reversals as well as multi months to multi year time lags between climatic triggers and rainfall add further complexity in this contribution we are attempting to identify the most important correlations of rainfall with six potential climatic drivers of natural variability namely amo nao enso

optimized pearson r values that were calculated for monthly rainfall over the period 1901 2017 for 49 african countries the monthly analysis has been shown to be particularly sensitive to seasonally variable influences of potential climatic drivers on rain laurenz et al 2019 and temperature lÃ¼decke et al 2020 although not used much in the recent past the method reaches back to ogallo 1988 who found monthly rainfall in east africa highly correlated with lag zero southern oscillation index soi our empirical results may help to improve short to midterm rainfall prognoses in africa and provide important calibration data for the further improvement of climate models in many cases simulations still struggle to replicate the observed rainfall trends e g mackellar et al 2014 masih et al 2014 nouaceur and murarescu 2016 rowell et al 2015 2 hydroclimate of africa and rainfall trends large parts of north africa southern africa and the horn of africa are dominated by hot arid desert and steppe climates kÃ¶ppen 1918 the equatorial region of africa has humid tropical climates whilst parts of southern africa are under the influence of temperate climates as part of the yearly monsoon cycle the rain belt moves from west africa and the sahel in boreal summer to southern africa in austral summer in equatorial coastal east africa there are two rainy seasons namely the long rains which occur between march and may and the short rains which start in september and peak in october and november although the daily mean rainfall during the short rains is lower than that during the long rains the short rains exhibit greater interannual variability black 2005 there are also two rainy seasons along the gulf of guinea coast january march and july september the southwestern tip of south africa receives rain in austral winter only a few significant long term rainfall trends are evident in africa over the past decades and century nicholson et al 2018 west africa and the sahel experienced severe droughts during the 1970s and 1980s with a regime shift towards increased rainfall around 1992 badou et al 2017 park et al 2016 different trends were reported from equatorial eastern africa for the short and long rainfall seasons cattani et al 2018 gitau et al 2017 there are no trends in regionally aggregated rainfall in south africa mackellar et al 2014 the african

northwestern algeria is negatively correlated with the nao knippertz et al 2003a lamb and peppler 1987 marchane et al 2016 taibi et al 2017 in contrast winter rainfall in libya and northern egypt has been reported to be positively correlated with the nao brandimarte et al 2011 lÃ³pez moreno et al 2011 on seasonal interannual timescales the rainfall in northwestern africa can be influenced by a north atlantic sea surface temperature sst tripole and the influence may be asymmetric with respect to the sign of the sst and also seasonally dependent li et al 2003 boreal winter rainfall in uganda shows negative correlations with the nao mchugh and rogers 2001 the west african summer monsoon rainfall is negatively correlated with boreal spring nao li et al 2012 3 2 atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo the amo was first described by schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 and represents a low frequency ocean cycle with an estimated period of 60 80 years kerr 2000 the amo is based upon the average anomalies of sst in the north atlantic basin between 0 60 n from which the long term warming signal is removed by detrending trenberth and shea 2006 the sahel boreal summer rain is strongly positively correlated with the amo berntell et al 2018 diatta and fink 2014 folland et al 1986 martin et al 2014 o reilly et al 2017 shanahan et al 2009 zhang and delworth 2006 zhang et al 2019 a negative correlation of boreal summer autumn rainfall and amo was reported for central equatorial africa diem et al 2014 martin and thorncroft 2014 published rainfall maps which show positive amo correlations along the atlantic coast in october december ond and in east africa in january march jfm negative amo correlations were reported by these authors for the southeastern african indian ocean

is defined as the difference between the sst in the western and eastern equatorial indian ocean saji et al 1999 the iod is linked to enso through an extension of the walker circulation to the west and associated indonesian throughflow the short rain season in east africa in october to december ond is strongly positively correlated to the iod black 2005 black et al 2003 clark et al 2003 liebmann et

positive phase of the iod ogwang et al 2015 whilst droughts are more common when the iod turns negative lim and hendon 2017 mpelasoka et al 2018 the long rain season in east africa in march to may mam

atlantic coast as well as in western west africa bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2005 at the same time rainfall in central africa and southeastern africa is suggested to be reduced pointing to the existence of iod dipoles bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2003 positive iod correlations have been reported in southern africa for the austral spring summer transition october december although the correlation is non stationary and apparently deteriorated significantly after 1997 manatsa et al 2012 in the majority of southern africa peak rainfall occurs in the austral summer december february whereby precipitation is influenced by a complex interaction of iod with enso manatsa and mukwada 2012 reason 2001 according to hoell et al 2017 the phase of the iod can disrupt or enhance the southern africa precipitation response to enso depending on whether iod and enso are in the same or opposite phases a weakly negative correlation with iod has been reported for the boreal summer rain

eastern equatorial pacific sst fluctuate between two states namely warmer el niÃ±o and colder la niÃ±a enso is attributed to have complex effects on african rainfall that differ greatly regionally and seasonally kiladis and diaz 1989 mason and goddard 2001 nicholson and kim 1997 ropelewski and halpert 1987 several authors have reported negative enso correlations with rainfall in morocco northwest algeria and tunisia knippertz et al 2003b meddi et al 2010 ouachani et al 2013 rodÃ³ et al 1997 zeroual et al 2016 however other studies struggled to document significant enso correlations in northwest africa e g bougara et al 2020 probably because the coupling between enso and rain has repeatedly weakened over a few decades knippertz et al 2003b and because some of the correlations involved time lags of 2 years ouachani et al 2013 according to biasutti 2019 sahel rain reduces during el niÃ±o phases influence of enso on rainfall in west africa is complex dezfuli and nicholson 2013 the same sst pattern may enhance rainfall in one season but reduce it in the following season balas et al 2007 discharge of the congo river as a comprehensive integrator of rainfall over central

alternation of multidecade intervals of good and poor correlations clark et al 2003 nicholson 2015 rainfall modulation in the region is typically dependent on both enso and iod hoell and funk 2014 austral summer rainfall in southern africa is negatively correlated with enso interacting with the iod funk et al 2018 hoell et al 2015 2017 kane 2009 in contrast austral winter rain in south africa shows a positive enso correlation philippon et al 2012 3 6 solar activity changes solar correlations to african rainfall have been reported on time scales ranging from decadal to multi centennial the solar schwabe cycle 11 years was identified in east african gachari et al 2014 central african van loon et al 2004 and south african currie 1993 rainfall as well as in lake level changes in lake victoria alexander et al 2007 the solar magnetic hale cycle 22 years is manifested in hydrometeorological data of south africa alexander 2005 alexander et al 2007 according to mason and tyson 1992 the solar effect on rainfall in southern africa is modulated by the phase of the quasi biennial oscillation qbo the solar gleissberg cycle 90 years was found in the nile discharge ruzmaikin et al 2006 the solar suess de vries cycle 200 years occurs in both nile discharge and moroccan palaeohydroclimate ait brahim et al 2018 ruzmaikin et al 2006 other multi centennial solar effects on holocene rainfall were suggested for east africa hennekam et al 2014 junginger et al 2014 stager et al 2003 verschuren et al 2000 and southern africa heine and vÃ¶lkel 2011 since solar activity influences most oceanic modes of variability it therefore likely contributes indirectly in a non linear way to changes in african rainfall a link to solar activity changes has been reported for nao helama and holopainen 2012

volcanic eruptions haywood et al 2013 3 8 interdependence of drivers the potential drivers of african precipitation are physically not fully independent a large body of research is devoted to how and with what time lag they interact with each other and with other atmospheric and oceanic events li et al 2013 wyatt et al 2012 however such considerations are beyond the scope of this paper in the methods section of our paper we briefly address the question of whether statistical intercorrelations are present that could affect the interpretation of the bivariate correlations between each potential driver and rainfall in african countries as analyzed in this paper 4 material and methods 4 1 data monthly rainfall data for 49 african countries covering the period 1901 2017 were downloaded from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia dataset cru cy v4 02 country averages pre the monthly nao data were sourced from the cru the amo and iod data from noaa and pdo and enso data from the knmi climate explorer the solar activity data sun is based on sunspot number version 2 0 from the royal observatory of belgium in brussels sunspot index and long term solar observations silso clette et al 2015 web addresses and dates of access are listed in supplement chapter 2 4 2 statistical processing 4 2 1 preprocessing in order to limit the influence of outliers we smoothed the monthly series of both the precipitation and the potential drivers using a savitzky golay filter sgf the sgf is a method of filtering the data for increasing the signal to noise ratio the fundamental method is mathematical convolution riley et al 2006 by fitting successive subsets of close by data points with a polynomial by the linear least squares method luo et al 2005 savitzky and golay 1964 the sgf used here has a frame size of 11 and a polynomial order of 5 please note that the simple moving average sma of e g 3 months which is frequently used for smoothing was not appropriate in our approach as we focused on monthly time series fig s19 shows a smoothed and an unsmoothed time series for comparison 4 2 2 effect assessment the effect of each potential driver nao amo iod pdo enso and sun on the monthly precipitation in each country was assessed with lag optimized linear least squares regression the rainfall series of each month in each country across the n 117 years was linearly predicted from the monthly values of the potential driver that preceded the rainfall by 0 1 11 months i e lagged it by 0 11 months please note that predicted and prediction are used here solely in terms of the general linear model glm and must not be confused with forecasts the absolute maximum linear correlation r was recorded together with its sign or and the respective time lag and served as a measure of the positive or negative impact of this potential driver in this month and country for sun the optimization ran across lags of up to 66 months i e about half a schwabe cycle 4 2 3 significance testing in order to ascertain the statistical reliability of the maximized r values we needed the distribution of these values under the null hypothesis h0 stating that for all lags i e 0 to 11 for nao amo iod pdo enso and 0 to 66 for sun rainfall and potential driver are uncorrelated for each month and each driver we generated 10 000 monte carlo mc rainfall series under h0 by independently drawing n 117 random values from a standard normal distribution note that mean and standard deviation do not matter because the correlation is invariant under linear transformation the normality assumption was justified by the observation that the real monthly rainfall series across the years 1901 2017 showed almost no autocorrelation the mean of hurst exponents was h 0 52 Ïƒ 0 06 denoting nearly white noise kantelhardt et al 2001 each mc rainfall series was then subjected to the same analysis as the real data i e smoothed with the sgf and linearly correlated with the same set of lags of the driver under consideration the maximum absolute correlation rmc across the lags was recorded for each month each country and each driver we rejected h0 at significance level p 0 05 p 0 01 or p 0 001 if the empirical r exceeded the 0 95 0 99 or 0 999 quantile of the respective rmc distribution note that these upper quantiles of rmc served as critical r values for maximum positive as well as negative r because the random variable rmc is symmetrically distributed about zero to avoid any filter artefacts we repeated all correlation calculations and significance tests for the unsmoothed data table 1 shows the range of critical r values obtained for all months and potential drivers both for smoothed and unsmoothed data although effect sizes were larger for the smoothed data significance decisions turned out to be more conservative because the mc simulated random rainfall series had to be smoothed in the same way thus the original data yielded even more significant results whilst the main paper is based on the smoothed data a comparative analysis of smoothed and unsmoothed data can be found in the supplement table s7 figs s19 s20 4 2 4 alternative significance testing the mc method requires specifying a distribution from which n random values are drawn in each run due to the lack of autocorrelation we assumed normality however some empirical rainfall distributions were markedly skewed e g for ethiopia in february to validate our mc significance tests we carried out a bootstrapping test efron and tibshirani 1993 for 11 exemplary cases from these only 4 were found significant p 0 05 with the mc method but 9 with the bootstrap method in particular every mc significance was confirmed by bootstrap but not vice versa we are therefore confident that the normality assumption in our mc simulations has not systematically inflated the false positive rate but rather resulted in too conservative decisions 4 2 5 multiple tests with 12 months 49 countries and 6 potential drivers i e altogether 3528 significance tests at a local significance level of p 0 05 0 05 or 0 001 we are well aware that probably a certain amount of false positives are among our results the only remedy would be to lower the individual significance level so much that the probability of even a single false positive was less than 5 or that the rate of false positives was limited however all available correction routines for multiple tests inflate the false negative rate and this even more the stronger the tests are interdependent mcdonald 2014 257 261 in the present research not only tests for consecutive months but also for neighbouring countries are highly interdependent the false positive rate is therefore likely to be much lower than the local significance level multiplied with the number of tests and the false negative rate would increase excessively if corrected since this is a continent wide exploratory hypothesis generating study we decided against a correction and would like to emphasize as a precaution that the present results will require detailed confirmation in future research 4 2 6 interdependence of drivers the six potential drivers considered here are not fully independent for every rainfall series we computed a 6 6 correlation matrix of the six drivers each with the lag that was found to optimize the linear prediction correlation of the rainfall in the respective country and month with 49 countries x 12 months we obtained 588 unsmoothed and 588 smoothed correlation matrices correlations were mostly spurious in some cases however substantial linear relationships between drivers could be observed in particular in cases in which more than one driver significantly predicted the rainfall exemplary correlation matrices are shown in the supplement tables s14 s17 however in none of the cases a significant r value between the rainfall series and a driver was exceeded by an r value between two drivers statistical intercorrelations between drivers do not question the interpretation of the bivariate correlations between drivers and rainfall as mapped out and discussed in the present paper notably we do not interpret our r values as indicators of direct causal physical effects however they do point to relationships that are practically relevant for forecasting rainfall and theoretically worth further physical analysis mediating moderating and suppressing effects need to be investigated in future work so that more complex models can be built however this is beyond the scope of the present paper 4 3 visualization of results the tables s1 s6 in the supplement show all 3528 lag optimized linear correlation coefficients r together with the respective lag information calculated for the six potential rainfall drivers in 49 countries and 12 months of the year all r values exceeding the p 0 05 significance level for the respective driver and month are highlighted in red positive r or blue colour negative r even though table 1 provides only the interval in which the individually obtained critical r values for the 6 drivers and 12 months lie it can be used to evaluate which correlations exceed a more rigorous significance level p 0 01 oder p 0 001 with the upper bounds of the critical r intervals given in table 1 one is on the safe side for all countries and months a detailed list of the critical r values for all potential drivers and months is provided in the supplement table s8 the r values were regionally mapped out using a colour coded approach of five different numerical ranges the colour code is based on absolute r values and not on statistical significance in order to allow comparison of effect sizes not only across countries and drivers but also with the literature please note that the first category yellow denoting r values between 0 30 0 39 does not ensure statistical significance it has been included in the maps since these r values at least contain the possibility of a relationship marginal statistical significance with p 0 10 and could thus be interesting for further research for the same reason the maps not only show the maximum absolute r for each country each month and each driver as specified above but also separately the most positive left side and the most negative r right side the resulting 144 maps figs s1 s6 example in fig 2 are grouped into 24 panels that consist of 6 maps each allowing direct visual comparison of best positive and negative r values for a given potential rainfall driver e g nao within a season the maps also contain lag information for the best correlations key regional correlation patterns of at least moderate effect size r 0 40 were captured in simplified form on results maps that inventorize the most important relationships between rainfall and potential drivers in a differentiated manner for all 12 months fig 3 countries with r values of 0 50 or better large effect size were shaded in the colour of their respective potential driver nao blue amo green iod orange enso red pdo purple solar activity yellow black the phase relationship with rainfall is indicated as a polarity sign e g nao or nao meaning positive or negative correlation with rainfall respectively comparative time series are shown in figs 4 and s7 18 in addition some second order relationships were explored through cross wavelets one example for each potential driver is depicted in fig 5 wavelet transforms time series into time frequency space and can therefore find localized intermittent periodicities grinsted et al 2004 a colour code is generated that highlights not only the best agreement correlation of the oscillating pattern of the rainfall and the driver but also the main frequencies of this common oscillation which can be variable along the years 1901 2017 the relative phase relationship is shown as arrows with same phase pointing right anti phase pointing left from such intermittently synchronous and significant frequencies conclusions might be drawn about a possible common cause modulating the correlation between potential driver and rain 5 results in the following we are summarizing all correlations with an effect size of at least r 0 40 moderate effect which are mostly statistically significant although a small percentage might also be false positives due to multiple testing see above the results are sorted by season and respective driver statistical results are listed in supplement tables s2 s4 s6 s8 s10 and s12 which are mapped out in supplement figs s1 s6

most of nw africa but is reduced to morocco during october where the linkage further intensifies in november several dipoles are developed during this season namely in gabon nao vs r congo nao in

fig s7 5 4 2 amo moderate to strong amo correlations occur in both september and october lags mostly 8 to 9 but not in november september rain is positively correlated to amo in a belt stretching from burkina faso to the central african republic figs 3 s8 tab s4 this belt disintegrates in october when amo correlations are restricted to some gulf of guinea coastal countries and the central african

eastern african countries september rainfall in namibia shows a good positive correlation with solar activity during the interval 1955 1985 when even relative amplitudes of both parameters match lag

rainfall are eritrea october good negative correlation 1960 2005 lag 46 zimbabwe october good correlation 1930 1985 lag 12 and south africa november good correlation 1950 1980 lag 66 fig s12 the exploratory cross wavelet transform for the sun shows that over the entire time series there is significant common power in the frequency band corresponding to a period of about 10 12 years which is the length of the schwabe cycle fig 5 for every other potential driver nao amo iod pdo and enso there is also significant common power in this frequency range however not continuously but intermittently for example the iod correlation between october rain in kenia middle right panel computed across the entire time series was r 0 55 lag 1 however the wavelet transform reveals that in the time window between 1940 1980 both time series oscillate with a common period of roughly 8 years whereas between 1940 1960 there is a second significant frequency band corresponding to a period of about 14 years similar patterns were obtained for the other potential drivers 6 discussion the lag optimized correlation analysis demonstrates that african rainfall is correlated with a diverse set of potential drivers characterized by a clear seasonal month by month evolution and complex lag relationships in the following we are discussing some of the key correlation patterns that were identified in our lag optimizing cross correlation analysis and compare them to previously reported findings 6 1 nao we confirmed that boreal autumn and winter rainfall in morocco is strongly negatively correlated with the nao fig 3 because a negative nao diverts the moisture laden westerly winds southwards to iberia and northwest africa knippertz et al 2003a the effect fades away in march as also confirmed by marchane et al 2016 because the phase relationship between nao and rainfall becomes more unstable over time whilst march is still dominated by a weak negative correlation r 0 38 lag 0 april rain in morocco shows multidecadal intervals with both negative and positive nao correlations knippertz et al 2003b turki et al 2016 fig s7 the non stationary relationship with repeated phase reversals results in an apparent overall non correlation of april rain when considering the last 117 years we further found positive nao correlations in central and eastern north africa namely tunisia libya october libya egypt january and tunisia february fig 3 this north african west east nao rainfall dipole matches with previous analyses of modern precipitation data brandimarte et al 2011 lÃ³pez moreno et al 2011 and is also known from palaeoclimatic studies covering multicentennial timescales nieto moreno et al 2015 roberts et al 2012 sÃ¡nchez lÃ³pez et al 2016 the dipole axis is located within algeria whereby winter rainfall in northwestern algeria is still negatively correlated with nao whereas the northeastern part of the country does not show systematic nao influence taibi et al 2017 linderholm et al 2009 suggested a negative nao correlation of sahel rainfall in july and august which however we could not fully replicate in our analysis possibly due to mismatches in sahel rainfall datasets berntell et al 2018 an exception is algerian rainfall in july which is dominated by the sahel rain in southernmost algeria here we found a negative nao correlation in line with the findings of linderholm et al 2009 a strongly positive nao correlation occurs in june in chad in the subsequent month of july the correlation weakens a bit in chad but expands greatly southward to form a 4000 km long belt reaching to angola with a particulary well developed nao correlation in the central african republic fig 3 a strong nao correlation also occurs in december in mali and burkina faso forming a dipole with a pronounced nao correlation in morocco fig 3 during march rainfall in a 4000 km long west east belt stretching from guinea to the central african republic correlates negatively with the nao this partly matches with the findings of li et al 2012 who suggested that the west african summer monsoon is negatively correlated with boreal spring nao however we identified a more direct linkage of march nao with march rain without involving major time lags fig 3 s7 table s2 the reason for the discrepancy may be the shorter time interval studied by li et al 2012 i e 1979 2010 vs our time interval of 1901 2017 potentially involving non stationary correlation effects the strongest apparent influence of nao on east african rainfall occurs in january when a negative correlation is registered over the entire northern part of the region a similar relation was already previously reported by mchugh and rogers 2001 and mpelasoka et al 2018 uganda shows the greatest r values for january in our analysis with a more moderate correlation for the long rains in april fig s7 in contrast some of the boreal autumn rains in the region correlate positively with nao as evidenced in ethiopia september and uganda october highlighting the need for detailed seasonal differentiation in rainfall and drought analyses this is also further illustrated by the austral winter rain in south africa that is initially correlated positively with nao in june but changes into a negative correlation by august fig s1 further differentiation of south african rainfall trends on a province level would be necessary to better understand regional details 6 2 amo among the most prominent and best studied relationships is the positive amo correlation with summer sahel rain e g folland et al 1986 o reilly et al 2017 shanahan et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 which our analysis fully agrees with the correlation slowly begins to form in june expands over the entire sahel in july and peaks in intensity in august fig 3 it still covers a large area in september although less intense and begins to regionally disintegrate in october fig 3 the best positive correlation of amo and sahel rainfall has a time lag of about 7 months fig s2 comparison of rain and amo without lag instantaneous correlation yields significantly poorer correlations in addition non stationary effects occur as correlations in the first half of the 20th century were partly negative or absent diatta and fink 2014 fig s8 notably a variety of different sahel rain datasets exist which partly conflict with each other berntell et al 2018 many simulation studies still fail to fully replicate the scale of the relationship between sahel rain and amo knight et al 2006 martin et al 2014 some authors have reported an equatorial belt to the south of the sahel with regions of summer autumn negative amo correlations diem et al 2014 o reilly et al 2017 ogou et al 2019 zhang and delworth 2006 zhang et al 2019 which could not be detected by our analysis possibly due to weaker correlation intensities and limited areal extent it may also be a result of non stationary correlations according to losada et al 2012 an anti correlation between rainfall anomalies in the sahel and the gulf of guinea coast existed before the 1970 s forming a dipole negative amo correlation e g in equatorial guinea in august fig s2 however the dipole pattern almost disappeared after that date losada et al 2012 our study identified positive amo correlations in central africa during two months namely in the greater congo basin in march and along the atlantic coast from gabon to angola in december fig 3 october rainfall in madagascar is characterized by a negative amo correlation similar correlations were already reported by martin and thorncroft 2014 taye and willems 2012 reported a strong positive correlation in the ethiopian blue nile basin of october february rainfall with amo we could not detect this correlation in our study probably because the blue nile basin is located in the northwestern part of the country and rainfall in other parts of ethiopia may have different relationships with amo based on countrywide data we only found a weakly positive amo correlation in december fig s2 the importance of high resolution seasonal differentiation is underlined by the rainfall anomalies in zimbabwe whilst rain is negatively correlated with amo in may the correlation turns positive in june the amo area in may extends eastwards into mozambique the amo area in june extends westwards with a strongly positive amo correlation in botswana fig s8 our results newly suggest amo relationships in march characterized by a negative correlation in north africa and sudan and a positive one in the congo basin resulting in a dipole axis in south sudan 6 3 iod the iod plays a major role for african rainfall during most months of the year the best known and most pronounced influence occurs during the short rain season in east africa in september to november when rainfall is strongly positively correlated to the iod e g black 2005 marchant et al 2007 saji et al 1999 in our analysis the effect initially appears in kenya uganda in september with moderate correlation strength and subsequently intensifies and expands north and southwards in october by november most of east and central africa are positively correlated with iod bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2005 with a strong core area along the uganda tanzania axis fig 3 during that month a major iod rainfall dipole forms with west africa which is negatively correlated with the iod bahaga et al 2015 diatta and fink 2014 the typical iod correlation occasionally flips to iod as seen in an october time series for tanzania where such inversions occurred in the 1920s and 1980s clark et al 2003 owiti et al 2008 fig s9 the effect could be due to an interference with the solar activity signal that in the same country and month shows significant correlation with rainfall r 0 40 lag 34 figs 3 s6 also other authors report non stationary iod correlations of various kinds with the east african short rains manatsa and behera 2013 strong and or widespread negative iod correlations also occur in sudan in february in march and april in various places in the interior of africa in june in large parts of west and northwest africa diatta and fink 2014 and in december along the gulf of guinea coast fig 3 iod rainfall dipoles occur in northwest and west africa during july and august bahaga et al 2015 behera et al 2003 fig 3 in south africa the only month with iod influence is september when rainfall shows an overall moderate negative correlation with iod behera et al 2003 although the correlation is very much non stationary when inspecting the time series in detail fig s9 manatsa et al 2012 in the same month an iod correlation also occurs in malawi forming a potential dipole with the iod correlation observed in northern east africa bahaga et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 fig 3 rainfall in southern africa during january and february does not yield any moderate or strong correlations with iod over the past 115 years however visual analysis of the january and february time series of south africa and lesotho show that positive and negative correlations alternated on a decadal to multi decadal basis fig s9 highlighting significant non stationary iod relationships manatsa et al 2012 most likely as a response to enso interaction manatsa and mukwada 2012 cross wavelet analyses as explored in fig 5 could capture this effect 6 4 pdo the pdo correlates with african rainfall somewhere on the continent in all months of the year except in june in most cases rainfall is negatively correlated with the pdo during the period july october rainfall in the sahel and sub saharan northern equatorial belt is correlated to both amo and pdo whereby their respective regions of correlation are partly overlapping or adjacent to each other diatta and fink 2014 mohino et al 2011 mpelasoka et al 2018 ogou et al 2019 taye and willems 2012 fig 3 negative pdo correlations occur in western central africa repeatedly over the year namely in january march october and november whilst they are recorded in northwest africa during april and december fig 3 positive pdo correlations exist only in east africa in february and may during may a dipole forms with mozambique where rainfall is strongly negatively correlated with the pdo in november the negative iod correlation extends from gabon across the entire continent to madagascar where the relation is the strongest 6 5 enso we found negative enso correlations with african rainfall occurring in march southwest africa may congo basin july central africa august and september northern east africa october gabon equatorial guinea and december south africa lesotho and r congo the only significant positive enso correlation is recorded in may in cameroon which forms a dipole with the negative enso correlation in dr congo fig 3 the enso relationship to seasonal east african rainfall is a well known general feature e g fer et al 2017 funk et al 2018 hoell et al 2014 indeje et al 2000 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1987 williams and funk 2011 nevertheless the occasional link up of droughts and la niÃ±a conditions in parts of east africa i e a positive enso correlation lott et al 2013 lyon and dewitt 2012 was not detected in our study as a longterm anomaly over the past 117 years of data the reason may be because the enso correlation of the east african short rains in september november is highly time dependent over the past 140 years with an alternation of multidecadal intervals of good and poor correlations clark et al 2003 nicholson 2015 furthermore rainfall modulation in the region is believed to be dependent on both enso and iod black et al 2003 hoell and funk 2014 mpelasoka et al 2018 and the iod signal appears in our study very prominently in the east african short rain season overshadowing the enso contribution fig 3 a negative enso correlation with summer rainfall in ethiopia has been widely reported e g korecha and barnston 2007 zaroug et al 2014 but only weakly negative correlations in august were found in our study fig s5 table s10 this is most probably because the easternmost part of ethiopia is known to correlate positively with enso e g funk 2011 korecha and barnston 2007 resulting in a heterogeneous overall enso response in ethiopia on a country wide scale korecha and barnston 2007 we did neither detect significant enso correlations with rainfall in west africa nor the sahel biasutti 2019 except for july rain in burkina faso which shows a moderate negative correlation in contrast rainfall in central africa is primarily negatively correlated to enso during several months of the year as a consequence discharge of the congo river is also negatively correlated with enso amarasekera et al 1997 an enso dipole occurs in may with a positive enso correlation in cameroon and a negative correlation in dr congo fig 3 the complexity of arguments for enso influence on rainfall in the region was already pointed out by balas et al 2007 and dezfuli and nicholson 2013 negative enso correlations in march of angola and zambia are associated with a rainfall lag of 5 months and the correlations in july of angola and dr congo with lags of 10 and 6 months respectively fig s5 table s10 there is no instantaneous response of rainfall to enso in these regions and months we have also explored longer lag times of up to 36 months the only case in which this resulted in a significant improvement was june rainfall of equatorial guinea which shows a moderate negative correlation with enso with a lag of 27 whilst lags up to 11 months did not yield a convincing relationship we confirmed earlier results that austral summer rainfall in southern africa is negatively correlated with enso funk et al 2018 hoell et al 2015 2017 kane 2009 mason and goddard 2001 december rainfall in south africa is moderately negatively correlated with enso and rain in lesotho even strongly negatively correlated fig 3 the choice of longer lags of up to 36 months does not bring further improvement for enso correlation indices except for the comoros in march r 0 40 with lag 36 no correlation with shorter lags up to 11 months several authors have reported negative enso correlations with rainfall in morocco northwest algeria and tunisia knippertz et al 2003b meddi et al 2010 ouachani et al 2013 rodÃ³ et al 1997 zeroual et al 2016 we did not detect any significant enso correlation within the chosen 11 months lag time window fig s5 inspired by ouachani et al 2013 who reported time lags of 2 years between enso signal and rain in northwest africa we have experimented with lag times of up to 36 months this indeed produced moderate negative correlations although just for the dry boreal summer month of august with insignificant total rainfall e g morocco 0 44 lag 35 algeria 0 40 lag 33 tunisia 0 41 lag 21 also other studies struggled to document significant enso correlations in northwest africa e g bougara et al 2020 most likely because the coupling between enso and rain has repeatedly weakened over a few decades knippertz et al 2003b clearly the key driver of winter rainfall in the region is the nao whilst iod plays a role for rainfall during the summer months fig 3 6 6 sun in agreement with previous studies highlighting a solar influence on african rainfall e g ait brahim et al 2018 alexander et al 2007 gachari et al 2014 van loon et al 2004 we identified moderate to strong solar correlations with rainfall in at least some locations in many months of the year except during april september and november fig 3 the strongest solar correlations occur in ethiopia in february in kenya and burundi in june and in botswana in july these are all low rainfall months suggesting that strong solar influence in these cases controls rare rain showers in the dry season cross wavelets for february rain in ethiopia correspondingly show a distinct 11 year cyclicity across the entire time series fig 5 more moderate solar correlations were also found in the high rainfall season namely for a large area in northwest africa in february and in botswana in february fig 3 in some months the solar correlations are regionally overlapping or adjacent to nao correlations e g in east africa in january or in northwest africa in february fig 3 in our study we allowed lags up to 66 months in explorative time series plots up to 120 months in order to account for the sinusoidal nature of the 11 year solar schwabe cycle non trivial phase relationships and delayed solar forced rainfall response the identified solar correlations are characterized by a diverse range of lags reflecting multi year response delays and or complex phase relationships in some cases relative amplitudes of solar signal and rainfall anomaly match best when considering long lags of 9 years e g ethiopia in february namibia in september figs s12 very rarely optimal solar correlations involve zero lag relationships e g in the central african republic in december fig s6 in some cases there are both significant positive and negative solar correlations for lags shifted by a half cycle e g dr congo in december east africa in june namibia in october fig s21 due to the nearly sinusoidal nature of the solar schwabe cycle as stated in the theoretical section 3 6 and backed up with comprehensive literature solar activity influences most oceanic modes of variability and is therefore likely to contribute indirectly in a non linear way to changes in african rainfall our exemplary and explorative cross wavelet analysis in fig 5 supports this notion in every potential oceanic driver a temporally intermittent common oscillatory period of roughly 10 12 years between oceanic driver and rainfall is seen it suggests that a physical cause oscillating with the common significant period might intermittently influence the oceanic oscillation which in turn drives the rainfall since in all six pictures the intermittently significant common power has a period of roughly about 10 12 years part of the cause might be the sun however more research is needed on this topic 6 7 mid term forecasting potential based on the empirical relationships mapped out in this contribution and reported in the literature rainfall prognoses in africa can be attempted based on three main pillars firstly a large number of established correlations involve a delayed rainfall response with regards to their potential drivers this offers forecasting potential with an advance notice of the respective time lag once the value of the potential driver has been measured secondly several modes of climate variability are now being forecast one month to more than a year ahead e g enso he et al 2019 petersik and dijkstra 2020 nao dunstone et al 2016 scaife et al 2014 smith et al 2016 wang et al 2017b and iod lim and hendon 2017 these forecasts allow rainfall prognoses also for relationships in which potential drivers and rainfall are instantaneously coupled without time lags thirdly rainfall prognoses are possible based on quasi cyclical potential drivers such as the 60 year periods of amo kerr 2000 ting et al 2014 and pdo e g easterbrook 2016 as well as the 11 year cyclicity of the solar schwabe cycle e g hamid and marzouk 2018 hathaway and upton 2016 this group of forecasts involves time horizons of several years or in the case of amo and pdo even of a few decades although only with coarser multi year resolution the expected decline of the amo in the coming years hermanson et al 2014 keenlyside et al 2008 klÃ¶wer et al 2014 sutton and dong 2012 will most likely reduce the amount of rainfall in the sahel similar as in the 1960s 80 s berntell et al 2018 zhang and delworth 2006 however correlations can be non stationary it is therefore always necessary to verify on time series or in shorter term pearson correlations that the established long term relationship is currently valid or whether the correlation has recently flipped or failed due to these variations empirically driven rainfall prognoses can be made with a certain probability but never with full certainty explaining and forecasting are two different aims in research toulmin 1961 in contrast to the attempt to establish structural relationships as in the present research for forecasting monthly rainfall the unsmoothed time series of both precipitation and potential driver should be used as an example fig s19 shows that even if the unsmoothed data do not fully capture the amplitude of precipitation resulting in lower r values they mimic the variability from year to year with astonishing accuracy 6 8 limitations and outlook correlation coefficients presented here refer to the period 1901 2017 therefore averaging over a more than a century long time span during which phase relationships between rainfall and the potential driver may have changed in cases of non stationary correlations the pearson r values depend on the chosen time period furthermore some correlations can only be detected when time lags are taken into consideration more sophisticated statistical methods like cross wavelets multiple linear regression including lag optimization or path analysis will be necessary in order to detect second order relationships in our approach we have chosen to smooth the data in order to better detect decadal and multidecadal trends the detection of higher frequency interannual variability requires the use of unfiltered data for which we provide statistical results in supplement tables s1 s3 s5 s7 s9 s11 and s20 7 conclusions african rainfall shows significant year to year natural fluctuations that in part are linked to teleconnections associated with modes of variability in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans several of these relations have already been documented in the literature e g the link between the amo and sahel rains the connection between the nao and moroccan precipitation as well as the influence of the iod on the short rain season in east africa the present paper provides the first continent wide analysis of the influence of six potential climatic drivers of natural variability namely amo nao iod pdo enso and solar activity changes on african rainfall on a month by month basis we calculated pearson r values for smoothed monthly rainfall data of 49 african countries over the period 1901 2017 with the six potential climatic drivers in the search for the best correlations we allowed time lags of up to 11 months for each potential driver 66 months for solar activity the lag optimized pearson coefficients were regionally mapped out across africa separately for each of the 12 months of the year for each of the five oceanic climate drivers we found specific temporal and geographical patterns of influence on rainfall variability the monthly approach was particularly suited to capture the dynamic of this influence over the year we showed further that solar activity influences rainfall in a linear way in smaller scale regions during certain seasons with extraordinary strength an explorative wavelet analysis revealed that the solar schwabe cycle left its imprint in the spectra of all five ocean cycles this points to second order relationships that require further research whilst our study is based on statistical correlations we do not interpret our r values as indicators of direct causal physical effects future investigations will have to thoroughly analyze the meteorological processes behind the correlations in order to physically validate these teleconnections and integrate and replicate them in climate models our empirical results may help to further improve short to midterm rainfall prognoses in africa and provide important calibration data for the continuous improvement of climate models a better understanding of african rainfall variability and potential natural drivers would help to better prepare african societies for anticipated droughts and floods by taking early precautionary action credit authorship contribution statement horst joachim lÃ¼decke methodology formal

8264,study region the studied recharge zone of regionally extended quaternary aquifers lwÃ³wek region wielkpolska poland is located in a region where quaternary aquifers are the principal source of drinking water a visible water quality deterioration trend was observed manifested mainly by increase of nitrate concentration study focus the main objective of the presented study is to examine groundwater flow patterns and vertical difference of groundwater chemistry using a multicomponent chemical tracers approach and groundwater isotopic compositions stable isotopes tritium and radiocarbon new hydrological insights for the region this study documented the influence of water extraction on groundwater contamination the contamination plume that moves to the deepest parts of the aquifer in the region where water extraction is performed was documented as a consequence in deep parts of the aquifer nitrates appear and the groundwater chemistry is very similar to that observed in the shallow part meanwhile in regions where natural gradients exist without water extraction the contamination in the shallow part is also evident but recently infiltrating water does not reach the deeper parts of the aquifer a stagnation point exists in the deep part of the aquifer with completely different groundwater chemistry in the deep and shallow parts of the aquifer this work shown how groundwater chemistry can help to investigate groundwater flow systems keywords groundwater flow pattern groundwater chemistry regional aquifer system groundwater contamination by nitrate stagnation point 1 introduction determining groundwater chemistry and flow patterns are essential for effective water management and protection jeong 2001 edmunds et al 2002 perea and rodriguez rodriguez 2009 as defined by toth 1999 for groundwater chemistry formation the groundwater flow pattern is crucial because of 1 the interactions between water and the environment and 2 systematized and hierarchical flow paths distributing effects of interaction in the groundwater environment many studies investigating groundwater chemistry differentiation around the world can help to determine the flow pattern occurring in aquifers coetsiers and walraevens 2006 hendry and schwartz 1990 ophori and toth 1989 ochsenkuhn et al 1997 chang and wang 2010 wang et al 2013 dragon and gorski 2015 this is principally important in cases where complex hydrogeology i e in cases of multi layer aquifer systems pilla et al 2006 or groundwater extraction creating a cone of depression influence the flow pattern and hinder hydrodynamic investigation the groundwater flow pattern can be investigated in that case using multi component geochemical tracers and physical parameters can also be used as indicators of current flow pattern tweed et al 2005 a great tool to support the investigation of both groundwater flow pattern and groundwater chemistry origin are isotope techniques clark and fritz 1997 these investigations can help to determine the origin of groundwater rouabhia et al 2009 chen et al 2006 hamed et al 2011 and groundwater residence time edmunds and smedley 2000 zuber et al 2000 su et al 2009 as well as support investigations of recharge areas and recharge mechanisms chen et al 2006 lu et al 2008 abdalla 2009 marques et al 2013 for the present research the recharge zone of a regionally extended quaternary aquifer units was chosen during previous regional studies the groundwater origin was recognized to be controlled dominantly by natural geochemical processes but the influence of anthropogenic processes dominate in regions where preferential aquifer recharge exists dragon and gorski 2009 where an aquitard has relative low thickness 20 m or where the aquitard does not exist in these regions the intensification of human activity effects on groundwater chemistry has also been documented dragon 2012 but contamination still exists at a relatively low level dragon 2016 the investigation of groundwater circulation in the recharge zone was supported by chemical data and multivariate statistical analyses the spatial distribution of fluoride indicates a clear relationship with the flow pattern and show the lowest fluoride concentrations in the recharge zone where the highest effective infiltration occurs dragon and gorski 2015 these parts of the flow system are most vulnerable to contamination from the surface the recharge zone of regionally extended quaternary aquifer units was determined to be extremely vulnerable to groundwater contamination dragon 2013 as manifested mainly by relatively deep groundwater nitrate pollution the concentration of nitrate 10 mg l at a great depth of more than 80 m the main objective of the present study is to examine groundwater flow patterns using multicomponent chemical tracers and groundwater isotopic compositions the specific goals are 1 investigating the groundwater vertical chemistry differences in a recharge zone 2 documenting the influence of water extraction on groundwater contamination and 3 evaluating the feasibility of using groundwater chemistry to examine groundwater flow systems 2 the study area the study area is located in the highest part of the lwowek rakoniewice rampart in a region of relatively high ground elevation with the maximum of 138 m a s l this is the central part of the recharge zone of regionally extended quaternary aquifers figs 1 and 2 from the peak the elevation decreases in all directions to less than 100 m a s l there is one town in the study area lwÃ³wek and several small villages apart from the areas of settlement arable lands predominate where both the use of chemical fertilizers and manure spreading on the land are potential sources of groundwater contamination the thickness of the quaternary sediments is more than 120 m locally the lithology is dominated by glacial and fluvio glacial sediments the aquifers are composed by fluvio glacial sands and gravels fig 2 the shallower aquifer units usually have a small thickness less than 20 m and comprise fine sands the main aquifer in this region wielopolska buried valley aquifer main groundwater basin no 144 has variable thickness between 20 and 40 m and is formed by gravels and coarse sands in the deep part and medium and fine sands in shallower parts figs 1 and 2 the deepest quaternary aquifer unit discovered in this region in chmielinko comprises fine sands and has a thickness less than 20 m the aquifer units are usually characterized by confined and semi confined conditions with the aquitard composed by glacial tills the thickness of the aquitard is variable and ranges between 10 wytomysl and more than 100 m chmielinko but in investigated sites jozefowo and wladyslawowo aquitards are absent and sands and gravels forming aquifers occur from the surface to a depth of more than 100 m in the regions where hydrogeological windows occur the aquifer units are hydraulically connected whereas in the regions where aquitards occur the glacial tills cause the aquifer units to be vertically isolated these conditions form a multi layer aquifer system except of jozefowo and wladyslawowo regions it was previously documented that the water chemistry in aquifers surrounding the recharge zone figs 1 and 2 is highly influenced by the inflow of groundwater from the study area dragon and gorski 2009 2015 the permeability of the aquifer is very heterogenious particularly at the jozefowo site the variable occurrence of fine sands versus coarse sands and gravels with till inserts is observable in the vertical profile fig 2 and it can influence the vertical groundwater flow the principal sources of the groundwater recharge is the direct infiltration of water in the unconfined parts of the aquifer system and the indirect recharge by percolation of water through the glacial tills from the shallower to the deepest aquifer units it is expected that in the studied regions lwÃ³wek and wladyslawowo sites due to the existence of high permeable sediments and hydrogeological windows the direct infiltration is the main groundwater recharge component dragon 2012 2013 the selected region is located in the central part of the recharge zone on the groundwater divide from which groundwater flows either eastward to the warta river valley or westward to the obra river valley fig 1 the characteristic attribute of the recharge zone is a high downward gradient the documented difference in the piezometric water level between the deepest and shallowest aquifer units measured during well drilling is more than 14 0 m locally the well in chmielinko fig 2 the differences in water level between deep and shallow parts of the aquifer in the sites of the hydrogeological windows occurrence are smaller and were documented at level of 0 24 m in jozefowo the difference between j i and j iii and 0 06 m in wladyslawowo the difference between w i and w iii for a detailed study two sites were chosen the jozefowo site is located in the region of a well field comprising 3 productive wells 1 bis 1a and 2 fig 2 the admissible volume of extracted groundwater of these wells is 120 m3 h the wladyslawowo site is located in the region of an inactive well field wladyslawowo 1 fig 2 3 materials and methods the unconfined parts of the flow system in jozefowo and wladyslawowo were selected for a detailed study of groundwater chemistry changes in these regions two multilevel observation wells were drilled each adjacent to a productive well this location enabled the productive well to be used as the deepest sampling point fig 2 the multilevel system was constructed by drilling separate observation wells cluster type of observation wells in very close distance from each other 5 m each with screen located at different depth fig 2 the pipe diameter of the observation wells is 80 mm while the length of the well screen of each observation well is 1 m at jozefowo site the two observation wells with screens at the depth of 27 28 m j i and 46 47 m j iii were located close to the jozefowo 1 bis well meanwhile three observation wells with screens positioned at 31 32 m w i 42 43 m w ii and 54 55 m w iii were located near the wladyslawowo 1 well in wladyslawowo site it should be noted that the well in jozefowo is located in a region where groundwater extraction is performed whereas groundwater extraction does not occur in wladyslawowo this situation enables the observation of groundwater chemistry changes in a vertical profile relative to the water extraction conditions groundwater sampling was performed in june 2018 the sampling campaign included multilevel observation wells including productive well 1 bis and inactive well at wladyslawowo which are located close to multilevel observation wells the location of these sampling points is marked on vertical profiles presented on figs 4 and 5 additionally the chemical analyses was performed in remaining productive wells of the jozefowo well field 1a and 2 the observation wells were pumped using an mp 1 grundfos pump while the inactive well in wladyslawowo was pumped by a grundfos sp 17 pump powered by a power generator before sampling the observation wells were pumped for a minimum 2 h to ensure minimum three times the water exchange in the well pipes in the inactive well in wladyslawowo 12 h of cleaning pumping was performed before sampling water samples were collected in 100 ml hdpe polyethylene bottles the bottles were rinsed three times before sampling and filled completely to prevent degassing samples for the nitrogen compounds analyses were treated with chloroform and the samples for iron and manganese testing were treated with hno3 after sampling the water was stored in a portable refrigerator in cold temperature 4 6 c and transported to the laboratory the same day the following parameters were measured directly in the field using a portable aquaread ap700 after standard calibration electrical conductivity ph eh potential oxygen content and temperature the alkalinity expressing hco3 concentrations was measured in the field by titration the field sampling was performed under relevant iso 5667 11 standards iso 5667 11 1993 the chemical analyses were performed in the laboratory of adam mickiewicz university in poznan institute of geology using a compact ic 881pro ionic chromatograph as a quality control measure the ionic error balance was calculated the calculated error did not exceed 3 the levels of stable isotopes Î´18o and Î´2h in four water samples representing the shallowest and deepest water at each site were determined and expressed in terms of the Î´ v smow standard mean ocean water these water samples were also analysed for c14 reported as percent modern carbon pmc for groundwater age estimation the ingerson pearson model was used ingerson and pearson 1964 clark and fritz 1997 the tritium content was measured in nine water samples and expressed in tus tritium units the isotope analyses were performed in the laboratory of the university of science and technology faculty of physics and applied computer science in cracow poland the results of the isotope analyses presented by dragon and gorski 2015 were also used in the data interpretation 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry the results of the hydrochemical investigation presented on the piper diagram fig 3 show a different nature for the vertical groundwater chemistry differences observed in the two investigated sites the sampling points from jozefowo clustered in one place on the diagram while the sampling points representing water from wladyslawowo differed from the others the water sampled from the shallowest part of the aquifer w i was clustered in this same field like the samples from jozefowo whereas the points representing the deepest parts of the aquifer w iii and wladyslawowo 1 were clearly shifted the middle sampling point w ii is located between these two point groups the results of the laboratory and field measurements are presented in table 1 while the vertical differences of chosen parameters at the jozefowo site are presented in fig 4 on this plot the results from the multilevel observation well are presented j i and j iii sampling points and the productive well jozefowo 1 bis was the deepest sampling point fig 2 the water chemistry observed in the vertical profile in jozefowo is very similar in both the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer table 1 fig 4 and a small deviation from this trend at the j iii sampling point was documented importantly the nitrate observed in a shallow part of the aquifer at a concentration of 12 6 mg l had a similar concentration as the well jozefowo 1 bis 9 98 mg l in the middle part j iii the concentration of nitrate was very small 1 39 mg l the opposite trend was documented for the sulphate concentration increasing from 58 0 mg l in the shallow part of the aquifer profile to 79 3 mg l in the middle part while decreasing to 68 9 mg l in the deep part well 1 bis a similar differentiation was also observed in the case of water oxidability 3 0 mgo2 l in the shallow part increasing to 4 5 mgo2 l in the middle part and decreasing to 2 5 mgo2 l in the deepest part jozefowo 1 bis importantly for the following interpretation the eh potential was very similar in the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer 297 7 and 297 mv respectively but significantly smaller in the middle of the profile 231 0 mv in the shallowest part of the aquifer the presence of oxygen was documented 4 45 mg l a small oxygen concentration was also detected at jÃ³zefowo 1 bis 0 23 mg l comparing the water chemistry between each productive well of the jozefowo site the different nitrate concentrations should be noted the highest concentration was observed at well 1 bis 9 98 mg l and the smallest was observed at well 2 1 47 mg l a different nature of the vertical groundwater chemistry changes was documented at the wladyslawowo site where the groundwater chemistry in the deep part differed considerably from that observed in the shallow part of the aquifer the vertical changes of the chosen parameters at the wladyslawowo site are presented on fig 5 on this plot the results from the multilevel observation well are presented w i w ii and w iii sampling points and the productive well at wladyslawowo is the deepest sampling point fig 2 the concentration of almost all parameters are higher in the shallow part of the aquifer while the concentrations are very low in the deepest part the most distinct differentiation showed the following nitrate concentrations 33 5 mg l in the shallow part versus very low concentrations in the deepest part 1 07 1 06 and 0 025 mg l at w ii w iii and wladyslawowo 1 respectively the concentration of chloride and sulphate were considerably higher in the shallowest part 24 8 and 60 1 mg l respectively compared with 2 83 and 9 46 mg l in the deepest part of the aquifer respectively the highest electrical conductivity and total hardness as well as concentration of calcium were also evident compared with the water in the deep part of the aquifer similar to the jozefowo site a relatively high concentration of oxygen was detected only in the shallowest part of the aquifer 7 93 mg l in w i whereas there was no oxygen in the deepest part compared with the jozefowo site a different pattern of eh potential was documented the highest redox potential was measured in the shallowest part of the aquifer 301 0 mv in w i decreasing to 74 0 mv at wladyslawowo 1 4 2 groundwater isotopic composition the isotope investigation was performed on 4 water samples 2 at each site representing the shallowest part of the aquifers sampling points j i and w i at the jozefowo and wladyslawowo sites respectively and the deepest parts of the aquifer jozefowo 1 bis and wladyslawowo 1 the measurement included stable isotopes of Î´18o and Î´2h and radiocarbon 14c the tritium content was measured for each water sample the results are presented in table 2 the stable isotopes of Î´18o and Î´2h represent relatively similar range between 9 59 and 9 62 for Î´18o and between 67 2 and 67 7 for Î´2h with slightly more negative values at the wladyslawowo sampling point 9 68 and 68 6 for Î´18o and Î´2h respectively the calculated groundwater residence time indicates the presence of recent infiltrating water in 3 water samples in both shallow and deep parts of the aquifers in jozefowo and in the shallow part in wladyslawowo meanwhile the residence time calculated for the wladyslawowo 1 sampling point deep part of the aquifer documented the presence of 2 100 year old water tritium was detected in both the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer at jozefowo with a range between 2 8 and 4 1 t u whereas at wladyslawowo tritium was detected only in the shallow part of the aquifer 6 5 and 3 2 t u at the w i and w ii sampling points respectively no tritium was found in the deep part of the aquifer 5 discussion groundwater occurring in the shallow part of the aquifer is strongly influenced by contamination from the surface the contamination is reflected mainly by the high level of nitrate concentration 12 6 mg l at jozefowo and 33 5 mg l at wladyslawowo other parameters also reflect the influence of contamination

indicates that the main source of contamination is diffuse from both manure spreading and chemical fertilizers meanwhile the influence of un severed settlement is negligible in this region this finding is supported by a relatively high nitrate concentration but low chloride concentration reflecting sewage influence gorski 1989 the concentration of boron another indicator of sewage influence lasagna and de luca 2019 was also very low the contaminants observed in the shallow part of the aquifer in the region of water extraction jozefowo site migrated downward and reached the deepest parts of the aquifer whereas in wladyslawowo the region where extraction is not performed recently infiltrating groundwater did not reach the deepest parts of the aquifer this finding is documented by the completely different natures of vertical chemistry at these two sites at jozefowo the groundwater chemistry observed in the deep part of the aquifer was very similar to that observed in the shallow part the similar eh value in the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer prove that under groundwater extraction conditions water moves easily from shallow to deep parts of the aquifer as a result a small amount of oxygen was documented at the jozefowo 1 bis productive well even at a great depth fig 4 this was also proved by isotopes the stable isotope values were similar across the whole vertical profile fig 6 and the calculated groundwater 14c residence time showed recently infiltrating water also occurring in the deep part of the aquifer table 2 moreover the tritium was at a similar

newest and is exploited the most intensively in well 1a and 2 small thickness 4 m of low permeable lenses occur glacial tills which can limit contaminants downward migration meanwhile at wladyslawowo the groundwater chemistry observed in the shallow part of the aquifer deviated completely from that observed in the deep part of the aquifer the water occurring in the shallow part was very similar to that observed at jozefowo meanwhile the groundwater in the deep part of the aquifer was characterized by different attributes there were very low concentrations of nitrate chloride and sulphate and lower total hardness compared with the shallow part of the aquifer the vertical differences in eh potential were different from those observed at jozefowo because considerably lower values were observed in the deep part of the aquifer these features prove that recently infiltrating water does not reach the deepest part of the aquifer this is confirmed by stable isotopes showing the shift of this point on the scatter diagram fig 6 furthermore the calculated groundwater 14c residence time indicates the occurrence of old groundwater there 2 100 years old this work confirms earlier findings related to groundwater flow systems and confirms the conceptual model presented by dragon 2013 this model confirms that the nature of groundwater chemistry changes with a focus on nitrate changes can be helpful for defining the flow system villarreal et al 2019 the presented data confirm that the most intensive aquifer recharge occurs in the unconfined parts of the aquifer and that the groundwater occurring in the shallow part of the aquifer is highly contaminated mainly by nitrate in the region of groundwater extraction these contaminants migrate downward to the deep part of the flow system fig 7 in the sections where natural gradients exist without water extraction the recharge in the shallow part of the aquifer can be intensive but freshwater does not reach the deep part of the flow system under this condition a stagnation zone typically exists in the deep part of the aquifer as defined by toth 1963 which is manifested by a completely different groundwater chemistry than in the shallow part of the aquifer this stagnation zone is located between fields of opposite flow directions fetter 1994 the local geological conditions affect the groundwater flow pattern because the aquifer is surrounded by laterally contacted glacial tills fig 2 forming container filled by stagnant water the study area is located in the central part of the recharge zone on the groundwater divide fig 1 where the flow path diverges to the west and east and surrounds the documented stagnation zone fig 7 the groundwater chemistry nature occurring in this zone very low concentrations of chloride is most likely caused by groundwater recharge in a colder climate paleogroundwater the isotope data confirm this observation because stagnant water is characterized by more negative d18o and d2h values fig 6 what is a characteristic attribute of water infiltrating under cold climate clark and fritz 1997 groundwater infiltrated during the last glaciation during permafrost condition was documented in poland previously in mazovian basin zuber et al 2000 in the case of wladyslawowo well extraction the water quality is expected to deteriorate due to deeper penetration of shallow contaminated groundwater this observation is important for assessing groundwater vulnerability to contamination especially if there are conditions for deep water impacts by shallow contaminated water tweed et al 2005 the investigated vertical differences in groundwater chemistry confirm that to properly manage groundwater resources and protection performing water quality monitoring only at productive wells cannot provide adequate information and monitoring shallower parts of the aquifer is also requisite netzer et al 2011 this is especially important in recharge zones characterized by a high downward gradient it is indeed that the results presented are supported on the research performed only on two sites but until now the only two regions of hydrogeological window occurrence was discovered in the investigated region on the other hand high compliance of the results obtained using different research methods multicomponent chemical tracers isotope methods allows validating the conclusions presented moreover it is advisable to confirm the processes documented here in other regions characterized by similar hydrogeological conditions 6 conclusions the groundwater chemistry occurring in the recharge zone of the regionally extended quaternary aquifer system in the wielkopolska region poland is highly dependent on the groundwater flow pattern this investigation shows the different patterns of groundwater chemistry under extraction conditions induced hydraulic gradient jozefowo site and under a natural hydraulic gradient wladyslawowo site this investigation documented agricultural contamination in the shallow part of the aquifer system the contamination is reflected mainly by relatively high nitrate concentrations but relative low chloride and boron concentrations indicators of sewage influence which indicate the agricultural nature of the contamination multi component chemical tracers were used to document that the contaminants migrate downward in the region of groundwater extraction in this region jozefowo site in the deep part of the flow system nitrates appear at concentrations similar to those observed in the shallow part and the groundwater chemistry is very similar in both the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer meanwhile in regions under a natural hydraulic gradient without exploitation wladyslawowo the contaminants were also observed in the shallow part of the aquifer but they did not migrate downward to deep parts of the flow system where a stagnation zone exists as documented by toth 1963 thus the groundwater chemistry occurring in the deep part of the aquifer differs considerably from that observed in the shallow part of the aquifer these findings were confirmed by investigations on the stable isotopes of Î´18o and Î´2h radiocarbon 14c and tritium in the region of groundwater extraction the stable isotopes values were similar across the whole vertical profile and the calculated groundwater 14c residence time documents recently infiltrating water in both the shallow and deep part of the aquifer where also tritium was detected meanwhile in the region under a natural hydraulic gradient recently infiltrating according to 14c investigation water was investigated with a detectable tritium content at level similar to the jozefowo site while in the deep part of the aquifer in the stagnation zone 2 100 year old groundwater was discovered without tritium the stable isotopes of Î´18o and Î´2h show a shift of the sampling point representing the deep part of the flow system indicating more negative values and confirming the different natures of these waters this work shown how groundwater chemistry can help to investigate groundwater flow systems the most significant finding is documentation of stagnation point in groundwater flow system what is unique field investigation it is also proven that the monitoring of groundwater chemistry should be performed for screened parts of the aquifer especially in recharge zones and in shallow parts of the flow system even though the shallow part is not used for water supply purposes in the long term in regions of groundwater extraction the quality of deep groundwater is expected to deteriorate if shallow contaminated groundwater penetrates due to changes in the natural hydraulic gradient author statement i declare that author krzysztof dragon individual

8264,study region the studied recharge zone of regionally extended quaternary aquifers lwÃ³wek region wielkpolska poland is located in a region where quaternary aquifers are the principal source of drinking water a visible water quality deterioration trend was observed manifested mainly by increase of nitrate concentration study focus the main objective of the presented study is to examine groundwater flow patterns and vertical difference of groundwater chemistry using a multicomponent chemical tracers approach and groundwater isotopic compositions stable isotopes tritium and radiocarbon new hydrological insights for the region this study documented the influence of water extraction on groundwater contamination the contamination plume that moves to the deepest parts of the aquifer in the region where water extraction is performed was documented as a consequence in deep parts of the aquifer nitrates appear and the groundwater chemistry is very similar to that observed in the shallow part meanwhile in regions where natural gradients exist without water extraction the contamination in the shallow part is also evident but recently infiltrating water does not reach the deeper parts of the aquifer a stagnation point exists in the deep part of the aquifer with completely different groundwater chemistry in the deep and shallow parts of the aquifer this work shown how groundwater chemistry can help to investigate groundwater flow systems keywords groundwater flow pattern groundwater chemistry regional aquifer system groundwater contamination by nitrate stagnation point 1 introduction determining groundwater chemistry and flow patterns are essential for effective water management and protection jeong 2001 edmunds et al 2002 perea and rodriguez rodriguez 2009 as defined by toth 1999 for groundwater chemistry formation the groundwater flow pattern is crucial because of 1 the interactions between water and the environment and 2 systematized and hierarchical flow paths distributing effects of interaction in the groundwater environment many studies investigating groundwater chemistry differentiation around the world can help to determine the flow pattern occurring in aquifers coetsiers and walraevens 2006 hendry and schwartz 1990 ophori and toth 1989 ochsenkuhn et al 1997 chang and wang 2010 wang et al 2013 dragon and gorski 2015 this is principally important in cases where complex hydrogeology i e in cases of multi layer aquifer systems pilla et al 2006 or groundwater extraction creating a cone of depression influence the flow pattern and hinder hydrodynamic investigation the groundwater flow pattern can be investigated in that case using multi component geochemical tracers and physical parameters can also be used as indicators of current flow pattern tweed et al 2005 a great tool to support the investigation of both groundwater flow pattern and groundwater chemistry origin are isotope techniques clark and fritz 1997 these investigations can help to determine the origin of groundwater rouabhia et al 2009 chen et al 2006 hamed et al 2011 and groundwater residence time edmunds and smedley 2000 zuber et al 2000 su et al 2009 as well as support investigations of recharge areas and recharge mechanisms chen et al 2006 lu et al 2008 abdalla 2009 marques et al 2013 for the present research the recharge zone of a regionally extended quaternary aquifer units was chosen during previous regional studies the groundwater origin was recognized to be controlled dominantly by natural geochemical processes but the influence of anthropogenic processes dominate in regions where preferential aquifer recharge exists dragon and gorski 2009 where an aquitard has relative low thickness 20 m or where the aquitard does not exist in these regions the intensification of human activity effects on groundwater chemistry has also been documented dragon 2012 but contamination still exists at a relatively low level dragon 2016 the investigation of groundwater circulation in the recharge zone was supported by chemical data and multivariate statistical analyses the spatial distribution of fluoride indicates a clear relationship with the flow pattern and show the lowest fluoride concentrations in the recharge zone where the highest effective infiltration occurs dragon and gorski 2015 these parts of the flow system are most vulnerable to contamination from the surface the recharge zone of regionally extended quaternary aquifer units was determined to be extremely vulnerable to groundwater contamination dragon 2013 as manifested mainly by relatively deep groundwater nitrate pollution the concentration of nitrate 10 mg l at a great depth of more than 80 m the main objective of the present study is to examine groundwater flow patterns using multicomponent chemical tracers and groundwater isotopic compositions the specific goals are 1 investigating the groundwater vertical chemistry differences in a recharge zone 2 documenting the influence of water extraction on groundwater contamination and 3 evaluating the feasibility of using groundwater chemistry to examine groundwater flow systems 2 the study area the study area is located in the highest part of the lwowek rakoniewice rampart in a region of relatively high ground elevation with the maximum of 138 m a s l this is the central part of the recharge zone of regionally extended quaternary aquifers figs 1 and 2 from the peak the elevation decreases in all directions to less than 100 m a s l there is one town in the study area lwÃ³wek and several small villages apart from the areas of settlement arable lands predominate where both the use of chemical fertilizers and manure spreading on the land are potential sources of groundwater contamination the thickness of the quaternary sediments is more than 120 m locally the lithology is dominated by glacial and fluvio glacial sediments the aquifers are composed by fluvio glacial sands and gravels fig 2 the shallower aquifer units usually have a small thickness less than 20 m and comprise fine sands the main aquifer in this region wielopolska buried valley aquifer main groundwater basin no 144 has variable thickness between 20 and 40 m and is formed by gravels and coarse sands in the deep part and medium and fine sands in shallower parts figs 1 and 2 the deepest quaternary aquifer unit discovered in this region in chmielinko comprises fine sands and has a thickness less than 20 m the aquifer units are usually characterized by confined and semi confined conditions with the aquitard composed by glacial tills the thickness of the aquitard is variable and ranges between 10 wytomysl and more than 100 m chmielinko but in investigated sites jozefowo and wladyslawowo aquitards are absent and sands and gravels forming aquifers occur from the surface to a depth of more than 100 m in the regions where hydrogeological windows occur the aquifer units are hydraulically connected whereas in the regions where aquitards occur the glacial tills cause the aquifer units to be vertically isolated these conditions form a multi layer aquifer system except of jozefowo and wladyslawowo regions it was previously documented that the water chemistry in aquifers surrounding the recharge zone figs 1 and 2 is highly influenced by the inflow of groundwater from the study area dragon and gorski 2009 2015 the permeability of the aquifer is very heterogenious particularly at the jozefowo site the variable occurrence of fine sands versus coarse sands and gravels with till inserts is observable in the vertical profile fig 2 and it can influence the vertical groundwater flow the principal sources of the groundwater recharge is the direct infiltration of water in the unconfined parts of the aquifer system and the indirect recharge by percolation of water through the glacial tills from the shallower to the deepest aquifer units it is expected that in the studied regions lwÃ³wek and wladyslawowo sites due to the existence of high permeable sediments and hydrogeological windows the direct infiltration is the main groundwater recharge component dragon 2012 2013 the selected region is located in the central part of the recharge zone on the groundwater divide from which groundwater flows either eastward to the warta river valley or westward to the obra river valley fig 1 the characteristic attribute of the recharge zone is a high downward gradient the documented difference in the piezometric water level between the deepest and shallowest aquifer units measured during well drilling is more than 14 0 m locally the well in chmielinko fig 2 the differences in water level between deep and shallow parts of the aquifer in the sites of the hydrogeological windows occurrence are smaller and were documented at level of 0 24 m in jozefowo the difference between j i and j iii and 0 06 m in wladyslawowo the difference between w i and w iii for a detailed study two sites were chosen the jozefowo site is located in the region of a well field comprising 3 productive wells 1 bis 1a and 2 fig 2 the admissible volume of extracted groundwater of these wells is 120 m3 h the wladyslawowo site is located in the region of an inactive well field wladyslawowo 1 fig 2 3 materials and methods the unconfined parts of the flow system in jozefowo and wladyslawowo were selected for a detailed study of groundwater chemistry changes in these regions two multilevel observation wells were drilled each adjacent to a productive well this location enabled the productive well to be used as the deepest sampling point fig 2 the multilevel system was constructed by drilling separate observation wells cluster type of observation wells in very close distance from each other 5 m each with screen located at different depth fig 2 the pipe diameter of the observation wells is 80 mm while the length of the well screen of each observation well is 1 m at jozefowo site the two observation wells with screens at the depth of 27 28 m j i and 46 47 m j iii were located close to the jozefowo 1 bis well meanwhile three observation wells with screens positioned at 31 32 m w i 42 43 m w ii and 54 55 m w iii were located near the wladyslawowo 1 well in wladyslawowo site it should be noted that the well in jozefowo is located in a region where groundwater extraction is performed whereas groundwater extraction does not occur in wladyslawowo this situation enables the observation of groundwater chemistry changes in a vertical profile relative to the water extraction conditions groundwater sampling was performed in june 2018 the sampling campaign included multilevel observation wells including productive well 1 bis and inactive well at wladyslawowo which are located close to multilevel observation wells the location of these sampling points is marked on vertical profiles presented on figs 4 and 5 additionally the chemical analyses was performed in remaining productive wells of the jozefowo well field 1a and 2 the observation wells were pumped using an mp 1 grundfos pump while the inactive well in wladyslawowo was pumped by a grundfos sp 17 pump powered by a power generator before sampling the observation wells were pumped for a minimum 2 h to ensure minimum three times the water exchange in the well pipes in the inactive well in wladyslawowo 12 h of cleaning pumping was performed before sampling water samples were collected in 100 ml hdpe polyethylene bottles the bottles were rinsed three times before sampling and filled completely to prevent degassing samples for the nitrogen compounds analyses were treated with chloroform and the samples for iron and manganese testing were treated with hno3 after sampling the water was stored in a portable refrigerator in cold temperature 4 6 c and transported to the laboratory the same day the following parameters were measured directly in the field using a portable aquaread ap700 after standard calibration electrical conductivity ph eh potential oxygen content and temperature the alkalinity expressing hco3 concentrations was measured in the field by titration the field sampling was performed under relevant iso 5667 11 standards iso 5667 11 1993 the chemical analyses were performed in the laboratory of adam mickiewicz university in poznan institute of geology using a compact ic 881pro ionic chromatograph as a quality control measure the ionic error balance was calculated the calculated error did not exceed 3 the levels of stable isotopes Î´18o and Î´2h in four water samples representing the shallowest and deepest water at each site were determined and expressed in terms of the Î´ v smow standard mean ocean water these water samples were also analysed for c14 reported as percent modern carbon pmc for groundwater age estimation the ingerson pearson model was used ingerson and pearson 1964 clark and fritz 1997 the tritium content was measured in nine water samples and expressed in tus tritium units the isotope analyses were performed in the laboratory of the university of science and technology faculty of physics and applied computer science in cracow poland the results of the isotope analyses presented by dragon and gorski 2015 were also used in the data interpretation 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry the results of the hydrochemical investigation presented on the piper diagram fig 3 show a different nature for the vertical groundwater chemistry differences observed in the two investigated sites the sampling points from jozefowo clustered in one place on the diagram while the sampling points representing water from wladyslawowo differed from the others the water sampled from the shallowest part of the aquifer w i was clustered in this same field like the samples from jozefowo whereas the points representing the deepest parts of the aquifer w iii and wladyslawowo 1 were clearly shifted the middle sampling point w ii is located between these two point groups the results of the laboratory and field measurements are presented in table 1 while the vertical differences of chosen parameters at the jozefowo site are presented in fig 4 on this plot the results from the multilevel observation well are presented j i and j iii sampling points and the productive well jozefowo 1 bis was the deepest sampling point fig 2 the water chemistry observed in the vertical profile in jozefowo is very similar in both the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer table 1 fig 4 and a small deviation from this trend at the j iii sampling point was documented importantly the nitrate observed in a shallow part of the aquifer at a concentration of 12 6 mg l had a similar concentration as the well jozefowo 1 bis 9 98 mg l in the middle part j iii the concentration of nitrate was very small 1 39 mg l the opposite trend was documented for the sulphate concentration increasing from 58 0 mg l in the shallow part of the aquifer profile to 79 3 mg l in the middle part while decreasing to 68 9 mg l in the deep part well 1 bis a similar differentiation was also observed in the case of water oxidability 3 0 mgo2 l in the shallow part increasing to 4 5 mgo2 l in the middle part and decreasing to 2 5 mgo2 l in the deepest part jozefowo 1 bis importantly for the following interpretation the eh potential was very similar in the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer 297 7 and 297 mv respectively but significantly smaller in the middle of the profile 231 0 mv in the shallowest part of the aquifer the presence of oxygen was documented 4 45 mg l a small oxygen concentration was also detected at jÃ³zefowo 1 bis 0 23 mg l comparing the water chemistry between each productive well of the jozefowo site the different nitrate concentrations should be noted the highest concentration was observed at well 1 bis 9 98 mg l and the smallest was observed at well 2 1 47 mg l a different nature of the vertical groundwater chemistry changes was documented at the wladyslawowo site where the groundwater chemistry in the deep part differed considerably from that observed in the shallow part of the aquifer the vertical changes of the chosen parameters at the wladyslawowo site are presented on fig 5 on this plot the results from the multilevel observation well are presented w i w ii and w iii sampling points and the productive well at wladyslawowo is the deepest sampling point fig 2 the concentration of almost all parameters are higher in the shallow part of the aquifer while the concentrations are very low in the deepest part the most distinct differentiation showed the following nitrate concentrations 33 5 mg l in the shallow part versus very low concentrations in the deepest part 1 07 1 06 and 0 025 mg l at w ii w iii and wladyslawowo 1 respectively the concentration of chloride and sulphate were considerably higher in the shallowest part 24 8 and 60 1 mg l respectively compared with 2 83 and 9 46 mg l in the deepest part of the aquifer respectively the highest electrical conductivity and total hardness as well as concentration of calcium were also evident compared with the water in the deep part of the aquifer similar to the jozefowo site a relatively high concentration of oxygen was detected only in the shallowest part of the aquifer 7 93 mg l in w i whereas there was no oxygen in the deepest part compared with the jozefowo site a different pattern of eh potential was documented the highest redox potential was measured in the shallowest part of the aquifer 301 0 mv in w i decreasing to 74 0 mv at wladyslawowo 1 4 2 groundwater isotopic composition the isotope investigation was performed on 4 water samples 2 at each site representing the shallowest part of the aquifers sampling points j i and w i at the jozefowo and wladyslawowo sites respectively and the deepest parts of the aquifer jozefowo 1 bis and wladyslawowo 1 the measurement included stable isotopes of Î´18o and Î´2h and radiocarbon 14c the tritium content was measured for each water sample the results are presented in table 2 the stable isotopes of Î´18o and Î´2h represent relatively similar range between 9 59 and 9 62 for Î´18o and between 67 2 and 67 7 for Î´2h with slightly more negative values at the wladyslawowo sampling point 9 68 and 68 6 for Î´18o and Î´2h respectively the calculated groundwater residence time indicates the presence of recent infiltrating water in 3 water samples in both shallow and deep parts of the aquifers in jozefowo and in the shallow part in wladyslawowo meanwhile the residence time calculated for the wladyslawowo 1 sampling point deep part of the aquifer documented the presence of 2 100 year old water tritium was detected in both the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer at jozefowo with a range between 2 8 and 4 1 t u whereas at wladyslawowo tritium was detected only in the shallow part of the aquifer 6 5 and 3 2 t u at the w i and w ii sampling points respectively no tritium was found in the deep part of the aquifer 5 discussion groundwater occurring in the shallow part of the aquifer is strongly influenced by contamination from the surface the contamination is reflected mainly by the high level of nitrate concentration 12 6 mg l at jozefowo and 33 5 mg l at wladyslawowo other parameters also reflect the influence of contamination occurring at higher concentrations in shallowest parts of the aquifer i e chloride and total hardness reflecting the concentration of calcium and magnesium the nature of groundwater chemistry changes indicates that the main source of contamination is diffuse from both manure spreading and chemical fertilizers meanwhile the influence of un severed settlement is negligible in this region this finding is supported by a relatively high nitrate concentration but low chloride concentration reflecting sewage influence gorski 1989 the concentration of boron another indicator of sewage influence lasagna and de luca 2019 was also very low the contaminants observed in the shallow part of the aquifer in the region of water extraction jozefowo site migrated downward and reached the deepest parts of the aquifer whereas in wladyslawowo the region where extraction is not performed recently infiltrating groundwater did not reach the deepest parts of the aquifer this finding is documented by the completely different natures of vertical chemistry at these two sites at jozefowo the groundwater chemistry observed in the deep part of the aquifer was very similar to that observed in the shallow part the similar eh value in the shallow and deep parts of the aquifer prove that under groundwater extraction conditions water moves easily from shallow to deep parts of the aquifer as a result a

vertical profile fig 6 and the calculated groundwater 14c residence time showed recently infiltrating water also occurring in the deep part of the aquifer table 2 moreover the tritium was at a similar level compared with water from the shallow part of the aquifer only sulphate and nitrate and oxidability and the eh measurement did not confirm these observations and deviated in the trends observed in j iii sampling point fig 4 the nature of groundwater chemistry indicates denitrification to be the most probable reason the highest comparing to adjacent zones concentration of sulphate denitrification product and very low concentration of nitrate and low hco3 suggest the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification processes rivett et al 2008 the changes in lithology in the geological profile occurrence of low permeable till lenses fig 2 that cause the lower eh potential in this zone can form the local favourable conditions for the development of the denitrification processes near j iii screen zone the difference in groundwater chemistry especially differentiation of nitrate concentrations of each well of jozefowo well field can be elucidated by two factors the well 1bis is the newest and is exploited the most intensively in well 1a and 2 small thickness 4 m of low permeable lenses occur glacial tills which can limit contaminants downward migration meanwhile at wladyslawowo

is expected to deteriorate if shallow contaminated groundwater penetrates due to changes in the natural hydraulic gradient author statement i declare that author krzysztof dragon individual
