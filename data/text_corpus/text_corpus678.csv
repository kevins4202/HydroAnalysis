3390,hydraulic properties are well known to be essential in controlling fluid flow solute migration and heat transport in fractured subsurface however accurate characterization of hydraulic properties including the locations of conductive fracture and their hydraulic conductivities as well as their cross well connectivity is still challenging in this work we modified the inversion framework of travel time based thermal tracer tomography tt firstly based on a numerical study considering the features of heat transfer in fractured media a regularization term and an irregular triangular mesh are introduced a distortion of thermal travel times caused by annular wall flow at an observation well is eliminated by assigning a specific well zone in the inversion model the performance of this modified inversion framework in characterizing hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers is firstly analyzed through nine numerical tests results indicate that the modified tt method can efficiently identify directly connected or interconnected fractures even with the presence of an ambient hydraulic gradient observation well annular wall flow or measurements based on conventional thermal sensors with less precision accordingly a tomographic thermal tracer test is performed and analyzed at a fractured rock experimental site located at the university of göttingen germany it can be inferred that there is a directly connected fracture two interconnected fractures and an overburden zone with hydraulic conductivities between 5 10 4 m s and 1 10 5 m s the outcomes demonstrate that the proposed inversion framework is efficient and robust in characterizing hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers keywords hydraulic conductivity profile hydraulic connectivity fractured aquifer thermal tracer tomography field investigation travel time inversion 1 introduction in fractured bedrock the fracture system may form preferential flow paths it is therefore of great importance for fluid and contaminant migration for example in the fields of energy supply oil and gas industry geothermal energy production and of environmental safety contamination remediation nuclear waste disposal co2 sequestration it is essential to characterize the hydraulic properties of a fractured system such as the locations of conductive fracture their hydraulic conductivities and the cross well connectivity however due to the mostly complex fracture geometry and pronounced hydraulic heterogeneity this characterization has been long one of the major challenges in hydrogeology within the past decades numerous studies have been devoted to this field especially those using cross well tomographical imaging methods such as geophysical tomography day lewis 2001 karasaki et al 2000 robinson et al 2016 hydraulic tomography dong et al 2019 illman 2014 illman et al 2009 klepikova et al 2020 and tracer tomography brauchler et al 2013a kittilä et al 2019 klepikova et al 2014 compared to geophysical methods hydraulic and tracer tests can directly provide hydraulic information without additional correlation analysis hu et al 2017 tracer testing provides not only the most intuitive evidence of cross well hydraulic connectivity but also implies information on transport connectivity of fractures knudby and carrera 2005 recently with the technological advances in temperature monitoring such as fiber optic distributed temperature sensing dts and flexible borehole liners measuring temperature evolution along a borehole becomes more efficient accurate and economical bakker et al 2015 coleman et al 2015 maldaner et al 2019 pehme et al 2010 read et al 2013 this makes heat as an ideal choice compared to conventional tracers and using heat as a tracer to investigate hydraulic properties of fractured zone is attracting more and more attention cross well thermal tracer tomography that combines thermal tracer techniques with imaging methods has been promoted in the past several years to reconstruct aquifer heterogeneity doro et al 2015 schwede et al 2014 somogyvári and bayer 2017 somogyvári et al 2016 wagner et al 2014 this novel technique was intensively studied in porous media so far including a comparative analysis with hydraulic tomography and joint inversion using head and temperature measurements etc lee et al 2018 ringel et al 2019 schwede et al 2014 somogyvári et al 2016 somogyvári et al 2019 in order to investigate aquifer heterogeneity in the field doro et al 2015 improved the field scale experimental design for thermal tracer tomography using travel time based thermal tracer tomography tt somogyvári and bayer 2017 successfully estimated hydraulic conductivity profiles in alluvial sediments however up to now this method was rarely studied for the characterization of fractured media applying cross well thermal tracer tomography in fractured media still encounters some obstacles firstly in fractured bedrock conductive fractures are the preferential channels for groundwater flow and heat transfer their hydraulic conductivity can be generally much higher than that of the matrix when performing a cross well thermal tracer test due to different time scales of the experiment and of heat conduction temperature changes may only be observed at depths where connected fractures are exposed to the observation well this spatially sparse temperature response can result in a strong ill posed inversion problem secondly fracture systems usually have a complex geometry that is the fractures can be disconnected connected by a dominant single fracture or interconnected in a network and hydraulic conductivities of fractures controlled by fracture distribution aperture and filling material can vary significantly at a small scale national research council 1996 the connectivity between fractures and their different hydraulic conductivities will increase the non uniqueness of the inversion result also a classical regular inversion grid may cause difficulties in tracing the irregular fracture geometry thus introducing calculation errors in addition some practical issues such as ambient groundwater flow or vertical flow within the well if any will affect the heat transport processes during tomographic testing and thus distort the parameter estimation results nevertheless due to the high conductivity contrast between fractures and rock matrix the injected water and heat will preferentially flow through the fractures compared to porous media the distortion of the flow field induced by a high injection rate can be much lower temperature response can be received much faster at the same injection rate and heat transport will be less affected by heat diffusion facing the foregoing ill posed and non uniqueness problem travel time based inversion is considered an efficient method brauchler et al 2013b hu et al 2011b somogyvári et al 2016 thermal travel time is defined as the propagation time of a thermal tracer front in the source receiver dipole since only the thermal travel times need to be matched instead of all temperature data this approach is robust and can significantly reduce computational cost because the inversion problem for travel times is quasi linear its solution can be much less sensitive to the initial model compared to non linear inversion problems such as the full wave inversion vasco 2018 in addition introducing a regularization constraint in the inversion framework is also an effective method to solve the ill posed problems illman et al 2015 wang et al 2017 apart from this using a dts system to monitor temperature changes is another approach to reduce the uncertainty of inversion results by providing high resolution temperature data in space and time maldaner et al 2019 pehme et al 2010 combining these techniques the intention of this study is to modify and improve the inversion framework and to evaluate the feasibility of thermal tracer tomography to characterize hydraulic properties of fractured media according to the features of heat transfer in fractured media we firstly modify the inversion framework of the tt method in section 2 in section 3 the performance of this modified inversion framework in characterizing the hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers is evaluated and validated through nine numerical tests finally a field scale thermal tracer tomography experiment is implemented at a fractured rock experimental site located at the north campus of the university of göttingen germany and the fracture connectivity as well as the cross well hydraulic conductivity profile are finally delineated through the numerical and field experiments the advantages and disadvantages of the tt method in obtaining hydraulic characteristics of fractured media are discussed considering future studies and related applications 2 inverse modeling of thermal tracer tomography in fractured aquifers 2 1 travel time based thermal tracer tomography vasco and datta gupta 1999 first derived a trajectory based integral formula that directly links the solute travel time to hydraulic conductivity k based on the similarity of the solute transport and the heat transfer equations somogyvári et al 2016 further extended this trajectory based integral formula for thermal tracer tomography they considered thermal retardation and proposed an early time diagnostics method to improve the accuracy of the inversion result the thermal travel time t tt is defined as the propagation time of a thermal tracer front along the path l from the injection source x s to a receiver x r which is given in somogyvári et al 2016 1 t tt x r x s x r ϕ l r k l h l d l in which ϕ is the porosity distribution h is the hydraulic gradient and r is the thermal retardation factor defined as 2 r ρ b c b ρ w c w where ρ is the density and c represents the specific heat capacity and the subscript b and w denote the rock material and water respectively to invert the hydraulic conductivity distribution using thermal travel times some other assumptions need to be made in eq 1 the thermal travel time is not only affected by the hydraulic conductivity field but also by the porosity the hydraulic gradient and by the thermal retardation factor nevertheless comparing to k the variance of the other three parameters is usually much smaller for a fractured medium thus they can be approximated by a constant value in the entire model somogyvári et al 2016 assuming that a site of interest contains m source receiver pairs and the site domain is discretized into n cells in the inversion model the path integral eq 1 can be discretized into a matrix form 3 t m a where t is an m vector of observed thermal travel time m is an m n matrix and its elements m ij represent the trajectory lengths of the i th ray through the j th element a is a n vector containing a homogeneous and isotropic material property a j in each cell which is defined as a j ϕ j r k j h j according to fermat s principle eq 3 is subject to the so called shortest path problem which is widespread in network optimization and seismic tomography in a highly heterogeneous fractured medium the shortest path propagates toward the high k fracture zone which makes the matrix m very sparse in this study dijkstra s algorithm is applied to trace the shortest paths for the sparse matrix more details about dijkstra s algorithm can be found in dijkstra 1959 xu et al 2007 and zhao et al 2004 2 2 numerical techniques considering hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers 2 2 1 regularization constraint when inverting the thermal tracer test data from fractured aquifers one of the main challenges is a spatially sparse temperature response this is because temperature changes in observation wells can only be observed at those depths where the connected fractures are exposed to the well screen considering the time scales of the experiment and of heat conduction as a result the inversion framework will be ill posed since the number of measurements is much less than the discretized cells in the inversion model to solve this problem a regularization term is commonly introduced into the objective function φ which is given by rücker et al 2017 4 φ w fit t d a 2 2 lam w reg a a 0 2 2 where w fit is the weighting matrix containing the observation errors and w reg is the model constraint matrix to restrict the parameters to be varying in reasonable ranges d represents the forward operator using the dijkstra s algorithm and a 0 is a reference parameter model lam is a parameter weighting the importance of the parameter model constraints which can be regarded as a smoothness operator to minimize this objective function the gauss newton iteration method is adopted in field applications such as predicting the spread of a contaminant plume the main target is on obtaining the hydraulic properties of highly conductive fractures which form preferential pathways it is therefore necessary to retain more information on the short thermal travel times in the inversion framework this can be achieved in the numerical iteration process by reducing the weight of the regularization term lam or by adjusting the weighting matrix of the observation error w fit in order to avoid introduction of new uncertainties only lam will be adjusted during the iteration in this study 2 2 2 irregular inversion mesh another main feature of heat transfer in fractured aquifers is a sharp thermal front and the complex pathway of the front which is controlled by the hydraulic conductivities of fractures and their geometry since the travel time tomography is trajectory based it is suitable for detecting the preferential pathways the trajectories are typically restricted to iterate along the mesh in the inversion domain in a regular grid the calculated trajectory could thus be longer than the actual fracture leading to overestimated k values using an irregular triangular mesh to discretize the model could be more conducive because at a fixed mesh density the irregular mesh will provide more reasonable channels for trajectory tracing additionally a secondary node is also added to each mesh edge to make the trajectory calculation more accurate 2 2 3 specific well zone vertical flow may occur in an observation well when there is a head difference between the fractures covered by the well which can deflect the flow field significantly and affect the heat transfer process pehme et al 2010 to hinder the thermal signal from being distorted by vertical flow a flexible borehole liner is employed in some studies coleman et al 2015 munn et al 2020 however unsealed or fully screened observation wells are still common in field testing to investigate and to consider the distortion of thermal travel times caused by vertical flow an open observation well is represented in the inversion model a well zone is cut out from the inversion domain by adjusting the constraint weights to zero at the interface between the well zone and the aquifer domain the hydraulic conductivity of the well can be inverted independently of the surrounding aquifer the shortened travel time observed at a sensor placed along the open observation well can be thus corrected based on the generalized form of darcy s law the hydraulic conductivity k x within the well zone is assumed to be uniform and approximated by bear 2013 hu et al 2011a 5 k x x ω wel r w 2 8 ρ w g μ where r w is the well radius ρ w is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water the k x will be assigned for the observation well in the following forward modelling to consider the vertical flow and will also be set as the initial value for the well zone in the inversion framework to correct the measured travel time data 2 3 numerical implementation the inverse modeling of the thermal tracer tomography is implemented in an open source python code using a framework built based on the geophysical library pygimli rücker et al 2017 the traveltimemanager module is originally developed for seismic travel time inversion it can be extended to solve the travel time based thermal tracer tomography problem due to the similarity of the inversion formula in the inversion framework the initial k of the well zone is calculated by eq 5 depending on the well radius for the aquifer zone the initial model is estimated by the measured thermal travel time the range of the inverted k values of the aquifer zone will be limited between 1 10 8 m s and 0 1 m s this is reasonable because the observed thermal signal mainly contains the hydraulic information of the conductive fractures in addition an optimized smoothness operator lam op will be determined by the numerical tests in the next section 3 synthetic examples for model performance evaluation 3 1 numerical setup in order to evaluate the performance of the thermal tracer tomography in a fractured medium a series of numerical tests were carried out in a two dimensional 2d model although flow in fractured rocks is usually three dimensional the 2d approximation is still reasonable in certain local zones such as in a zone with obvious principal stress directions lang et al 2018 or near geological structures that control the local seepage field in the forward modelling the discrete fracture matrix dfm model is utilized which preserves the dominant fractures and upscales and replaces the secondary fractures by averaged quantities of the porous matrix this is due to the fact that during a thermal tracer test the heat transport process is dominated by heat advection in the connected fractures and by heat diffusion in the porous rock matrix which consists of discrete disconnected fractures the forward hydrothermal processes are simulated using the finite volume method details on derivation of the equations and on the modelling method are provided in the appendix as shown in fig 1 a 2d geometric model 40 m 20 m consisting of an upper porous layer and a fractured bedrock is set up hydraulic conductivities k in each domain are isotropic and homogeneous the k values of the upper layer and the bedrock are 10 6 and 10 8 m s respectively fractures are inserted as line elements and assumed to be straight with various lengths angles and k values which will be adjusted for different scenarios for simulating the tomographic thermal tracer tests six injection intervals and eleven monitoring points are placed considering that the straddle packer system is often employed during heat injection heat and water flow in the injection well is neglected the effects of the unsealed observation well on heat and water flow will be evaluated in the following case study based on this geometric model nine different scenarios were designed aiming at different fracture connectivity k distributions and some practical issues table 1 lists the main parameters for these cases three fractures in fig 1 represent three modes of cross well hydraulic connectivity i e disconnected fracture 1 directly connected fracture 2 and interconnected fractures 2 and 3 from case 1 to case 3 a fracture is added each time and the hydraulic conductivity of the added fracture k f is set to 1 10 4 m s from case 4 to case 6 k f of these three fractures is reduced individually to 1 10 6 m s from case 7 to case 9 three practical issues are considered including ambient hydraulic gradient h 1 temperature sensor accuracy δ t 0 and vertical flow in the observation well in case 9 an observation well is implemented with a radius of 0 05 m and a length of 18 m the vertical flow inside the observation well is achieved by assigning a high hydraulic conductivity k well 3125 m s to the well which is defined as eq 5 in section 2 2 3 according to these scenarios nine forward and inverse model simulations are carried out table a1 shows all the simulation parameters of the hydrothermal processes in the forward modelling continuous thermal injection tests are simulated at the six injection intervals sequentially the injected water temperature is 10 c above the background temperature and the injection rate is 0 5 l s all the injections are simulated for ten days by comparing the inverted k with the true values the optimized smoothness operator lam op is set to 10 the thermal travel times at the eleven monitoring points fig 1 are recorded and then used to invert the hydraulic conductivity profiles only the total temperature changes at a monitoring point greater than 0 001 c will be included in the inversion procedure considering thermal sensor accuracy to consider the heat diffusion effects on the thermal travel time the early time diagnostics method proposed by somogyvári et al 2016 is employed additionally accounting for the observation error a gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 is added to the travel time datasets 3 2 inversion model performance fig 2 shows the nine inverted hydraulic conductivity profiles corresponding to the designed cases the orange lines denote the true fracture geometry and the grey curves are the calculated trajectories between the sources and receivers all nine k tomograms can be divided into three categories the tomograms in the top row fig 2a c corresponding to case 1 3 reflect the capability of the inversion to detect the cross well hydraulic connectivity the results indicate that fracture connectivity can be clearly identified if the true fracture geometry is cross well connected as shown in fig 2b and c once a fracture is disconnected such as shown in fig 2a the inversion result cannot retrieve it because the travel times observed at each monitoring point have minor differences which are hardly to form a preferential channel in fig 2c although the connected fracture is bifurcated on the right side the position of the bottom fracture fracture 3 is deflected the reason could be the impact of the top disconnected fracture 1 on the seepage field thus disturbing the thermal travel times the second aim is to test the inversion procedure in identifying the hydraulic properties of fractures under different k contrasts the inversion results based on case 4 6 are shown in fig 2d f it illustrates that different k contrasts between fractures have a significant impact on the inverted hydraulic profile in fig 2e when the k of fracture 2 decreases to 1 10 6 m s and the k of fracture 1 and 3 keep at 1 10 4 m s only one potential fracture is revealed its trajectory is close to the high k path i e the left part of fracture 2 plus fracture 3 however the inverted k value along this trajectory is averaged which is close to 5 10 5 m s this indicates that it is hard to distinguish the changes of the k value in a connected fracture using the trajectory based inversion method additionally as shown in fig 2f when a low k fracture fracture 3 inserts in a high k fracture fracture 2 the low k fracture is covered from the calculated trajectories fracture 3 is ignored and instead more is passing through fracture 2 to make up the misfit in thermal travel times this implies that the inverted profile tends to reveal the preferential flow path if there is no additional fracture geometry information when the k of interconnected fractures is equivalent as illustrated in fig 2d the k value is accurately estimated and the fracture geometry is very similar to the truth comparing to fig 3 c it is further confirmed that the k magnitude of the top disconnected fracture can affect the thermal travel times although this fracture is not recognized in future applications prior information such as fracture geometry and matrix data zhao et al 2021 can improve the inversion results through correcting the thermal travel time to examine the uncertainty of the inversion results considering some practical issues three scenarios are considered in the last category firstly fig 2g shows the inversion result of thermal tracer tomography under an extremely high natural hydraulic gradient of 0 2 m m from the right to the left side the result shows that the interconnected fractures fracture 2 and 3 can be clearly recognized and the k distribution is very close to the case without ambient gradient fig 2c this indicates that the ambient hydraulic gradient has less influence on the inversion results when the injection rate is around 0 5 l s secondly fig 2h is the inversion result of the case in which the accuracy of the temperature sensor is assumed to be 0 1 c that is only the travel times in which the observed temperature responses vary more than 0 1 c are used for inversion which means that only several sensors near the fractures can receive temperature responses this makes the inverted data matrix more sparse and the inversion gets more ill posed however the inversion result in fig 2h can still identify a connected fracture fracture 2 from the calculated trajectories the other one fracture 3 can also be recognized thirdly to correct the distorted thermal travel times caused by vertical flow in the open observation well a well zone is added at the right side of the inversion model with the width of 0 1 m i e the diameter of the observation well represented in the forward model the k in the well zone is iterated separately from the aquifer thus it can be much higher than that of the aquifer the inverted k distribution shown in fig 2i indicates that the high k distribution in the aquifer not only covers the connected fractures but also an area between the fractures and the well this is because the thermal travel times observed at the sensors between the identified fractures become very similar due to the rapid flow inside the well the calculated trajectories thus short circuit in this area overall these nine numerical tests show that the travel time based inversion procedure is efficient and robust in identifying the connected fractures and in estimating the k distribution 4 field application 4 1 site description the fractured rock experimental site is located at the north campus of the university of göttingen germany this test site consists of six groundwater wells with a depth of 80 m well bhe and w were built in 2007 for the study of shallow geothermal energy problems in order to investigate the hydraulic properties of fractures and apply hydraulic and thermal tracer tomography another four groundwater wells well n o m and s were installed at this site in 2013 the well arrangement lithology and well design are illustrated in fig 3 geologically this test site is located at the eastern shoulder of the leinetalgraben which is a distinctive zone of subsidence in the southern part of lower saxony germany its geological structure is very complicated due to polyphase tectonic development under various tension forces leiss 2011 following werner 2013 especially in the eastern shoulder including this site it is dominated by nne striking faults with high offsets and a number of folds fractures have also well developed lithologically this area is located in the lower and middle keuper which mainly consists of clay sequences and silt sandstone layers the main lithology exposed by the drill cores is shown in fig 3b moreover the geophysical loggings show that the bedding planes dip constantly with approximately 75 towards se the acoustic and optic televiewer data delivers three trends of the dip angle and azimuth of inserted fractures 351 06 221 37 and 045 59 werner 2013 the well design is depicted in fig 3c to achieve tomographic testing at this site each well has been provided with separated nine filter sections that are hydraulically connected to different geological strata the diameters of the boreholes and the well pipes are 0 2 m and 0 08 m respectively the well pipe except the top 8 m casing is composed of alternating 5 m screened and 3 m non screened sections the corresponding filling materials outside the well pipe are filter gravel and clay pellets additionally fiber optical cables for dts based groundwater temperature monitoring are installed along the well pipes in this study the spatial resolution of the dts system is 0 5 m and the standard deviation of a temperature value is 0 1 c 4 2 preliminary testing several other studies have been carried out at this site including geophysical loggings hydraulic tomography and groundwater temperature monitoring baetzel 2017 jahr et al 2020 oberdorfer et al 2013 schuster 2015 werner 2013 yang et al 2020 their findings demonstrate that highly conductive fractures are mainly distributed at the top 40 m particularly between well m and o still it is hard to figure out the accurate locations of the connected fractures between the wells and their hydraulic conductivities 4 3 tomographic thermal tracer test with the experience from the numerical tests and the preliminary testing results a tomographic thermal tracer test was designed and implemented at the top four screen intervals ca 40 m length between well m and o experimental design of this test is depicted in fig 4 warm water heated to about 20 c was first injected sequentially at each of the top four 5 m screen intervals in well m a double packer system was employed to isolate the 5 m sections in the injection well each injection lasted for at least 5 h at a rate of 0 4 l s then waiting for heat dissipation for about two days afterwards this multilevel thermal injection test was repeated in well o in the same way only well m and well o are selected because the evident thermal signal is only observed in these two wells during the 5 h of each test which corroborates the finding of the preliminary tests showing that the hydraulic connection between well m and o is better than between the others baetzel 2017 the temperature evolutions along all the wells were recorded by the dts with a spatial resolution of 0 5 m and a temporal resolution of 1 min note that since the observation well was open during the tests the temperature evolutions in this well may be affected by vertical well flow fig 5 shows the temperature evolutions along the observation wells above 40 m the heatmaps in the first row represent the temperature evolution in well o when the warm water was injected sequentially at the top four screen sections of well m in turn heatmaps in the second row represent the temperature responses in well m when injecting in well o it is obvious that a clear temperature response can be observed in all cases except in fig 5e when injecting at screen sections other than the first a rapid and multiple depth temperature response can be observed in fig 5b c and 5f h the temperature observed at similar depth compared to the injection section varies more sharply than the others and the temperature changes along the well seems to be impacted by the well construction such as the temperature depression at the depth of 13 16 m in fig 5b d overall the observed temperature evolutions reflect that some well connected fractures exist between these two wells the observed multiple depth temperature response may be due to the vertical flow in the open observation well 5 inversion results and discussion after denoising the observed temperature datasets using the method proposed by yang et al 2020 a total of 264 thermal travel times were extracted based on the early time diagnostic method after identifying the peak value of each thermal response curve the early travel time corresponding to 10 of the peak value can be found the early travel time is then extrapolated to the ideal travel time that takes heat diffusion into account somogyvári et al 2016 in the inversion procedure the inversion domain is 40 m deep and 2 8 m wide consisting of well m and o and the aquifer between them the borehole radius is 0 1 m and the horizontal distance between these two wells is set to 2 4 m which is the average distance considering the borehole drilling deviation according to geophysical loggings such as the ultrasonic pulse velocity test baetzel 2017 schuster 2015 some inversion parameters are determined the density of the rock ρ b is about 2500 kg m3 the porosity ϕ is averaged to 0 2 and the specific heat capacity c b of the bedrock is estimated to 1300 j kg k an average hydraulic gradient of h 0 08 in the east west direction is calculated by head measurements during the test in addition the vertical flow in the observation well is considered after the numerical calculations the inversion result of the reconstructed log 10 k field and the calculated trajectories are presented in fig 6 the tomogram in fig 6a reveals four high k connected zones between well m and o at a depth of ca 10 m 20 m 28 m and 36 m the inverted k values of these zones are in a range from 5 10 4 m s to 1 10 5 m s they can be considered as potentially connected fractures except for the top zone at about 10 m this is because the k values nearby the top zone are obviously lower than the others and the high k zone is relatively larger combining with the lithological background fig 3b this zone can be determined as the overburden additionally several sub high k zones in which the values are around 1 10 5 m s are present near the inferred fractures such as the zones nearby well m at a depth of around 17 m and 31 m close to well o according to the calculated trajectories shown in fig 6b their appearance seems to be caused by the high hydraulic conductivity between the well and the corresponding dts sensing points note that the inverted minimum k value of 1 10 6 m s in this tomogram does not represent the hydraulic conductivity of the rock matrix this is because the travel times used for the inversion only include the temperature response that can be detected within 5 h but not the travel time through rock matrix which would be much longer moreover the k values within the well zones are also estimated in the inversion procedure the inverted k values in these zones shown in fig 6a are much higher than those within the aquifer except for the top 5 m their distribution however is not the direct reflection of the flow velocity in the well but a common manifestation of the conductivity including the part within the well and the part from the well to the dts sensing points due to the well construction the hydraulic connectivity between the well and the different sensing points is distinct thus the k distribution in the well zone is not very smooth in summary the inverted tomogram has clearly identified an overburden above 14 m and three connected fractures at ca 20 m 28 m and 35 m between well m and o with k values between 5 10 4 m s and 1 10 5 m s the validation of the inversion results includes two aspects i e the fracture locations and the magnitude of k validation results for the two wells m and o are shown in fig 7 firstly to verify the fracture locations the inverted k profiles are compared with the vertical well flow rate profiles measured by flowmeter logging under pumping in the flow rate curves the location of the conductive fractures can be figured out through a sudden increase of the vertical flow rate accordingly the inferred locations of fracture are marked by the red points in fig 7 by comparison it can be found that the fracture locations identified by these two results in each well are quite consistent secondly to verify the k magnitude the inverted k values are compared with results from permeability tests on rock drill cores from well n and with results from conventional pumping tests in well m and o in the drill cores from well n nine fractures were found at the top 40 m and tested in laboratory for permeability by schuster 2015 the bar chart shown in fig 7c depicts the measured k and the apparent aperture size three high k fractures are revealed although the locations are similar to the inversion results the magnitude of measured k from the laboratory is approximately two orders lower compared to the inverted values however according to pumping tests conducted in well m and o the estimated k values are 6 68 10 5 m s and 6 78 10 4 m s respectively these results demonstrate that the magnitude of the inverted k is much larger than the measured k from rock cores at laboratory scale but slightly smaller than the estimated k from the pumping tests considering spatial variability and lab field scale effects of k measurements this difference is reasonable based on experiences gained from numerical tests several uncertainties of travel time based inversion results from field tests can be recognized the first is that cross well disconnected fractures may not be revealed by the inversion procedure including high k fractures according to the numerical results shown in fig 2a although there is a local preferential flow path it cannot shorten thermal travel times because of the extremely low k in the rock matrix the second point is that there is an uncertainty in the k magnitude of the revealed fractures as shown in fig 2e when the k magnitude changes along the connected fracture this change will be averaged along the entire trajectory by the inversion procedure therefore in fig 6a the k values in each revealed fracture are also averaged thirdly the vertical flow in the observation well may mask some interconnected fractures the travel time difference among the dts sensing locations placed at depths between the inserted fracture locations is hard to recognize due to the rapid vertical flow this results in a short circuit area of inverted k as shown in fig 2i in fig 6a some similar areas nearby well m at a depth of around 17 m and approx 31 m deep close to well o can therefore be interpreted as interconnected fractures it is worth noting that this inference may be impacted by the structures beyond the inversion domain which is not considered in the travel time approach the modified thermal tracer tomography shows a good applicability for characterization of hydraulic properties of fractured media with the high spatial and temporal resolution of dts thermal tracer tomography can efficiently and accurately capture the locations of conductive fractures as well as fracture connectivity and provide the spatial distribution of k values furthermore even if the thermal travel times are disturbed by vertical flow in the observation well reliable inversion result can still be obtained from field experiments although the fracture is assumed to be straight due to the short distance between the wells in this study we believe that the proposed method can be easily upscaled for instance the inversion model can be constrained by supplementing the orientation of fractures zhao et al 2021 6 conclusions through numerical experiments it is demonstrated that the modified tt method tends to reveal the cross well connected fractures especially the highly permeable ones it is insensitive to the natural hydraulic gradient if applied at an injection rate of around 0 5 l s at the investigated scale the influence of vertical flow in the observation well on the inversion result can be significantly reduced by adding well zones to the inversion approach given these experiences the hydraulic properties of a fractured sedimentary rock site located at the north campus of the university of göttingen germany are investigated the inversion results show that there is a directly connected fracture two interconnected fractures and an overburden zone between well m and o the inverted k values of the detected fractures are between 5 10 4 m s and 1 10 5 m s their locations and k magnitudes are verified by comparing with the results from flowmeter logs drill core permeability testing and field scale pumping tests from a practical point of view it is valuable to use thermal tracer tomography to investigate hydraulic properties of fractured media thermal tracer tomography not only reduces a lot of experimental efforts but is also easy to operate for example it only requires injection of warm water and monitoring of temperature changes along the wells somogyvári and bayer 2017 even completed this testing method by reinjecting pumped water into the well after being heated by the sunlight however it is worth noting that the testing period can be much longer compared to hydraulic tomography especially when the well spacing is large also in order to avoid interference with pervious thermal tests a relatively long break may be needed between experiments for heat dissipation in order to reduce the uncertainty of inversion results it is a good choice to use a flexible borehole liner sealing within the observation wells or to add more prior information to constrain the inversion procedure such as the fracture orientations in addition since hydraulic diffusion is much more sensitive to low permeable fractures and rock matrix than thermal diffusion we also recommend to combine thermal tracer tomography and hydraulic tomography to improve the characterization of hydraulic and structural properties of fractured media credit authorship

3390,hydraulic properties are well known to be essential in controlling fluid flow solute migration and heat transport in fractured subsurface however accurate characterization of hydraulic properties including the locations of conductive fracture and their hydraulic conductivities as well as their cross well connectivity is still challenging in this work we modified the inversion framework of travel time based thermal tracer tomography tt firstly based on a numerical study considering the features of heat transfer in fractured media a regularization term and an irregular triangular mesh are introduced a distortion of thermal travel times caused by annular wall flow at an observation well is eliminated by assigning a specific well zone in the inversion model the performance of this modified inversion framework in characterizing hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers is firstly analyzed through nine numerical tests results indicate that the modified tt method can efficiently identify directly connected or interconnected fractures even with the presence of an ambient hydraulic gradient observation well annular wall flow or measurements based on conventional thermal sensors with less precision accordingly a tomographic thermal tracer test is performed and analyzed at a fractured rock experimental site located at the university of göttingen germany it can be inferred that there is a directly connected fracture two interconnected fractures and an overburden zone with hydraulic conductivities between 5 10 4 m s and 1 10 5 m s the outcomes demonstrate that the proposed inversion framework is efficient and robust in characterizing hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers keywords hydraulic conductivity profile hydraulic connectivity fractured aquifer thermal tracer tomography field investigation travel time inversion 1 introduction in fractured bedrock the fracture system may form preferential flow paths it is therefore of great importance for fluid and contaminant migration for example in the fields of energy supply oil and gas industry geothermal energy production and of environmental safety contamination remediation nuclear waste disposal co2 sequestration it is essential to characterize the hydraulic properties of a fractured system such as the locations of conductive fracture their hydraulic conductivities and the cross well connectivity however due to the mostly complex fracture geometry and pronounced hydraulic heterogeneity this characterization has been long one of the major challenges in hydrogeology within the past decades numerous studies have been devoted to this field especially those using cross well tomographical imaging methods such as geophysical tomography day lewis 2001 karasaki et al 2000 robinson et al 2016 hydraulic tomography dong et al 2019 illman 2014 illman et al 2009 klepikova et al 2020 and tracer tomography brauchler et al 2013a kittilä et al 2019 klepikova et al 2014 compared to geophysical methods hydraulic and tracer tests can directly provide hydraulic information without additional correlation analysis hu et al 2017 tracer testing provides not only the most intuitive evidence of cross well hydraulic connectivity but also implies information on transport connectivity of fractures knudby and carrera 2005 recently with the technological advances in temperature monitoring such as fiber optic distributed temperature sensing dts and flexible borehole liners measuring temperature evolution along a borehole becomes more efficient accurate and economical bakker et al 2015 coleman et al 2015 maldaner et al 2019 pehme et al 2010 read et al 2013 this makes heat as an ideal choice compared to conventional tracers and using heat as a tracer to investigate hydraulic properties of fractured zone is attracting more and more attention cross well thermal tracer tomography that combines thermal tracer techniques with imaging methods has been promoted in the past several years to reconstruct aquifer heterogeneity doro et al 2015 schwede et al 2014 somogyvári and bayer 2017 somogyvári et al 2016 wagner et al 2014 this novel technique was intensively studied in porous media so far including a comparative analysis with hydraulic tomography and joint inversion using head and temperature measurements etc lee et al 2018 ringel et al 2019 schwede et al 2014 somogyvári et al 2016 somogyvári et al 2019 in order to investigate aquifer heterogeneity in the field doro et al 2015 improved the field scale experimental design for thermal tracer tomography using travel time based thermal tracer tomography tt somogyvári and bayer 2017 successfully estimated hydraulic conductivity profiles in alluvial sediments however up to now this method was rarely studied for the characterization of fractured media applying cross well thermal tracer tomography in fractured media still encounters some obstacles firstly in fractured bedrock conductive fractures are the preferential channels for groundwater flow and heat transfer their hydraulic conductivity can be generally much higher than that of the matrix when performing a cross well thermal tracer test due to different time scales of the experiment and of heat conduction temperature changes may only be observed at depths where connected fractures are exposed to the observation well this spatially sparse temperature response can result in a strong ill posed inversion problem secondly fracture systems usually have a complex geometry that is the fractures can be disconnected connected by a dominant single fracture or interconnected in a network and hydraulic conductivities of fractures controlled by fracture distribution aperture and filling material can vary significantly at a small scale national research council 1996 the connectivity between fractures and their different hydraulic conductivities will increase the non uniqueness of the inversion result also a classical regular inversion grid may cause difficulties in tracing the irregular fracture geometry thus introducing calculation errors in addition some practical issues such as ambient groundwater flow or vertical flow within the well if any will affect the heat transport processes during tomographic testing and thus distort the parameter estimation results nevertheless due to the high conductivity contrast between fractures and rock matrix the injected water and heat will preferentially flow through the fractures compared to porous media the distortion of the flow field induced by a high injection rate can be much lower temperature response can be received much faster at the same injection rate and heat transport will be less affected by heat diffusion facing the foregoing ill posed and non uniqueness problem travel time based inversion is considered an efficient method brauchler et al 2013b hu et al 2011b somogyvári et al 2016 thermal travel time is defined as the propagation time of a thermal tracer front in the source receiver dipole since only the thermal travel times need to be matched instead of all temperature data this approach is robust and can significantly reduce computational cost because the inversion problem for travel times is quasi linear its solution can be much less sensitive to the initial model compared to non linear inversion problems such as the full wave inversion vasco 2018 in addition introducing a regularization constraint in the inversion framework is also an effective method to solve the ill posed problems illman et al 2015 wang et al 2017 apart from this using a dts system to monitor temperature changes is another approach to reduce the uncertainty of inversion results by providing high resolution temperature data in space and time maldaner et al 2019 pehme et al 2010 combining these techniques the intention of this study is to modify and improve the inversion framework and to evaluate the feasibility of thermal tracer tomography to characterize hydraulic properties of fractured media according to the features of heat transfer in fractured media we firstly modify the inversion framework of the tt method in section 2 in section 3 the performance of this modified inversion framework in characterizing the hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers is evaluated and validated through nine numerical tests finally a field scale thermal tracer tomography experiment is implemented at a fractured rock experimental site located at the north campus of the university of göttingen germany and the fracture connectivity as well as the cross well hydraulic conductivity profile are finally delineated through the numerical and field experiments the advantages and disadvantages of the tt method in obtaining hydraulic characteristics of fractured media are discussed considering future studies and related applications 2 inverse modeling of thermal tracer tomography in fractured aquifers 2 1 travel time based thermal tracer tomography vasco and datta gupta 1999 first derived a trajectory based integral formula that directly links the solute travel time to hydraulic conductivity k based on the similarity of the solute transport and the heat transfer equations somogyvári et al 2016 further extended this trajectory based integral formula for thermal tracer tomography they considered thermal retardation and proposed an early time diagnostics method to improve the accuracy of the inversion result the thermal travel time t tt is defined as the propagation time of a thermal tracer front along the path l from the injection source x s to a receiver x r which is given in somogyvári et al 2016 1 t tt x r x s x r ϕ l r k l h l d l in which ϕ is the porosity distribution h is the hydraulic gradient and r is the thermal retardation factor defined as 2 r ρ b c b ρ w c w where ρ is the density and c represents the specific heat capacity and the subscript b and w denote the rock material and water respectively to invert the hydraulic conductivity distribution using thermal travel times some other assumptions need to be made in eq 1 the thermal travel time is not only affected by the hydraulic conductivity field but also by the porosity the hydraulic gradient and by the thermal retardation factor nevertheless comparing to k the variance of the other three parameters is usually much smaller for a fractured medium thus they can be approximated by a constant value in the entire model somogyvári et al 2016 assuming that a site of interest contains m source receiver pairs and the site domain is discretized into n cells in the inversion model the path integral eq 1 can be discretized into a matrix form 3 t m a where t is an m vector of observed thermal travel time m is an m n matrix and its elements m ij represent the trajectory lengths of the i th ray through the j th element a is a n vector containing a homogeneous and isotropic material property a j in each cell which is defined as a j ϕ j r k j h j according to fermat s principle eq 3 is subject to the so called shortest path problem which is widespread in network optimization and seismic tomography in a highly heterogeneous fractured medium the shortest path propagates toward the high k fracture zone which makes the matrix m very sparse in this study dijkstra s algorithm is applied to trace the shortest paths for the sparse matrix more details about dijkstra s algorithm can be found in dijkstra 1959 xu et al 2007 and zhao et al 2004 2 2 numerical techniques considering hydraulic properties of fractured aquifers 2 2 1 regularization constraint when inverting the thermal tracer test data from fractured aquifers one of the main challenges is a spatially sparse temperature response this is because temperature changes in observation wells can only be observed at those depths where the connected fractures are exposed to the well screen considering the time scales of the experiment and of heat conduction as a result the inversion framework will be ill posed since the number of measurements is much less than the discretized cells in the inversion model to solve this problem a regularization term is commonly introduced into the objective function φ which is given by rücker et al 2017 4 φ w fit t d a 2 2 lam w reg a a 0 2 2 where w fit is the weighting matrix containing the observation errors and w reg is the model constraint matrix to restrict the parameters to be varying in reasonable ranges d represents the forward operator using the dijkstra s algorithm and a 0 is a reference parameter model lam is a parameter weighting the importance of the parameter model constraints which can be regarded as a smoothness operator to minimize this objective function the gauss newton iteration method is adopted in field applications such as predicting the spread of a contaminant plume the main target is on obtaining the hydraulic properties of highly conductive fractures which form preferential pathways it is therefore necessary to retain more information on the short thermal travel times in the inversion framework this can be achieved in the numerical iteration process by reducing the weight of the regularization term lam or by adjusting the weighting matrix of the observation error w fit in order to avoid introduction of new uncertainties only lam will be adjusted during the iteration in this study 2 2 2 irregular inversion mesh another main feature of heat transfer in fractured aquifers is a sharp thermal front and the complex pathway of the front which is controlled by the hydraulic conductivities of fractures and their geometry since the travel time tomography is trajectory based it is suitable for detecting the preferential pathways the trajectories are typically restricted to iterate along the mesh in the inversion domain in a regular grid the calculated trajectory could thus be longer than the actual fracture leading to overestimated k values using an irregular triangular mesh to discretize the model could be more conducive because at a fixed mesh density the irregular mesh will provide more reasonable channels for trajectory tracing additionally a secondary node is also added to each mesh edge to make the trajectory calculation more accurate 2 2 3 specific well zone vertical flow may occur in an observation well when there is a head difference between the fractures covered by the well which can deflect the flow field significantly and affect the heat transfer process pehme et al 2010 to hinder the thermal signal from being distorted by vertical flow a flexible borehole liner is employed in some studies coleman et al 2015 munn et al 2020 however unsealed or fully screened observation wells are still common in field testing to investigate and to consider the distortion of thermal travel times caused by vertical flow an open observation well is represented in the inversion model a well zone is cut out from the inversion domain by adjusting the constraint weights to zero at the interface between the well zone and the aquifer domain the hydraulic conductivity of the well can be inverted independently of the surrounding aquifer the shortened travel time observed at a sensor placed along the open observation well can be thus corrected based on the generalized form of darcy s law the hydraulic conductivity k x within the well zone is assumed to be uniform and approximated by bear 2013 hu et al 2011a 5 k x x ω wel r w 2 8 ρ w g μ where r w is the well radius ρ w is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water the k x will be assigned for the observation well in the following forward modelling to consider the vertical flow and will also be set as the initial value for the well zone in the inversion framework to correct the measured travel time data 2 3 numerical implementation the inverse modeling of the thermal tracer tomography is implemented in an open source python code using a framework built based on the geophysical library pygimli rücker et al 2017 the traveltimemanager module is originally developed for seismic travel time inversion it can be extended to solve the travel time based thermal tracer tomography problem due to the similarity of the inversion formula in the inversion framework the initial k of the well zone is calculated by eq 5 depending on the well radius for the aquifer zone the initial model is estimated by the measured thermal travel time the range of the inverted k values of the aquifer zone will be limited between 1 10 8 m s and 0 1 m s this is reasonable because the observed thermal signal mainly contains the hydraulic information of the conductive fractures in addition an optimized smoothness operator lam op will be determined by the numerical tests in the next section 3 synthetic examples for model performance evaluation 3 1 numerical setup in order to evaluate the performance of the thermal tracer tomography in a fractured medium a series of numerical tests were carried out in a two dimensional 2d model although flow in fractured rocks is usually three dimensional the 2d approximation is still reasonable in certain local zones such as in a zone with obvious principal stress directions lang et al 2018 or near geological structures that control the local seepage field in the forward modelling the discrete fracture matrix dfm model is utilized which preserves the dominant fractures and upscales and replaces the secondary fractures by averaged quantities of the porous matrix this is due to the fact that during a thermal tracer test the heat transport process is dominated by heat advection in the connected fractures and by heat diffusion in the porous rock matrix which consists of discrete disconnected fractures the forward hydrothermal processes are simulated using the finite volume method details on derivation of the equations and on the modelling method are provided in the appendix as shown in fig 1 a 2d geometric model 40 m 20 m consisting of an upper porous layer and a fractured bedrock is set up hydraulic conductivities k in each domain are isotropic and homogeneous the k values of the upper layer and the bedrock are 10 6 and 10 8 m s respectively fractures are inserted as line elements and assumed to be straight with various lengths angles and k values which will be adjusted for different scenarios for simulating the tomographic thermal tracer tests six injection intervals and eleven monitoring points are placed considering that the straddle packer system is often employed during heat injection heat and water flow in the injection well is neglected the effects of the unsealed observation well on heat and water flow will be evaluated in the following case study based on this geometric model nine different scenarios were designed aiming at different fracture connectivity k distributions and some practical issues table 1 lists the main parameters for these cases three fractures in fig 1 represent three modes of cross well hydraulic connectivity i e disconnected fracture 1 directly connected fracture 2 and interconnected fractures 2 and 3 from case 1 to case 3 a fracture is added each time and the hydraulic conductivity of the added fracture k f is set to 1 10 4 m s from case 4 to case 6 k f of these three fractures is reduced individually to 1 10 6 m s from case 7 to case 9 three practical issues are considered including ambient hydraulic gradient h 1 temperature sensor accuracy δ t 0 and vertical flow in the observation well in case 9 an observation well is implemented with a radius of 0 05 m and a length of 18 m the vertical flow inside the observation well is achieved by assigning a high hydraulic conductivity k well 3125 m s to the well which is defined as eq 5 in section 2 2 3 according to these scenarios nine forward and inverse model simulations are carried out table a1 shows all the simulation parameters of the hydrothermal processes in the forward modelling continuous thermal injection tests are simulated at the six injection intervals sequentially the injected water temperature is 10 c above the background temperature and the injection rate is 0 5 l s all the injections are simulated for ten days by comparing the inverted k with the true values the optimized smoothness operator lam op is set to 10 the thermal travel times at the eleven monitoring points fig 1 are recorded and then used to invert the hydraulic conductivity profiles only the total temperature changes at a monitoring point greater than 0 001 c will be included in the inversion procedure considering thermal sensor accuracy to consider the heat diffusion effects on the thermal travel time the early time diagnostics method proposed by somogyvári et al 2016 is employed additionally accounting for the observation error a gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 is added to the travel time datasets 3 2 inversion model performance fig 2 shows the nine inverted hydraulic conductivity profiles corresponding to the designed cases the orange lines denote the true fracture geometry and the grey curves are the calculated trajectories between the sources and receivers all nine k tomograms can be divided into three categories the tomograms in the top row fig 2a c corresponding to case 1 3 reflect the capability of the inversion to detect the cross well hydraulic connectivity the results indicate that fracture connectivity can be clearly identified if the true fracture geometry is cross well connected as shown in fig 2b and c once a fracture is disconnected such as shown in fig 2a the inversion result cannot retrieve it because the travel times observed at each monitoring point have minor differences which are hardly to form a preferential channel in fig 2c although the connected fracture is bifurcated on the right side the position of the bottom fracture fracture 3 is deflected the reason could be the impact of the top disconnected fracture 1 on the seepage field thus disturbing the thermal travel times the second aim is to test the inversion procedure in identifying the hydraulic properties of fractures under different k contrasts the inversion results based on case 4 6 are shown in fig 2d f it illustrates that different k contrasts between fractures have a significant impact on the inverted hydraulic profile in fig 2e when the k of fracture 2 decreases to 1 10 6 m s and the k of fracture 1 and 3 keep at 1 10 4 m s only one potential fracture is revealed its trajectory is close to the high k path i e the left part of fracture 2 plus fracture 3 however the inverted k value along this trajectory is averaged which is close to 5 10 5 m s this indicates that it is hard to distinguish the changes of the k value in a connected fracture using the trajectory based inversion method additionally as shown in fig 2f when a low k fracture fracture 3 inserts in a high k fracture fracture 2 the low k fracture is covered from the calculated trajectories fracture 3 is ignored and instead more is passing through fracture 2 to make up the misfit in thermal travel times this implies that the inverted profile tends to reveal the preferential flow path if there is no additional fracture geometry information when the k of interconnected fractures is equivalent as illustrated in fig 2d the k value is accurately estimated and the fracture geometry is very similar to the truth comparing to fig 3 c it is further confirmed that the k magnitude of the top disconnected fracture can affect the thermal travel times although this fracture is not recognized in future applications prior information such as fracture geometry and matrix data zhao et al 2021 can improve the inversion results through correcting the thermal travel time to examine the uncertainty of the inversion results considering some practical issues three scenarios are considered in the last category firstly fig 2g shows the inversion result of thermal tracer tomography under an extremely high natural hydraulic gradient of 0 2 m m from the right to the left side the result shows that the interconnected fractures fracture 2 and 3 can be clearly recognized and the k distribution is very close to the case without ambient gradient fig 2c this indicates that the ambient hydraulic gradient has less influence on the inversion results when the injection rate is around 0 5 l s secondly fig 2h is the inversion result of the case in which the accuracy of the temperature sensor is assumed to be 0 1 c that is only the travel times in which the observed temperature responses vary more than 0 1 c are used for inversion which means that only several sensors near the fractures can receive temperature responses this makes the inverted data matrix more sparse and the inversion gets more ill posed however the inversion result in fig 2h can still identify a connected fracture fracture 2 from the calculated trajectories the other one fracture 3 can also be recognized thirdly to correct the distorted thermal travel times caused by vertical flow in the open observation well a well zone is added at the right side of the inversion model with the width of 0 1 m i e the diameter of the observation well represented in the forward model the k in the well zone is iterated separately from the aquifer thus it can be much higher than that of the aquifer the inverted k distribution shown in fig 2i indicates that the high k distribution in the aquifer not only covers the connected fractures but also an area between the fractures and the well this is because the thermal travel times observed at the sensors between the identified fractures become very similar due to the rapid flow inside the well the calculated trajectories thus short circuit in this area overall these nine numerical tests show that the travel time based inversion procedure is efficient and robust in identifying the connected fractures and in estimating the k distribution 4 field application 4 1 site description the fractured rock experimental site is located at the north campus of the university of göttingen germany this test site consists of six groundwater wells with a depth of 80 m well bhe and w were built in 2007 for the study of shallow geothermal energy problems in order to investigate the hydraulic properties of fractures and apply hydraulic and thermal tracer tomography another four groundwater wells well n o m and s were installed at this site in 2013 the well arrangement lithology and well design are illustrated in fig 3 geologically this test site is located at the eastern shoulder of the leinetalgraben which is a distinctive zone of subsidence in the southern part of lower saxony germany its geological structure is very complicated due to polyphase tectonic development under various tension forces leiss 2011 following werner 2013 especially in the eastern shoulder including this site it is dominated by nne striking faults with high offsets and a number of folds fractures have also well developed lithologically this area is located in the lower and middle keuper which mainly consists of clay sequences and silt sandstone layers the main lithology exposed by the drill cores is shown in fig 3b moreover the geophysical loggings show that the bedding planes dip constantly with approximately 75 towards se the acoustic and optic televiewer data delivers three trends of the dip angle and azimuth of inserted fractures 351 06 221 37 and 045 59 werner 2013 the well design is depicted in fig 3c to achieve tomographic testing at this site each well has been provided with separated nine filter sections that are hydraulically connected to different geological strata the diameters of the boreholes and the well pipes are 0 2 m and 0 08 m respectively the well pipe except the top 8 m casing is composed of alternating 5 m screened and 3 m non screened sections the corresponding filling materials outside the well pipe are filter gravel and clay pellets additionally fiber optical cables for dts based groundwater temperature monitoring are installed along the well pipes in this study the spatial resolution of the dts system is 0 5 m and the standard deviation of a temperature value is 0 1 c 4 2 preliminary testing several other studies have been carried out at this site including geophysical loggings hydraulic tomography and groundwater temperature monitoring baetzel 2017 jahr et al 2020 oberdorfer et al 2013 schuster 2015 werner 2013 yang et al 2020 their findings demonstrate that highly conductive fractures are mainly distributed at the top 40 m particularly between well m and o still it is hard to figure out the accurate locations of the connected fractures between the wells and their hydraulic conductivities 4 3 tomographic thermal tracer test with the experience from the numerical tests and the preliminary testing results a tomographic thermal tracer test was designed and implemented at the top four screen intervals ca 40 m length between well m and o experimental design of this test is depicted in fig 4 warm water heated to about 20 c was first injected sequentially at each of the top four 5 m screen intervals in well m a double packer system was employed to isolate the 5 m sections in the injection well each injection lasted for at least 5 h at a rate of 0 4 l s then waiting for heat dissipation for about two days afterwards this multilevel thermal injection test was repeated in well o in the same way only well m and well o are selected because the evident thermal signal is only observed in these two wells during the 5 h of each test which corroborates the finding of the preliminary tests showing that the hydraulic connection between well m and o is better than between the others baetzel 2017 the temperature evolutions along all the wells were recorded by the dts with a spatial resolution of 0 5 m and a temporal resolution of 1 min note that since the observation well was open during the tests the temperature evolutions in this well may be affected by vertical well flow fig 5 shows the temperature evolutions along the observation wells above 40 m the heatmaps in the first row represent the temperature evolution in well o when the warm water was injected sequentially at the top four screen sections of well m in turn heatmaps in the second row represent the temperature responses in well m when injecting in well o it is obvious that a clear temperature response can be observed in all cases except in fig 5e when injecting at screen sections other than the first a rapid and multiple depth temperature response can be observed in fig 5b c and 5f h the temperature observed at similar depth compared to the injection section varies more sharply than the others and the temperature changes along the well seems to be impacted by the well construction such as the temperature depression at the depth of 13 16 m in fig 5b d overall the observed temperature evolutions reflect that some well connected fractures exist between these two wells the observed multiple depth temperature response may be due to the vertical flow in the open observation well 5 inversion results and discussion after denoising the observed temperature datasets using the method proposed by yang et al 2020 a total of 264 thermal travel times were extracted based on the early time diagnostic method after identifying the peak value of each thermal response curve the early travel time corresponding to 10 of the peak value can be found the early travel time is then extrapolated to the ideal travel time that takes heat diffusion into account somogyvári et al 2016 in the inversion procedure the inversion domain is 40 m deep and 2 8 m wide consisting of well m and o and the aquifer between them the borehole radius is 0 1 m and the horizontal distance between these two wells is set to 2 4 m which is the average distance considering the borehole drilling deviation according to geophysical loggings such as the ultrasonic pulse velocity test baetzel 2017 schuster 2015 some inversion parameters are determined the density of the rock ρ b is about 2500 kg m3 the porosity ϕ is averaged to 0 2 and the specific heat capacity c b of the bedrock is estimated to 1300 j kg k an average hydraulic gradient of h 0 08 in the east west direction is calculated by head measurements during the test in addition the vertical flow in the observation well is considered after the numerical calculations the inversion result of the reconstructed log 10 k field and the calculated trajectories are presented in fig 6 the tomogram in fig 6a reveals four high k connected zones between well m and o at a depth of ca 10 m 20 m 28 m and 36 m the inverted k values of these zones are in a range from 5 10 4 m s to 1 10 5 m s they can be considered as potentially connected fractures except for the top zone at about 10 m this is because the k values nearby the top zone are obviously lower than the others and the high k zone is relatively larger combining with the lithological background fig 3b this zone can be determined as the overburden additionally several sub high k zones in which the values are around 1 10 5 m s are present near the inferred fractures such as the zones nearby well m at a depth of around 17 m and 31 m close to well o according to the calculated trajectories shown in fig 6b their appearance seems to be caused by the high hydraulic conductivity between the well and the corresponding dts sensing points note that the inverted minimum k value of 1 10 6 m s in this tomogram does not represent the hydraulic conductivity of the rock matrix this is because the travel times used for the inversion only include the temperature response that can be detected within 5 h but not the travel time through rock matrix which would be much longer moreover the k values within the well zones are also estimated in the inversion procedure the inverted k values in these zones shown in fig 6a are much higher than those within the aquifer except for the top 5 m their distribution however is not the direct reflection of the flow velocity in the well but a common manifestation of the conductivity including the part within the well and the part from the well to the dts sensing points due to the well construction the hydraulic connectivity between the well and the different sensing points is distinct thus the k distribution in the well zone is not very smooth in summary the inverted tomogram has clearly identified an overburden above 14 m and three connected fractures at ca 20 m 28 m and 35 m between well m and o with k values between 5 10 4 m s and 1 10 5 m s the validation of the inversion results includes two aspects i e the fracture locations and the magnitude of k validation results for the two wells m and o are shown in fig 7 firstly to verify the fracture locations the inverted k profiles are compared with the vertical well flow rate profiles measured by flowmeter logging under pumping in the flow rate curves the location of the conductive fractures can be figured out through a sudden increase of the vertical flow rate accordingly the inferred locations of fracture are marked by the red points in fig 7 by comparison it can be found that the fracture locations identified by these two results in each well are quite consistent secondly to verify the k magnitude the inverted k values are compared with results from permeability tests on rock drill cores from well n and with results from conventional pumping tests in well m and o in the drill cores from well n nine fractures were found at the top 40 m and tested in laboratory for permeability by schuster 2015 the bar chart shown in fig 7c depicts the measured k and the apparent aperture size three high k fractures are revealed although the locations are similar to the inversion results the magnitude of measured k from the laboratory is approximately two orders lower compared to the inverted values however according to pumping tests conducted in well m and o the estimated k values are 6 68 10 5 m s and 6 78 10 4 m s respectively these results demonstrate that the magnitude of the inverted k is much larger than the measured k from rock cores at laboratory scale but slightly smaller than the estimated k from the pumping tests considering spatial variability and lab field scale effects of k measurements this difference is reasonable based on experiences gained from numerical tests several uncertainties of travel time based inversion results from field tests can be recognized the first is that cross well disconnected fractures may not be revealed by the inversion procedure including high k fractures according to the numerical results shown in fig 2a although there is a local preferential flow path it cannot shorten thermal travel times because of the extremely low k in the rock matrix the second point is that there is an uncertainty in the k magnitude of the revealed fractures as shown in fig 2e when the k magnitude changes along the connected fracture this change will be averaged along the entire trajectory by the inversion procedure therefore in fig 6a the k values in each revealed fracture are also averaged thirdly the vertical flow in the observation well may mask some interconnected fractures the travel time difference among the dts sensing locations placed at depths between the inserted fracture locations is hard to recognize due to the rapid vertical flow this results in a short circuit area of inverted k as shown in fig 2i in fig 6a some similar areas nearby well m at a depth of around 17 m and approx 31 m deep close to well o can therefore be interpreted as interconnected fractures it is worth noting that this inference may be impacted by the structures beyond the inversion domain which is not considered in the travel time approach the modified thermal tracer tomography shows a good applicability for characterization of hydraulic properties of fractured media with the high spatial and temporal resolution of dts thermal tracer tomography can efficiently and accurately capture the locations of conductive fractures as well as fracture connectivity and provide the spatial distribution of k values furthermore even if the thermal travel times are disturbed by vertical flow in the observation well reliable inversion result can still be obtained from field experiments although the fracture is assumed to be straight due to the short distance between the wells in this study we believe that the proposed method can be easily upscaled for instance the inversion model can be constrained by supplementing the orientation of fractures zhao et al 2021 6 conclusions through numerical experiments it is demonstrated that the modified tt method tends to reveal the cross well connected fractures especially the highly permeable ones it is insensitive to the natural hydraulic gradient if applied at an injection rate of around 0 5 l s at the investigated scale the influence of vertical flow in the observation well on the inversion result can be significantly reduced by adding well zones to the inversion approach given these experiences the hydraulic properties of a fractured sedimentary rock site located at the north campus of the university of göttingen germany are investigated the inversion results show that there is a directly connected fracture two interconnected fractures and an overburden zone between well m and o the inverted k values of the detected fractures are between 5 10 4 m s and 1 10 5 m s their locations and k magnitudes are verified by comparing with the results from flowmeter logs drill core permeability testing and field scale pumping tests from a practical point of view it is valuable to use thermal tracer tomography to investigate hydraulic properties of fractured media thermal tracer tomography not only reduces a lot of experimental efforts but is also easy to operate for example it only requires injection of warm water and monitoring of temperature changes along the wells somogyvári and bayer 2017 even completed this testing method by reinjecting pumped water into the well after being heated by the sunlight however it is worth noting that the testing period can be much longer compared to hydraulic tomography especially when the well spacing is large also in order to avoid interference with pervious thermal tests a relatively long break may be needed between experiments for heat dissipation in order to reduce the uncertainty of inversion results it is a good choice to use a flexible borehole liner sealing within the observation wells or to add more prior information to constrain the inversion procedure such as the fracture orientations in addition since hydraulic diffusion is much more sensitive to low permeable fractures and rock matrix than thermal diffusion we also recommend to combine thermal tracer tomography and hydraulic tomography to improve the characterization of hydraulic and structural properties of fractured media credit authorship

3391,it is important that real time flood forecasting provides information on inundation extents and depths to emergency responders for flood mitigation planning warning and rescue operations conventional hydrodynamic flood inundation modelling is generally not suited for real time operations because of its large computational demand the most widely adopted industry practice is to link a pre canned library of flood maps with river levels and use an interpolation approach to derive flood surfaces and depths based on selected model inputs however there is surprisingly scant information in the literature on the procedures and performance of the library interpolation approach in this study we describe the library interpolation approach introduce univariate and multivariate interpolation schemes and investigate their performance through a case study of a river in port fairy australia the mike 11 21 hydrodynamic model was used to construct a pre canned flood inundation library of design events the hydrodynamic model was also used to generate outputs for four test cases to evaluate the performance of the library interpolation approach it is found that the accuracy of the library interpolation approach relies heavily on how the map library was constructed selection of flood drivers and shape and timing of hydrographs the widely deployed univariate interpolation scheme based on a single primary flood driver yields results of varied accuracy depending on the validity of assumptions often made implicitly about the inputs of the non primary drivers a newly developed multivariate interpolation scheme overcomes this problem overall it is found that the results obtained using the map library interpolation schemes are generally satisfactory achieving a hit rate of 0 85 0 99 and a critical success index of 0 85 0 99 however a major limitation of the library interpolation approach is that the shape and timing of the input hydrographs need to be similar to that used in constructing the map library further research is needed to mitigate this limitation keywords flood inundation forecasting flood inundation map library univariate interpolation multivariate interpolation performance evaluation 1 introduction flood forecasting and warning plays a critical role in managing flooding events to reduce economic damages and protect lives from devastating floods traditionally forecasts have focused solely on the provision of river levels and flows but these do not provide useful information on the likely extent and depth of inundation which are key threats to life and property accordingly with the advent of better models of floodplain behaviour there is a strong desire to produce information on flood inundation extents and water depths to help mitigate flood risks and undertake rescue operations in a timely manner arduino et al 2005 demeritt et al 2007 for this reason many forecasting agencies are interested in developing flood inundation forecasting systems for operational use in real time flood inundation modelling is an essential component of such forecasting systems teng et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive review of the state of the art flood inundation modelling approaches including empirical conceptual and hydrodynamic models hydrodynamic modelling is considered the most capable approach to accurately simulating detailed flood propagation and inundation two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models representing floodplain flows as 2d fields solve shallow water equations derived from the conservation of mass and momentum they provide more information on floodplain hydraulic behaviour than one dimensional models resulting in greater modelling accuracy bates et al 2003 cunge et al 1980 however such models are computationally very demanding limiting the uptake of 2d hydrodynamic models in real time applications murphy et al 2016 although computing technology has rapidly advanced in recent years it is still challenging to achieve real time flood inundation forecasting using a detailed hydrodynamic model world meteorological organisation 2011 this is especially onerous when it is necessary to assess forecast uncertainty by repeating simulations for multiple possible scenarios in real time as the event unfolds bermúdez et al 2019 hosseiny et al 2020 toro et al 2010 to enable real time flood inundation forecasting a range of efficient tools have been proposed to model flood inundation one popular solution is to use a conceptual routing model to spread flood volume across the floodplain to produce a maximum flood inundation extent examples of this approach include rapid flood spreading method rfsm lhomme et al 2008 flood modeller isis fast néelz pender 2013 tvd teng et al 2015 and height above the nearest drainage hand nobre et al 2011 the rfsm and flood modeller isis fast both divide floodplains based on topographic depressions and spread the flood volume with a filling and spilling process rfsm incurs less computational cost than flood modeller isis fast lhomme et al 2008 néelz pender 2013 teng et al 2017 the tvd model uses a planar method that intersects a series of planes and links the water level and volume to produce the flood extent teng et al 2015 the hand model nobre et al 2011 normalises topography according to local relative heights found along drainage network to produce relative height values for the surrounding cells of streams and then compare these values with in stream water depth to determine flood inundation extent these simple conceptual models are suitable for simulating flood behaviour over large floodplains in data sparse regions and for real time ensemble flood forecasting due to their low computational overhead compared with hydrodynamic models teng et al 2017 another fast approach is the use of surrogate models based on machine learning to emulate hydrodynamic models pan et al 2011 developed a surrogate model for a low lying area based on principal component analysis pca and hybrid neural network contreras et al 2020 developed a surrogate model for an urban area near a mountain region based on kriging on the space of parameters xie et al 2021 developed an ann based hybrid modelling approach to improve model performance for an data sparse region the surrogate models provided fast simulation times with acceptable levels of accuracy chu et al 2020 training data are required for establishing surrogate models and these can be generated by running hydrodynamic models with a variety of input data once surrogate models are established they can be used to estimate flood inundation for a given input data series without running the hydrodynamic models fundamentally surrogate models can be considered a form of interpolation with limited extrapolation by combining basis functions with regression in practice by far the most widely used interpolation approach for flood inundation estimation is through simple linear interpolation of pre canned flood maps for this reason we turn our attention here to this simple linear interpolation approach termed interpolation from hereon for brevity the uk environment agency have recently concluded that interpolation has the most potential to meet their requirements for real time predictions cox et al 2019 a flood map library is constructed from a set of inundation maps that are pre computed from hydrodynamic models showing flood extents and depths the library are typically based on a range of event magnitudes from near bankfull to the probable maximum flood usgs 2020 flood events used in the library can be historical and or design flood events historical flood events exhibit more realistic variability in flood behaviour than design events as the input rainfalls used in design typically ignore the high degree of spatio temporal variability found in real rainfall events ball et al 2019 cristiano et al 2017 the library can also be developed from a series of satellite derived inundation extents from historical events bhatt et al 2017 the general approach followed with the map library approach is to relate a set of inundation surfaces to river levels that have been derived for a particular location because river conditions in any given forecast event are unlikely to exactly match conditions used to derive the different flood cases in the map library it is necessary to estimate a forecast flood surface from the available maps using interpolation this most commonly involves linearly interpolating a water level between the nearest upper and lower levels from the map library and using this information to estimate water depths at individual grid cells in the flooded area druery et al 2007 despite the popularity of using simple interpolation schemes in practice there is a lack of published studies that consider the relative performance of different interpolation schemes thus there is a clear need to address this knowledge gap bales and wagner 2009 emphasised over ten years ago that further studies are needed to demonstrate the conditions and benefits of the map library approach however there is still a lack of attention given to this in the scientific literature in this study we describe the application of two simple univariate interpolation schemes and propose a multivariate alternative that considers river levels at multiple points in a catchment the multivariate interpolation scheme is proposed to predict flood extents and water depths in a multi driver floodplain where flooding may be the result of multiple drivers in an event such as mainstream tributaries and tides we assess the performances of these schemes for a case study at port fairy in australia the performances are measured against 2d hydraulic model simulations and the benefits and limitations of the schemes are discussed the outcomes of the study are intended to highlight the issues involved in the application of such approaches and to stimulate further research for their ongoing development and improvement 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area used in this research is port fairy and its surrounding area 1 1 km2 in south western victoria australia port fairy is situated on low lying ground near the mouth of the moyne river where it flows into the southern ocean fig 1 moyne river has an upstream catchment area of 758 km2 with significant tributaries including murray brook 133 km2 reedy creek 17 km2 and holcombe s drain 9 km2 these watercourses flow into an estuary which connects to the open sea in bass straight the moyne river catchment is dominated by landforms of volcanic origin with volcanic ash and lava flows duggan et al 2008 in the study area there is significant floodplain storage including the korongah flats and belfast lough which have appreciable influences on floodplain behaviour the dominant contribution to flood levels in the area is from the moyne river main channel though flood behaviour is also influenced by its largest tributary murray brook and changing tides the other smaller tributaries have much less influence compared with the moyne river main channel and murray brook the only river gauge in the study area is on the main channel of moyne river at toolong murray brook is ungauged and accounts for 18 of the total moyne river catchment area port fairy harbour does not have tide measurement and the nearest tide gauge is at portland harbour which is 40 km distant from port fairy 2 2 foundation models and datasets a hydrological model is used to produce river flow inputs and a hydrodynamical model is used to produce flood inundation data these are needed for constructing a flood inundation map library for constructing test cases and for generating validation data for evaluating performance of different interpolation schemes 2 2 1 hydrological model the hydrological model used for this study is the rorb model which is an event based runoff routing model widely used in australia to produce design flood hydrographs it simulates surface runoff by subtracting losses from rainfall to produce rainfall excess and then routing through a network of storages to produce hydrographs at points of interest laurenson et al 2010 it is a semi distributed hydrological model that may be configured to consider catchment geometry and topographic data the model has four parameters that describe the available storage in the catchment the degree of non linearity in the catchment response to rainfall and losses before water enters the channel network laurenson et al 2010 the rorb model is used to generate flood hydrographs at key locations in the moyne river catchment which are then input to the hydraulic model the parameters were tuned in a model calibration process for historical flood events in 1946 1978 and 2001 duggan et al 2008 2 2 2 hydraulic model a hydraulic model established by water technology for the glenelg hopkins catchment management authority was made available to this study duggan et al 2008 the model uses the mike 21 two dimensional hydrodynamic modelling system with the capability to model rivers floodplains and coastal areas the model has a topographic grid with a resolution of 10 m derived and integrated from several sources including an aerial laser survey bathymetric data and a field survey duggan et al 2008 the dem data are also available from the elevation foundation spatial data elvis portal of geoscience australia that provides the best available elevation data describing australia s landforms and seabed flow behaviour in the estuary is often unsteady due to the changing influence of river inflows and tide levels for this reason a small computational time step 0 75 s was adopted to ensure the stability of the hydraulic model the hydraulic roughness grid was based principally on aerial orthophotography and then inspected during field visits duggan et al 2008 the roughness values representing various land uses including open grassland paved surfaces buildings and thick vegetation were initially adopted based on literature and experience then they were adjusted through a hydraulic model calibration process for three historical flood events in 1946 1978 and 2001 2 2 3 design flood hydrographs for the main river and each of the tributaries seven design flood flow hydrographs were created to represent the flood hazard with annual exceedance probabilities aeps of 20 10 5 2 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 these design floods were obtained by using the rorb model in combination with probabilistic estimates of rainfall depths under assumptions governed by local design procedures ball et al 2019 design tides that combine both astronomical tide and storm surge were adopted from a regional study mcinnes et al 2009 the highest astronomical tide hat at port fairy is 0 6 m ahd and the 1 and 10 aep surge levels are respectively 0 45 m and 0 23 m accordingly the adopted tidal levels for the 1 and 10 aeps are respectively 1 05 m and 0 83 m from the two known tidal levels the design tide levels of 20 5 2 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 aeps were derived based on logarithmic interpolation and extrapolation 2 3 map library cases flooding can be affected by a combination of multiple drivers in an event spatial and temporal variability in real rainfall events leads to different levels of flood severity of the drivers in the one event accordingly a number of design events were created using various combinations of input design hydrographs ranging from near bankfull conditions to the 0 1 aep flood input hydrographs were derived for three combinations of flood drivers consisting of the moyne river mainstream the largest tributary murray brook and high tides as these constitute the largest contributions to flooding for the other small tributaries reedy creek and holcombe s drain design hydrographs of the same aeps as the mainstream were assumed when creating design events the events were then used as inputs to the hydraulic model to derive a flood map library where each map represents the maximum flood extent and depth resulting from each selected combination of inputs in this study the map library is populated using design events and it is convenient to refer to library cases by their aeps but with historic events resulting from a combination of factors it may be more convenient to refer to the different cases by their peak magnitude in the following descriptions we solely refer to aeps 2 4 flood inundation map library interpolation schemes estimating flood inundation extents in real time is achieved by interpolating the different flood extents and depths associated with the different flood library maps the most common practice is to consider only the main flood driver and it is usual to adopt a univariate interpolation scheme in this study we also propose an alternative multivariate approach which uses information on major flood drivers at different locations around the modelled domain for a particular event and we then evaluate the performance of both approaches 2 4 1 univariate interpolation schemes consider a hydrograph describing the primary driver for a new event its peak level is h the interpolation is based on selection of two nearest cases from the map library with peak water levels h u and h l that bracket the magnitude of the selected primary driver the maps provide information on maximum inundation water depths du and dl as upper and lower bounds respectively to predict maximum inundation water depth d of the new event a linear interpolation is applied 1 d d l a d u d l where a h h l h u h l the interpolation is undertaken separately for each individual cell across the model domain a schematic of this interpolation scheme is shown in fig 2 with this univariate scheme it is assumed that the inundation surface is solely dependent on the primary driver however in practice other flood drivers can influence the outcome different levels of sophistication can be adopted to accommodate these interactions and in this study we introduce two ways of choosing the nearest maps the two univariate schemes considered here u1 and u2 are described as follows u1 peak water levels of non primary drivers are unknown and assumed to have the same aeps as the primary driver the selection of the two nearest maps are based on this assumption u2 peak water levels of non primary drivers are known this information together with information on the peak water level of the primary drivers are used to select the two nearest maps where these are selected to provide the closest upper and lower bounds at all locations of the primary and non primary drivers in order to apply the u1 univariate approach it is only necessary to populate the map library with a single set of design events corresponding to the primary flood driver however to apply the u2 univariate approach it is necessary to populate the map library with the results obtained from running all combinations of flood severities for the primary and all non primary drivers the following example can help explain the nearest upper and lower library cases represented by u1 and u2 the example assumes that the actual flood severity at the mainstream primary driver is 3 aep the tributary non primary driver is 12 aep and the tide level non primary driver is 8 aep the upper and lower library case bounds corresponding to the u1 and u2 univariate schemes are specified in table 1 2 4 2 multivariate interpolation scheme in contrast to the univariate interpolation schemes the multivariate interpolation scheme m scheme explicitly considers the inundation surfaces associated with all primary and non primary drivers here we describe the scheme in terms of three drivers but the methodology can be easily extended to any number of drivers given the peak levels of three hydrographs h 1 h 2 and h 3 the two nearest map cases that bound the primary driver peak level h 1 are identified with associated peak levels h u 1 and h l 1 and the corresponding map cases bounding the non primary drivers h 2 and h 3 are also identified with peak levels h u 2 and h l 2 and h u 3 and h l 3 respectively the scheme thus uses eight 23 close library cases that are generated from a combination of the inputs of the three drivers consequently at each grid cell there are eight maximum inundation water depths denoted by d u u u d l u u d u l u d l l u d u u l d l u l d u l l and d l l l where the three subscript positions correspond to the three drivers subscript u refers to an upper library case and l refers to an lower library case to predict maximum inundation water depth d of the new event linear interpolations are successively applied according to each of the three drivers this results in the following equation for the final interpolated water depth 2 d d l l l a 1 d u l l d l l l a 2 d l u l d l l l a 3 d l l u d l l l a 1 a 2 d u u l d l l l d u l l d l u l a 1 a 3 d u l u d l l l d u l l d l l u a 2 a 3 d l u u d l l l d l u l d l l u a 1 a 2 a 3 d u u u d l l u d u l l d l u l d u u l d l l l d u l u d l u u where a 1 h 1 h l 1 h u 1 h l 1 a 2 h 2 h l 2 h u 2 h l 2 a 3 h 3 h l 3 h u 3 h l 3 a schematic of the multivariate interpolation scheme is shown in fig 3 the derivation of the equation 2 is given in appendix 2 5 selected test cases four test cases were developed to evaluate the performance of the library interpolation schemes where particular attention was paid to assessing the differences between the univariate and multivariate interpolation scheme details of the four test cases tc1 to tc4 are provided in table 2 including information on simulation period forecast length peak magnitude and the library cases used in the interpolations test cases tc1 and tc3 are historical events with recorded streamflow for the mainstream tc2 and tc4 are synthetic design events which have been scaled to have the same peak as the historic events including synthetic events that have the same peak but different shape to the historic events provides useful information on the influence of hydrograph shape and timing on the accuracy of the interpolation schemes simulated tributary streamflow and design tides are used in all test cases as the tributaries and estuary are ungauged fig 4 a shows hydrographs of the four test cases the hydrographs of the historical events tc1 tc3 have greater volumes and delayed peaks compared to the synthetic events fig 4 b illustrates selection of the library cases for each interpolation scheme the u1 and u2 schemes use the two nearest library cases as upper and lower bounds whereas the m scheme requires eight close library cases because the peaks of tc1 and tc2 have the same severity they adopt the same set of library cases in the interpolation schemes fig 5 presents the inundation extents and water depths of the test cases simulated using the 2d hydraulic model and illustrates how the flood extent varies over the range of events considered it is seen that although the magnitudes of the tc1 and tc2 flood peaks are identical the larger volume of tc1 leads to more extensive and deeper flood inundation in some areas such as from korongah flats to belfast lough the same is also true when the tc3 and tc4 events are compared 2 6 performance evaluation the performance of the different interpolation schemes is assessed against the results obtained from the detailed 2d hydraulic model performance is assessed for flood extents and water depths using events that were not included in the map library the accuracy of the predicted flood extents is assessed using binary pattern performance measures and the accuracy of the predicted water depths is assessed using scalar error statistics the binary pattern performance measures used to assess flood extents are derived from a contingency table that groups all grid cells in the model domain into four categories as shown in table 3 mason et al 2009 stephens et al 2014 the binary pattern performance measures adopted for this study are hit rate critical success index csi or f1 score and two skills scores f2 and f3 as described below hit rate eqn 3 is used to assess the fraction of the modelled flood extent that is correctly estimated by the interpolation schemes csi eqn 4 measures the percentage of the correctly estimated cells that exclude the dry cells and is a metric that is commonly used in evaluating flood inundation assessments the two skill scores f2 and f3 eqns 5 and 6 penalise underprediction and overprediction respectively archer et al 2018 stephens et al 2014 all these binary pattern metrics range between 0 no match and 1 perfect match 3 hitrate a a c 4 csi o r f 1 a a b c 5 f 2 a c a b c 6 f 3 a b a b c the accuracy of water depths derived using the different interpolation schemes is assessed using the differences between the interpolated estimates h i and hydraulic model results hi the level of overall agreement between the interpolated estimates and hydraulic modelled water depths are summarised using the common statistical measures of normalised mean bias error nmbe and root mean squared error rmse dawson et al 2007 7 nmbe i 1 n h i h i i 1 n h i 8 rmse i 1 n h i h i 2 n rmse is a positive metric that provides an indication of overall error based on the square differences and is sensitive to high magnitude events that often have large errors chu et al 2020 dawson et al 2007 in contrast nmbe normalises the errors across different magnitudes of flood events and provides information on the degree of either under or over prediction involved dawson et al 2007 3 results 3 1 flood extent comparison the binary pattern performance measures are used to compare the maximum flood extents simulated by the hydraulic model with the flood extents interpolated based on the peaks of all drivers fig 6 and table b1 present hit rate csi f2 underprediction and f3 overprediction scores used to assess performance of all interpolation schemes in general the performance results show all of them work reasonably well with all binary pattern performance scores above 0 7 hit rate consistently shows high scores ranging from 0 85 to close to 1 perfect prediction it means that a high proportion of the modelled flood extent is predicted correctly by all interpolation schemes across all test cases the csi metric are similar to hit rate indicating high model accuracy with the dry areas excluded in both modelled and interpolated results 3 1 1 different test cases the interpolation performance is however not consistent across all test cases better performance can be observed when the hydrograph shapes and timing of test cases are similar to those of the library cases for example fig 6 shows that the synthetic events based on the library cases tc2 and tc4 have higher binary pattern performance scores than the historical events tc1 and tc3 across all interpolation schemes the results for tc2 and tc4 range from 0 79 to 1 00 and those for tc1 and tc3 range between 0 70 and 0 98 a spatial display of the interpolated versus modelled flood extents in fig 7 also supports this observation on the other hand fig 6 shows that the binary pattern performance scores of the larger events tc3 and tc4 greater than0 93 are generally higher than tc1 and tc2 greater than0 70 this observation results from the fact that binary pattern performance measures are sensitive to the magnitude of a flood event since they are all dependent on the ratio between erroneous cells b c and the size of the observed flood a b stephens et al 2014 this is especially evident in the csi metric which has much higher scores for more severe floods here tc3 and tc4 0 1 aep are much more severe events than tc1 and tc2 5 aep this inherent limitation of these scores mean that care needs to be taken when interpretating the results stephens et al 2014 3 1 2 different interpolation schemes it is also seen from fig 6 that the successive complexity associated with moving from u1 u2 to m generally yields better performance in the synthetic events based on the library cases tc2 and tc4 the results are in accordance with the expectation that increasing the information content used by the schemes improves the accuracy of the interpolations however this trend is not as evident for the historical events tc1 and tc3 this indicates that the performance of the different schemes is dependent on the degree of similarity between the event hydrographs and the library cases and a less refined interpolation scheme may fortuitously achieve a better performance for certain events despite the high scores represented by hit rate and csi it is seen the f2 and f3 scores are not always as high as the hit rate and csi metrics the f2 scores of 0 70 and 0 79 for the u2 and m schemes of tc1 indicates that the flood extents are generally underpredicted conversely the f3 score of 0 79 achieved by application of the u1 scheme to tc2 indicates that the flood extents are generally over predicted these scores are consistent with the coloured regions of fig 7 showing areas of underprediction blue and overprediction red that were achieved for the tc1 and tc2 events 3 2 water depth comparison the accuracy of the water depths derived from the interpolation approach is evaluated against the maximum water depths simulated by the hydraulic model using scalar error statistics the difference in the water depths is calculated for each individual grid cell and summarised by the rmse and nmbe metrics fig 6 and table b1 the rmse values ranging between 0 007 m and 0 125 m and the nmbe values ranging between 0 174 and 0 102 indicate that the overall performance of the interpolation schemes is generally high summary distributions of the water depth errors are shown in fig 8 in the form of boxplots it is seen about 90 of the grid cells have errors between 0 4 m and 0 25 m across all test cases and schemes and the spatial distributions of these errors are shown in fig 7 it is evident that the maximum depths estimated at most of the grid cells have reasonably small errors regardless of the interpolation scheme used 3 2 1 different test cases from fig 6 nmbe values are negative for tc1 and tc3 across all interpolation schemes indicating the water depths for the historical events are generally underestimated the overall underprediction for tc1 and tc3 is also seen in the boxplots fig 8 with the water depths underestimated by up to 0 4 m the spatial error maps fig 7 show that the underpredicted depths occur mainly in the korongah flats to belfast lough areas in contrast to the historical events the results for the synthetic events tc2 and tc4 exhibit better scores in terms of absolute rmse and proportional nmbe metrics in addition the water depth errors for the tc2 and tc4 events range between 0 15 m and 0 25 m with medians close to 0 and this represents significantly better accuracy over the results obtained for the historical events tc1 and tc3 this observation is consistent with the findings from section 3 1 1 that the performance scores improve as the degree of similarity between the event and library case hydrographs increases and as additional information is utilised by the different interpolation schemes fig 6 also shows that the accuracy of the schemes is dependent on event magnitude where it is seen that the bigger flood event tc3 produces larger errors in comparison with the smaller event tc1 however it should be noted that the errors in the larger event are smaller in proportional terms as can be seen from the nmbe metric 3 2 2 different interpolation schemes from fig 6 the rmse and nmbe scores show the progressive improvement achieved for the synthetic events tc2 and tc4 by moving from simple interpolation of a single flood driver based on uniform u1 and variable u2 flood severity to the interpolation of multiple flood drivers m this trend can also be seen with water depth error ranges and medians in fig 8 and reflects the benefits of considering events that are similar in behaviour to the library cases it is interesting to note that the improvement obtained from the univariate interpolation of library cases based on a combination of flood severities in the mainstream and tributaries i e u2 compared to u1 is more pronounced than moving to a multivariate interpolation scheme i e m compared to u2 for the remaining two test cases tc1 and tc3 the expected improvements from u1 to u2 to m are no longer present figs 6 and 7 these two cases are based on observed historical input hydrographs with different shapes to the library cases again it is evident that worse results are obtained when the event hydrographs exhibit different behaviour to the library cases we also evaluate whether the water depth simulations from individual interpolation schemes are clearly different from each other with respect to the computational error bounds of the hydrodynamic model a water depth error below 0 1 m is considered within computational precision of the hydrodynamic model symonds et al 2017 we count the number of cells taking u1 and u2 as examples in which the absolute error in u2 is 0 1 m lower than the corresponding error in u1 and we conclude that u2 led to a clear improvement over u1 in such cells similarly if the difference in absolute errors is greater than 0 1 m then we conclude the reverse we then calculate percentages of cells with clear improvements and deteriorations in water depth simulations results in the percentage of cells showing clear improvements and deteriorations for four test cases are shown in table 4 it shows the percentage differences in performance are generally less than 30 across all test cases which also means that most of the cells more than 70 are simulated to be within the computational error bounds 0 1 m the percentage differences between tc1 and tc2 smaller events are generally higher than those between tc3 and tc4 larger events it indicates that the percentage of cells within the error bounds is higher with larger events the results show that between 8 and 27 of the cells exhibit a clear improvement from u1 to u2 from u1 to m and from u2 to m in the synthetic events tc2 and tc4 though a smaller improvement 0 3 is evident between u2 to m for tc4 whilst only less than 1 of the cells result in deteriorated performance overall the improvements in water depth simulations from u1 to u2 from u1 to m and from u2 to m are evident in tc2 and tc4 however this finding is not as clear for the historical events tc1 and tc3 4 discussion the results presented in the preceding section indicate that the performance of all interpolation schemes is generally satisfactory the range of rmse scores obtained here less than 0 125 m compare favourably with those obtained using ann surrogate models generally less than 0 4 m for flood events of similar severity chu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 although it is difficult to directly compare such metrics due to differences in bathymetry and floodplain topography however the relatively high scores of the binary pattern performance measures should be carefully interpreted in the study some measures are based on the ratio of flooded areas obtained from observations and modelled these measures are sensitive to the magnitude of floods and tend to provide better performance scores for larger flood events this is particularly so with the csi metric besides overprediction and topographic slope can also lead to bias of these measures csi shows bias towards a model that overpredicts rather than underpredicts flooding and it is sensitive to correctly predicting areas with smaller topographic gradients stephens et al 2014 due to the inherent limitations of these measures additional metrics based on scalar error statistics such as those used in this study can be used to provide a more robust and informative performance analysis it is evident that the performance of the interpolation schemes improves as the degree of similarity between the event and library case hydrographs increases when the shape of the event hydrographs is similar to the library cases the performance improves as interpolation becomes more sophisticated from a univariate scheme with uniform severity in flood drivers u1 to a univariate scheme with variable u2 severity and to a multivariate scheme with variable severity m conversely the performance of all interpolation schemes degrades when event hydrographs exhibit different behaviour to the library cases this is a common limitation when applying any statistical or conceptual models to events that lie outside the range of conditions used in their development one approach to mitigating this issue would be to include events in the map library that have a greater range of variability and magnitude suitable events could be obtained from hydrodynamic models or from remote sensing bhatt et al 2017 one of the attractions of using interpolation approaches is that the library cases do not need to preserve the variability and correlated behaviour found in historical events they merely need to bracket the range of flood drivers relevant to the future conditions of interest this greatly simplifies the manner in which library cases are prepared as the necessary dependencies are implicitly accounted for in the flood drivers that are inputs for each specific event as long as the adopted interpolation scheme is sufficiently sophisticated to accommodate the required variability in the key flood drivers of interest any library cases that do not represent likely combinations of flood behaviours will simply not be utilised tidal influence is significantly attenuated from the port to belfast lough thus the impact of tide the third flood driver on inundation behaviour was found to be marginal in this study it is expected that the influence of tide decreases upstream along the main channel for example bermudez et al 2019 found that the influence of the tide on flood levels was only perceived along the lower 600 m reach of their study this study focuses on deriving a maximum flood inundation surface based on flood peaks using the interpolation schemes one obvious potential impediment to applying interpolation schemes to a time series of inputs is that they neglect the dependence of the inundation levels on prior conditions e g hysteresis the loss of accuracy associated with neglecting such influences tends to increase with larger floodplains as the time taken for water to get to all depressions distant from the river channels may be longer than a single time step teng et al 2019 and the storage discharge relationships on the rising limb of a flood hydrograph different from those on the recession limb as water is retained in the floodplain the uk environment agency did trial the application of a simple univariate interpolation scheme that corresponds to the u1 scheme described in this paper to derive successive estimates of inundation surfaces during the course of an event cox et al 2019 they found the approach provided robust estimates of maximum flood inundation that compared favourably to observed or physically based simulated flood extents however they did not report on how well the scheme performed at successive times throughout the event future work is required to investigate how best to accommodate the influence of hysteresis and other related factors when applying the interpolation approach to produce a time series of flood surfaces it is possible that these issues could be ameliorated by developing library cases corresponding to rising and falling limbs of the flood hydrograph while conceptually straightforward this has the disadvantage of doubling the number of library cases required the interpolation approach was validated against the results obtained using the detailed 2d hydraulic model rather than from historical observations records this approach avoids dealing with the inherent errors associated with the structure and parameterisation of the hydraulic model and the uncertainty arising from input data but such uncertainties are common to all interpolation approaches and thus do not impact on the relative performance between interpolation methods some of these errors and associated uncertainty could be reduced by a more rigorous calibration approach but it may be assumed that the true uncertainty of any individual interpolation approach is greater than that indicated by comparison with modelled results another limitation of this approach is a lack of flexibility to simulate a changing situation in a major flood event floodwaters could lead to significant changes and damages in a floodplain including potential dam or embankment failure geomorphological change and damage to infrastructure if the pre canned library is constructed only for the as is situation without considering other failure scenarios then this approach is not able to accommodate the associated changes in hydrodynamic behaviour and thus will not be able to produce an accurate flood inundation map in real time if such failure scenarios need to be accounted for then it will be necessary to prepare an alternative library of results relevant to each scenario and use these for model predictions though of course all such considerations are relevant to the case where estimates are obtained solely from hydraulic models for all schemes it only takes a few seconds to simulate a flood surface these simulation times represent a dramatic reduction in computational overhead compared with detailed conventional hydraulic modelling for example it takes approximately 12 h to simulate a 90 hour flood event using a computer with 16 cpu 3 70 ghz and 64 gb ram the high computational efficiency of the interpolation approach explains the popularity of its application for real time predictions in industry but of course the penalty for this computational efficiency is a lower prediction accuracy of course when evaluating the trade offs involved in using a map library approach it is necessary to consider the computational resources and effort required to build the map library 5 summary and conclusions emergency responders and decision makers require a flood forecasting service to provide fast reliable and accurate flood inundation forecasts in a timely manner for flood operations and mitigation conventional hydraulic models have high computational burden and thus are often not practical for a real time simulation for this reason it is common for industry practitioners to adopt an interpolation approach based on pre computed flood inundation maps to derive flood surfaces from observed or forecast river levels discharges despite the popularity of this approach there has been little published research that documents the approach and evaluates its performance the wide adoption of this approach and lack of research become the key motivation of this study here two univariate interpolation schemes u1 and u2 and one multivariate interpolation scheme m are described while both univariate schemes use simple linear interpolation between two nearest library maps to derive a flood surface the u1 scheme assumes that non primary drivers have the same aeps as the primary driver and the u2 scheme allows for variability in the aeps in contrast the multivariate scheme m derives a flood surface using linear interpolation based on all primary and non primary drivers comparison of the interpolation methods against results obtained from detailed 2d hydraulic modelling shows that the performance of all three interpolation schemes is generally satisfactory the interpolation schemes perform best when the event hydrographs are similar to the library case hydrographs performance improves when additional information on the spatial variability of the flood drivers is considered that is when the complexity of the interpolation scheme is progressively increased from simple interpolation based on a single flood driver with uniform flood severity u1 to the interpolation based on a single flood driver with variable flood severity u2 and to the interpolation based on multiple flood drivers m the performance of all interpolation schemes degrades when the event hydrographs exhibit different behaviour to the library cases and this reinforces the need to adopt a more comprehensive range of cases in the map library the pre computed map library should contain a sufficient number of library cases to capture a required range of flood variability in the key flood drivers as long as the library cases bracket the range of the flood drivers that can accommodate the future conditions of interest it is not necessary to preserve the variability and correlated behaviour of the flood drivers found in historical events because the necessary dependencies in the flood drivers have been implicitly captured in those cases this concept can greatly simplify the way to prepare the library cases the schemes discussed here have only been assessed for producing a maximum flood surface based on flood peaks however there are challenges involved in applying the schemes to simulate time evolution of flood surfaces and further work is required to determine how best to account for hysteretic behaviour in time series applications credit authorship contribution statement

the multivariate interpolation scheme in terms of three drivers but the methodology can be easily generalised to any number of drivers to predict the maximum inundation water depth d of a new event linear interpolations are successively applied according to each of the three drivers being considered given the peak levels of the hydrographs of the three drivers h 1 h 2 and h 3 the two nearest design hydrograph peak levels for each driver are identified h u 1 and h l 1 h u 2 and h l 2 and h u 3 and h l 3 the eight library cases representative of the different combinations of the driver

3391,it is important that real time flood forecasting provides information on inundation extents and depths to emergency responders for flood mitigation planning warning and rescue operations conventional hydrodynamic flood inundation modelling is generally not suited for real time operations because of its large computational demand the most widely adopted industry practice is to link a pre canned library of flood maps with river levels and use an interpolation approach to derive flood surfaces and depths based on selected model inputs however there is surprisingly scant information in the literature on the procedures and performance of the library interpolation approach in this study we describe the library interpolation approach introduce univariate and multivariate interpolation schemes and investigate their performance through a case study of a river in port fairy australia the mike 11 21 hydrodynamic model was used to construct a pre canned flood inundation library of design events the hydrodynamic model was also used to generate outputs for four test cases to evaluate the performance of the library interpolation approach it is found that the accuracy of the library interpolation approach relies heavily on how the map library was constructed selection of flood drivers and shape and timing of hydrographs the widely deployed univariate interpolation scheme based on a single primary flood driver yields results of varied accuracy depending on the validity of assumptions often made implicitly about the inputs of the non primary drivers a newly developed multivariate interpolation scheme overcomes this problem overall it is found that the results obtained using the map library interpolation schemes are generally satisfactory achieving a hit rate of 0 85 0 99 and a critical success index of 0 85 0 99 however a major limitation of the library interpolation approach is that the shape and timing of the input hydrographs need to be similar to that used in constructing the map library further research is needed to mitigate this limitation keywords flood inundation forecasting flood inundation map library univariate interpolation multivariate interpolation performance evaluation 1 introduction flood forecasting and warning plays a critical role in managing flooding events to reduce economic damages and protect lives from devastating floods traditionally forecasts have focused solely on the provision of river levels and flows but these do not provide useful information on the likely extent and depth of inundation which are key threats to life and property accordingly with the advent of better models of floodplain behaviour there is a strong desire to produce information on flood inundation extents and water depths to help mitigate flood risks and undertake rescue operations in a timely manner arduino et al 2005 demeritt et al 2007 for this reason many forecasting agencies are interested in developing flood inundation forecasting systems for operational use in real time flood inundation modelling is an essential component of such forecasting systems teng et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive review of the state of the art flood inundation modelling approaches including empirical conceptual and hydrodynamic models hydrodynamic modelling is considered the most capable approach to accurately simulating detailed flood propagation and inundation two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic models representing floodplain flows as 2d fields solve shallow water equations derived from the conservation of mass and momentum they provide more information on floodplain hydraulic behaviour than one dimensional models resulting in greater modelling accuracy bates et al 2003 cunge et al 1980 however such models are computationally very demanding limiting the uptake of 2d hydrodynamic models in real time applications murphy et al 2016 although computing technology has rapidly advanced in recent years it is still challenging to achieve real time flood inundation forecasting using a detailed hydrodynamic model world meteorological organisation 2011 this is especially onerous when it is necessary to assess forecast uncertainty by repeating simulations for multiple possible scenarios in real time as the event unfolds bermúdez et al 2019 hosseiny et al 2020 toro et al 2010 to enable real time flood inundation forecasting a range of efficient tools have been proposed to model flood inundation one popular solution is to use a conceptual routing model to spread flood volume across the floodplain to produce a maximum flood inundation extent examples of this approach include rapid flood spreading method rfsm lhomme et al 2008 flood modeller isis fast néelz pender 2013 tvd teng et al 2015 and height above the nearest drainage hand nobre et al 2011 the rfsm and flood modeller isis fast both divide floodplains based on topographic depressions and spread the flood volume with a filling and spilling process rfsm incurs less computational cost than flood modeller isis fast lhomme et al 2008 néelz pender 2013 teng et al 2017 the tvd model uses a planar method that intersects a series of planes and links the water level and volume to produce the flood extent teng et al 2015 the hand model nobre et al 2011 normalises topography according to local relative heights found along drainage network to produce relative height values for the surrounding cells of streams and then compare these values with in stream water depth to determine flood inundation extent these simple conceptual models are suitable for simulating flood behaviour over large floodplains in data sparse regions and for real time ensemble flood forecasting due to their low computational overhead compared with hydrodynamic models teng et al 2017 another fast approach is the use of surrogate models based on machine learning to emulate hydrodynamic models pan et al 2011 developed a surrogate model for a low lying area based on principal component analysis pca and hybrid neural network contreras et al 2020 developed a surrogate model for an urban area near a mountain region based on kriging on the space of parameters xie et al 2021 developed an ann based hybrid modelling approach to improve model performance for an data sparse region the surrogate models provided fast simulation times with acceptable levels of accuracy chu et al 2020 training data are required for establishing surrogate models and these can be generated by running hydrodynamic models with a variety of input data once surrogate models are established they can be used to estimate flood inundation for a given input data series without running the hydrodynamic models fundamentally surrogate models can be considered a form of interpolation with limited extrapolation by combining basis functions with regression in practice by far the most widely used interpolation approach for flood inundation estimation is through simple linear interpolation of pre canned flood maps for this reason we turn our attention here to this simple linear interpolation approach termed interpolation from hereon for brevity the uk environment agency have recently concluded that interpolation has the most potential to meet their requirements for real time predictions cox et al 2019 a flood map library is constructed from a set of inundation maps that are pre computed from hydrodynamic models showing flood extents and depths the library are typically based on a range of event magnitudes from near bankfull to the probable maximum flood usgs 2020 flood events used in the library can be historical and or design flood events historical flood events exhibit more realistic variability in flood behaviour than design events as the input rainfalls used in design typically ignore the high degree of spatio temporal variability found in real rainfall events ball et al 2019 cristiano et al 2017 the library can also be developed from a series of satellite derived inundation extents from historical events bhatt et al 2017 the general approach followed with the map library approach is to relate a set of inundation surfaces to river levels that have been derived for a particular location because river conditions in any given forecast event are unlikely to exactly match conditions used to derive the different flood cases in the map library it is necessary to estimate a forecast flood surface from the available maps using interpolation this most commonly involves linearly interpolating a water level between the nearest upper and lower levels from the map library and using this information to estimate water depths at individual grid cells in the flooded area druery et al 2007 despite the popularity of using simple interpolation schemes in practice there is a lack of published studies that consider the relative performance of different interpolation schemes thus there is a clear need to address this knowledge gap bales and wagner 2009 emphasised over ten years ago that further studies are needed to demonstrate the conditions and benefits of the map library approach however there is still a lack of attention given to this in the scientific literature in this study we describe the application of two simple univariate interpolation schemes and propose a multivariate alternative that considers river levels at multiple points in a catchment the multivariate interpolation scheme is proposed to predict flood extents and water depths in a multi driver floodplain where flooding may be the result of multiple drivers in an event such as mainstream tributaries and tides we assess the performances of these schemes for a case study at port fairy in australia the performances are measured against 2d hydraulic model simulations and the benefits and limitations of the schemes are discussed the outcomes of the study are intended to highlight the issues involved in the application of such approaches and to stimulate further research for their ongoing development and improvement 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area used in this research is port fairy and its surrounding area 1 1 km2 in south western victoria australia port fairy is situated on low lying ground near the mouth of the moyne river where it flows into the southern ocean fig 1 moyne river has an upstream catchment area of 758 km2 with significant tributaries including murray brook 133 km2 reedy creek 17 km2 and holcombe s drain 9 km2 these watercourses flow into an estuary which connects to the open sea in bass straight the moyne river catchment is dominated by landforms of volcanic origin with volcanic ash and lava flows duggan et al 2008 in the study area there is significant floodplain storage including the korongah flats and belfast lough which have appreciable influences on floodplain behaviour the dominant contribution to flood levels in the area is from the moyne river main channel though flood behaviour is also influenced by its largest tributary murray brook and changing tides the other smaller tributaries have much less influence compared with the moyne river main channel and murray brook the only river gauge in the study area is on the main channel of moyne river at toolong murray brook is ungauged and accounts for 18 of the total moyne river catchment area port fairy harbour does not have tide measurement and the nearest tide gauge is at portland harbour which is 40 km distant from port fairy 2 2 foundation models and datasets a hydrological model is used to produce river flow inputs and a hydrodynamical model is used to produce flood inundation data these are needed for constructing a flood inundation map library for constructing test cases and for generating validation data for evaluating performance of different interpolation schemes 2 2 1 hydrological model the hydrological model used for this study is the rorb model which is an event based runoff routing model widely used in australia to produce design flood hydrographs it simulates surface runoff by subtracting losses from rainfall to produce rainfall excess and then routing through a network of storages to produce hydrographs at points of interest laurenson et al 2010 it is a semi distributed hydrological model that may be configured to consider catchment geometry and topographic data the model has four parameters that describe the available storage in the catchment the degree of non linearity in the catchment response to rainfall and losses before water enters the channel network laurenson et al 2010 the rorb model is used to generate flood hydrographs at key locations in the moyne river catchment which are then input to the hydraulic model the parameters were tuned in a model calibration process for historical flood events in 1946 1978 and 2001 duggan et al 2008 2 2 2 hydraulic model a hydraulic model established by water technology for the glenelg hopkins catchment management authority was made available to this study duggan et al 2008 the model uses the mike 21 two dimensional hydrodynamic modelling system with the capability to model rivers floodplains and coastal areas the model has a topographic grid with a resolution of 10 m derived and integrated from several sources including an aerial laser survey bathymetric data and a field survey duggan et al 2008 the dem data are also available from the elevation foundation spatial data elvis portal of geoscience australia that provides the best available elevation data describing australia s landforms and seabed flow behaviour in the estuary is often unsteady due to the changing influence of river inflows and tide levels for this reason a small computational time step 0 75 s was adopted to ensure the stability of the hydraulic model the hydraulic roughness grid was based principally on aerial orthophotography and then inspected during field visits duggan et al 2008 the roughness values representing various land uses including open grassland paved surfaces buildings and thick vegetation were initially adopted based on literature and experience then they were adjusted through a hydraulic model calibration process for three historical flood events in 1946 1978 and 2001 2 2 3 design flood hydrographs for the main river and each of the tributaries seven design flood flow hydrographs were created to represent the flood hazard with annual exceedance probabilities aeps of 20 10 5 2 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 these design floods were obtained by using the rorb model in combination with probabilistic estimates of rainfall depths under assumptions governed by local design procedures ball et al 2019 design tides that combine both astronomical tide and storm surge were adopted from a regional study mcinnes et al 2009 the highest astronomical tide hat at port fairy is 0 6 m ahd and the 1 and 10 aep surge levels are respectively 0 45 m and 0 23 m accordingly the adopted tidal levels for the 1 and 10 aeps are respectively 1 05 m and 0 83 m from the two known tidal levels the design tide levels of 20 5 2 0 5 0 2 and 0 1 aeps were derived based on logarithmic interpolation and extrapolation 2 3 map library cases flooding can be affected by a combination of multiple drivers in an event spatial and temporal variability in real rainfall events leads to different levels of flood severity of the drivers in the one event accordingly a number of design events were created using various combinations of input design hydrographs ranging from near bankfull conditions to the 0 1 aep flood input hydrographs were derived for three combinations of flood drivers consisting of the moyne river mainstream the largest tributary murray brook and high tides as these constitute the largest contributions to flooding for the other small tributaries reedy creek and holcombe s drain design hydrographs of the same aeps as the mainstream were assumed when creating design events the events were then used as inputs to the hydraulic model to derive a flood map library where each map represents the maximum flood extent and depth resulting from each selected combination of inputs in this study the map library is populated using design events and it is convenient to refer to library cases by their aeps but with historic events resulting from a combination of factors it may be more convenient to refer to the different cases by their peak magnitude in the following descriptions we solely refer to aeps 2 4 flood inundation map library interpolation schemes estimating flood inundation extents in real time is achieved by interpolating the different flood extents and depths associated with the different flood library maps the most common practice is to consider only the main flood driver and it is usual to adopt a univariate interpolation scheme in this study we also propose an alternative multivariate approach which uses information on major flood drivers at different locations around the modelled domain for a particular event and we then evaluate the performance of both approaches 2 4 1 univariate interpolation schemes consider a hydrograph describing the primary driver for a new event its peak level is h the interpolation is based on selection of two nearest cases from the map library with peak water levels h u and h l that bracket the magnitude of the selected primary driver the maps provide information on maximum inundation water depths du and dl as upper and lower bounds respectively to predict maximum inundation water depth d of the new event a linear interpolation is applied 1 d d l a d u d l where a h h l h u h l the interpolation is undertaken separately for each individual cell across the model domain a schematic of this interpolation scheme is shown in fig 2 with this univariate scheme it is assumed that the inundation surface is solely dependent on the primary driver however in practice other flood drivers can influence the outcome different levels of sophistication can be adopted to accommodate these interactions and in this study we introduce two ways of choosing the nearest maps the two univariate schemes considered here u1 and u2 are described as follows u1 peak water levels of non primary drivers are unknown and assumed to have the same aeps as the primary driver the selection of the two nearest maps are based on this assumption u2 peak water levels of non primary drivers are known this information together with information on the peak water level of the primary drivers are used to select the two nearest maps where these are selected to provide the closest upper and lower bounds at all locations of the primary and non primary drivers in order to apply the u1 univariate approach it is only necessary to populate the map library with a single set of design events corresponding to the primary flood driver however to apply the u2 univariate approach it is necessary to populate the map library with the results obtained from running all combinations of flood severities for the primary and all non primary drivers the following example can help explain the nearest upper and lower library cases represented by u1 and u2 the example assumes that the actual flood severity at the mainstream primary driver is 3 aep the tributary non primary driver is 12 aep and the tide level non primary driver is 8 aep the upper and lower library case bounds corresponding to the u1 and u2 univariate schemes are specified in table 1 2 4 2 multivariate interpolation scheme in contrast to the univariate interpolation schemes the multivariate interpolation scheme m scheme explicitly considers the inundation surfaces associated with all primary and non primary drivers here we describe the scheme in terms of three drivers but the methodology can be easily extended to any number of drivers given the peak levels of three hydrographs h 1 h 2 and h 3 the two nearest map cases that bound the primary driver peak level h 1 are identified with associated peak levels h u 1 and h l 1 and the corresponding map cases bounding the non primary drivers h 2 and h 3 are also identified with peak levels h u 2 and h l 2 and h u 3 and h l 3 respectively the scheme thus uses eight 23 close library cases that are generated from a combination of the inputs of the three drivers consequently at each grid cell there are eight maximum inundation water depths denoted by d u u u d l u u d u l u d l l u d u u l d l u l d u l l and d l l l where the three subscript positions correspond to the three drivers subscript u refers to an upper library case and l refers to an lower library case to predict maximum inundation water depth d of the new event linear interpolations are successively applied according to each of the three drivers this results in the following equation for the final interpolated water depth 2 d d l l l a 1 d u l l d l l l a 2 d l u l d l l l a 3 d l l u d l l l a 1 a 2 d u u l d l l l d u l l d l u l a 1 a 3 d u l u d l l l d u l l d l l u a 2 a 3 d l u u d l l l d l u l d l l u a 1 a 2 a 3 d u u u d l l u d u l l d l u l d u u l d l l l d u l u d l u u where a 1 h 1 h l 1 h u 1 h l 1 a 2 h 2 h l 2 h u 2 h l 2 a 3 h 3 h l 3 h u 3 h l 3 a schematic of the multivariate interpolation scheme is shown in fig 3 the derivation of the equation 2 is given in appendix 2 5 selected test cases four test cases were developed to evaluate the performance of the library interpolation schemes where particular attention was paid to assessing the differences between the univariate and multivariate interpolation scheme details of the four test cases tc1 to tc4 are provided in table 2 including information on simulation period forecast length peak magnitude and the library cases used in the interpolations test cases tc1 and tc3 are historical events with recorded streamflow for the mainstream tc2 and tc4 are synthetic design events which have been scaled to have the same peak as the historic events including synthetic events that have the same peak but different shape to the historic events provides useful information on the influence of hydrograph shape and timing on the accuracy of the interpolation schemes simulated tributary streamflow and design tides are used in all test cases as the tributaries and estuary are ungauged fig 4 a shows hydrographs of the four test cases the hydrographs of the historical events tc1 tc3 have greater volumes and delayed peaks compared to the synthetic events fig 4 b illustrates selection of the library cases for each interpolation scheme the u1 and u2 schemes use the two nearest library cases as upper and lower bounds whereas the m scheme requires eight close library cases because the peaks of tc1 and tc2 have the same severity they adopt the same set of library cases in the interpolation schemes fig 5 presents the inundation extents and water depths of the test cases simulated using the 2d hydraulic model and illustrates how the flood extent varies over the range of events considered it is seen that although the magnitudes of the tc1 and tc2 flood peaks are identical the larger volume of tc1 leads to more extensive and deeper flood inundation in some areas such as from korongah flats to belfast lough the same is also true when the tc3 and tc4 events are compared 2 6 performance evaluation the performance of the different interpolation schemes is assessed against the results obtained from the detailed 2d hydraulic model performance is assessed for flood extents and water depths using events that were not included in the map library the accuracy of the predicted flood extents is assessed using binary pattern performance measures and the accuracy of the predicted water depths is assessed using scalar error statistics the binary pattern performance measures used to assess flood extents are derived from a contingency table that groups all grid cells in the model domain into four categories as shown in table 3 mason et al 2009 stephens et al 2014 the binary pattern performance measures adopted for this study are hit rate critical success index csi or f1 score and two skills scores f2 and f3 as described below hit rate eqn 3 is used to assess the fraction of the modelled flood extent that is correctly estimated by the interpolation schemes csi eqn 4 measures the percentage of the correctly estimated cells that exclude the dry cells and is a metric that is commonly used in evaluating flood inundation assessments the two skill scores f2 and f3 eqns 5 and 6 penalise underprediction and overprediction respectively archer et al 2018 stephens et al 2014 all these binary pattern metrics range between 0 no match and 1 perfect match 3 hitrate a a c 4 csi o r f 1 a a b c 5 f 2 a c a b c 6 f 3 a b a b c the accuracy of water depths derived using the different interpolation schemes is assessed using the differences between the interpolated estimates h i and hydraulic model results hi the level of overall agreement between the interpolated estimates and hydraulic modelled water depths are summarised using the common statistical measures of normalised mean bias error nmbe and root mean squared error rmse dawson et al 2007 7 nmbe i 1 n h i h i i 1 n h i 8 rmse i 1 n h i h i 2 n rmse is a positive metric that provides an indication of overall error based on the square differences and is sensitive to high magnitude events that often have large errors chu et al 2020 dawson et al 2007 in contrast nmbe normalises the errors across different magnitudes of flood events and provides information on the degree of either under or over prediction involved dawson et al 2007 3 results 3 1 flood extent comparison the binary pattern performance measures are used to compare the maximum flood extents simulated by the hydraulic model with the flood extents interpolated based on the peaks of all drivers fig 6 and table b1 present hit rate csi f2 underprediction and f3 overprediction scores used to assess performance of all interpolation schemes in general the performance results show all of them work reasonably well with all binary pattern performance scores above 0 7 hit rate consistently shows high scores ranging from 0 85 to close to 1 perfect prediction it means that a high proportion of the modelled flood extent is predicted correctly by all interpolation schemes across all test cases the csi metric are similar to hit rate indicating high model accuracy with the dry areas excluded in both modelled and interpolated results 3 1 1 different test cases the interpolation performance is however not consistent across all test cases better performance can be observed when the hydrograph shapes and timing of test cases are similar to those of the library cases for example fig 6 shows that the synthetic events based on the library cases tc2 and tc4 have higher binary pattern performance scores than the historical events tc1 and tc3 across all interpolation schemes the results for tc2 and tc4 range from 0 79 to 1 00 and those for tc1 and tc3 range between 0 70 and 0 98 a spatial display of the interpolated versus modelled flood extents in fig 7 also supports this observation on the other hand fig 6 shows that the binary pattern performance scores of the larger events tc3 and tc4 greater than0 93 are generally higher than tc1 and tc2 greater than0 70 this observation results from the fact that binary pattern performance measures are sensitive to the magnitude of a flood event since they are all dependent on the ratio between erroneous cells b c and the size of the observed flood a b stephens et al 2014 this is especially evident in the csi metric which has much higher scores for more severe floods here tc3 and tc4 0 1 aep are much more severe events than tc1 and tc2 5 aep this inherent limitation of these scores mean that care needs to be taken when interpretating the results stephens et al 2014 3 1 2 different interpolation schemes it is also seen from fig 6 that the successive complexity associated with moving from u1 u2 to m generally yields better performance in the synthetic events based on the library cases tc2 and tc4 the results are in accordance with the expectation that increasing the information content used by the schemes improves the accuracy of the interpolations however this trend is not as evident for the historical events tc1 and tc3 this indicates that the performance of the different schemes is dependent on the degree of similarity between the event hydrographs and the library cases and a less refined interpolation scheme may fortuitously achieve a better performance for certain events despite the high scores represented by hit rate and csi it is seen the f2 and f3 scores are not always as high as the hit rate and csi metrics the f2 scores of 0 70 and 0 79 for the u2 and m schemes of tc1 indicates that the flood extents are generally underpredicted conversely the f3 score of 0 79 achieved by application of the u1 scheme to tc2 indicates that the flood extents are generally over predicted these scores are consistent with the coloured regions of fig 7 showing areas of underprediction blue and overprediction red that were achieved for the tc1 and tc2 events 3 2 water depth comparison the accuracy of the water depths derived from the interpolation approach is evaluated against the maximum water depths simulated by the hydraulic model using scalar error statistics the difference in the water depths is calculated for each individual grid cell and summarised by the rmse and nmbe metrics fig 6 and table b1 the rmse values ranging between 0 007 m and 0 125 m and the nmbe values ranging between 0 174 and 0 102 indicate that the overall performance of the interpolation schemes is generally high summary distributions of the water depth errors are shown in fig 8 in the form of boxplots it is seen about 90 of the grid cells have errors between 0 4 m and 0 25 m across all test cases and schemes and the spatial distributions of these errors are shown in fig 7 it is evident that the maximum depths estimated at most of the grid cells have reasonably small errors regardless of the interpolation scheme used 3 2 1 different test cases from fig 6 nmbe values are negative for tc1 and tc3 across all interpolation schemes indicating the water depths for the historical events are generally underestimated the overall underprediction for tc1 and tc3 is also seen in the boxplots fig 8 with the water depths underestimated by up to 0 4 m the spatial error maps fig 7 show that the underpredicted depths occur mainly in the korongah flats to belfast lough areas in contrast to the historical events the results for the synthetic events tc2 and tc4 exhibit better scores in terms of absolute rmse and proportional nmbe metrics in addition the water depth errors for the tc2 and tc4 events range between 0 15 m and 0 25 m with medians close to 0 and this represents significantly better accuracy over the results obtained for the historical events tc1 and tc3 this observation is consistent with the findings from section 3 1 1 that the performance scores improve as the degree of similarity between the event and library case hydrographs increases and as additional information is utilised by the different interpolation schemes fig 6 also shows that the accuracy of the schemes is dependent on event magnitude where it is seen that the bigger flood event tc3 produces larger errors in comparison with the smaller event tc1 however it should be noted that the errors in the larger event are smaller in proportional terms as can be seen from the nmbe metric 3 2 2 different interpolation schemes from fig 6 the rmse and nmbe scores show the progressive improvement achieved for the synthetic events tc2 and tc4 by moving from simple interpolation of a single flood driver based on uniform u1 and variable u2 flood severity to the interpolation of multiple flood drivers m this trend can also be seen with water depth error ranges and medians in fig 8 and reflects the benefits of considering events that are similar in behaviour to the library cases it is interesting to note that the improvement obtained from the univariate interpolation of library cases based on a combination of flood severities in the mainstream and tributaries i e u2 compared to u1 is more pronounced than moving to a multivariate interpolation scheme i e m compared to u2 for the remaining two test cases tc1 and tc3 the expected improvements from u1 to u2 to m are no longer present figs 6 and 7 these two cases are based on observed historical input hydrographs with different shapes to the library cases again it is evident that worse results are obtained when the event hydrographs exhibit different behaviour to the library cases we also evaluate whether the water depth simulations from individual interpolation schemes are clearly different from each other with respect to the computational error bounds of the hydrodynamic model a water depth error below 0 1 m is considered within computational precision of the hydrodynamic model symonds et al 2017 we count the number of cells taking u1 and u2 as examples in which the absolute error in u2 is 0 1 m lower than the corresponding error in u1 and we conclude that u2 led to a clear improvement over u1 in such cells similarly if the difference in absolute errors is greater than 0 1 m then we conclude the reverse we then calculate percentages of cells with clear improvements and deteriorations in water depth simulations results in the percentage of cells showing clear improvements and deteriorations for four test cases are shown in table 4 it shows the percentage differences in performance are generally less than 30 across all test cases which also means that most of the cells more than 70 are simulated to be within the computational error bounds 0 1 m the percentage differences between tc1 and tc2 smaller events are generally higher than those between tc3 and tc4 larger events it indicates that the percentage of cells within the error bounds is higher with larger events the results show that between 8 and 27 of the cells exhibit a clear improvement from u1 to u2 from u1 to m and from u2 to m in the synthetic events tc2 and tc4 though a smaller improvement 0 3 is evident between u2 to m for tc4 whilst only less than 1 of the cells result in deteriorated performance overall the improvements in water depth simulations from u1 to u2 from u1 to m and from u2 to m are evident in tc2 and tc4 however this finding is not as clear for the historical events tc1 and tc3 4 discussion the results presented in the preceding section indicate that the performance of all interpolation schemes is generally satisfactory the range of rmse scores obtained here less than 0 125 m compare favourably with those obtained using ann surrogate models generally less than 0 4 m for flood events of similar severity chu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 although it is difficult to directly compare such metrics due to differences in bathymetry and floodplain topography however the relatively high scores of the binary pattern performance measures should be carefully interpreted in the study some measures are based on the ratio of flooded areas obtained from observations and modelled these measures are sensitive to the magnitude of floods and tend to provide better performance scores for larger flood events this is particularly so with the csi metric besides overprediction and topographic slope can also lead to bias of these measures csi shows bias towards a model that overpredicts rather than underpredicts flooding and it is sensitive to correctly predicting areas with smaller topographic gradients stephens et al 2014 due to the inherent limitations of these measures additional metrics based on scalar error statistics such as those used in this study can be used to provide a more robust and informative performance analysis it is evident that the performance of the interpolation schemes improves as the degree of similarity between the event and library case hydrographs increases when the shape of the event hydrographs is similar to the library cases the performance improves as interpolation becomes more sophisticated from a univariate scheme with uniform severity in flood drivers u1 to a univariate scheme with variable u2 severity and to a multivariate scheme with variable severity m conversely the performance of all interpolation schemes degrades when event hydrographs exhibit different behaviour to the library cases this is a common limitation when applying any statistical or conceptual models to events that lie outside the range of conditions used in their development one approach to mitigating this issue would be to include events in the map library that have a greater range of variability and magnitude suitable events could be obtained from hydrodynamic models or from remote sensing bhatt et al 2017 one of the attractions of using interpolation approaches is that the library cases do not need to preserve the variability and correlated behaviour found in historical events they merely need to bracket the range of flood drivers relevant to the future conditions of interest this greatly simplifies the manner in which library cases are prepared as the necessary dependencies are implicitly accounted for in the flood drivers that are inputs for each specific event as long as the adopted interpolation scheme is sufficiently sophisticated to accommodate the required variability in the key flood drivers of interest any library cases that do not represent likely combinations of flood behaviours will simply not be utilised tidal influence is significantly attenuated from the port to belfast lough thus the impact of tide the third flood driver on inundation behaviour was found to be marginal in this study it is expected that the influence of tide decreases upstream along the main channel for example bermudez et al 2019 found that the influence of the tide on flood levels was only perceived along the lower 600 m reach of their study this study focuses on deriving a maximum flood inundation surface based on flood peaks using the interpolation schemes one obvious potential impediment to applying interpolation schemes to a time series of inputs is that they neglect the dependence of the inundation levels on prior conditions e g hysteresis the loss of accuracy associated with neglecting such influences tends to increase with larger floodplains as the time taken for water to get to all depressions distant from the river channels may be longer than a single time step teng et al 2019 and the storage discharge relationships on the rising limb of a flood hydrograph different from those on the recession limb as water is retained in the floodplain the uk environment agency did trial the application of a simple univariate interpolation scheme that corresponds to the u1 scheme described in this paper to derive successive estimates of inundation surfaces during the course of an event cox et al 2019 they found the approach provided robust estimates of maximum flood inundation that compared favourably to observed or physically based simulated flood extents however they did not report on how well the scheme performed at successive times throughout the event future work is required to investigate how best to accommodate the influence of hysteresis and other related factors when applying the interpolation approach to produce a time series of flood surfaces it is possible that these issues could be ameliorated by developing library cases corresponding to rising and falling limbs of the flood hydrograph while conceptually straightforward this has the disadvantage of doubling the number of library cases required the interpolation approach was validated against the results obtained using the detailed 2d hydraulic model rather than from historical observations records this approach avoids dealing with the inherent errors associated with the structure and parameterisation of the hydraulic model and the uncertainty arising from input data but such uncertainties are common to all interpolation approaches and thus do not impact on the relative performance between interpolation methods some of these errors and associated uncertainty could be reduced by a more rigorous calibration approach but it may be assumed that the true uncertainty of any individual interpolation approach is greater than that indicated by comparison with modelled results another limitation of this approach is a lack of flexibility to simulate a changing situation in a major flood event floodwaters could lead to significant changes and damages in a floodplain including potential dam or embankment failure geomorphological change and damage to infrastructure if the pre canned library is constructed only for the as is situation without considering other failure scenarios then this approach is not able to accommodate the associated changes in hydrodynamic behaviour and thus will not be able to produce an accurate flood inundation map in real time if such failure scenarios need to be accounted for then it will be necessary to prepare an alternative library of results relevant to each scenario and use these for model predictions though of course all such considerations are relevant to the case where estimates are obtained solely from hydraulic models for all schemes it only takes a few seconds to simulate a flood surface these simulation times represent a dramatic reduction in computational overhead compared with detailed conventional hydraulic modelling for example it takes approximately 12 h to simulate a 90 hour flood event using a computer with 16 cpu 3 70 ghz and 64 gb ram the high computational efficiency of the interpolation approach explains the popularity of its application for real time predictions in industry but of course the penalty for this computational efficiency is a lower prediction accuracy of course when evaluating the trade offs involved in using a map library approach it is necessary to consider the computational resources and effort required to build the map library 5 summary and conclusions emergency responders and decision makers require a flood forecasting service to provide fast reliable and accurate flood inundation forecasts in a timely manner for flood operations and mitigation conventional hydraulic models have high computational burden and thus are often not practical for a real time simulation for this reason it is common for industry practitioners to adopt an interpolation approach based on pre computed flood inundation maps to derive flood surfaces from observed or forecast river levels discharges despite the popularity of this approach there has been little published research that documents the approach and evaluates its performance the wide adoption of this approach and lack of research become the key motivation of this study here two univariate interpolation schemes u1 and u2 and one multivariate interpolation scheme m are described while both univariate schemes use simple linear interpolation between two nearest library maps to derive a flood surface the u1 scheme assumes that non primary drivers have the same aeps as the primary driver and the u2 scheme allows for variability in the aeps in contrast the multivariate scheme m derives a flood surface using linear interpolation based on all primary and non primary drivers comparison of the interpolation methods against results obtained from detailed 2d hydraulic modelling shows that the performance of all three interpolation schemes is generally satisfactory the interpolation schemes perform best when the event hydrographs are similar to the library case hydrographs performance improves when additional information on the spatial variability of the flood drivers is considered that is when the complexity of the interpolation scheme is progressively increased from simple interpolation based on a single flood driver with uniform flood severity u1 to the interpolation based on a single flood driver with variable flood severity u2 and to the interpolation based on multiple flood drivers m the performance of all interpolation schemes degrades when the event hydrographs exhibit different behaviour to the library cases and this reinforces the need to adopt a more comprehensive range of cases in the map library the pre computed map library should contain a sufficient number of library cases to capture a required range of flood variability in the key flood drivers as long as the library cases bracket the range of the flood drivers that can accommodate the future conditions of interest it is not necessary to preserve the variability and correlated behaviour of the flood drivers found in historical events because the necessary dependencies in the flood drivers have been implicitly captured in those cases this concept can greatly simplify the way to prepare the library cases the schemes discussed here have only been assessed for producing a maximum flood surface based on flood peaks however there are challenges involved in applying the schemes to simulate time evolution of flood surfaces and further work is required to determine how best to account for hysteretic behaviour in time series applications credit authorship contribution statement

3392,phosphorus p transport from soil to surface runoff is of great concern for the accurate prediction of p transport within the watershed while the interaction between p and sediments has rarely been considered in conventional soil solute transport models this study develops a novel p transport model that couples the processes of selective soil erosion and dynamic partitioning of p at the particle water interface the model assumes that the gradation of soil sediment particles strongly affects the maximum amount of adsorption and therefore affects p partitioning while changes in the water environment also influence the partition coefficient the novel model was then validated by four laboratory experimental runs the r 2 and rmse values show that the simulated results are in good agreement with the measured data indicating that the model is capable of effectively simulating rainfall induced p transport from soil to runoff the modelled results indicate that an increase in the coarseness of sediment particles resulted in a sharp decrease in particle p adsorption c sd during erosion therefore if the change in particle size was not accounted for in the model k ed k p the concentrations of soluble phosphorus sp and particulate phosphorus pp would be significantly underestimated this highlights the importance of including selective erosion and p sediment interactions in models of p transport from soils to surface runoff keywords phosphorus transport particle gradation environmental factors partition coefficient exchange layer rainfall induced erosion 1 introduction nutrient loss from soils due to rainfall induced runoff is extremely common not only causing nutrient loss from agricultural land but also leading to eutrophication and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in rivers and reservoirs elser et al 2007 huang et al 2015 in particular the transport of phosphorus p the key limiting factor for eutrophication in rivers and lakes requires further attention fang et al 2017 huang et al 2017 sediment is a major carrier of p and controls the amount of highly available soluble phosphorus sp in waterbodies due to its large specific surface area and high abundance of potential adsorption sites davis and kent 1990 fang et al 2013 therefore developing models to describe the interactions between soil sediment and p is critical for the comprehensive understanding of p transport from soils to runoff numerous dynamic models have been established based on the simulation of physical processes causing chemical migration between soil water and runoff ahuja 1990 ao et al 2020 gao et al 2003 li et al 2017 tong et al 2010 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 1997 chemical transfer models can be generally grouped into two categories mixing layer models and diffusion controlled models gao et al 2004 the mixing layer approach is probably the most commonly adopted for the analysis of chemical transport in soil due to its straightforward conception and easy implementation shi et al 2011 however it has been reported that the conventional soil mixing layer model fails to consider the influence of raindrop impact ahuja et al 1981 steenhuis et al 1994 resulting in a significant underestimation of solute concentrations gao et al 2004 proposed a high fidelity soil solute transport model including adsorbed and non adsorbed substances by coupling the ejection of soil water by raindrop impacts and the diffusion of solutes to resolve this problem the model was then further developed for example the new concept of downward development of mixed layer thickness with time tong and ye 2020 consideration of time varying parameters such as rainfall induced water transfer rate and infiltration rate ao et al 2020 and data assimilation methods for calibration model parameters meng et al 2021 these improvements have greatly enhanced our understanding of the physical mechanisms of solute transport especially for non adsorbed substances however most models describe its transport more simply for the adsorbed substance p similar to the gao model these models only use constant adsorption coefficients to express adsorbed p kang et al 2011 tao et al 2017 tao et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the description of p dynamics with sediment and how sediment gradation affects adsorption was missing as an important physical property of sediments particle gradation is a highly significant factor that should be considered in analyzing sediment erosion transport accumulation and riverbed evolution zhang et al 2020 during the soil erosion process fine particles tend to be dislodged and transported early while coarse particles are dislodged in later stages of erosion those fine sediment particles have relatively small settling velocities they can be carried away by runoff over long distances so in the initial stages of an erosion event finer particles contribute more to the concentration of eroded sediment hairsine and rose 1991 aksoy and kavvas 2005 while p has been reported to be mainly associated with finer particles there are marked differences in the p adsorption capacity of coarse and fine particles meng et al 2014 wang et al 2021 therefore the impact of varying particle size on p migration is essential to accurately reflect variations in p concentrations in the runoff with varying suspended sediment particle sizes and characteristics in addition to sediment particle gradation the mineral composition particle concentration and water characteristics significantly influence the interactions between p and sediments cui et al 2017 fang et al 2017 wang et al 2005 many water quality models utilize empirical relationships such as linear partition coefficient k sd values to characterize the adsorption and desorption of p by soils and sediments gao et al 2004 mcgechan and lewis 2002 however the k sd in the actual dynamic process differs significantly from under isothermal adsorption conditions due to temporal and spatial variations in water chemistry davis et al 2004 rainfall induced p loss is often accompanied by strong soil erosion sedimentation and large variations in solute concentrations in runoff under these conditions the partition of p varies with environmental conditions making it unreasonable to replace the k sd value in natural waterbodies with the coefficient value under ideal experimental conditions therefore quantification of k sd is necessary to reduce uncertainty in the simulation of p transport in this study to better understand the transport mechanism of p from soil to runoff a novel p transport model with soil erosion was developed by incorporating the process of selective erosion of soil and dynamic partition of p between particles and water sediment gradation as well as the variability of sp and particulate phosphorus pp concentrations were modeled and investigated two laboratory experimental runs were conducted for model validation the objectives of this study were 1 to validate the proposed novel p transport model using laboratory experiments 2 to quantify the effect of particle gradation on p enrichment during erosion and 3 to establish the impacts of particle properties and environmental factors on p dynamic partitioning in runoff 2 methodologies 2 1 numerical models the proposed model comprised a soil erosion model and p transport model which was developed based on the rose model hairsine and rose 1991 and gao model gao et al 2004 to describe the selective erosion of soil sediment particles and their effect on p transport between the exchange layer and runoff a conceptual schematic of the model is shown in fig 1 with the soil water system divided into three horizontal layers runoff an exchange layer or deposited layer and the underlying soil layer 2 1 1 soil erosion model the rose model was proposed by hairsine and rose 1991 to simulate the raindrop induced erosion process in the absence of entrainment by shallow overland flow the model assumes that fine particles can be transported with runoff leaving coarser particles in the deposited layer during raindrop erosion events the model considers the separate contributions of individual particle size classes to the total suspended sediment concentration sander et al 1996 presented separate coupled conservation equations for the suspended sediment concentration s i x t and

be determined assouline 2006 reported that the bulk density of soil increased exponentially during rainfall while the amount of soil splash gradually decreased therefore the raindrop detachment rate

that the e rt value may be modified by eq 10 as follows as the residual water ejection rate persists after the soil deposited layer is completely formed 10 e rt x t ap θ ρ b 1 h e r 0 where e r 0 indicates the residual soil water ejection rate cm s it is of note that the sediment eroded into runoff also carries p and reduces the solute concentration of p in the exchange layer therefore the term e t k ed c e can be introduced into eq 9 describing pp erosion from the exchange layer in the runoff layer two separate governing equations can be used for p in water and the suspended sediment allowing consideration of dynamic p partitioning between the water phase and the solid phase by not accounting for the sediment diffusion term the mass conservation of sp and pp carried by the sediment in the runoff is expressed according to eqs 11 and 12 as follows 11 d w c w t qc w x e rt c e λ c w fc w d w sk k sd c w c sd 12 d w sc sd t qsc sd x d w sk k sd c w c sd e t k ed c e where c

huang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 and k sd is the partition coefficient of p onto suspended sediment particles l kg which varies with the erosion process the last term of eq 11 d w sk k sd c w c sd represents the adsorption flux of p onto suspended sediment particles from water following the law of first order kinetics substituting eq 5 into eq 11 and eqs 6 and 7 into eq 12 gives eqs 13 and 14

particles exhibit a strong affinity to pollutants due to their high specific surface area and abundance of active surface sites davis and kent 1990 wang et al 2009 the p in water tends to be adsorbed by sediment particles moving from the particulate phase to the dissolved phase withers and jarvie 2008 the partition coefficient k d has been widely used to characterize the capability of sediments to retain p galunin et al 2014 as shown in eq 15 15 k d q e c w where q e is the amount of p adsorbed by sediments at equilibrium mg kg p adsorption by sediment particles depends on intrinsic sediment factors which determine the maximum amount of p adsorption as well as on environmental factors that affect how much p can be adsorbed by sediment particles in aquatic environments huang et al 2017 li et al 2021 the equation used to estimate the amount of p adsorption by sediment particles is described in eq 16 as follows 16 q e q max f environmental factors where q max is the maximum amount of p adsorbed by the sediment mg kg and f environmental factors is a function of environmental factors therefore the partition coefficient of p onto sediment particles was determined by the characteristic of sediment themselves and the aquatic environment as shown in eq 17 17 k d q max f environmental factors c w 2 2 1 partition coefficient of p onto supplementary sediment during erosion fine particles are eroded from the original soil matrix to runoff transferring to the suspended sediment these particles have a smaller size and larger specific surface area enhancing the maximum potentially adsorbed amount as compared to the original soils therefore it may be assumed that the environment surrounding these fine particles at the moment of erosion is the same as that of the soil in the exchange layer therefore following eq 17 a correction factor can be established using eq 18 as follows 18 κ p k ed k p q max sup q max soil where q max sup and q max soil are the maximum adsorbed amount of p onto the supplementary sediment and the original soil mg kg in order to avoid the need for batch equilibrium adsorption experiments to obtain the maximum adsorbed amount the method of calculating q max proposed by fang et al 2017 and li et al 2021 was adopted sediment is treated as an assemblage of major minerals and therefore the maximum adsorption amount can be determined using the component additivity method davis et al 1998 as shown in eq 19 as follows 19 q max j 1 n p j q max j where p j and q max j represent the mass percentage and maximum adsorption amount of the j th mineral and mg kg respectively li et al 2021 experimentally derived a correlation between the q max of each mineral and the comprehensive factor c which can be described using eq 20 as follows 20 q max j 5 02 c j 0 02 where c j is the comprehensive factor of the j th mineral for each mineral 21 c d 50 n s f 2 a n s ρ 2 d 50 1 85 f 2 a 0 60 where d 50 is the median particle size m n s indicates the surface active site density determined using crystallographic characterization site m2 f 2 a indicates an average morphology descriptor calculated from the sem images that indicate the degree of heterogeneity or roughness of particle surfaces and ρ indicates the particle density further details are provided in fang et al 2017 and li et al 2021 once the mineral composition and the median particle size of the sediment sample have been established the maximum adsorbed amount of each mineral is calculated according to the measured particle size groups using eqs 20 and 21 allowing the maximum adsorbed amount of a sample to be obtained using eq 19 2 2 2 partition coefficient of p onto suspended sediment the partition of p onto the suspended sediment is more complicated than partitioning in soil matrices with continued erosion rapid and continual variation occurs in the sediment and surrounding environmental factors such as median particle size d 50 sediment concentration s and solute concentration c w the effect of particle size is evaluated in terms of q max using eqs 19 21 the effects of extrinsic factors can be regarded as individual functions of environmental factors as shown in eq 22 with the major factors including c w ph ionic strength is and s 22 f environmental factors f c w f ph f is f s the influence of these factors has been discussed in previously reported literature huang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 pagnanelli et al 2003 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 for simplification empirical formulas were applied in power form for c w ph and s wu et al 2020 furthermore according to previously reported literature f is is assumed to be 1 huang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 in general they do not vary much throughout the erosion process and have a small effect on soil sediment adsorption properties the is ranged from 30 36 to 44 77 ppm in our test finally the p partition coefficient at equilibrium can be expressed according to eq 23 as follows 23 k sd k 1 q max c w m 1 1 ph m 2 s m 3 where k 1 m 1 m 2 and m 3 are empirical parameters 2 3 experimental methods four experimental laboratory runs were carried out at the lab of china agricultural university cau beijing china the soils used for four runs were loam soil from the surface of an orchard run 1 and a vegetable field run 2 in the international seed science and technology park tongzhou district beijing and the surface of wheat fields run 3 and 4 in the hetao experiment station of cau inner mongolia china there were remarkable differences in the median particle size 0 042 mm 0 041 mm 0 015 mm and 0 009 mm but slight differences in the organic matter content 3 19 1 23 1 81 and 1 81 of the four soils to ensure good water permeability a layer of gauze pore size 100 μm was laid on the bottom plate of the soil tank with a 7 cm thick layer of 0 2 0 8 cm particle size sand on top of the gauze another layer of gauze was placed on top of the sand and a 28 cm thick layer of test soil was added with a bulk density of 1 5 g cm3 potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution was applied to the soil at a designed concentration bodi tianjin 99 5 the soil moisture content was controlled at 25 and the filled soil tank was wrapped in plastic film and maintained for one week before the experiment the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a plexiglass cube 160 80 50 cm3 was filled with experimental soil and maintained at a 2 degree inclination under the rainmaker the rainmaker was composed of a needle tube device that could move back and forth at a fixed speed to ensure all topsoil was eroded fig 1 this device generated rainfall with a christiansen uniformity coefficient greater than 80 which was considered to be uniform over the test surface ghazi zadeh hashemi et al 2020 four experiments were conducted at different rainfall rates 12 12 13 and 7 cm h the rainfall intensity was calibrated several times before the experiment to ensure uniformity of rainfall was maintained the duration of artificial rainfall events was 90 120 min and the initial time of runoff exceedance was recorded once runoff yielded runoff outlet flushed with soil level and a plastic bucket was used to collect runoff samples for 1 min durations at regular intervals another plastic bucket was used to simultaneously collect infiltration samples from the bottom of the other side after the rainfall was stopped the runoff and sediment in the plastic bucket were measured to establish the water volume and sediment concentration the water and sediment from each bucket were collected and separated for further experiments within ten minutes to minimize the interaction between p and sediment particles after the rainfall test soil samples were collected at soil tank depths of 0 1 2 3 and 5 cm and then air dried the grain size of soils and sediment was determined using a laser particle size analyzer ms2000 malvern uk water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filter membranes the content of sp was determined using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method the total p content in original soil soils after rainfall and eroded sediment samples i e pp were determined by sulfuric acid perchloric acid digestion and the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method the original soil and eroded sediment samples were analyzed using x ray diffractograms xrd d max rb to determine their mineral composition the ph and ionic strength were also measured before and after the experiment and during the experiment 3 results 3 1 simulated and measured sediment concentration and sediment size classes fig 2 presents the simulated and measured total suspended sediment concentrations established from four experimental runs the erosion of fine particles from the soil and the sediment concentration in runoff increased rapidly in the initial stage then decreased gradually with development of the deposited layer fig 2 these results were consistent with the findings reported by heilig et al 2001 and walker et al 2007 although the results of the present study were obtained using the sum of all s i values the concentrations of each sediment fraction are shown in fig 3a d using the 1 st experimental run run 1 as an example with continued erosion the smallest particle sizes 0 004 mm class entered the runoff most rapidly and exhibited the highest peak concentration the second smallest particle sizes 0 008 mm class exhibited the next highest concentration the coarser particle sizes 0 221 0 581 and 10 181 mm classes exhibited smaller concentrations with less accumulation observed throughout the experimental process fig 3e shows the change in median particle size of the eroded sediment over time the median particle size gradually increased with continued erosion becoming nearly half of the median particle size 0 042 mm of the original soil after 6000 s as reported by heilig et al 2001 soil in the exchange layer became coarser during the experimental period while the percentage abundance of clay and fine silt in the surface layer decreased and the proportion of sand increased compared with the original soil fig 3f the results of the 2 nd experimental run run 2 were similar to those of run 1 the soil particle size of run 3 and run 4 is much finer than that of run 1 and run 2 thus the median particle size of eroded sediment in run 3 and run 4 grows very slowly fig 3e table 1 summarizes the soil erosion model parameters measured and calibrated using laboratory experiments the soil detachability a and the mass per unit area of the deposited layer m dt were obtained by fitting the soil erosion model to the measured sediment concentration data the detachability of the deposited layer a d value was applied according to sander et al 1996 other parameters p f and d w were measured experimentally when solving the equations for soil erosion the time step was set to 1 s the initial concentration of sediment in the runoff was zero and the initial m d i values were also set to zero although the original soil median diameter in run 2 was slightly smaller than that of run 1 the organic matter content 3 19 was higher than in run 1 1 23 resulting in lower soil detachability a in run 2 than run 1 shown in table 1 therefore the concentration of total suspended sediment and sediment fractions in run 2 was slightly less than in run 1 while the ratio of clay and fine silt in the surface soil after rainfall was slightly higher shown in fig 3d the peak sediment concentration and soil detachment a of run 3 and run 4 were much lower than those of run 1 and run 2 because of the higher particle cohesion as obvious caking on the surface was observed after rainfall as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the model accurately simulated the process of changing sediment concentration in runoff the r 2 in run 1 run 2 run 3 and run 4 were between 0 83 and 0 86 while the rmse values were between 0 09 and 1 30 g l the median size of suspended sediment particles was calculated from the sediment gradation at each time point which was difficult to simulate accurately however as shown in fig 3e and table 1 the model is able to simulate the median particle size of the suspended sediment with some degree of accuracy the r 2 of d 50 in four runs were between 0 50 and 0 65 while the rmse values were between 0 83 and 4 61 μm this indicates that the rose based erosion model can accurately describe soil detachment and particle sorting processes during rainfall events 3 2 variations in p partition coefficient for k ed and k sd the maximum adsorption amounts q max for soils and eroded sediment were first determined using the component additivity method the mass percentage of minerals in the original soil and sediment samples were selected from the compared experimental runs and are listed in table 2 showing that the concentrations of kaolin and montmorillonite in eroded sediment samples were slightly larger than in the original soils following this the variation in q max was assessed with particle sizes for soils and sediments calculated using eqs 19 21 an example of the results for soil particles is shown in fig 4 exhibiting the original soil from run 1 for comparison previously reported results from the literature for experimental p adsorption by natural sediments are also shown in fig 4 fang et al 2013 hei et al 2017 hu 2011 li 2005 wang et al 2009 xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 as reported by li et al 2021 the q max of soils sediment exhibited the same trend with increasing particle size as that of minerals with the observed q max response being within the same range as for pure minerals however for natural soils or sediment surface pollutants such as humic acid organic matter and ions may cause a sharper increase in the q max with decreasing particle size than that shown by the red line in fig 4 especially when d 10 μm fig 5 shows the variation in d 50 and κ p in the supplementary sediments during the erosion process from four experimental runs for all runs the κ p values were 1 indicating that the partition coefficient of the supplementary sediment was larger than that of the original soil as the particle size of the eroded sediment supplementing the suspended sediment was much finer than the original soil leading to the enrichment of p in eroded sediments for run 3 and run 4 the particle sizes of the eroded sediment gradually increased and were slightly smaller than the original soil leading to κ p being slightly greater than 1 as time went on the median particle size of supplementary sediments became larger and the κ p became smaller approaching 1 in addition to the effects of median particle size mineral composition and q max on the p partition coefficient of suspended sediment in the runoff changes in the water environmental factors also affect the partition coefficient the extensive literature on p adsorption on soils and sediments was consulted we used a wide range of c w ph s and q max values obtained from eight previously reported studies which were shown in supplementary materials although these samples were fetched from different places they shared some similar characteristics such as low organic content similar conventional mineral composition and specific functional groups on surfaces thus showing similar adsorption characteristics davis et al 1998 the parameters in eq 23 derived from these experimental data were assumed suitable for the natural soils and sediments formed by mineral assemblages and then the least square multiple regression method in the scipy library python software v3 6 7 was used to obtain these empirical parameters the calculated k sd value was in good agreement with the generated experimental values unpublished data see supplementary materials therefore using this model the dynamic partitioning of p between suspended sediment particles and runoff can be estimated using eq 24 as follows 24 k sd 0 8206 q max c w 0 8544 ph 0 4124 s 0 0575 where ph ranged from 7 52 to 7 95 in our test and was set to the average value 7 74 3 3 simulated and measured sp and pp in runoff fig 6 shows the simulated and measured variations in the sp concentration in runoff exhibiting a similar trend to that of sediment concentration within the first 180 to 300 s of the experiment run 1 and run 2 the sp concentration initially increased then decreased sharply before finally stabilizing the sp concentration established during rainfall events in run 1 was higher than that of run 2 in run 1 a low p retention capability and k p value were observed table 3 with the original soil releasing more sp into the water body than run 2 especially in the first 3000 s of rainfall the sp trend of run 3 and run 4 was similar fig 7 shows the simulated and measured variations in the amount of p adsorbed by suspended sand particles in runoff in the early stage of rainfall events p rapidly accumulated on the fine suspended sediment and the adsorption capacity per unit mass of sediment exceeded 700 mg kg before rapidly decreasing and stabilizing thereafter run 2 exhibited a higher p partition coefficient in the original soil and supplementary sediment than run 1 which may be due to the high organic matter content and thus the amount of sediment p adsorption was obviously higher than in run 1 the amounts of sediment p adsorption in run 3 and run 4 were obviously higher than in run 1 because of much finer suspended sediment fig 3e the parameters used for the soil erosion model a a d and m dt were obtained by fitting the measured sediment concentration curve subsequently eqs 4 and 7 were used to obtain the h x t and e t x t values at each time point the soil density and saturated moisture content were measured using traditional methods while k p was derived from the measured sp and pp values in soil before the start of the experiment however the parameters d e and e r 0 cannot be directly measured and require determination through fitting the p transport model to measured sp suspended sediment p adsorption and soil p adsorption values table 3 the governing equations for p transport were solved using the crank nicklson method with the time step to 1 s and the soil vertical distance set to 0 02 cm the initial concentrations of sp and pp in runoff were both 0 while the initial values of soil sp and pp both utilized measured values the bottom boundary condition of eq 8 was set as a symmetric boundary as shown in fig 6 the model accurately estimated the sp concentration in the early stage of the experiment while underestimating these parameters in the later stage of the experiment the underestimation of sp in the later experimental period is likely to mainly be caused by the assumption of constant mixing layer depth tong and ye 2020 the mixing layer depth was reported to shift increasingly downwards with time with a larger mixing layer depth meaning more solute transport from the mixing layer to the runoff layer the level of pp adsorption was accurately simulated throughout the experiments by the model fig 7 as shown in table 3 the r 2 and rmse values of simulated sp concentrations in runoff from four runs ranged from 0 73 to 0 87 and from 0 44 to 0 87 mg l respectively the r 2 and rmse values of simulated pp adsorption from four runs ranged from 0 69 to 0 88 from 70 97 to 134 55 mg kg respectively these values indicated that the p transport model developed in this study could accurately describe the process of soil p transport from soil to runoff as shown in table 3 the d e value ranged between 0 6 and 1 2 cm which is within the same range as the natural soil d e reported by ao et al 2020 the k p k ed and k sd values exerted a greater impact on the model results than d e and e r 0 values the measured k p was used in the model while the k ed value depended on the median particle size of the supplementary sediment and the original soil varying with ongoing erosion figs 6 and 7 also show the changes in runoff sp concentration and sediment p adsorption when k ed k p where it can be seen that if particle gradation was not considered the sp concentration and amount of sediment p adsorption in runoff would be greatly underestimated especially for pp for run 1 the average concentration of sp c w and pp sc sd decreased by 40 8 and 49 1 respectively throughout the whole rainfall event while in run 2 they decreased by 11 5 and 55 0 respectively for run 3 and run 4 the k ed only slightly affects the sp concentration in the early stage 0 800 s because the κ p is much greater than 1 in this stage fig 5 on the contrary the amount of sediment p adsorption in runoff would be greatly underestimated when k ed k p it can be concluded that the k ed values have a large influence on the extent of p transport to runoff in the particulate phase although the k sd values affect the sp and pp concentrations in runoff as well they mainly affect the redistribution of p in the dissolved and particulate phase in the water 3 4 simulated and measured p distribution profile in soil fig 8 shows the simulated and measured levels of pp adsorption in the vertical soil profile after the completion of rainfall event experiments due to the constant partition coefficient k p in the soil layer the distribution profile of sp in soil was similar to that of pp after raindrops impact and infiltrate the exchange layer the amount of sp and pp adsorption in the surface soil layer was lower than in the underlying soil indicating that solute diffusion had occurred from the lower soil to upper soil layers the simulated vertical distribution of soil p was generally consistent with the measured data which also indicates that the simulation of soil p transport to runoff was accurate as shown in fig 8 the level of soil p adsorption in run 1 was about half of that of run 2 as stated above run 1 had a higher sp concentration but lower sediment p adsorption than run 2 figs 6 and 7 which corresponded to higher sp and p adsorption in soil as compared to run 2 this indicates that less p was released to runoff by raindrop impact in run 1 than in run 2 the loss of p in the particulate phase had a higher contribution in run 2 therefore more attention should be paid to controlling pp loss from soil run 3 and run 4 have a higher initial sp concentration but a lower soil detachment and exchange layer depth so they have higher p adsorption in soil than run 1 and run 2 in run 3 and run 4 less p is released into the water and the p below 3 cm is almost not reduced fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 particle gradation in the soil erosion process rainfall induced erosion is a phenomenon in soil erosion affecting the distribution of different particle sizes over time bryan 2000 prats et al 2017 shi et al 2012 this study quantified the change in eroded sediment grain size median particle size as time grew and achieved good results according to the data in the present study the median particle size of suspended sediment increased from about 4 to 23 μm from the onset of rainfall to 7000 s see fig 3d the main reason is that the proportion of fine particles was relatively higher in the early stage while that of coarse particles was slightly higher in the later stage the calculation of the time varying particle size is not common in the previous rainfall induced soil erosion models these models placed high importance on changes in the total concentration of eroded sediments but little attention to sediment size classes ao et al 2020 tao et al 2020 wang et al 2013 furthermore the original rose erosion model considered changes in the distribution of various particle sizes but this key aspect was ignored by some of the simplified rose models heilig et al 2001 therefore our model has been dramatically improved one shortcoming is that the fitting of d 50 in all runs was not very accurate because the determination of the gradation and d 50 was affected by the randomness error of sampling during the experiment therefore our model can be considered successful in quantifying particle gradation and its effects on nutrient transport as validated by the experiments 4 2 the effect of particle gradation on p release to runoff changes in the particle size of eroded sediments have a significant impact on p enrichment in contrast with coarser particle size classes it is widely accepted that finer particles are richer in nutrients such as nitrogen and p palis et al 1990 han et al 2018 hou et al 2021 moreover fine particles are more likely to be transported and accumulated during an erosion event resulting in higher concentrations of p in sediments than in the original soil asadi et al 2011 these mechanisms of changing p concentration with sediment particle size have been comprehensively investigated and applied in river models for example tang et al 2019 found that the concentration of bio p reduced from 40 to 25 mg kg when the median substrate sediment particle size in the three gorges reservoir increased from 6 to 11 μm meng et al 2014 reported that the maximum total p adsorption tq max of surface fine grain sediments 32 μm in the river was nearly sixfold higher than that of surface coarse grain sediments 32 μm however few rainfall induced erosion models consider the sorting effects of sediment particle sizes on p enrichment in this study the ratio of the partition coefficient of p onto supplementary sediment and original soil particles κ p was used to assess the effect of particle size on p enrichment as the eroded sediment supplementing the suspended sediment was much finer than the original soil hao et al 2019 κ p was greater than 1 with ongoing erosion the particle size of the eroded sediment becomes coarser and the q max of natural sediment and minerals decreases with the increase in d 50 li et al 2021 when the particle size composition of the supplementary sediment increases to within a similar range as the original soil there was no longer a significant difference in the capacity for p enrichment between the two resulting in a decrease in κ p from 5 5 to 1 5 see fig 5 additionally if changes in the particle size of supplementary sediment over time are not taken into account κ p 1 the amount of p in runoff may be greatly underestimated especially for pp figs 6 and 7 this effect may be explained by the fact that sediments exert an important effect on p metabolism in aquatic environments serving as both a source and a sink for p młynarczyk et al 2013 when it is assumed that the particle sizes distribution of the supplementary sediment is in a consistent range to the original soil the p adsorbed in the sediment may be seriously underestimated in addition the amount of sp could be affected by the process of pp release resulting in the amount of sp also being underestimated therefore focusing on the change in κ p is of great importance as otherwise analysis will produce a false assessment of the content of p in aquatic ecosystems which is not conducive to the effective control of water pollution 4 3 exchange of p between suspended sediment and runoff after pp and sp detach and diffuse from the exchange layer into the overlying water layer they are redistributed due to adsorption and desorption which is a rather important mode of p migration and transformation within water bodies guedes et al 2016 to better quantify the dynamics of p in aquatic systems wu et al 2020 the p partition coefficient k sd was used k sd is not only affected by the characteristics of the sediment itself but also by the surrounding environmental factors chen et al 2013 chen and fang 2013 huang et al 2012 wu et al 2020 in the present study as erosion developed c w and s exhibited a tendency to rapidly increase to a peak level then decrease and gradually stabilize while d 50 exhibited a gradual increase resulting in k sd initially decreasing rapidly and then gradually flattening as it stabilized data not shown however in addition to abiotic processes p transfer between suspended sediment and runoff involves a series of biotic processes li et al 2021 for example wang et al 2007 found that p adsorption by sediments increased as organic matter increased therefore further research is required in the future taking more environmental biological and ecological factors into consideration to provide a more meaningful reference for practical engineering applications in the treatment of water pollution different measures are usually taken to deal with excess sp and pp treatment of sp often requires chemical precipitation via the addition of metal salts and biological removal via absorption by plants and microorganisms mainstone and parr 2002 while pp treatment requires only physical interception such as barrier straps when the k sd value is smaller this indicates that more p is dissolved in runoff rather than adsorbed in suspended sediments and more effective measures are needed to remove sp therefore the k sd value contributes significantly to the effective management of contaminated sediments in natural rivers huang et al 2015 5 conclusions in this study a novel p transport model was developed by quantifying the enrichment of p in sediment caused by selective erosion and p exchange between solid and liquid phases in runoff the model was based on the erosion and deposition mechanisms of sediment with different particle sizes in the rose model simulating the change in sediment concentration and particle gradation during the erosion process making the model capable of quantifying the influence of sediment characteristics and environmental changes on p transport compared with the conventional model which only considers the fixed soil sediment partition coefficient k p and the ejection rate of soil water the novel model proposed in this study introduced ejected pp flux e t k ed c e and the partition coefficient k ed which vary according to the median particle size this model significantly enhanced the models ability to simulate p enrichment in fine sediments and the transport of sp and pp which affects not only the concentration of pp but also the concentration of sp in soil and runoff the enhanced model capability was validated by the comparison of experimental p loss simulation results to the results generated using the conventional model and the novel enhanced model in addition the variation in p partition coefficient k sd caused over time by eroded sediment characteristics and water environmental factors was also considered in the novel model enhancing the dynamic interactions between sediment particles and p in runoff the simultaneous simulation of sp and pp by the model can provide an effective tool for comprehensive understanding of the transport and fate of surface p the novel enhanced model also had the following limitations 1 when quantifying the maximum amount of p adsorption by soils sediments only six minerals were taken into account and the organic substances with low concentrations but strong activities in natural soil were not accounted for these substances can have a significant influence on the adsorption desorption and chemical behavior of p 2 some parameters in the model such as α d k d s cannot be directly measured experimentally and were determined according to previous literature although they have a certain influence on the model results 3 the model underestimated the concentrations of sp and pp in the later stage of the experiment to a certain extent due to a fixed mixing layer depth being applied this could be overcome by introducing a varying mixing front for the soil exchange layer tong and ye 2020 4 the model well simulated the p transport process in the experimental environment rather than the natural system future research will try to use the model for the natural environment and optimize the parameters funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 52079137 the undergraduate research

3392,phosphorus p transport from soil to surface runoff is of great concern for the accurate prediction of p transport within the watershed while the interaction between p and sediments has rarely been considered in conventional soil solute transport models this study develops a novel p transport model that couples the processes of selective soil erosion and dynamic partitioning of p at the particle water interface the model assumes that the gradation of soil sediment particles strongly affects the maximum amount of adsorption and therefore affects p partitioning while changes in the water environment also influence the partition coefficient the novel model was then validated by four laboratory experimental runs the r 2 and rmse values show that the simulated results are in good agreement with the measured data indicating that the model is capable of effectively simulating rainfall induced p transport from soil to runoff the modelled results indicate that an increase in the coarseness of sediment particles resulted in a sharp decrease in particle p adsorption c sd during erosion therefore if the change in particle size was not accounted for in the model k ed k p the concentrations of soluble phosphorus sp and particulate phosphorus pp would be significantly underestimated this highlights the importance of including selective erosion and p sediment interactions in models of p transport from soils to surface runoff keywords phosphorus transport particle gradation environmental factors partition coefficient exchange layer rainfall induced erosion 1 introduction nutrient loss from soils due to rainfall induced runoff is extremely common not only causing nutrient loss from agricultural land but also leading to eutrophication and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in rivers and reservoirs elser et al 2007 huang et al 2015 in particular the transport of phosphorus p the key limiting factor for eutrophication in rivers and lakes requires further attention fang et al 2017 huang et al 2017 sediment is a major carrier of p and controls the amount of highly available soluble phosphorus sp in waterbodies due to its large specific surface area and high abundance of potential adsorption sites davis and kent 1990 fang et al 2013 therefore developing models to describe the interactions between soil sediment and p is critical for the comprehensive understanding of p transport from soils to runoff numerous dynamic models have been established based on the simulation of physical processes causing chemical migration between soil water and runoff ahuja 1990 ao et al 2020 gao et al 2003 li et al 2017 tong et al 2010 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 1997 chemical transfer models can be generally grouped into two categories mixing layer models and diffusion controlled models gao et al 2004 the mixing layer approach is probably the most commonly adopted for the analysis of chemical transport in soil due to its straightforward conception and easy implementation shi et al 2011 however it has been reported that the conventional soil mixing layer model fails to consider the influence of raindrop impact ahuja et al 1981 steenhuis et al 1994 resulting in a significant underestimation of solute concentrations gao et al 2004 proposed a high fidelity soil solute transport model including adsorbed and non adsorbed substances by coupling the ejection of soil water by raindrop impacts and the diffusion of solutes to resolve this problem the model was then further developed for example the new concept of downward development of mixed layer thickness with time tong and ye 2020 consideration of time varying parameters such as rainfall induced water transfer rate and infiltration rate ao et al 2020 and data assimilation methods for calibration model parameters meng et al 2021 these improvements have greatly enhanced our understanding of the physical mechanisms of solute transport especially for non adsorbed substances however most models describe its transport more simply for the adsorbed substance p similar to the gao model these models only use constant adsorption coefficients to express adsorbed p kang et al 2011 tao et al 2017 tao et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the description of p dynamics with sediment and how sediment gradation affects adsorption was missing as an important physical property of sediments particle gradation is a highly significant factor that should be considered in analyzing sediment erosion transport accumulation and riverbed evolution zhang et al 2020 during the soil erosion process fine particles tend to be dislodged and transported early while coarse particles are dislodged in later stages of erosion those fine sediment particles have relatively small settling velocities they can be carried away by runoff over long distances so in the initial stages of an erosion event finer particles contribute more to the concentration of eroded sediment hairsine and rose 1991 aksoy and kavvas 2005 while p has been reported to be mainly associated with finer particles there are marked differences in the p adsorption capacity of coarse and fine particles meng et al 2014 wang et al 2021 therefore the impact of varying particle size on p migration is essential to accurately reflect variations in p concentrations in the runoff with varying suspended sediment particle sizes and characteristics in addition to sediment particle gradation the mineral composition particle concentration and water characteristics significantly influence the interactions between p and sediments cui et al 2017 fang et al 2017 wang et al 2005 many water quality models utilize empirical relationships such as linear partition coefficient k sd values to characterize the adsorption and desorption of p by soils and sediments gao et al 2004 mcgechan and lewis 2002 however the k sd in the actual dynamic process differs significantly from under isothermal adsorption conditions due to temporal and spatial variations in water chemistry davis et al 2004 rainfall induced p loss is often accompanied by strong soil erosion sedimentation and large variations in solute concentrations in runoff under these conditions the partition of p varies with environmental conditions making it unreasonable to replace the k sd value in natural waterbodies with the coefficient value under ideal experimental conditions therefore quantification of k sd is necessary to reduce uncertainty in the simulation of p transport in this study to better understand the transport mechanism of p from soil to runoff a novel p transport model with soil erosion was developed by incorporating the process of selective erosion of soil and dynamic partition of p between particles and water sediment gradation as well as the variability of sp and particulate phosphorus pp concentrations were modeled and investigated two laboratory experimental runs were conducted for model validation the objectives of this study were 1 to validate the proposed novel p transport model using laboratory experiments 2 to quantify the effect of particle gradation on p enrichment during erosion and 3 to establish the impacts of particle properties and environmental factors on p dynamic partitioning in runoff 2 methodologies 2 1 numerical models the proposed model comprised a soil erosion model and p transport model which was developed based on the rose model hairsine and rose 1991 and gao model gao et al 2004 to describe the selective erosion of soil sediment particles and their effect on p transport between the exchange layer and runoff a conceptual schematic of the model is shown in fig 1 with the soil water system divided into three horizontal layers runoff an exchange layer or deposited layer and the underlying soil layer 2 1 1 soil erosion model the rose model was proposed by hairsine and rose 1991 to simulate the raindrop induced erosion process in the absence of entrainment by shallow overland flow the model assumes that fine particles can be transported with runoff leaving coarser particles in the deposited layer during raindrop erosion events the model considers the separate contributions of individual particle size classes to the total suspended sediment concentration sander et al 1996 presented separate coupled conservation equations for the suspended sediment concentration s i x t and the mass of particles in the deposited layer m d i x t for each particle size class i as shown in eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1 d w s i t qs i x ap i 1 h a d p m d i m dt h ω i s i i 1 2 i and 2 d m d i d

respectively g cm3 and g cm2 d w indicates the ponding water depth cm q indicates the volumetric runoff flux per unit width cm2 s p indicates the rainfall rate cm s a indicates soil detachability g cm3 a d indicates the detachability of the deposited layer g cm3 using a d κ a a with κ a being a correction factor for the detachability of the deposited layer ω i indicates the settling velocity for each particle size class i cm s i indicates the total number of classes t indicates time s and x indicates the horizontal dimension cm in particular the total mass of sediment in the deposited layer m dt and the degree of soil shielding h are taken from previously reported literature heilig et al 2001 sander et al 1996 as shown in eqs 3 and 4 as follows 3 m dt x t i 1 i m di x t 4 h x t m dt x t m dt where m dt indicates the mass per unit area of sediment necessary for complete effective shielding g cm2 in the case of shallow kinematic overland flow d w and q are governed by eq 5 as follows 5 d w t q x p f where f indicates the infiltration rate in the soil cm s substituting eq 5 into eq 1 and assuming low slopes and low water flow velocities obtains eq 6 as follows 6 d w d s i d t ap i 1 h a d p m d i m dt h ω i s i p f s i i 1 2 i eq 6 and eq 2 form a system of n n 2 i linear ordinary differential equations for the determination of n unknowns s i x t and m d i x t the coupled equations can be numerically solved using the crank nicklson method applying an initial condition s i 0 and m d i 0 at t 0 subsequently the fraction sizes of the suspended sediment and deposited sediment are to be determined assouline 2006 reported that the bulk density of soil increased exponentially during rainfall while the amount of soil splash gradually decreased therefore the raindrop detachment rate can be assumed to decrease exponentially with the rainfall time ao et al 2020 with the raindrop induced soil detachment rate e t x t then obtained by summing the terms on the right hand side of eq 1 across all i as shown in eq 7 7 e t x t i 1 i e i x t i 1 i ap i 1 h a d p m d i m dt h ω i s i if e i x t exceeds 0 the eroded sediment particles supplement the suspended sediment while otherwise no sediment supplements the suspended sediment the percentage abundance of different particle grain sizes in the supplementary sediment can be calculated statistically based on the e i x t values that exceed 0 2 1 2 phosphorus transport model based on the gao model gao et al 2004 p transport within the soil profile can be described using the advection diffusion equation as shown in eq 8 8 α c s t f c s z z d s c s z where c s indicates the soil water concentration below the exchange layer mg l z indicates the vertical dimension cm d s indicates the diffusion constant of p in the soil cm2 s and equals to the sum of molecular diffusivity and mechanical dispersivity α ρ b k p θ ρ b indicates the dry bulk density g cm3 k p indicates a constant partition coefficient for p onto soil sediment particles l kg and θ indicates the soil moisture p transport in the exchange layer is controlled by diffusion raindrop driven exchange and infiltration which can be described according to eq 9 as follows 9 α d e d c e d t d s c s z e rt λ c w c e f c w c e e t k ed c e where d e and c e indicate the depth and solution concentration of the exchange layer cm and mg l c w indicates the solute concentration in runoff water mg l λ indicates the ratio of runoff entering the exchange layer which is assumed to be 1 in gao s model e rt indicates the rate of soil water ejected into the runoff at time t cm s k ed indicates the partition coefficient of p onto supplementary sediment l kg in gao s model the e rt value remains constant at a given rain intensity however xia and tong 2016 suggested that the e rt value may be modified by eq 10 as follows as the residual water ejection rate persists after the soil deposited layer is completely formed 10 e rt x t ap θ ρ b 1 h e r 0 where e r 0 indicates the residual soil water ejection rate cm s it is of note that the sediment eroded into runoff also carries p and reduces the solute concentration of p in the exchange layer therefore the term e t k ed c e can be introduced into eq 9 describing pp erosion from the exchange layer in the runoff layer two separate governing equations can be used for p in water and the suspended sediment allowing consideration of dynamic p partitioning between the water phase and the solid phase by not accounting for the sediment diffusion term the mass conservation of sp and pp carried by the sediment in the runoff is expressed according to eqs 11 and 12 as follows 11 d w c w t qc w x e rt c e λ c w fc w d w sk k sd c w c sd 12 d w sc sd t qsc sd x d w sk k sd c w c sd e t k ed c e where c sd is the amount of p bound to suspended sediment particles mg kg s is the sediment concentration based on a sum of s i across all classes of i g cm3 k is the p desorption rate from sediments s 1 huang et al 2015 huang et al 2017 and k sd is the partition coefficient of p onto suspended sediment particles l kg which varies with the erosion process the last term of eq 11 d w sk k sd c w c sd represents the adsorption flux of p onto suspended sediment particles from water following the law of first order kinetics substituting eq 5 into eq 11 and eqs 6 and 7 into eq 12 gives eqs 13 and 14 as follows 13 d w d c w d t e rt c e λ c w pc w d w sk k sd c w c sd and 14 d w s d c sd d t d w sk k sd c w c sd e t k ed c e c sd 2 2 quantitation of interactions between p and sediment sediment particles exhibit a strong affinity to pollutants due to their high specific surface area and abundance of active surface sites davis and kent 1990 wang et al 2009 the p in water tends to be adsorbed by sediment particles moving from the particulate phase to the dissolved phase withers and jarvie 2008 the partition coefficient k d has been widely used to characterize the capability of sediments to retain p galunin et al 2014 as shown in eq 15 15 k d q e c w where q e is the amount of p adsorbed by sediments at equilibrium mg kg p adsorption by sediment particles depends on intrinsic sediment factors which determine the maximum amount of p adsorption as well as on environmental factors that affect how much p can be adsorbed by sediment particles in aquatic environments huang et al 2017 li et al 2021 the equation used to estimate the amount of p adsorption by sediment particles is described in eq 16 as follows 16 q e q max f environmental factors where q max is the maximum amount of p adsorbed by the sediment mg kg and f environmental factors is a function of environmental factors therefore the partition coefficient of p onto sediment particles was determined by the characteristic of sediment themselves and the aquatic environment as shown in eq 17 17 k d q max f environmental factors c w 2 2 1 partition coefficient of p onto supplementary sediment during erosion fine particles are eroded from the original soil matrix to runoff transferring to the suspended sediment these particles have a smaller size and larger specific surface area enhancing the maximum potentially adsorbed amount as compared to the original soils therefore it may be assumed that the environment surrounding these fine particles at the moment of erosion is the same as that of the soil in the exchange layer therefore following eq 17 a correction factor can be established using eq 18 as follows 18 κ p k ed k p q max sup q max soil where q max sup and q max soil are the maximum adsorbed amount of p onto the supplementary sediment and the original soil mg kg in order to avoid the need for batch equilibrium adsorption experiments to obtain the maximum adsorbed amount the method of calculating q max proposed by fang et al 2017 and li et al 2021 was adopted sediment is treated as an assemblage of major minerals and therefore the maximum adsorption amount can be determined using the component additivity method davis et al 1998 as shown in eq 19 as follows 19 q max j 1 n p j q max j where p j and q max j represent the mass percentage and maximum adsorption amount of the j th mineral and mg kg respectively li et al 2021 experimentally derived a correlation between the q max of each mineral and the comprehensive factor c which can be described using eq 20 as follows 20 q max j 5 02 c j 0 02 where c j is the comprehensive factor of the j th mineral for each mineral 21 c d 50 n s f 2 a n s ρ 2 d 50 1 85 f 2 a 0 60 where d 50 is the median particle size m n s indicates the surface active site density determined using crystallographic characterization site m2 f 2 a indicates an average morphology descriptor calculated from the sem images that indicate the degree of heterogeneity or roughness of particle surfaces and ρ indicates the particle density further details are provided in fang et al 2017 and li et al 2021 once the mineral composition and the median particle size of the sediment sample have been established the maximum adsorbed amount of each mineral is calculated according to the measured particle size groups using eqs 20 and 21 allowing the maximum adsorbed amount of a sample to be obtained using eq 19 2 2 2 partition coefficient of p onto suspended sediment the partition of p onto the suspended sediment is more complicated than partitioning in soil matrices with continued erosion rapid and continual variation occurs in the sediment and surrounding environmental factors such as median particle size d 50 sediment concentration s and solute concentration c w the effect of particle size is evaluated in terms of q max using eqs 19 21 the effects of extrinsic factors can be regarded as individual functions of environmental factors as shown in eq 22 with the major factors including c w ph ionic strength is and s 22 f environmental factors f c w f ph f is f s the influence of these factors has been discussed in previously reported literature huang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 pagnanelli et al 2003 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 for simplification empirical formulas were applied in power form for c w ph and s wu et al 2020 furthermore according to previously reported literature f is is assumed to be 1 huang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 in general they do not vary much throughout the erosion process and have a small effect on soil sediment adsorption properties the is ranged from 30 36 to 44 77 ppm in our test finally the p partition coefficient at equilibrium can be expressed according to eq 23 as follows 23 k sd k 1 q max c w m 1 1 ph m 2 s m 3 where k 1 m 1 m 2 and m 3 are empirical parameters 2 3 experimental methods four experimental laboratory runs were carried out at the lab of china agricultural university cau beijing china the soils used for four runs were loam soil from the surface of an orchard run 1 and a vegetable field run 2 in the international seed science and technology park tongzhou district beijing and the surface of wheat fields run 3 and 4 in the hetao experiment station of cau inner mongolia china there were remarkable differences in the median particle size 0 042 mm 0 041 mm 0 015 mm and 0 009 mm but slight differences in the organic matter content 3 19 1 23 1 81 and 1 81 of the four soils to ensure good water permeability a layer of gauze pore size 100 μm was laid on the bottom plate of the soil tank with a 7 cm thick layer of 0 2 0 8 cm particle size sand on top of the gauze another layer of gauze was placed on top of the sand and a 28 cm thick layer of test soil was added with a bulk density of 1 5 g cm3 potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution was applied to the soil at a designed concentration bodi tianjin 99 5 the soil moisture content was controlled at 25 and the filled soil tank was wrapped in plastic film and maintained for one week before the experiment the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a plexiglass cube 160 80 50 cm3 was filled with experimental soil and maintained at a 2 degree inclination under the rainmaker the rainmaker was composed of a needle tube device that could move back and forth at a fixed speed to ensure all topsoil was eroded fig 1 this device generated rainfall with a christiansen uniformity coefficient greater than 80 which was considered to be uniform over the test surface ghazi zadeh hashemi et al 2020 four experiments were conducted at different rainfall rates 12 12 13 and 7 cm h the rainfall intensity was calibrated several times before the experiment to ensure uniformity of rainfall was maintained the duration of artificial rainfall events was 90 120 min and the initial time of runoff exceedance was recorded once runoff yielded runoff outlet flushed with soil level and a plastic bucket was used to collect runoff samples for 1 min durations at regular intervals another plastic bucket was used to simultaneously collect infiltration samples from the bottom of the other side after the rainfall was stopped the runoff and sediment in the plastic bucket were measured to establish the water volume and sediment concentration the water and sediment from each bucket were collected and separated for further experiments within ten minutes to minimize the interaction between p and sediment particles after the rainfall test soil samples were collected at soil tank depths of 0 1 2 3 and 5 cm and then air dried the grain size of soils and sediment was determined using a laser particle size analyzer ms2000 malvern uk water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filter membranes the content of sp was determined using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method the total p content in original soil soils after rainfall and eroded sediment samples i e pp were determined by sulfuric acid perchloric acid digestion and the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method the original soil and eroded sediment samples were analyzed using x ray diffractograms xrd d max rb to determine their mineral composition the ph and ionic strength were also measured before and after the experiment and during the experiment 3 results 3 1 simulated and measured sediment concentration and sediment size classes fig 2 presents the simulated and measured total suspended sediment concentrations established from four experimental runs the erosion of fine particles from the soil and the sediment concentration in runoff increased rapidly in the initial stage then decreased gradually with development of the deposited layer fig 2 these results were consistent with the findings reported by heilig et al 2001 and walker et al 2007 although the results of the present study were obtained using the sum of all s i values the concentrations of each sediment fraction are shown in fig 3a d using the 1 st experimental run run 1 as an example with continued erosion the smallest particle sizes 0 004 mm class entered the runoff most rapidly and exhibited the highest peak concentration the second smallest particle sizes 0 008 mm class exhibited the next highest concentration the coarser particle sizes 0 221 0 581 and 10 181 mm classes exhibited smaller concentrations with less accumulation observed throughout the experimental process fig 3e shows the change in median particle size of the eroded sediment over time the median particle size gradually increased with continued erosion becoming nearly half of the median particle size 0 042 mm of the original soil after 6000 s as reported by heilig et al 2001 soil in the exchange layer became coarser during the experimental period while the percentage abundance of clay and fine silt in the surface layer decreased and the proportion of sand increased compared with the original soil fig 3f the results of the 2 nd experimental run run 2 were similar to those of run 1 the soil particle size of run 3 and run 4 is much finer than that of run 1 and run 2 thus the median particle size of eroded sediment in run 3 and run 4 grows very slowly fig 3e table 1 summarizes the soil erosion model parameters measured and calibrated using laboratory experiments the soil detachability a and the mass per unit area of the deposited layer m dt were obtained by fitting the soil erosion model to the measured sediment concentration data the detachability of the deposited layer a d value was applied according to sander et al 1996 other parameters p f and d w were measured experimentally when solving the equations for soil erosion the time step was set to 1 s the initial concentration of sediment in the runoff was zero and the initial m d i values were also set to zero although the original soil median diameter in run 2 was slightly smaller than that of run 1 the organic matter content 3 19 was higher than in run 1 1 23 resulting in lower soil detachability a in run 2 than run 1 shown in table 1 therefore the concentration of total suspended sediment and sediment fractions in run 2 was slightly less than in run 1 while the ratio of clay and fine silt in the surface soil after rainfall was slightly higher shown in fig 3d the peak sediment concentration and soil detachment a of run 3 and run 4 were much lower than those of run 1 and run 2 because of the higher particle cohesion as obvious caking on the surface was observed after rainfall as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the model accurately simulated the process of changing sediment concentration in runoff the r 2 in run 1 run 2 run 3 and run 4 were between 0 83 and 0 86 while the rmse values were between 0 09 and 1 30 g l the median size of suspended sediment particles was calculated from the sediment gradation at each time point which was difficult to simulate accurately however as shown in fig 3e and table 1 the model is able to simulate the median particle size of the suspended sediment with some degree of accuracy the r 2 of d 50 in four runs were between 0 50 and 0 65 while the rmse values were between 0 83 and 4 61 μm this indicates that the rose based erosion model can accurately describe soil detachment and particle sorting processes during rainfall events 3 2 variations in p partition coefficient for k ed and k sd the maximum adsorption amounts q max for soils and eroded sediment were first determined using the component additivity method the mass percentage of minerals in the original soil and sediment samples were selected from the compared experimental runs and are listed in table 2 showing that the concentrations of kaolin and montmorillonite in eroded sediment samples were slightly larger than in the original soils following this the variation in q max was assessed with particle sizes for soils and sediments calculated using eqs 19 21 an example of the results for soil particles is shown in fig 4 exhibiting the original soil from run 1 for comparison previously reported results from the literature for experimental p adsorption by natural sediments are also shown in fig 4 fang et al 2013 hei et al 2017 hu 2011 li 2005 wang et al 2009 xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 as reported by li et al 2021 the q max of soils sediment exhibited the same trend with increasing particle size as that of minerals with the observed q max response being within the same range as for pure minerals however for natural soils or sediment surface pollutants such as humic acid organic matter and ions may cause a sharper increase in the q max with decreasing particle size than that shown by the red line in fig 4 especially when d 10 μm fig 5 shows the variation in d 50 and κ p in the supplementary sediments during the erosion process from four experimental runs for all runs the κ p values were 1 indicating that the partition coefficient of the supplementary sediment was larger than that of the original soil as the particle size of the eroded sediment supplementing the suspended sediment was much finer than the original soil leading to the enrichment of p in eroded sediments for run 3 and run 4 the particle sizes of the eroded sediment gradually increased and were slightly smaller than the original soil leading to κ p being slightly greater than 1 as time went on the median particle size of supplementary sediments became larger and the κ p became smaller approaching 1 in addition to the effects of median particle size mineral composition and q max on the p partition coefficient of suspended sediment in the runoff changes in the water environmental factors also affect the partition coefficient the extensive literature on p adsorption on soils and sediments was consulted we used a wide range of c w ph s and q max values obtained from eight previously reported studies which were shown in supplementary materials although these samples were fetched from different places they shared some similar characteristics such as low organic content similar conventional mineral composition and specific functional groups on surfaces thus showing similar adsorption characteristics davis et al 1998 the parameters in eq 23 derived from these experimental data were assumed suitable for the natural soils and sediments formed by mineral assemblages and then the least square multiple regression method in the scipy library python software v3 6 7 was used to obtain these empirical parameters the calculated k sd value was in good agreement with the generated experimental values unpublished data see supplementary materials therefore using this model the dynamic partitioning of p between suspended sediment particles and runoff can be estimated using eq 24 as follows 24 k sd 0 8206 q max c w 0 8544 ph 0 4124 s 0 0575 where ph ranged from 7 52 to 7 95 in our test and was set to the average value 7 74 3 3 simulated and measured sp and pp in runoff fig 6 shows the simulated and measured variations in the sp concentration in runoff exhibiting a similar trend to that of sediment concentration within the first 180 to 300 s of the experiment run 1 and run 2 the sp concentration initially increased then decreased sharply before finally stabilizing the sp concentration established during rainfall events in run 1 was higher than that of run 2 in run 1 a low p retention capability and k p value were observed table 3 with the original soil releasing more sp into the water body than run 2 especially in the first 3000 s of rainfall the sp trend of run 3 and run 4 was similar fig 7 shows the simulated and measured variations in the amount of p adsorbed by suspended sand particles in runoff in the early stage of rainfall events p rapidly accumulated on the fine suspended sediment and the adsorption capacity per unit mass of sediment exceeded 700 mg kg before rapidly decreasing and stabilizing thereafter run 2 exhibited a higher p partition coefficient in the original soil and supplementary sediment than run 1 which may be due to the high organic matter content and thus the amount of sediment p adsorption was obviously higher than in run 1 the amounts of sediment p adsorption in run 3 and run 4 were obviously higher than in run 1 because of much finer suspended sediment fig 3e the parameters used for the soil erosion model a a d and m dt were obtained by fitting the measured sediment concentration curve subsequently eqs 4 and 7 were used to obtain the h x t and e t x t values at each time point the soil density and saturated moisture content were measured using traditional methods while k p was derived from the measured sp and pp values in soil before the start of the experiment however the parameters d e and e r 0 cannot be directly measured and require determination through fitting the p transport model to measured sp suspended sediment p adsorption and soil p adsorption values table 3 the governing equations for p transport were solved using the crank nicklson method with the time step to 1 s and the soil vertical distance set to 0 02 cm the initial concentrations of sp and pp in runoff were both 0 while the initial values of soil sp and pp both utilized measured values the bottom boundary condition of eq 8 was set as a symmetric boundary as shown in fig 6 the model accurately estimated the sp concentration in the early stage of the experiment while underestimating these parameters in the later stage of the experiment the underestimation of sp in the later experimental period is likely to mainly be caused by the assumption of constant mixing layer depth tong and ye 2020 the mixing layer depth was reported to shift increasingly downwards with time with a larger mixing layer depth meaning more solute transport from the mixing layer to the runoff layer the level of pp adsorption was accurately simulated throughout the experiments by the model fig 7 as shown in table 3 the r 2 and rmse values of simulated sp concentrations in runoff from four runs ranged from 0 73 to 0 87 and from 0 44 to 0 87 mg l respectively the r 2 and rmse values of simulated pp adsorption from four runs ranged from 0 69 to 0 88 from 70 97 to 134 55 mg kg respectively these values indicated that the p transport model developed in this study could accurately describe the process of soil p transport from soil to runoff as shown in table 3 the d e value ranged between 0 6 and 1 2 cm which is within the same range as the natural soil d e reported by ao et al 2020 the k p k ed and k sd values exerted a greater impact on the model results than d e and e r 0 values the measured k p was used in the model while the k ed value depended on the median particle size of the supplementary sediment and the original soil varying with ongoing erosion figs 6 and 7 also show the changes in runoff sp concentration and sediment p adsorption when k ed k p where it can be seen that if particle gradation was not considered the sp concentration and amount of sediment p adsorption in runoff would be greatly underestimated especially for pp for run 1 the average concentration of sp c w and pp sc sd decreased by 40 8 and 49 1 respectively throughout the whole rainfall event while in run 2 they decreased by 11 5 and 55 0 respectively for run 3 and run 4 the k ed only slightly affects the sp concentration in the early stage 0 800 s because the κ p is much greater than 1 in this stage fig 5 on the contrary the amount of sediment p adsorption in runoff would be greatly underestimated when k ed k p it can be concluded that the k ed values have a large influence on the extent of p transport to runoff in the particulate phase although the k sd values affect the sp and pp concentrations in runoff as well they mainly affect the redistribution of p in the dissolved and particulate phase in the water 3 4 simulated and measured p distribution profile in soil fig 8 shows the simulated and measured levels of pp adsorption in the vertical soil profile after the completion of rainfall event experiments due to the constant partition coefficient k p in the soil layer the distribution profile of sp in soil was similar to that of pp after raindrops impact and infiltrate the exchange layer the amount of sp and pp adsorption in the surface soil layer was lower than in the underlying soil indicating that solute diffusion had occurred from the lower soil to upper soil layers the simulated vertical distribution of soil p was generally consistent with the measured data which also indicates that the simulation of soil p transport to runoff was accurate as shown in fig 8 the level of soil p adsorption in run 1 was about half of that of run 2 as stated above run 1 had a higher sp concentration but lower sediment p adsorption than run 2 figs 6 and 7 which corresponded to higher sp and p adsorption in soil as compared to run 2 this indicates that less p was released to runoff by raindrop impact in run 1 than in run 2 the loss of p in the particulate phase had a higher contribution in run 2 therefore more attention should be paid to controlling pp loss from soil run 3 and run 4 have a higher initial sp concentration but a lower soil detachment and exchange layer depth so they have higher p adsorption in soil than run 1 and run 2 in run 3 and run 4 less p is released into the water and the p below 3 cm is almost not reduced fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 particle gradation in the soil erosion process rainfall induced erosion is a phenomenon in soil erosion affecting the distribution of different particle sizes over time bryan 2000 prats et al 2017 shi et al 2012 this study quantified the change in eroded sediment grain size median particle size as time grew and achieved good results according to the data in the present study the median particle size of suspended sediment increased from about 4 to 23 μm from the onset of rainfall to 7000 s see fig 3d the main reason is that the proportion of fine particles was relatively higher in the early stage while that of coarse particles was slightly higher in the later stage the calculation of the time varying particle size is not common in the previous rainfall induced soil erosion models these models placed high importance on changes in the total concentration of eroded sediments but little attention to sediment size classes ao et al 2020 tao et al 2020 wang et al 2013 furthermore the original rose erosion model considered changes in the distribution of various particle sizes but this key aspect was ignored by some of the simplified rose models heilig et al 2001 therefore our model has been dramatically improved one shortcoming is that the fitting of d 50 in all runs was not very accurate because the determination of the gradation and d 50 was affected by the randomness error of sampling during the experiment therefore our model can be considered successful in quantifying particle gradation and its effects on nutrient transport as validated by the experiments 4 2 the effect of particle gradation on p release to runoff changes in the particle size of eroded sediments have a significant impact on p enrichment in contrast with coarser particle size classes it is widely accepted that finer particles are richer in nutrients such as nitrogen and p palis et al 1990 han et al 2018 hou et al 2021 moreover fine particles are more likely to be transported and accumulated during an erosion event resulting in higher concentrations of p in sediments than in the original soil asadi et al 2011 these mechanisms of changing p concentration with sediment particle size have been comprehensively investigated and applied in river models for example tang et al 2019 found that the concentration of bio p reduced from 40 to 25 mg kg when the median substrate sediment particle size in the three gorges reservoir increased from 6 to 11 μm meng et al 2014 reported that the maximum total p adsorption tq max of surface fine grain sediments 32 μm in the river was nearly sixfold higher than that of surface coarse grain sediments 32 μm however few rainfall induced erosion models consider the sorting effects of sediment particle sizes on p enrichment in this study the ratio of the partition coefficient of p onto supplementary sediment and original soil particles κ p was used to assess the effect of particle size on p enrichment as the eroded sediment supplementing the suspended sediment was much finer than the original soil hao et al 2019 κ p was greater than 1 with ongoing erosion the particle size of the eroded sediment becomes coarser and the q max of natural sediment and minerals decreases with the increase in d 50 li et al 2021 when the particle size composition of the supplementary sediment increases to within a similar range as the original soil there was no longer a significant difference in the capacity for p enrichment between the two resulting in a decrease in κ p from 5 5 to 1 5 see fig 5 additionally if changes in the particle size of supplementary sediment over time are not taken into account κ p 1 the amount of p in runoff may be greatly underestimated especially for pp figs 6 and 7 this effect may be explained by the fact that sediments exert an important effect on p metabolism in aquatic environments serving as both a source and a sink for p młynarczyk et al 2013 when it is assumed that the particle sizes distribution of the supplementary sediment is in a consistent range to the original soil the p adsorbed in the sediment may be seriously underestimated in addition the amount of sp could be affected by the process of pp release resulting in the amount of sp also being underestimated therefore focusing on the change in κ p is of great importance as otherwise analysis will produce a false assessment of the content of p in aquatic ecosystems which is not conducive to the effective control of water pollution 4 3 exchange of p between suspended sediment and runoff after pp and sp detach and diffuse from the exchange layer into the overlying water layer they are redistributed due to adsorption and desorption which is a rather important mode of p migration and transformation within water bodies guedes et al 2016 to better quantify the dynamics of p in aquatic systems wu et al 2020 the p partition coefficient k sd was used k sd is not only affected by the characteristics of the sediment itself but also by the surrounding environmental factors chen et al 2013 chen and fang 2013 huang et al 2012 wu et al 2020 in the present study as erosion developed c w and s exhibited a tendency to rapidly increase to a peak level then decrease and gradually stabilize while d 50 exhibited a gradual increase resulting in k sd initially decreasing rapidly and then gradually flattening as it stabilized data not shown however in addition to abiotic processes p transfer between suspended sediment and runoff involves a series of biotic processes li et al 2021 for example wang et al 2007 found that p adsorption by sediments increased as organic matter increased therefore further research is required in the future taking more environmental biological and ecological factors into consideration to provide a more meaningful reference for practical engineering applications in the treatment of water pollution different measures are usually taken to deal with excess sp and pp treatment of sp often requires chemical precipitation via the addition of metal salts and biological removal via absorption by plants and microorganisms mainstone and parr 2002 while pp treatment requires only physical interception such as barrier straps when the k sd value is smaller this indicates that more p is dissolved in runoff rather than adsorbed in suspended sediments and more effective measures are needed to remove sp therefore the k sd value contributes significantly to the effective management of contaminated sediments in natural rivers huang et al 2015 5 conclusions in this study a novel p transport model was developed by quantifying the enrichment of p in sediment caused by selective erosion and p exchange between solid and liquid phases in runoff the model was based on the erosion and deposition mechanisms of sediment with different particle sizes in the rose model simulating the change in sediment concentration and particle gradation during the erosion process making the model capable of quantifying the influence of sediment characteristics and environmental changes on p transport compared with the conventional model which only considers the fixed soil sediment partition coefficient k p and the ejection rate of soil water the novel model proposed in this study introduced ejected pp flux e t k ed c e and the partition coefficient k ed which vary according to the median particle size this model significantly enhanced the models ability to simulate p enrichment in fine sediments and the transport of sp and pp which affects not only the concentration of pp but also the concentration of sp in soil and runoff the enhanced model capability was validated by the comparison of experimental p loss simulation results to the results generated using the conventional model and the novel enhanced model in addition the variation in p partition coefficient k sd caused over time by eroded sediment characteristics and water environmental factors was also considered in the novel model enhancing the dynamic interactions between sediment particles and p in runoff the simultaneous simulation of sp and pp by the model can provide an effective tool for comprehensive understanding of the transport and fate of surface p the novel enhanced model also had the following limitations 1 when quantifying the maximum amount of p adsorption by soils sediments only six minerals were taken into account and the organic substances with low concentrations but strong activities in natural soil were not accounted for these substances can have a significant influence on the adsorption desorption and chemical behavior of p 2 some parameters in the model such as α d k d s cannot be directly measured experimentally and were determined according to previous literature although they have a certain influence on the model results 3 the model underestimated the concentrations of sp and pp in the later stage of the experiment to a certain extent due to a fixed mixing layer depth being applied this could be overcome by introducing a varying mixing front for the soil exchange layer tong and ye 2020 4 the model well simulated the p transport process in the experimental environment rather than the natural system future research will try to use the model for the natural environment and optimize the parameters funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 52079137 the undergraduate research

cascade reservoirs is important for extending the life of reservoirs the objective of this paper is to provide a sound scientific approach to optimize the water sediment operation of cascade reservoirs considering multiple objectives an innovative time dependent objective function was proposed in which the sediment release efficiency equations suitable for different sediment inflow scenarios were introduced for sediment flushing calculation the sanmenxia smx and xiaolangdi xld reservoirs on the yellow river were selected as case studies to test the proposed method first two

large scale reservoir group in the sediment laden basins keywords multi objective water sediment optimal operation cascade reservoirs hydropower generation sediment flushing the yellow river basin 1 introduction water resources are important in human production and activities such as water supply flood control and power generation niu and feng 2021 qiu et al 2021 xia et al 2016 xu and milliman 2009 yang et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 in addition human activities that include reservoir construction sediment mining and water diversion and drainage also have a profound impact on the natural rivers especially on sediment laden rivers which complicates the relationship between water and sediment xu 2011 kiss and blanka 2012 bi et al 2019 he 2019 peng et al 2010 sediment deposition is a serious problem for sediment laden rivers that can detrimentally affect the future economic and ecological development of basins hauer et al 2018 with the construction of reservoirs and barrages on sediment laden rivers the downstream transport of sediment is gradually reduced and most of sediment is deposited in upstream reservoirs walling and fang 2003 therefore reservoirs on sediment laden rivers gradually fill with sediment which weakens the water storage function of reservoirs and reduces the hydropower navigation and water supply benefits nicklow and mays 2000 rashid et al 2015 miao et al 2016 li et al 2017 many sediment laden rivers globally are affected by reservoir sedimentation since the reservoir construction has disrupted the original water sediment balance in rivers yu et al 2013 in egypt the storage capacity of the aswan high dam on the nile river was reduced by approximately 12 from 1964 to 2013 due to sediment deposition the morphology change of the reservoir and river channel has hindered navigation and reduced the flood discharge capacity of the nile river ahmed and abdelbary 2004 el shazli and hoermann 2016 in the united states as of 2016 24 reservoirs on rivers in the state of kansas have collectively lost approximately 17 of their original storage capacity with the highest loss of 45 for a single reservoir which has created pressure on water supply and reservoir management rahmani et al 2018 in india the hirakud reservoir on the mahanadi river had lost approximately 22 of its storage capacity due to sedimentation by 2007 this loss has reduced the reservoir s water storage capacity increased risk of flooding and hindered reservoir operation dutta and sen 2016 in china the high sediment load and continuous human activities have exacerbated the overloaded relationship between water and sediment in the yellow river during the first 18 months of the operation of the sanmenxia reservoir on the yellow river 93 of the incoming sediment was deposited in the reservoir accounting for 17 of total storage capacity 9 64 10 9 m3 the deposited sediment has seriously reduced the flood control irrigation and hydropower generation benefits of the reservoir wang et al 2005 water sediment regulation as an effective way to sustain the long term useful life of reservoirs and remediate the water sediment relationship of sediment laden rivers has received worldwide attention nicklow and mays 2000 hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 rashid et al 2014 jin et al 2019 the water sediment operation in basins often involves multiple reservoirs and objectives hence a multi objective operation model of cascade reservoirs has been considered by many researchers for example rashid et al 2015 developed a multi objective operation model for multiple reservoirs which considered irrigation hydropower sediment evacuation and flood control bai et al 2015a proposed a multi objective optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs which accounted for ice and flood control power generation water supply and water sediment regulation this model has merit in efforts to alleviate serious reservoir sedimentation and achieve comprehensive benefits of reservoirs in the basin in previous water sediment operation studies reservoir sediment flushing calculations were performed in two ways khan and tingsanchali 2010 chaudhry et al 2014 habib ur rehman et al 2018 one way involves a sediment transport dynamics model nicklow and mays 2000 and the other way involves a sediment flushing formula chang et al 2003 hadihardaja 2009 shokri et al 2013 hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 since excessive computation time required for the dynamics model the simple and effective sediment flushing formula is generally recommended to calculate the sediment discharge of reservoirs khan and tingsanchali 2010 however the sediment flushing formulae used in previous studies are only applicable to the sediment flushing scenario in which the reservoir water level is dropping or unchanged chang et al 2003 srl 1979 ches 1989 the formulae are not suitable for the sediment flushing scenario in which the reservoir water level rises during reservoir operation therefore sediment flushing equations considering multiple sediment flushing scenarios should be established to simulate the whole cycle sediment flushing process of reservoirs considering the changes of the inflow and sediment inflow in different periods the water sediment operation model should pay more attention to sediment flushing in flood season and hydropower and water supply in non flood season however in previous related studies the importance of the multiple objectives was the same in different operation periods which did not maximize the benefits of cascade reservoirs khan and tingsanchali 2009 shokri et al 2013 rashid et al 2015 therefore a time dependent water sediment operation model of cascade reservoirs should be considered the objective of this paper is to provide a sound scientific approach to optimize the water sediment operation of cascade reservoirs considering the multiple objectives the innovative aspect of this paper is as follows first a multi objective function with time dependent weights was proposed to emphasize the operation objectives in different periods second the sediment release efficiency equations considering different sediment inflow scenarios are introduced for sediment flushing calculation the sediment discharge of reservoirs in each operation period was calculated based on the sediment release efficiency equations to test the proposed method the sanmenxia smx and xiaolangdi xld cascade reservoirs on the yellow river were selected as case studies the multiple objective water sediment optimal operation of the cascade reservoirs was established the water sediment joint optimal operation schemes of the cascade reservoirs under different inflow and sediment inflow scenarios were discussed the main framework of the study is as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data data with a typical relationship between inflow and sediment inflow were selected as model input scenarios section 3 establishes the water sediment optimal operation model with the sediment release efficiency equations and the time dependent objective functions the discrete differential dynamic programming dddp method was used to solve the operation model section 4 analyzes the results of the operation model the water sediment optimal operation schemes of cascade reservoirs under different inflows and sediment inflows with changing weights and constraints were discussed 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yellow river known as the mother river in china is the fifth longest river in the world the drainage area is 750 000 km2 accounting for approximately 8 of china s land area fu et al 2004 bai et al 2015b bai et al 2019 the basin is rich in hydroenergy and provides a large amount of water for production and domestic activities on both sides of the river jin et al 2019 the sediment deposition in the basin is a significant problem approximately 90 of the sediment in the yellow river is derived from the loess plateau in the middle reaches wang et al 2010 the large quantity of sediment in the river causes reservoir deposition and serious downstream channel erosion which affects the normal operation of the reservoir and the ecological balance of rivers these determinants might threaten the safety of basin residents li and sheng 2011 yu et al 2013 in addition a quick increase in the ice melt flood in the ningxia inner mongolia reach during ice flood season may lead to ice jams or ice dams which increases the flood risk of the lower reach jin et al 2019 therefore as controlled reservoirs in the middle reach of the yellow river the main functions of the smx and xld reservoirs are sediment flushing flood control ice prevention water supply and power generation the smx reservoir is located in the sanmenxia city henan province the reservoir controls a drainage area of 688 000 km2 with a total storage capacity of 9 64 billion m3 it is the first comprehensive water conservancy project in the yellow river basin to mainly undertake the tasks of sediment flushing and flood control wang et al 2005 wang et al 2007 in the initial operation stage this reservoir intercepted the sediment from the upper reach and effectively scoured the sediment downstream reach however the reservoir became seriously silted due to sedimentation application of storing clean water and discharging muddy flow in 1973 eased the silting situation of the reservoir and achieved a relative balance between erosion and deposition so far the sedimentation of the smx reservoir is 2 95 billion m3 and the discharge of hydropower generation capacity and the hydropower generation capacity of the smx hydropower station are 1 250 m3 s and 135 000 kw respectively the xld reservoir is located in the mengjin county henan province the reservoir controls a drainage area of 694 000 km2 with a total storage capacity of 12 65 billion m3 including 7 55 billion m3 of sediment storage capacity the main tasks of the reservoir are flood control and sediment flushing as well as water supply and power generation jiang et al 2004 li et al 2014 su et al 2009 the xld reservoir is still in the later sediment retaining period the sedimentation is 3 35 billion m3 the hydropower generation capacity of the xld hydropower station is 1 800 000 kw and its corresponding discharge is 1 776 m3 s therefore the initial boundary conditions of the operation model were set based on the current situation of the smx and xld reservoirs to simulate the future optimal operation of these reservoirs the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 data the historical flow and sediment concentration data at the tongguan gauging station were used as inflow and sediment inflow of the smx reservoir respectively a variety of inflow and sediment inflow scenarios exists in the yellow river basin to simulate water sediment operation that covers the representative scenarios it is necessary to select data with a typical relationship between inflow and sediment inflow generally large inflow is accompanied by more sediment and vice versa wang et al 2010 thus two typical data sets including high and low flow magnitudes were taken as model input scenarios the data from 1980 to 1990 represents the large inflow with more sediment and the data from 2000 to 2010 represents the small inflow with less sediment according to the historical data at the tongguan station the average annual flow of the selected 22 years is 904 16 m3 s and the average annual sediment concentration is 12 25 kg m3 specifically the average annual flow and average annual sediment concentration in the year from 1980 to 1990 are 1058 55 m3 s and 14 56 kg m3 respectively while they are 749 77 m3 s and 9 93 kg m3 in the year from 2000 to 2010 the flow magnitude in 1981 is the largest in the study period with the average annual flow of 45 44 billion m3 the flow in 2002 is the lowest in the study period with the average annual flow of 19 23 billion m3 since the distance between the smx and xld reservoirs is short and the interval inflow is small the outflow of the smx reservoir was taken as the inflow of the xld reservoir to demonstrate the difference of the data set in use the historical inflow and sediment data of the smx reservoir are shown in fig 2 3 establishment of the water sediment optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs 3 1 analysis of multiple objectives the flood control sediment flushing water supply ice flood control hydropower generation and ecological objectives were considered in the proposed model flood control is the most important objective which mainly includes the safety of the dams and its downstream areas in flood season for the sediment laden rivers flood control objective also includes the safety of its upstream areas this is because that serious sedimentation in reservoir areas can raise the elevation of upstream riverbed and threaten the flood control safety of upstream areas in addition the water supply ice flood control and ecological objectives are also important in the operation model besides the above objectives the hydropower generation and sediment flushing were considered to maximize the hydropower generation benefits and decrease the serious sediment deposition of reservoirs for the flood control objective the huayuankou hyk section is a downstream flood control section it is necessary to ensure that the sum of the discharge from the xld reservoir and the interval inflow from the xld hyk reach can meet the flood control standard in the downstream areas for large floods the safety of reservoir should be ensured first then the discharge from the reservoir should be reduced as much as possible to relieve the downstream flood control pressure in addition in order to guarantee the flood control safety of the lower wei river it is necessary to make use of the smx reservoir to control the elevation at the tongguan station not rising for the water supply and ecological objectives the discharge of the xld reservoir should meet the water supply requirements of the xld hyk reach and the ecological water demand at the hyk section for the ice flood control objective from december to february of the next year is the ice flood season the discharge of the cascade reservoirs should be stable during this period furthermore concerning the objective of sediment flushing in flood season since the inflow and sediment concentration are high the sediment should be flushed as much as possible in contrast in non flood season since the sediment concentration of the inflow is low the reservoir should store the inflow as much as possible for hydropower generation and water supply finally under the condition of meeting the above objectives the benefits of hydropower generation should be maximized due to multiple objectives the constraints method was used in the study in which some objectives were transformed to constraints bai et al 2015a ha et al 2017 jin et al 2019 bai et al 2019 the flood control objective was transformed to the constraints of the reservoir outflow and water level during the flood season the objective of ice flood control was transformed to the constraints of the reservoir outflow during the ice flood season for the water supply and ecological objectives the constraints of reservoir outflow were determined based on water withdrawn and ecological water demand at the downstream sections finally the hydropower generation and sediment flushing were considered as the objectives of the optimal model 3 2 establishment of the objective functions 3 2 1 hydropower generation objective for the hydropower generation objective the annual hydropower generation is always the significant index to evaluate whether or not the reservoir operation is reasonable and effective therefore maximizing the annual hydropower generation of cascade reservoirs was selected as an objective function which is given by 1 max e i 1 r j 1 t n ij δ t 2 n ij a i h ij q ij n where e is the total hydropower generation of the cascade reservoirs during the whole operation period r is the number of hydropower stations t is the number of operation period δ t is the time interval n ij is the hydropower generation output of the i th reservoir at time j a i is the output coefficient of the i th reservoir h ij is the hydropower generation water head of the i th reservoir at time j and q ij n is the discharge flow for hydropower generation of the i th reservoir at time j the hydropower generation water head h ij can be calculated based on the water level in reservoir and tailwater level considering the hydraulic connections of water level in cascade reservoir system the tailwater level of the upstream reservoir is mainly controlled by its own discharge and the backwater of the downstream reservoir correlations between tail water level of upstream reservoir and water level of downstream reservoir decreases as the distance between the two reservoirs increases the distance between the smx and xld reservoirs is about 130 km to simplify the operation model the backwater effect of the xld reservoir can be ignored 3 2 2 sediment flushing objective to decrease the sediment deposition and maintain the long term operation capacity of the reservoir the sediment in the reservoir should be flushed as much as possible therefore minimization of the annual sediment deposition in each reservoir was selected as the other objective the sediment flushing objective was developed based on the sediment release efficiency equations proposed by tsinghua university and northwest institute of hydrotechnical research 1979 eqs 3a and 3b are suitable to the sediment flushing scenarios with the water level of reservoir raising and dropping respectively these equations reference from handbook of sedimentation engineering edited by the sediment professional committee of chinese hydraulic engineering society the equations are η 1 λ f v s q in q out 2 d 50 when the reservoir level is raising 3a q so q si ψ q out 1 6 j 1 2 b 0 6 q in s in when the reservoir level is droppin or unchanged 3b where η and λ are sediment release efficiency and sediment deposition ratio respectively q in and q out are inflow and outflow of reservoir respectively vs is remaining reservoir capacity except the siltation capacity d 50 is median size of sediment q si is sediment inflow rate q so is sediment outflow rate s in is the sediment concentration of inflow of reservoir j is energy slope b is the width of the channel and ψ is erodibility coefficient which depends on characteristics of suspended sediment and bed load when the sediment diameter is less than 0 1 mm the erodibility coefficient ψ is 650 whereas when the sediment diameter is greater than 0 1 mm the erodibility coefficient ψ is 300 otherwise the erodibility coefficient ψ is generally taken as 180 eq 3a is applicable to the sediment flushing scenario when the water level of reservoir is rising the tsinghua university and northwest institute of hydrotechnical research 1979 plotted the measured sediment release efficiency and its main influencing factors of several reservoirs and obtained the empirical fitting curve of eq 3a which is given by 4 η ij 1 λ ij 1 β 1 x ij 5 β 2 x ij 4 β 3 x ij 3 β 4 x ij 2 β 5 x ij β 6 5 x ij q ij in v ij v i j 1 2 q ij out 2 where η ij is the sediment release efficiency of the i th reservoir at time j λ ij is the sediment deposition ratio of the i th reservoir at time j calculated by the fitting curve formula β is the coefficient of the fitting curve formula x ij is intermediate variable which is calculated by eq 5 v ij and v i j 1 are the initial and final reservoir capacities of the i th reservoir at time j respectively and q ij in and q ij out are the inflow and outflow of the i th reservoir at time j respectively when drawing curves to describe the relationship between the sediment release efficiency and flow according to the historical data there is a bunch of curves corresponding to different d50 for a specific reservoir d50 in its sediment inflow can be determined eq 4 was used to fit this curve chosen by d50 eq 3b is applicable to the sediment flushing scenario when the water level of reservoir is dropping or unchanged which can better fit the historical sediment flushing of reservoirs in the yellow river basin such as the smx reservoir srl 1979 ches 1989 eq 3b has been successfully applied to many reservoirs in multiple countries chang et al 2003 hadihardaja 2009 shokri et al 2013 hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 the objective function of the sediment flushing is calculated by 7 δ y ij y ij in y ij out q ij in s ij in q ij in s ij in η ij q ij in s ij in λ ij min c i 1 r j 1 t δ y ij δ t where δ y ij is sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at time j with positive value for deposition and negative value for erosion y ij in and y ij out are the sediment inflow and sediment flushing of the i th reservoir at time j respectively q ij in is the inflow of the i th reservoir at time j s ij in is the sediment concentration of inflow of the i th reservoir at time j and c is the total sediment deposition in the cascade reservoirs during the whole operation period the positive value for deposition and the negative value for erosion 3 3 time dependent objective function the objective function was established based on the above objectives with time dependent weights coefficient since the different emphasis of operation objectives in flood and non flood seasons the objectives weights should be adjusted to meet the operation requirements in different periods the objective function of the multi objective operation model is given by 8 max f i 1 r j 1 t α in n ij α i δ y δ y ij δ t α i δ y α i δ y 1 in the flood season α i δ y α i δ y 2 in the non flood season where f is the total objective in operation α in and α i δ y are the weights for the hydropower generation objective and sediment flushing objective of the i th reservoir respectively α i δ y 1 is the weight of the sediment flushing objective in flood season and α i δ y 2 is the weight of sediment flushing objective in the non flood season in flood season the main objective of the established operation model is to reduce the sedimentation pressure of reservoirs in non flood season since the inflow is smaller than that in flood season a larger weight assigned for the sediment flushing objective may affect the benefits of water supply and hydropower generation thus the weight of sediment flushing objective in the model was set to a higher value in flood season and a lower value in non flood season it can be seen from eqs 2 and 8 the water level and discharge of the reservoirs are regarded as the decision variables and the inflow is taken as the input to the model therefore the hydropower generation and the sediment flushing are both controlled by the water level and discharge in general the objective of hydropower generation wishes high water level in reservoirs whereas the sediment flushing requires the reservoir to maintain a low water level the conflict between hydropower generation and sediment transport objectives is prominent rashid et al 2015 bai 2019 therefore optimizing the water level and maximizing the comprehensive benefits of reservoirs are the main objectives of this paper 3 4 establishment of constraints considering the reservoir characteristics and the objectives of flood control water supply ecology ice flood control sediment flushing and hydropower generation the operation model is subject to the constraints described below which include water level outflow hydropower generation water balance equation and others 3 4 1 constraints of water level the constraints for the water level are given by 9 z ij min z ij z ij max 10 z i 0 z i beg z it z i end where z ij min and z ij max are the minimum and maximum water level respectively for the i th reservoir at time j in which the flood control and normal water levels are the maximum water levels in flood and non flood seasons respectively and the dead water level is chosen as the minimum water level z ij is the water level for the i th reservoir at time j z i 0 and z it are the water levels for the i th reservoir at the beginning and ending of operation period respectively and z i beg and z i end are the designated water levels for the i th reservoir at the beginning and ending of the operation period respectively 3 4 2 constraints of outflow the constraint for the outflow of reservoirs is given by 11 q ij min q ij out q ij max where q ij min and q ij max are the minimum and maximum allowable outflow respectively for the i th reservoir at time j the safety outflow at the flood control point downstream in flood season and the maximum outflow in ice flood season were taken as the maximum allowable outflow the water supply and basic eco environmental water demand were selected as the minimum outflow q ij out is the outflow of the i th reservoir at time j 3 4 3 constraints of hydropower output the constraint of the hydropower output is given by 12 n ij min n ij n ij max where n ij min and n ij max are the minimum and maximum hydropower outputs respectively of the i th reservoir at time j and n ij is the hydropower output of the i th reservoir at time j 3 4 4 constraints of water balance the water balance of single reservoir and the hydraulic connections between reservoirs should be considered the water balance of single reservoir is given by 13 v i j 1 v ij q ij out q ij in δ t where v ij and v i j 1 are the initial and final reservoir capacities of the i th reservoir at time j considering the hydraulic connections between reservoirs if the upstream and downstream reservoirs are close to each other the time delay of flow can be considered in reservoir operation zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 assuming that it takes duration δt for the outflow from the upstream reservoir to the downstream reservoir the inflow of the downstream reservoir at time t is 14 q down in t q up out t δ t b ij where q down in t is the inflow of the downstream reservoir at time t q up out t δ t is the outflow of the upstream reservoir at time t δ t and b ij is the interval inflow between the upstream and downstream reservoirs 3 4 5 constraints of sediment balance the constraints of sediment balance are given by 15 c i j 1 c ij δ y ij δ t s ij in q ij in s ij out q ij out δ t 16 c i 0 c i beg where c ij and c i j 1 are the initial and final sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at time j s ij out is the sediment concentration of the outflow for the i th reservoir at time j c i 0 is the initial sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at the beginning of the operation period and c i beg is the designated sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at the beginning of operation period 3 4 6 non negative constraints except for the variables of total sediment deposition c sediment deposition δ y ij and sediment deposition ratio λ ij other variables are non negative 3 5 establishment of optimal operation model in this study a water sediment optimal operation model considering hydropower generation sediment flushing flood control ice flood control water supply and ecology was established to investigate the optimal operation mode of the smx and xld reservoirs in which the objectives of flood control ice flood control water supply and ecology were transformed to constraints the optimal reservoir operation model is mainly aimed at searching the maximum operational strategy of reservoirs based on the historical data therefore the two typical historical data sets including high and low flow magnitudes were taken as model input scenarios the proposed model not only considered the water level of reservoirs but also multiple information such as the inflow sediment inflow and outflow of reservoirs both the hydropower generation and sediment flushing of reservoirs were considered as criteria in evaluating the various operation strategies the dddp method was used to solve the operation model the specific steps for establishing the model are given as follows 3 5 1 boundary conditions of the model the initial boundary conditions of the model were set based on the characteristics and the sediment deposition conditions of reservoirs a boundary conditions of water level constraints the upper and lower boundaries of water level for reservoirs were set based on the normal water level flood control limited water level and dead water level and other characteristic water levels in reservoirs the monthly water level constraints of the smx and xld reservoirs are shown in tables 1 and 2 in order to reduce the elevation at the tongguan station the water level of the smx reservoir was controlled below 305 m in flood season and 318 m in non flood season therefore the water level of the smx reservoir was controlled between the dead water level 300 m and the flood control limited water level 305 m in flood season and between the flood control limited water level 305 m and the normal water level 318 m in non flood season for the xld reservoir in order to play the role of flood control in flood season and water supply in non flood season the water level of the reservoir was controlled below the flood control limit water level 254 m in flood season and the normal water level 275 m in non flood season and above the dead water level in whole year b boundary conditions of outflow constraints considering the flood and ice flood control downstream the discharge requirement for water supply ecology and other operation objectives the minimum and maximum outflow in each period was determined the upper limit of output was set based on the hydropower generation capacity and the discharge of hydropower generation capacity the monthly discharge constraints of the smx and xld reservoirs are shown in tables 1 and 2 during flood season in order to ensure the flood control safety at the downstream hyk section the maximum outflow is 4000 m3 s during ice flood season there are the upper and lower boundaries of the discharge for the smx and the xld reservoirs during non flood season in order to ensure the water supply and ecological needs of the basin the minimum outflow is 150 m3 s for the smx reservoir and 200 m3 s for the xld reservoir furthermore the hydraulic connections of cascade reservoir should be considered in the established operation model ten days were used as an operation period since the propagation time from the smx reservoir to the xld reservoir is only a few hours the time delay δ t can be ignored therefore the inflow of the xld reservoir can be calculated by 17 q xld j in q smx j out b smx x l d j where q xld j in is the inflow of the xld reservoir at time j q smx j out is the outflow from the smx reservoir at time j and b smx x l d j is the interval inflow between the smx and xld reservoirs at time j 3 initial sediment deposition conditions of reservoirs the sedimentation of the smx and xld reservoirs is 2 95 billion m3 and 3 35 billion m3 respectively which is set as the boundaries of initial sediment deposition conditions the sediment deposition is serious in the smx reservoir which is in a state of erosion and deposition balance the sediment deposition of the xld reservoir is relatively small and the reservoir is still in the later sediment retaining period 3 5 2 determinations of the weights in the objective function the initial weights in the model were determined according to the initial reservoir sediment deposition and the operation objectives according to the historical data of the yellow river the sediment concentration in flood season is higher than that in non flood season the inflow is large and the sediment concentration is high in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river during flood season the total storage capacity of the smx reservoir is 9 64 billion m3 and the sedimentation is as high as 2 95 billion m3 therefore for the smx reservoir with serious sediment deposition the initial weight of sediment flushing objective should be set to a larger value 0 95 in flood season in contrast the hydropower generation and water supply are the main objectives in non flood season thus the initial weight of sediment flushing objective should be set to a smaller value 0 05 in non flood season for the xld reservoir at present the sediment deposition is relatively small which is 3 35 billion m3 the remaining siltation capacity of the reservoir is 4 20 billion m3 thus this reservoir can play an important role in reducing the sediment deposition of downstream river during flood season and also can undertake the task of hydropower generation therefore the initial weights of xld reservoir for the sediment flushing and hydropower generation objectives are set to be nearly the same value the initial weight for the sediment flushing objective of the xld reservoir is 0 48 in flood and non flood seasons the normalized weights for the model are given in table 3 3 5 3 solutions of optimal operation model the steps of dddp method are given as follows first the initial solution was formulated based on the results of the dynamic programming dp method second an optimization corridor was generated based on the initial operation process third the current objective and optimal trajectory were obtained in the corridor by dp method the new corridor was confirmed by the optimal trajectory fourth the iterations were maintained until the maximum iterations or the last operation results with small differences 0 0005 billion is set as the convergence precision of the dddp method in this study fig 3 displays the flow chart of the dddp method the whole reservoir operation process has been developed and coded in java computer program language 4 results and discussions the historical data at the tongguan station were divided into the high flow and low flow series as mentioned in section 2 the optimization results were analyzed as follows 4 1 hydropower generation sediment flushing and other objectives 4 1 1 hydropower generation according to the established model the optimal operation processes of the cascade reservoirs were obtained results of the annual hydropower generation sediment flushing and total benefits are shown in table 4 for the smx reservoir it can be seen from table 4 that the average annual hydropower generation for the natural high flow the data from 1980 to 1990 and the natural low flow the data from 2000 to 2010 series is approximately 11 17 10 1 and 10 78 10 1 billion kw h respectively the hydropower generation of the reservoir is mainly controlled by the net head since the net head of the smx reservoir is small the discharge has little effect on hydropower generation of the smx reservoir therefore the average annual hydropower generation of the natural high flow and low flow series for the smx reservoir is similar for the xld reservoir the inflow was controlled by the smx reservoir it can be seen from table 4 that when the natural flow is large the controlled inflow of the xld reservoir is still large after the regulation of the smx reservoir and the inflow of the xld reservoir in flood season is equal to the discharge of the smx reservoir the average annual hydropower generation for the controlled high flow and low flow series is 78 84 10 1 and 60 21 10 1 billion kw h respectively demonstrating a significantly decreased trend since the natural flow is high the outflow controlled by the smx reservoir is still large since both the waterhead and the controlled inflow of the xld reservoir are large more hydropower is generated in flood season in general when the natural flow is relatively abundant the outflow of the upstream reservoir is large therefore the inflow of the downstream reservoir tends to be abundant as well for the smx reservoir the average hydropower generation of the high flow and low flow series is similar however for the operation of cascade reservoirs when the water resources are abundant the hydropower generation of the smx xld cascade reservoirs increase significantly 4 1 2 sediment flushing the annual sediment deposition in the two reservoirs is shown in fig 4 the negative value represents erosion and positive value represents deposition for the smx reservoir it can be seen from table 4 and fig 4 a that in flood season a large amount of sedimentation in the reservoir area is flushed when the natural inflow is abundant as shown in years 2 4 6 and 10 when the natural inflow is small little sedimentation in the reservoir area is flushed in non flood season the sediment flushing weight of the smx reservoir is small a large amount of sedimentation is flushed in flood season leading to increased sediment storage capacity of the reservoir thus a large amount of sediment is deposited in the reservoir in non flood season in general erosion and deposition are balanced and the amount of sediment erosion and deposition in most of the years is within 0 05 billion m3 for the xld reservoir it can be seen from fig 4 b that the deposition of the xld reservoir mainly occurs in flood season the reasons are discussed as follows the natural and controlled sediment inflow data for the xld reservoir are given in table 5 the outflow of the smx reservoir is taken as the inflow of the xld reservoir as shown in table 5 the controlled inflow sediment concentration in flood season of the xld reservoir became higher after the operation of the smx reservoir therefore most of sediment has been deposited in the xld reservoir in flood season accounting for 87 98 of the annual deposition generally after regulated by the smx reservoir the sediment concentration of the xld reservoir is higher in flood season which increases the sediment deposition of the xld reservoir for the smx xld cascade reservoirs when the amount of natural inflow and sediment inflow is large the total sedimentation of the cascade reservoirs is also large the response of sedimentation to different sediment boundary conditions each year was discussed results are shown in fig 5 with the increase of the annual initial sedimentation the annual sedimentation in the smx and xld reservoirs decrease the correlation coefficients between the annual sedimentation and initial sedimentation of the smx and xld reservoirs are 0 5603 and 0 8749 respectively indicating a negative correlation for the smx reservoir since the reservoir reach a relative balance between erosion and deposition the sediment is flushed in large quantities to maintain this balance of the reservoir with the increased initial sediment boundary condition for the xld reservoir with the increase in reservoir sedimentation the remaining storage of the reservoir decreases gradually the optimization process is inclined to flush more sediment to maintain the long term stable operation of the reservoir therefore the annual sedimentation in the reservoir decreases with the increasing annual initial sedimentation boundaries 4 1 3 flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives the flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives were transformed to constraints in the operation model which limited the outflow of the xld reservoir the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir is given in table 6 the data in table 6 demonstrates that the maximum monthly outflow for the xld reservoir does not exceed 4000 m3 s and the outflow in all periods meets the constraints of flood control for ice flood control the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir in december is controlled within 500 600 m3 s in january and february the outflow is controlled within 300 400 m3 s in addition for the water supply and ecological objectives from april to june the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir is not less than 200 m3 s as shown in table 6 the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir in each period meets the requirements of ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives therefore based on the initial weight of the model all the objectives can be guaranteed 4 2 discussions of the weights in the time dependent model the operation results based on different weights were discussed to identify the relationship among these objectives the various weights under different water and sediment scenarios were discussed in addition a current operation model of the smx and xld reservoirs was established whose operation results were compared with the optimal operation method the current operation schemes for the smx and xld reservoirs are described as follows the water level in non flood and flood seasons cannot exceed 318 m and 305 m respectively when the inflow in flood season exceeds 1500 m3 s an ungated operation rules should be used for the smx reservoir zheng et al 2015 wang 2020 for the xld reservoir the current operation process is divided into three periods during flood season the water level of the xld reservoir should be below the flood control limited water level 254 m from mid july to late october at the end of flood season the reservoir begins to store water and the water level of reservoir continues rising from november to june of the next year the water level is maintained at a high level to meet the water demand of the downstream yellow river during late june to early july the water level of the xld reservoir decreases significantly to prepare for the arrival of the flood season wang et al 2019 4 2 1 reservoir operation results based on different weights in flood season for the smx reservoir with serious sediment deposition the main task in flood season is to flush sediment as much as possible to keep the balance between erosion and deposition in the reservoir area therefore the weights of the smx reservoir in flood season should continue to be set a high value for the xld reservoir different weight schemes were selected in flood season the influence of the weights on the hydropower generation and sediment flushing of the xld reservoir in flood season was discussed specifically the weight of the xld reservoir in non flood season α 2 δ y 2 was fixed and the weights in flood season α 2 δ y 1 was time variant for sediment flushing the benefit of hydropower generation was calculated based on the local electricity price of 0 368 yuan kw h and the benefit of sediment deposition was calculated based on the cost of manual desilting of 15 yuan m3 zhang et al 2017 the total hydropower generation sediment deposition and benefits of the xld reservoir based on different weight scenarios in flood season of the 22 years are given in fig 6 and table 7 it can be seen from fig 6 and table 7 that with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 for the sediment flushing in flood season the total hydropower generation and sediment deposition in 22 years present a decreasing trend and the total benefits increase obviously the sediment deposition decreases uniformly with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 when the weight α 2 δ y 1 less than 0 85 the hydropower generation decreases slowly the hydropower generation decreases rapidly when the weight α 2 δ y 1 exceeds 0 85 the average annual hydropower generation sediment deposition and water level in flood season for the high and low flow series under different weight scenarios are shown in table 8 when the weight of sediment flushing is less than 0 85 the water level in flood season drops slightly and the hydropower generation decreases slowly when the weight of sediment flushing increases to 0 85 the water level in flood season for the high flow series drops rapidly to flush sediment as much as possible resulting in a rapid decline in hydropower generation for the optimal weight as shown in table 7 and fig 6 when the sediment flushing weight reaches 0 98 the maximum total benefit is 17 33 billion yuan in addition as shown in table 8 for the two series with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 the sediment deposition in the reservoir area decreases obviously for the high flow series in contrast for the low flow series with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 the decrease in sediment deposition is not so obvious in general the sediment deposition in the reservoir area for the high and low flow series decrease significantly with the increase weight of the sediment flushing compared with the initial weight scenario the sedimentation is reduced by approximately 1 6 billion m3 and the power generation reduced by 14 billion kw h therefore the total benefit can be significantly improved by increasing the sediment flushing weight in flood season for the xld reservoir compared with the current operation scheme the optimal weight scenario only increases the sedimentation by 0 2 billion m3 but the hydropower generation increases by 70 billion kw h the total benefits in 22 years increases by 24 billion yuan therefore for the high flow years in flood season the weight of the sediment flushing for the xld reservoir can be increased appropriately there are some trade offs of water use for hydropower generation and sediment flushing 4 2 2 reservoir operation results based on different weights in non flood season in order to discuss the influence of changing weights in non flood season the weights in flood season were fixed first the weight for the xld reservoir in non flood season was changed and the initial weight was used for the smx reservoir the influences of the weights in non flood season on hydropower generation and sediment flushing were investigated the total hydropower generation sediment deposition and benefits of the smx and xld reservoirs based on different weight scenarios in non flood season of the 22 years are demonstrated in figs 7 and 8 and tables 9 11 4 2 2 1 results of the smx reservoir as shown in fig 7 and table 9 with the increased weight for the sediment flushing in non flood season the hydropower generation and sediment deposition of the smx reservoir are basically unchanged for the hydropower generation since the installed capacity of the reservoir is small and the water level in non flood season is high the output in most periods is equal to the installed capacity with the increased sediment flushing weight in non flood season the water level drops slightly and the output is still equal to the installed capacity thus the hydropower generation is basically unchanged for the sediment deposition since the smx reservoir reaches a balance between the erosion and deposition increasing the sediment flushing in non flood season results in more sediment deposition in flood season sediment deposition in the reservoir area in flood and non flood seasons under different weights are shown in table 10 when the weight equals the initial value 0 05 the average sediment deposition in non flood season is 0 66 10 1 billion m3 and the sediment flushing in flood season is 0 66 10 1 billion m3 when the weight increasing to 0 60 and 0 90 the average sediment deposition drops to 0 49 10 1 billion m3 and 0 44 10 1 billion m3 respectively and the average sediment flushing drops to 0 50 10 1 billion m3 and 0 46 10 1 billion m3 respectively thus with increased weight α 2 δ y 2 the sediment flushing increases slightly in non flood season and decreases in flood season which results in unchanged total sediment deposition therefore increasing the weight for the sediment flushing in non flood season cannot reduce reservoir sedimentation as shown in table 9 the maximum total benefit is 9 26 billion yuan when the sediment flushing weight in non flood season reaches 0 48 compared with the initial weight scenario the sedimentation is reduced by approximately 0 11 10 1 billion m3 whereas the hydropower generation remains unchanged and the total benefits increases only by 0 1 billion yuan in general increasing the weight of sediment flushing in non flood season has little effect on the total benefits of the smx reservoir compared with the current operation scheme the optimal weight scenario reduces the sedimentation in the reservoir area by 0 3 10 1 billion m3 and the hydropower generation increases by 5 6 billion kw h the total benefits in 22 years increases by 2 5 billion yuan to research the influence of weight change of the smx reservoir on the xld reservoir the change of sediment concentration of the smx reservoir with weight change of the xld reservoir is discussed when the sediment flushed from the upstream reservoir to the downstream reservoir the sediment inflow of downstream reservoir may increase as well since the sediment inflow in non flood season is small and the regulation of upstream reservoir has little influence on the sediment inflow of downstream reservoir the sediment inflow in the xld reservoir is basically unchanged with the changing weights of the smx reservoir in non flood season it can be seen from table 1 that when the sediment flushing weight changing from 0 3 to 0 98 only 0 012billion m3 of sediment is flushed away from the smx reservoir and the total benefit of the reservoir is basically unchanged the sediment inflow of the xld reservoir did not change obviously with the changing weights of the smx reservoir in non flood season therefore the weights changes of the smx reservoir in non flood season has little effect on the xld reservoir 4 2 2 2 results of the xld reservoir as shown in fig 8 and table 11 for the xld reservoir the hydropower generation and sediment deposition are unchanged when the weight for sediment flushing in non flood season is less than 0 8 the total hydropower generation and sediment deposition begins to decrease when the weight exceeds 0 8 the reasons are as follows as shown in tables 12 and 13 data of the sediment inflow of the smx and xld reservoirs in 22 years indicate that the sediment inflow in flood season is greater than that in non flood season the natural water and sediment in the yellow river basin increase in flood season and decrease in non flood season moreover in flood season since the inflow and sediment inflow of the xld reservoir are regulated by the smx reservoir considerable sediment is flushed downstream resulting in more concentrated sediment inflow in the xld reservoir this behavior results in a more obvious annual difference in the sediment inflow therefore the sediment inflow of the xld reservoir in non flood season is much less than that in flood season in non flood season the total sediment deposition is not sensitive to changes in the weight of sediment flushing when the weight is low and decrease when the weight exceeds a certain value therefore to a certain extent with the increase in the weight for sediment flushing in non flood season the reservoir sedimentation can be reduced however the effect of increasing the weight for sediment flushing in non flood season is worse than that in the flood season for the optimal weight data in fig 8 and table 11 the maximum total benefit is 12 85 billion yuan when the sediment flushing weight in non flood season reaches 0 95 compared with the initial weight scenario the sedimentation is reduced by approximately 1 2 billion m3 whereas the hydropower generation decreases by approximately 10 billion kw h and the total benefits increase by 14 billion yuan compared with the current operation scheme the sedimentation increases by 0 6 billion m3 based on the optimal weight scenario but the hydropower generation increases by 80 billion kw h and the total benefits in 22 years increases by approximately 20 billion yuan 4 3 discussions of the constraints in order to investigate the sensitivity of the objective function to the constraints the xld reservoir was taken as an example the upper boundary of the water level was increased by 5 m and the upper boundary of the flow constraint was increased by 1000 m3 s operation results of the xld reservoir based on different water level and outflow constraints are given in table 14 as shown in table 14 compared to the initial operation results the average water level in reservoir increases by 3 5 m which results in hydropower generation and sediment deposition increasing to 70 million kw h and 25 million m3 respectively thus the model is sensitive to the changes of water level constraint for the outflow constraint it can be seen that both hydropower generation and sediment deposition are slightly reduced therefore compared to the outflow constraint the water level constraint is much more sensitive to the objective functions 5 conclusions this paper addresses the prominent problem of water sediment management in the sediment laden river the multi objective water sediment optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs was established which considers hydropower generation sediment flushing flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives a time dependent objective function was proposed innovatively in the model and the sediment release efficiency equations considering different sediment flushing scenarios were introduced into the water and sediment operation the smx and xld reservoirs on the yellow river were selected as case studies two typical data sets including high and low flow magnitudes were selected as model input scenarios the operation processes with various weight schemes in flood and non flood seasons were discussed the main results are summarized as follows 1 for sediment laden rivers such as the yellow river the proposed model can achieve the maximization of the hydropower generation and sediment flushing benefits for the high flow and low flow series and results indicate that the proposed model can guarantee the flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives for the smx reservoir the average annual hydropower generation calculated based on the natural high flow and low flow series is similar and the erosion and deposition in the reservoir areas are balanced for the natural high flow and low flow series for the xld reservoir the hydropower generation increases with the increasing of inflow magnitude and most of the sediment inflow is deposited in the reservoir for the high flow series for the smx xld cascade reservoir when the water resources are abundant the hydropower generation reservoirs increase significantly 2 compared with the current operation scheme the proposed model optimizes the water and sediment regulation process and significantly improves the hydropower generation and sediment flushing benefits of cascade reservoir in flood season the sediment deposition in the reservoir area decreases significantly with the increase weight of the sediment flushing thus the weights for sediment flushing in flood season can be increased appropriately to improve the comprehensive benefits of the reservoirs in sediment laden rivers in non flood season the hydropower generation and sediment deposition of cascade reservoirs change not so obviously with the increase weight for the sediment flushing specifically for the yellow river the weight for sediment flushing of the smx reservoir in flood season should be set a large value and the weight for sediment flushing of the xld reservoir in flood and non flood seasons can be set to 0 6 0 8 and 0 3 0 8 respectively which can reduce the sedimentation in the downstream channel and maximize the total benefits of the cascade reservoirs 3 the water sediment optimal operation model is sensitive to the changes of the water level constraints with the increase of the boundaries of water level constraints the hydropower generation and sedimentation of reservoir increase significantly raising the water level constraints is conducive to hydropower generation while not conducive to sediment flushing and flood control therefore the boundaries of water level constraints should be determined according to hydropower generation sediment flushing flood control and other objectives of the reservoirs 4 the operation objectives can be flexibly adjusted by the time dependent weights function the reasonable weight schemes can be selected according to different operation scenarios which can effectively improve the comprehensive benefits of cascade reservoirs in addition the time dependent objective function can provide a reference for the multi objective optimal operation of cascade reservoirs the multi objective water sediment optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs can demonstrate the optimal water sediment operation mode in which the flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives can be guaranteed the optimal operation model provides a model basis for the water sediment energy joint operation of large scale reservoir group in the sediment laden basins credit authorship

3393,sediment deposition in sediment laden rivers seriously restricts the normal operation of reservoirs and the socioeconomic development of the basin studying the water sediment joint operation of cascade reservoirs is important for extending the life of reservoirs the objective of this paper is to provide a sound scientific approach to optimize the water sediment operation of cascade reservoirs considering multiple objectives an innovative time dependent objective function was proposed in which the sediment release efficiency equations suitable for different sediment inflow scenarios were introduced for sediment flushing calculation the sanmenxia smx and xiaolangdi xld reservoirs on the yellow river were selected as case studies to test the proposed method first two

flood season the weight for sediment flushing can be increased appropriately to improve the comprehensive benefits of the reservoir in sediment laden rivers in addition the time dependent objective

introduction water resources are important in human production and activities such as water supply flood control and power generation niu and feng 2021 qiu et al 2021 xia et al 2016 xu and milliman 2009 yang et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 in addition human activities that include reservoir construction sediment mining and water diversion and drainage also have a profound impact on the natural rivers especially on sediment laden rivers which complicates the relationship between water and sediment xu 2011 kiss and blanka 2012 bi et al 2019 he 2019 peng et al 2010 sediment deposition is a serious problem for sediment laden rivers that can detrimentally affect the future economic and ecological development of basins hauer et al 2018 with the construction of reservoirs and barrages on sediment laden rivers the downstream transport of sediment is gradually reduced and most of sediment is deposited in upstream reservoirs walling and fang 2003 therefore reservoirs on sediment laden rivers gradually fill with sediment which weakens the water storage function of reservoirs and reduces the hydropower navigation and water supply benefits nicklow and mays 2000 rashid et al 2015 miao et al 2016 li et al 2017 many sediment laden rivers globally are affected by reservoir sedimentation since the reservoir construction has disrupted the original water sediment balance in rivers yu et al 2013 in egypt the storage capacity of the aswan high dam on the nile river was reduced by approximately 12 from 1964 to 2013 due to sediment deposition the morphology change of the reservoir and river channel has hindered navigation and reduced the flood discharge capacity of the nile river ahmed and abdelbary 2004 el shazli and hoermann 2016 in the united states as of 2016 24 reservoirs on rivers in the state of kansas have collectively lost approximately 17 of their original storage capacity with the highest loss of 45 for a single reservoir which has created pressure on water supply and reservoir management rahmani et al 2018 in india the hirakud reservoir on the mahanadi river had lost approximately 22 of its storage capacity due to sedimentation by 2007 this loss has reduced the reservoir s water storage capacity increased risk of flooding and hindered reservoir operation dutta and sen 2016 in china the high sediment load and continuous human activities have exacerbated the overloaded relationship between water and sediment in the yellow river during the first 18 months of the operation of the sanmenxia reservoir on the yellow river 93 of the incoming sediment was deposited in the reservoir accounting for 17 of total storage capacity 9 64 10 9 m3 the deposited sediment has seriously reduced the flood control irrigation and hydropower generation benefits of the reservoir wang et al 2005 water sediment regulation as an effective way to sustain the long term useful life of reservoirs and remediate the water sediment relationship of sediment laden rivers has received worldwide attention nicklow and mays 2000 hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 rashid et al 2014 jin et al 2019 the water sediment operation in basins often involves multiple reservoirs and objectives hence a multi objective operation model of cascade reservoirs has been considered by many researchers for example rashid et al 2015 developed a multi objective operation model for multiple reservoirs which considered irrigation hydropower sediment evacuation and flood control bai et al 2015a proposed a multi objective optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs which accounted for ice and flood control power generation water supply and water sediment regulation this model has merit in efforts to alleviate serious reservoir sedimentation and achieve comprehensive benefits of reservoirs in the basin in previous water sediment operation studies reservoir sediment flushing calculations were performed in two ways khan and tingsanchali 2010 chaudhry et al 2014 habib ur rehman et al 2018 one way involves a sediment transport dynamics model nicklow and mays 2000 and the other way involves a sediment flushing formula chang et al 2003 hadihardaja 2009 shokri et al 2013 hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 since excessive computation time required for the dynamics model the simple and effective sediment flushing formula is generally recommended to calculate the sediment discharge of reservoirs khan and tingsanchali 2010 however the sediment flushing formulae used in previous studies are only applicable to the sediment flushing scenario in which the reservoir water level is dropping or unchanged chang et al 2003 srl 1979 ches 1989 the formulae are not suitable for the sediment flushing scenario in which the reservoir water level rises during reservoir operation therefore sediment flushing equations considering multiple sediment flushing scenarios should be established to simulate the whole cycle sediment flushing process of reservoirs considering the changes of the inflow and sediment inflow in different periods the water sediment operation model should pay more attention to sediment flushing in flood season and hydropower and water supply in non flood season however in previous related studies the importance of the multiple objectives was the same in different operation periods which did not maximize the benefits of cascade reservoirs khan and tingsanchali 2009 shokri et al 2013 rashid et al 2015 therefore a time dependent water sediment operation model of cascade reservoirs should be considered the objective of this paper is to provide a sound scientific approach to optimize the water sediment operation of cascade reservoirs considering the multiple objectives the innovative aspect of this paper is as follows first a multi objective function with time dependent weights was proposed to emphasize the operation objectives in different periods second the sediment release efficiency equations considering different sediment inflow scenarios are introduced for sediment flushing calculation the sediment discharge of reservoirs in each operation period was calculated based on the sediment release efficiency equations to test the proposed method the sanmenxia smx and xiaolangdi xld cascade reservoirs on the yellow river were selected as case studies the multiple objective water sediment optimal operation of the cascade reservoirs was established the water sediment joint optimal operation schemes of the cascade reservoirs under different inflow and sediment inflow scenarios were discussed the main framework of the study is as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data data with a typical relationship between inflow and sediment inflow were selected as model input scenarios section 3 establishes the water sediment optimal operation model with the sediment release efficiency equations and the time dependent objective functions the discrete differential dynamic programming dddp method was used to solve the operation model section 4 analyzes the results of the operation model the water sediment optimal operation schemes of cascade reservoirs under different inflows and sediment inflows with changing weights and constraints were discussed 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yellow river known as the mother river in china is the fifth longest river in the world the drainage area is 750 000 km2 accounting for approximately 8 of china s land area fu et al 2004 bai et al 2015b bai et al 2019 the basin is rich in hydroenergy and provides a large amount of water for production and domestic activities on both sides of the river jin et al 2019 the sediment deposition in the basin is a significant problem approximately 90 of the sediment in the yellow river is derived from the loess plateau in the middle reaches wang et al 2010 the large quantity of sediment in the river causes reservoir deposition and serious downstream channel erosion which affects the normal operation of the reservoir and the ecological balance of rivers these determinants might threaten the safety of basin residents li and sheng 2011 yu et al 2013 in addition a quick increase in the ice melt flood in the ningxia inner mongolia reach during ice flood season may lead to ice jams or ice dams which increases the flood risk of the lower reach jin et al 2019 therefore as controlled reservoirs in the middle reach of the yellow river the main functions of the smx and xld reservoirs are sediment flushing flood control ice prevention water supply and power generation the smx reservoir is located in the sanmenxia city henan province the reservoir controls a drainage area of 688 000 km2 with a total storage capacity of 9 64 billion m3 it is the first comprehensive water conservancy project in the yellow river basin to mainly undertake the tasks of sediment flushing and flood control wang et al 2005 wang et al 2007 in the initial operation stage this reservoir intercepted the sediment from the upper reach and effectively scoured the sediment downstream reach however the reservoir became seriously silted due to sedimentation application of storing clean water and discharging muddy flow in 1973 eased the silting situation of the reservoir and achieved a relative balance between erosion and deposition so far the sedimentation of the smx reservoir is 2 95 billion m3 and the discharge of hydropower generation capacity and the hydropower generation capacity of the smx hydropower station are 1 250 m3 s and 135 000 kw respectively the xld reservoir is located in the mengjin county henan province the reservoir controls a drainage area of 694 000 km2 with a total storage capacity of 12 65 billion m3 including 7 55 billion m3 of sediment storage capacity the main tasks of the reservoir are flood control and sediment flushing as well as water supply and power generation jiang et al 2004 li et al 2014 su et al 2009 the xld reservoir is still in the later sediment retaining period the sedimentation is 3 35 billion m3 the hydropower generation capacity of the xld hydropower station is 1 800 000 kw and its corresponding discharge is 1 776 m3 s therefore the initial boundary conditions of the operation model were set based on the current situation of the smx and xld reservoirs to simulate the future optimal operation of these reservoirs the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 data the historical flow and sediment concentration data at the tongguan gauging station were used as inflow and sediment inflow of the smx reservoir respectively a variety of inflow and sediment inflow scenarios exists in the yellow river basin to simulate water sediment operation that covers the representative scenarios it is necessary to select data with a typical relationship between inflow and sediment inflow generally large inflow is accompanied by more sediment and vice versa wang et al 2010 thus two typical data sets including high and low flow magnitudes were taken as model input scenarios the data from 1980 to 1990 represents the large inflow with more sediment and the data from 2000 to 2010 represents the small inflow with less sediment according to the historical data at the tongguan station the average annual flow of the selected 22 years is 904 16 m3 s and the average annual sediment concentration is 12 25 kg m3 specifically the average annual flow and average annual sediment concentration in the year from 1980 to 1990 are 1058 55 m3 s and 14 56 kg m3 respectively while they are 749 77 m3 s and 9 93 kg m3 in the year from 2000 to 2010 the flow magnitude in 1981 is the largest in the study period with the average annual flow of 45 44 billion m3 the flow in 2002 is the lowest in the study period with the average annual flow of 19 23 billion m3 since the distance between the smx and xld reservoirs is short and the interval inflow is small the outflow of the smx reservoir was taken as the inflow of the xld reservoir to demonstrate the difference of the data set in use the historical inflow and sediment data of the smx reservoir are shown in fig 2 3 establishment of the water sediment optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs 3 1 analysis of multiple objectives the flood control sediment flushing water supply ice flood control hydropower generation and ecological objectives were considered in the proposed model flood control is the most important objective which mainly includes the safety of the dams and its downstream areas in flood season for the sediment laden rivers flood control objective also includes the safety of its upstream areas this is because that serious sedimentation in reservoir areas can raise the elevation of upstream riverbed and threaten the flood control safety of upstream areas in addition the water supply ice flood control and ecological objectives are also important in the operation model besides the above objectives the hydropower generation and sediment flushing were considered to maximize the hydropower generation benefits and decrease the serious sediment deposition of reservoirs for the flood control objective the huayuankou hyk section is a downstream flood control section it is necessary to ensure that the sum of the discharge from the xld reservoir and the interval inflow from the xld hyk reach can meet the flood control standard in the downstream areas for large floods the safety of reservoir should be ensured first then the discharge from the reservoir should be reduced as much as possible to relieve the downstream flood control pressure in addition in order to guarantee the flood control safety of the lower wei river it is necessary to make use of the smx reservoir to control the elevation at the tongguan station not rising for the water supply and ecological objectives the discharge of the xld reservoir should meet the water supply requirements of the xld hyk reach and the ecological water demand at the hyk section for the ice flood control objective from december to february of the next year is the ice flood season the discharge of the cascade reservoirs should be stable during this period furthermore concerning the objective of sediment flushing in flood season since the inflow and sediment concentration are high the sediment should be flushed as much as possible in contrast in non flood season since the sediment concentration of the inflow is low the reservoir should store the inflow as much as possible for hydropower generation and water supply finally under the condition of meeting the above objectives the benefits of hydropower generation should be maximized due to multiple objectives the constraints method was used in the study in which some objectives were transformed to constraints bai et al 2015a ha et al 2017 jin et al 2019 bai et al 2019 the flood control objective was transformed to the constraints of the reservoir outflow and water level during the flood season the objective of ice flood control was transformed to the constraints of the reservoir outflow during the ice flood season for the water supply and ecological objectives the constraints of reservoir outflow were determined based on water withdrawn and ecological water demand at the downstream sections finally the hydropower generation and sediment flushing were considered as the objectives of the optimal model 3 2 establishment of the objective functions 3 2 1 hydropower generation objective for the hydropower generation objective the annual hydropower generation is always the significant index to evaluate whether or not the reservoir operation is reasonable and effective therefore maximizing the annual hydropower generation of cascade reservoirs was selected as an objective function which is given by 1 max e i 1 r j 1 t n ij δ t 2 n ij a i h ij q ij n where e is the total hydropower generation of the cascade reservoirs during the whole operation period r is the number of hydropower stations t is the number of operation period δ t is the time interval n ij is the hydropower generation output of the i th reservoir at time j a i is the output coefficient of the i th reservoir h ij is the hydropower generation water head of the i th reservoir at time j and q ij n is the discharge flow for hydropower generation of the i th reservoir at time j the hydropower generation water head h ij can be calculated based on the water level in reservoir and tailwater level considering the hydraulic connections of water level in cascade reservoir system the tailwater level of the upstream reservoir is mainly controlled by its own discharge and the backwater of the downstream reservoir correlations between tail water level of upstream reservoir and water level of downstream reservoir decreases as the distance between the two reservoirs increases the distance between the smx and xld reservoirs is about 130 km to simplify the operation model the backwater effect of the xld reservoir can be ignored 3 2 2 sediment flushing objective to decrease the sediment deposition and maintain the long term operation capacity of the reservoir the sediment in the reservoir should be flushed as much as possible therefore minimization of the annual sediment deposition in each reservoir was selected as the other objective the sediment flushing objective was developed based on the sediment release efficiency equations proposed by tsinghua university and northwest institute of hydrotechnical research 1979 eqs 3a and 3b are suitable to the sediment flushing scenarios with the water level of reservoir raising and dropping respectively these equations reference from handbook of sedimentation engineering edited by the sediment professional committee of chinese hydraulic engineering society the equations are η 1 λ f v s q in q out 2 d 50 when the reservoir level is raising 3a q so q si ψ q out 1 6 j 1 2 b 0 6 q in s in when the reservoir level is droppin or unchanged 3b where η and λ are sediment release efficiency and sediment deposition ratio respectively q in and q out are inflow and outflow of reservoir respectively vs is remaining reservoir capacity except the siltation capacity d 50 is median size of sediment q si is sediment inflow rate q so is sediment outflow rate s in is the sediment concentration of inflow of reservoir j is energy slope b is the width of the channel and ψ is erodibility coefficient which depends on characteristics of suspended sediment and bed load when the sediment diameter is less than 0 1 mm the erodibility coefficient ψ is 650 whereas when the sediment diameter is greater than 0 1 mm the erodibility coefficient ψ is 300 otherwise the erodibility coefficient ψ is generally taken as 180 eq 3a is applicable to the sediment flushing scenario when the water level of reservoir is rising the tsinghua university and northwest institute of hydrotechnical research 1979 plotted the measured sediment release efficiency and its main influencing factors of several reservoirs and obtained the empirical fitting curve of eq 3a which is given by 4 η ij 1 λ ij 1 β 1 x ij 5 β 2 x ij 4 β 3 x ij 3 β 4 x ij 2 β 5 x ij β 6 5 x ij q ij in v ij v i j 1 2 q ij out 2 where η ij is the sediment release efficiency of the i th reservoir at time j λ ij is the sediment deposition ratio of the i th reservoir at time j calculated by the fitting curve formula β is the coefficient of the fitting curve formula x ij is intermediate variable which is calculated by eq 5 v ij and v i j 1 are the initial and final reservoir capacities of the i th reservoir at time j respectively and q ij in and q ij out are the inflow and outflow of the i th reservoir at time j respectively when drawing curves to describe the relationship between the sediment release efficiency and flow according to the historical data there is a bunch of curves corresponding to different d50 for a specific reservoir d50 in its sediment inflow can be determined eq 4 was used to fit this curve chosen by d50 eq 3b is applicable to the sediment flushing scenario when the water level of reservoir is dropping or unchanged which can better fit the historical sediment flushing of reservoirs in the yellow river basin such as the smx reservoir srl 1979 ches 1989 eq 3b has been successfully applied to many reservoirs in multiple countries chang et al 2003 hadihardaja 2009 shokri et al 2013 hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 the objective function of the sediment flushing is calculated by 7 δ y ij y ij in y ij out q ij in s ij in q ij in s ij in η ij q ij in s ij in λ ij min c i 1 r j 1 t δ y ij δ t where δ y ij is sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at time j with positive value for deposition and negative value for erosion y ij in and y ij out are the sediment inflow and sediment flushing of the i th reservoir at time j respectively q ij in is the inflow of the i th reservoir at time j s ij in is the sediment concentration of inflow of the i th reservoir at time j and c is the total sediment deposition in the cascade reservoirs during the whole operation period the positive value for deposition and the negative value for erosion 3 3 time dependent objective function the objective function was established based on the above objectives with time dependent weights coefficient since the different emphasis of operation objectives in flood and non flood seasons the objectives weights should be adjusted to meet the operation requirements in different periods the objective function of the multi objective operation model is given by 8 max f i 1 r j 1 t α in n ij α i δ y δ y ij δ t α i δ y α i δ y 1 in the flood season α i δ y α i δ y 2 in the non flood season where f is the total objective in operation α in and α i δ y are the weights for the hydropower generation objective and sediment flushing objective of the i th reservoir respectively α i δ y 1 is the weight of the sediment flushing objective in flood season and α i δ y 2 is the weight of sediment flushing objective in the non flood season in flood season the main objective of the established operation model is to reduce the sedimentation pressure of reservoirs in non flood season since the inflow is smaller than that in flood season a larger weight assigned for the sediment flushing objective may affect the benefits of water supply and hydropower generation thus the weight of sediment flushing objective in the model was set to a higher value in flood season and a lower value in non flood season it can be seen from eqs 2 and 8 the water level and discharge of the reservoirs are regarded as the decision variables and the inflow is taken as the input to the model therefore the hydropower generation and the sediment flushing are both controlled by the water level and discharge in general the objective of hydropower generation wishes high water level in reservoirs whereas the sediment flushing requires the reservoir to maintain a low water level the conflict between hydropower generation and sediment transport objectives is prominent rashid et al 2015 bai 2019 therefore optimizing the water level and maximizing the comprehensive benefits of reservoirs are the main objectives of this paper 3 4 establishment of constraints considering the reservoir characteristics and the objectives of flood control water supply ecology ice flood control sediment flushing and hydropower generation the operation model is subject to the constraints described below which include water level outflow hydropower generation water balance equation and others 3 4 1 constraints of water level the constraints for the water level are given by 9 z ij min z ij z ij max 10 z i 0 z i beg z it z i end where z ij min and z ij max are the minimum and maximum water level respectively for the i th reservoir at time j in which the flood control and normal water levels are the maximum water levels in flood and non flood seasons respectively and the dead water level is chosen as the minimum water level z ij is the water level for the i th reservoir at time j z i 0 and z it are the water levels for the i th reservoir at the beginning and ending of operation period respectively and z i beg and z i end are the designated water levels for the i th reservoir at the beginning and ending of the operation period respectively 3 4 2 constraints of outflow the constraint for the outflow of reservoirs is given by 11 q ij min q ij out q ij max where q ij min and q ij max are the minimum and maximum allowable outflow respectively for the i th reservoir at time j the safety outflow at the flood control point downstream in flood season and the maximum outflow in ice flood season were taken as the maximum allowable outflow the water supply and basic eco environmental water demand were selected as the minimum outflow q ij out is the outflow of the i th reservoir at time j 3 4 3 constraints of hydropower output the constraint of the hydropower output is given by 12 n ij min n ij n ij max where n ij min and n ij max are the minimum and maximum hydropower outputs respectively of the i th reservoir at time j and n ij is the hydropower output of the i th reservoir at time j 3 4 4 constraints of water balance the water balance of single reservoir and the hydraulic connections between reservoirs should be considered the water balance of single reservoir is given by 13 v i j 1 v ij q ij out q ij in δ t where v ij and v i j 1 are the initial and final reservoir capacities of the i th reservoir at time j considering the hydraulic connections between reservoirs if the upstream and downstream reservoirs are close to each other the time delay of flow can be considered in reservoir operation zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 assuming that it takes duration δt for the outflow from the upstream reservoir to the downstream reservoir the inflow of the downstream reservoir at time t is 14 q down in t q up out t δ t b ij where q down in t is the inflow of the downstream reservoir at time t q up out t δ t is the outflow of the upstream reservoir at time t δ t and b ij is the interval inflow between the upstream and downstream reservoirs 3 4 5 constraints of sediment balance the constraints of sediment balance are given by 15 c i j 1 c ij δ y ij δ t s ij in q ij in s ij out q ij out δ t 16 c i 0 c i beg where c ij and c i j 1 are the initial and final sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at time j s ij out is the sediment concentration of the outflow for the i th reservoir at time j c i 0 is the initial sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at the beginning of the operation period and c i beg is the designated sediment deposition in the i th reservoir at the beginning of operation period 3 4 6 non negative constraints except for the variables of total sediment deposition c sediment deposition δ y ij and sediment deposition ratio λ ij other variables are non negative 3 5 establishment of optimal operation model in this study a water sediment optimal operation model considering hydropower generation sediment flushing flood control ice flood control water supply and ecology was established to investigate the optimal operation mode of the smx and xld reservoirs in which the objectives of flood control ice flood control water supply and ecology were transformed to constraints the optimal reservoir operation model is mainly aimed at searching the maximum operational strategy of reservoirs based on the historical data therefore the two typical historical data sets including high and low flow magnitudes were taken as model input scenarios the proposed model not only considered the water level of reservoirs but also multiple information such as the inflow sediment inflow and outflow of reservoirs both the hydropower generation and sediment flushing of reservoirs were considered as criteria in evaluating the various operation strategies the dddp method was used to solve the operation model the specific steps for establishing the model are given as follows 3 5 1 boundary conditions of the model the initial boundary conditions of the model were set based on the characteristics and the sediment deposition conditions of reservoirs a boundary conditions of water level constraints the upper and lower boundaries of water level for reservoirs were set based on the normal water level flood control limited water level and dead water level and other characteristic water levels in reservoirs the monthly water level constraints of the smx and xld reservoirs are shown in tables 1 and 2 in order to reduce the elevation at the tongguan station the water level of the smx reservoir was controlled below 305 m in flood season and 318 m in non flood season therefore the water level of the smx reservoir was controlled between the dead water level 300 m and the flood control limited water level 305 m in flood season and between the flood control limited water level 305 m and the normal water level 318 m in non flood season for the xld reservoir in order to play the role of flood control in flood season and water supply in non flood season the water level of the reservoir was controlled below the flood control limit water level 254 m in flood season and the normal water level 275 m in non flood season and above the dead water level in whole year b boundary conditions of outflow constraints considering the flood and ice flood control downstream the discharge requirement for water supply ecology and other operation objectives the minimum and maximum outflow in each period was determined the upper limit of output was set based on the hydropower generation capacity and the discharge of hydropower generation capacity the monthly discharge constraints of the smx and xld reservoirs are shown in tables 1 and 2 during flood season in order to ensure the flood control safety at the downstream hyk section the maximum outflow is 4000 m3 s during ice flood season there are the upper and lower boundaries of the discharge for the smx and the xld reservoirs during non flood season in order to ensure the water supply and ecological needs of the basin the minimum outflow is 150 m3 s for the smx reservoir and 200 m3 s for the xld reservoir furthermore the hydraulic connections of cascade reservoir should be considered in the established operation model ten days were used as an operation period since the propagation time from the smx reservoir to the xld reservoir is only a few hours the time delay δ t can be ignored therefore the inflow of the xld reservoir can be calculated by 17 q xld j in q smx j out b smx x l d j where q xld j in is the inflow of the xld reservoir at time j q smx j out is the outflow from the smx reservoir at time j and b smx x l d j is the interval inflow between the smx and xld reservoirs at time j 3 initial sediment deposition conditions of reservoirs the sedimentation of the smx and xld reservoirs is 2 95 billion m3 and 3 35 billion m3 respectively which is set as the boundaries of initial sediment deposition conditions the sediment deposition is serious in the smx reservoir which is in a state of erosion and deposition balance the sediment deposition of the xld reservoir is relatively small and the reservoir is still in the later sediment retaining period 3 5 2 determinations of the weights in the objective function the initial weights in the model were determined according to the initial reservoir sediment deposition and the operation objectives according to the historical data of the yellow river the sediment concentration in flood season is higher than that in non flood season the inflow is large and the sediment concentration is high in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river during flood season the total storage capacity of the smx reservoir is 9 64 billion m3 and the sedimentation is as high as 2 95 billion m3 therefore for the smx reservoir with serious sediment deposition the initial weight of sediment flushing objective should be set to a larger value 0 95 in flood season in contrast the hydropower generation and water supply are the main objectives in non flood season thus the initial weight of sediment flushing objective should be set to a smaller value 0 05 in non flood season for the xld reservoir at present the sediment deposition is relatively small which is 3 35 billion m3 the remaining siltation capacity of the reservoir is 4 20 billion m3 thus this reservoir can play an important role in reducing the sediment deposition of downstream river during flood season and also can undertake the task of hydropower generation therefore the initial weights of xld reservoir for the sediment flushing and hydropower generation objectives are set to be nearly the same value the initial weight for the sediment flushing objective of the xld reservoir is 0 48 in flood and non flood seasons the normalized weights for the model are given in table 3 3 5 3 solutions of optimal operation model the steps of dddp method are given as follows first the initial solution was formulated based on the results of the dynamic programming dp method second an optimization corridor was generated based on the initial operation process third the current objective and optimal trajectory were obtained in the corridor by dp method the new corridor was confirmed by the optimal trajectory fourth the iterations were maintained until the maximum iterations or the last operation results with small differences 0 0005 billion is set as the convergence precision of the dddp method in this study fig 3 displays the flow chart of the dddp method the whole reservoir operation process has been developed and coded in java computer program language 4 results and discussions the historical data at the tongguan station were divided into the high flow and low flow series as mentioned in section 2 the optimization results were analyzed as follows 4 1 hydropower generation sediment flushing and other objectives 4 1 1 hydropower generation according to the established model the optimal operation processes of the cascade reservoirs were obtained results of the annual hydropower generation sediment flushing and total benefits are shown in table 4 for the smx reservoir it can be seen from table 4 that the average annual hydropower generation for the natural high flow the data from 1980 to 1990 and the natural low flow the data from 2000 to 2010 series is approximately 11 17 10 1 and 10 78 10 1 billion kw h respectively the hydropower generation of the reservoir is mainly controlled by the net head since the net head of the smx reservoir is small the discharge has little effect on hydropower generation of the smx reservoir therefore the average annual hydropower generation of the natural high flow and low flow series for the smx reservoir is similar for the xld reservoir the inflow was controlled by the smx reservoir it can be seen from table 4 that when the natural flow is large the controlled inflow of the xld reservoir is still large after the regulation of the smx reservoir and the inflow of the xld reservoir in flood season is equal to the discharge of the smx reservoir the average annual hydropower generation for the controlled high flow and low flow series is 78 84 10 1 and 60 21 10 1 billion kw h respectively demonstrating a significantly decreased trend since the natural flow is high the outflow controlled by the smx reservoir is still large since both the waterhead and the controlled inflow of the xld reservoir are large more hydropower is generated in flood season in general when the natural flow is relatively abundant the outflow of the upstream reservoir is large therefore the inflow of the downstream reservoir tends to be abundant as well for the smx reservoir the average hydropower generation of the high flow and low flow series is similar however for the operation of cascade reservoirs when the water resources are abundant the hydropower generation of the smx xld cascade reservoirs increase significantly 4 1 2 sediment flushing the annual sediment deposition in the two reservoirs is shown in fig 4 the negative value represents erosion and positive value represents deposition for the smx reservoir it can be seen from table 4 and fig 4 a that in flood season a large amount of sedimentation in the reservoir area is flushed when the natural inflow is abundant as shown in years 2 4 6 and 10 when the natural inflow is small little sedimentation in the reservoir area is flushed in non flood season the sediment flushing weight of the smx reservoir is small a large amount of sedimentation is flushed in flood season leading to increased sediment storage capacity of the reservoir thus a large amount of sediment is deposited in the reservoir in non flood season in general erosion and deposition are balanced and the amount of sediment erosion and deposition in most of the years is within 0 05 billion m3 for the xld reservoir it can be seen from fig 4 b that the deposition of the xld reservoir mainly occurs in flood season the reasons are discussed as follows the natural and controlled sediment inflow data for the xld reservoir are given in table 5 the outflow of the smx reservoir is taken as the inflow of the xld reservoir as shown in table 5 the controlled inflow sediment concentration in flood season of the xld reservoir became higher after the operation of the smx reservoir therefore most of sediment has been deposited in the xld reservoir in flood season accounting for 87 98 of the annual deposition generally after regulated by the smx reservoir the sediment concentration of the xld reservoir is higher in flood season which increases the sediment deposition of the xld reservoir for the smx xld cascade reservoirs when the amount of natural inflow and sediment inflow is large the total sedimentation of the cascade reservoirs is also large the response of sedimentation to different sediment boundary conditions each year was discussed results are shown in fig 5 with the increase of the annual initial sedimentation the annual sedimentation in the smx and xld reservoirs decrease the correlation coefficients between the annual sedimentation and initial sedimentation of the smx and xld reservoirs are 0 5603 and 0 8749 respectively indicating a negative correlation for the smx reservoir since the reservoir reach a relative balance between erosion and deposition the sediment is flushed in large quantities to maintain this balance of the reservoir with the increased initial sediment boundary condition for the xld reservoir with the increase in reservoir sedimentation the remaining storage of the reservoir decreases gradually the optimization process is inclined to flush more sediment to maintain the long term stable operation of the reservoir therefore the annual sedimentation in the reservoir decreases with the increasing annual initial sedimentation boundaries 4 1 3 flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives the flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives were transformed to constraints in the operation model which limited the outflow of the xld reservoir the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir is given in table 6 the data in table 6 demonstrates that the maximum monthly outflow for the xld reservoir does not exceed 4000 m3 s and the outflow in all periods meets the constraints of flood control for ice flood control the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir in december is controlled within 500 600 m3 s in january and february the outflow is controlled within 300 400 m3 s in addition for the water supply and ecological objectives from april to june the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir is not less than 200 m3 s as shown in table 6 the monthly outflow of the xld reservoir in each period meets the requirements of ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives therefore based on the initial weight of the model all the objectives can be guaranteed 4 2 discussions of the weights in the time dependent model the operation results based on different weights were discussed to identify the relationship among these objectives the various weights under different water and sediment scenarios were discussed in addition a current operation model of the smx and xld reservoirs was established whose operation results were compared with the optimal operation method the current operation schemes for the smx and xld reservoirs are described as follows the water level in non flood and flood seasons cannot exceed 318 m and 305 m respectively when the inflow in flood season exceeds 1500 m3 s an ungated operation rules should be used for the smx reservoir zheng et al 2015 wang 2020 for the xld reservoir the current operation process is divided into three periods during flood season the water level of the xld reservoir should be below the flood control limited water level 254 m from mid july to late october at the end of flood season the reservoir begins to store water and the water level of reservoir continues rising from november to june of the next year the water level is maintained at a high level to meet the water demand of the downstream yellow river during late june to early july the water level of the xld reservoir decreases significantly to prepare for the arrival of the flood season wang et al 2019 4 2 1 reservoir operation results based on different weights in flood season for the smx reservoir with serious sediment deposition the main task in flood season is to flush sediment as much as possible to keep the balance between erosion and deposition in the reservoir area therefore the weights of the smx reservoir in flood season should continue to be set a high value for the xld reservoir different weight schemes were selected in flood season the influence of the weights on the hydropower generation and sediment flushing of the xld reservoir in flood season was discussed specifically the weight of the xld reservoir in non flood season α 2 δ y 2 was fixed and the weights in flood season α 2 δ y 1 was time variant for sediment flushing the benefit of hydropower generation was calculated based on the local electricity price of 0 368 yuan kw h and the benefit of sediment deposition was calculated based on the cost of manual desilting of 15 yuan m3 zhang et al 2017 the total hydropower generation sediment deposition and benefits of the xld reservoir based on different weight scenarios in flood season of the 22 years are given in fig 6 and table 7 it can be seen from fig 6 and table 7 that with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 for the sediment flushing in flood season the total hydropower generation and sediment deposition in 22 years present a decreasing trend and the total benefits increase obviously the sediment deposition decreases uniformly with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 when the weight α 2 δ y 1 less than 0 85 the hydropower generation decreases slowly the hydropower generation decreases rapidly when the weight α 2 δ y 1 exceeds 0 85 the average annual hydropower generation sediment deposition and water level in flood season for the high and low flow series under different weight scenarios are shown in table 8 when the weight of sediment flushing is less than 0 85 the water level in flood season drops slightly and the hydropower generation decreases slowly when the weight of sediment flushing increases to 0 85 the water level in flood season for the high flow series drops rapidly to flush sediment as much as possible resulting in a rapid decline in hydropower generation for the optimal weight as shown in table 7 and fig 6 when the sediment flushing weight reaches 0 98 the maximum total benefit is 17 33 billion yuan in addition as shown in table 8 for the two series with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 the sediment deposition in the reservoir area decreases obviously for the high flow series in contrast for the low flow series with the increase in the weight α 2 δ y 1 the decrease in sediment deposition is not so obvious in general the sediment deposition in the reservoir area for the high and low flow series decrease significantly with the increase weight of the sediment flushing compared with the initial weight scenario the sedimentation is reduced by approximately 1 6 billion m3 and the power generation reduced by 14 billion kw h therefore the total benefit can be significantly improved by increasing the sediment flushing weight in flood season for the xld reservoir compared with the current operation scheme the optimal weight scenario only increases the sedimentation by 0 2 billion m3 but the hydropower generation increases by 70 billion kw h the total benefits in 22 years increases by 24 billion yuan therefore for the high flow years in flood season the weight of the sediment flushing for the xld reservoir can be increased appropriately there are some trade offs of water use for hydropower generation and sediment flushing 4 2 2 reservoir operation results based on different weights in non flood season in order to discuss the influence of changing weights in non flood season the weights in flood season were fixed first the weight for the xld reservoir in non flood season was changed and the initial weight was used for the smx reservoir the influences of the weights in non flood season on hydropower generation and sediment flushing were investigated the total hydropower generation sediment deposition and benefits of the smx and xld reservoirs based on different weight scenarios in non flood season of the 22 years are demonstrated in figs 7 and 8 and tables 9 11 4 2 2 1 results of the smx reservoir as shown in fig 7 and table 9 with the increased weight for the sediment flushing in non flood season the hydropower generation and sediment deposition of the smx reservoir are basically unchanged for the hydropower generation since the installed capacity of the reservoir is small and the water level in non flood season is high the output in most periods is equal to the installed capacity with the increased sediment flushing weight in non flood season the water level drops slightly and the output is still equal to the installed capacity thus the hydropower generation is basically unchanged for the sediment deposition since the smx reservoir reaches a balance between the erosion and deposition increasing the sediment flushing in non flood season results in more sediment deposition in flood season sediment deposition in the reservoir area in flood and non flood seasons under different weights are shown in table 10 when the weight equals the initial value 0 05 the average sediment deposition in non flood season is 0 66 10 1 billion m3 and the sediment flushing in flood season is 0 66 10 1 billion m3 when the weight increasing to 0 60 and 0 90 the average sediment deposition drops to 0 49 10 1 billion m3 and 0 44 10 1 billion m3 respectively and the average sediment flushing drops to 0 50 10 1 billion m3 and 0 46 10 1 billion m3 respectively thus with increased weight α 2 δ y 2 the sediment flushing increases slightly in non flood season and decreases in flood season which results in unchanged total sediment deposition therefore increasing the weight for the sediment flushing in non flood season cannot reduce reservoir sedimentation as shown in table 9 the maximum total benefit is 9 26 billion yuan when the sediment flushing weight in non flood season reaches 0 48 compared with the initial weight scenario the sedimentation is reduced by approximately 0 11 10 1 billion m3 whereas the hydropower generation remains unchanged and the total benefits increases only by 0 1 billion yuan in general increasing the weight of sediment flushing in non flood season has little effect on the total benefits of the smx reservoir compared with the current operation scheme the optimal weight scenario reduces the sedimentation in the reservoir area by 0 3 10 1 billion m3 and the hydropower generation increases by 5 6 billion kw h the total benefits in 22 years increases by 2 5 billion yuan to research the influence of weight change of the smx reservoir on the xld reservoir the change of sediment concentration of the smx reservoir with weight change of the xld reservoir is discussed when the sediment flushed from the upstream reservoir to the downstream reservoir the sediment inflow of downstream reservoir may increase as well since the sediment inflow in non flood season is small and the regulation of upstream reservoir has little influence on the sediment inflow of downstream reservoir the sediment inflow in the xld reservoir is basically unchanged with the changing weights of the smx reservoir in non flood season it can be seen from table 1 that when the sediment flushing weight changing from 0 3 to 0 98 only 0 012billion m3 of sediment is flushed away from the smx reservoir and the total benefit of the reservoir is basically unchanged the sediment inflow of the xld reservoir did not change obviously with the changing weights of the smx reservoir in non flood season therefore the weights changes of the smx reservoir in non flood season has little effect on the xld reservoir 4 2 2 2 results of the xld reservoir as shown in fig 8 and table 11 for the xld reservoir the hydropower generation and sediment deposition are unchanged when the weight for sediment flushing in non flood season is less than 0 8 the total hydropower generation and sediment deposition begins to decrease when the weight exceeds 0 8 the reasons are as follows as shown in tables 12 and 13 data of the sediment inflow of the smx and xld reservoirs in 22 years indicate that the sediment inflow in flood season is greater than that in non flood season the natural water and sediment in the yellow river basin increase in flood season and decrease in non flood season moreover in flood season since the inflow and sediment inflow of the xld reservoir are regulated by the smx reservoir considerable sediment is flushed downstream resulting in more concentrated sediment inflow in the xld reservoir this behavior results in a more obvious annual difference in the sediment inflow therefore the sediment inflow of the xld reservoir in non flood season is much less than that in flood season in non flood season the total sediment deposition is not sensitive to changes in the weight of sediment flushing when the weight is low and decrease when the weight exceeds a certain value therefore to a certain extent with the increase in the weight for sediment flushing in non flood season the reservoir sedimentation can be reduced however the effect of increasing the weight for sediment flushing in non flood season is worse than that in the flood season for the optimal weight data in fig 8 and table 11 the maximum total benefit is 12 85 billion yuan when the sediment flushing weight in non flood season reaches 0 95 compared with the initial weight scenario the sedimentation is reduced by approximately 1 2 billion m3 whereas the hydropower generation decreases by approximately 10 billion kw h and the total benefits increase by 14 billion yuan compared with the current operation scheme the sedimentation increases by 0 6 billion m3 based on the optimal weight scenario but the hydropower generation increases by 80 billion kw h and the total benefits in 22 years increases by approximately 20 billion yuan 4 3 discussions of the constraints in order to investigate the sensitivity of the objective function to the constraints the xld reservoir was taken as an example the upper boundary of the water level was increased by 5 m and the upper boundary of the flow constraint was increased by 1000 m3 s operation results of the xld reservoir based on different water level and outflow constraints are given in table 14 as shown in table 14 compared to the initial operation results the average water level in reservoir increases by 3 5 m which results in hydropower generation and sediment deposition increasing to 70 million kw h and 25 million m3 respectively thus the model is sensitive to the changes of water level constraint for the outflow constraint it can be seen that both hydropower generation and sediment deposition are slightly reduced therefore compared to the outflow constraint the water level constraint is much more sensitive to the objective functions 5 conclusions this paper addresses the prominent problem of water sediment management in the sediment laden river the multi objective water sediment optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs was established which considers hydropower generation sediment flushing flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives a time dependent objective function was proposed innovatively in the model and the sediment release efficiency equations considering different sediment flushing scenarios were introduced into the water and sediment operation the smx and xld reservoirs on the yellow river were selected as case studies two typical data sets including high and low flow magnitudes were selected as model input scenarios the operation processes with various weight schemes in flood and non flood seasons were discussed the main results are summarized as follows 1 for sediment laden rivers such as the yellow river the proposed model can achieve the maximization of the hydropower generation and sediment flushing benefits for the high flow and low flow series and results indicate that the proposed model can guarantee the flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives for the smx reservoir the average annual hydropower generation calculated based on the natural high flow and low flow series is similar and the erosion and deposition in the reservoir areas are balanced for the natural high flow and low flow series for the xld reservoir the hydropower generation increases with the increasing of inflow magnitude and most of the sediment inflow is deposited in the reservoir for the high flow series for the smx xld cascade reservoir when the water resources are abundant the hydropower generation reservoirs increase significantly 2 compared with the current operation scheme the proposed model optimizes the water and sediment regulation process and significantly improves the hydropower generation and sediment flushing benefits of cascade reservoir in flood season the sediment deposition in the reservoir area decreases significantly with the increase weight of the sediment flushing thus the weights for sediment flushing in flood season can be increased appropriately to improve the comprehensive benefits of the reservoirs in sediment laden rivers in non flood season the hydropower generation and sediment deposition of cascade reservoirs change not so obviously with the increase weight for the sediment flushing specifically for the yellow river the weight for sediment flushing of the smx reservoir in flood season should be set a large value and the weight for sediment flushing of the xld reservoir in flood and non flood seasons can be set to 0 6 0 8 and 0 3 0 8 respectively which can reduce the sedimentation in the downstream channel and maximize the total benefits of the cascade reservoirs 3 the water sediment optimal operation model is sensitive to the changes of the water level constraints with the increase of the boundaries of water level constraints the hydropower generation and sedimentation of reservoir increase significantly raising the water level constraints is conducive to hydropower generation while not conducive to sediment flushing and flood control therefore the boundaries of water level constraints should be determined according to hydropower generation sediment flushing flood control and other objectives of the reservoirs 4 the operation objectives can be flexibly adjusted by the time dependent weights function the reasonable weight schemes can be selected according to different operation scenarios which can effectively improve the comprehensive benefits of cascade reservoirs in addition the time dependent objective function can provide a reference for the multi objective optimal operation of cascade reservoirs the multi objective water sediment optimal operation model of cascade reservoirs can demonstrate the optimal water sediment operation mode in which the flood control ice flood control water supply and ecological objectives can be guaranteed the optimal operation model provides a model basis for the water sediment energy joint operation of large scale reservoir group in the sediment laden basins credit authorship

3394,atmospheric deposition has a significant impact on the nutritional status and limitations of aquatic ecosystems however the impacts have considerable uncertainty due to a lack of quantification of the indirect nitrogen n deposition in terms of atmospheric land surface water bodies fluxes in this study we combined monitoring n deposition datasets with semi distributed modeling to characterize the baseline n flow in tributary streams in the three gorges reservoir region of china and predicted the varying impacts of indirect n deposition from 2006 to 2015 this study indicated that the indirect n deposition as an important n source accounted for 10 47 of the total n flow of tributary streams the clean air action or carbon neutral would induce a reduction of deposition and then reduced the tributary n flux by 0 45 104 1 09 104 t yr 1 meanwhile the declining n deposition would result in the tributary n phosphorus p stoichiometry to 22 04 approaching from p limitation to n limitation the variation in n p ratio was smaller in agricultural watersheds than those forest and grass dominated watersheds our finding indicated that process toward mitigating water quality will be difficult without consideration the indirect impacts of n deposition and attention should be paid to variations in nutrient limitation and the plankton communities of inland waters due to the variation of regional or global n deposition keywords atmospheric n deposition n flux water quality tributary stream nitrogen limitation nonpoint source pollution 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential elements for the synthesis of nuclei and proteins the two most important polymers of life the n cycle which has a broad and profound impact on an ecosystem is an important biogeochemical cycle and is entirely dependent on the reduction oxidation reaction primarily mediated by microorganisms and fungi dong et al 2020 peñuelas et al 2013 anthropogenic activities have had great impacts on the global n cycle and led to an increase in the production of reactive n nr erisman et al 2008 fowler et al 2013 this is concerning because the rapid increases in worldwide nr emissions would cause serious air pollution which in turn will induce excessive n deposition in natural ecosystems pan et al 2018 sickles and shadwick 2015 globally nr deposition comes from fossil fuel burning accounting for 25 33 tg n yr 1 while the contribution of fertilizer application reached to 118 tg n yr 1up to 2012 peñuelas et al 2013 only approximately 22 of the total human input of n eventually accumulates in the soil and biomass where 35 enters ocean through atmospheric deposition 17 and river runoff 18 unesco 2007 correspondingly p cycling and deposition are especially slow and low compared with n and the imbalance of n and p has caused major variation in the nutrient limitation and status of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2009 galloway et al 2008 atmospheric n deposition increased from 31 6 to 195 0 tg n yr 1 globally and from 13 2 to 21 0 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in china during the 1980s and 2000s galloway et al 2004 gao et al 2020 liu et al 2013 the excessive n input via atmospheric n wet and dry deposition has noticeable impact on the soil and water chemistry of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems schlesinger 2009 templer et al 2012 aquatic ecosystems receive n from the direct and indirect n deposition for a typical watershed direct n deposition is often defined as the n from atmosphere falling on the targeted water bodies while the indirect n deposition represents the n flux from atmosphere to land surface and then to nearby water bodies dong et al 2020 in china the non point source pollution 14 50 3 10 tg n yr 1 has been identified as the main source of n in inland water of which agricultural emissions accounted for 59 yu et al 2019 n deposition is also important in the n budget of aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2013 the patterns of direct n deposition flux can be obtained from in situ measurements and atmospheric physics chemistry models but the indirect n deposition is still uncertain because of the complex biogeochemical transformation and transportation of different n forms on land surface the isotope method can trace the source of nitrate and researches showed that the contribution of wet deposition reaches 50 or even 67 of nitrate in surface rivers buda and dewalle 2009 chen et al 2012 however this isotopic geochemistry is not enough to reveal the long term and large scale geochemical cycle process of n due to the complexity of the watershed system zhang et al 2018 in the late 20th and early 21st centuries many countries began to implement clean air action to control nr emissions to protect public health which inevitably affected the global n deposition kanter et al 2020 and nutrient balance in aquatic ecosystems gu et al 2015 studies have revealed the global impact of atmospherically deposited n on lakes indicating that human nr has caused an increase in the n p stoichiometry and thus the p limitation of phytoplankton growth and possibly even forest growth elser et al 2009 goswami et al 2018 freshwater phytoplankton assemblages are sensitive to alterations in the n p supply ratio and variations in n inputs will likely induce a shift in phytoplankton community composition peñuelas et al 2013 thus an improved understanding of the variation in n deposition on the n p stoichiometry of aquatic systems is critical for forecasting responses to future decreased n deposition and the potential impact of nutrient limitation on global rivers and lakes in this study we focus on the n flow from atmosphere to land surface and then to the receiving water and quantified the related impacts on n budget and nutrient limitation the n deposition data was integrated with the watershed model to simulate the entire biogeochemical process of n and the impacts of variation of n deposition the three gorges reservoir region tgrr in china was selected for detailed investigation the objectives of this study were to characterize the impacts of indirect n deposition on the transformation of n in the terrestrial area the n flow of tributaries and its implications for aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tgrr 28 10 32 13 n 105 17 110 11 e china which resides in the east asia region and has a high global n deposition flux fig 1 provides an ideal ecosystem to estimate the impact of atmospheric deposition on n flow and the nutritional status of inland waters the study area has experienced severe air pollution due to the development of the chemical industry in chongqing municipality and then air quality has been improving as a result of industry upgrades and pollution control the tgrr watershed covers a total area of 6 6 104 km2 and has approximately 80 tributaries range from just 50 38 km2 to as large as 7039 57 km2 with the area of 16 tributaries greater than 1000 km2 fig 1 dam interception and periodic impoundment of the tgrr have led to a slowdown of water velocity and have prolonged the hydraulic residence time resulting in periodic algal blooms consequently the tgrr has become a hotspot for eutrophication investigations liu et al 2012 2 2 atmospheric deposition data 2 2 1 data for wet n deposition the observational n deposition data were collected from the chinese ecosystem research network cern yu et al 2019 the dataset mainly includes the monitoring data from 41 sites of the cern 43 sites from national nitrogen deposition monitoring network 81 stations from the national acid deposition monitoring network and the monitoring data collected from published papers these datasets were divided into four subsets 1996 2000 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 to study the spatiotemporal impacts of wet n deposition fig a1 the wet deposition data of the tgrr were extracted from the national n deposition dataset fig a2 2 2 2 data for dry n deposition the dry n deposition data for tgrr was extracted from the two subsets 2006 2010 2011 2015 fig a3 of the five year interval dataset released by the chinese ecosystem research network http www cnern org cn this network developed remote sensing models to estimate dry deposition flux using no2 and nh3 satellite and ground measurements jia et al 2016 then the 10 km resolution national dry deposition of no2 hno3 and no3 as well as nh3 and nh4 datasets were obtained and the n dry deposition data of the tgrr is given in fig a4 the observational data on the cern showed that the amount of p deposition was small compared to n therefore this study only focused on the indirect n deposition yu et al 2019 2 3 estimation of tributary n flow caused by n deposition the process based watershed models are used in this study for the quantification of atmospheric land surface waterbody n flux however the construction of watershed models for the entire tgrr is difficult due to the complexity of the models and with a shortage of the observed data singh et al 2005 in this study the parameter sets were firstly obtained from some typical catchments and then expended to the surrounding area based on our proposed small scale watershed extended method swem hong et al 2012 for the tgrr the whole watershed was divided into four parts the yulin xiaojiang daning and xiangxi districts based on data availability and partition homogeneity and four parameter sets were calibrated and validated in construction of topography area size and adequacy of monitoring data then these calibrated parameters were extended to all 80 watersheds in the corresponding districts of the study area fig a5 and 80 watershed models were finally constructed for n flow simulation in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat model which is semi distributed and process based was constructed while the tgrr was divided into multiple sub watersheds and further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus containing homogeneous slope land use and soil characteristics the qual2e equation was selected to describe the processes of nutrient transformation and degradation in the channel as presented in the swat model the detailed description could be found in previous studies teshager et al 2017 chen et al 2019 by coupling n deposition monitoring data with the swat model the no3 and nh4 deposited terrestrially through precipitation were added to the no3 and nh4 pools in the surface 10 mm soil of the corresponding sub watersheds while no3 and nh4 through dry deposition were added to the n pool of the surface soil of the sub watersheds the equation for n deposition in the swat model eqs 1 4 are as follows no 3 r a i n 0 01 r no 3 r day 2 nh 4 r a i n 0 01 r nh 4 r day 3 n o 3 l y 1 no 3 l y 1 no 3 d r y d e p 4 n h 4 l y 1 nh 4 l y 1 nh 4 d r y d e p where no3rain and nh4rain are the amounts of nitrate and ammonium entering the soil through precipitation respectively kg ha 1 rno3 and rnh4 are the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in precipitation respectively mg l 1 rday is the precipitation no3ly 1 and nh4ly 1 are the amounts of nitrate and ammonium in the soil respectively kg ha 1 no3drydep and nh4drydep are the daily dry deposition amounts of nitrate and ammonium respectively kg ha 1 the wet deposition data in the swat model require the concentrations of no3 and nh4 in precipitation while dry deposition can input the no3 and nh4 fluxes directly therefore wet deposition flux was converted into concentration data which is shown as follows 5 c w f w 100 p t where cw is the concentration of no3 and nh4 in precipitation fw is the wet no3 and nh4 flux of each sub watershed in the study area which was obtained by arcgis extracting the average value of all grids in the sub watershed pt is the annual precipitation amount in each sub watershed in the study area which was obtained by the meteorological data in the study area the input data including digital elevation map dem meteorological data land use types soil type and cultivation measures was given in the supporting information si hydrology and water quality data in the past twenty years were collected from local government land and then used for model calibration wastewater treatment plant and industrial enterprise data in the study area were collected and their emissions were mainly obtained through the emission coefficient the average inlet concentrations of tn nh4 and tp of the wastewater treatment plant used in this study were 10 5 mg l 1 37 mg l and 0 29 mg l the impacts of rural and domestic enterprises were calculated according to the pollution production and discharge coefficient and were added as a point source for the sub watersheds of each typical watershed the swat cup was used for calibration as details in si the n flux of tributary stream was calculated as follows 6 q sub i 1 n q i i 1 n j 1 m a sub i j c sub i j 7 t i 1 n t i i 1 n j 1 m t ij where qsub is the total yield of n qi is the yield from part i asub ij is the area of sub watershed j in part i and csub ij is the load intensity of the n from the corresponding sub watersheds t is the n flow from the tributary watersheds ti is the total n flow at the outlet of the watershed in part i and tij is the n flow at the outlet of catchment j in part i the information about the p flow of tributary streams of this study can be found in the previous study chen et al 2021 2 4 n deposition scenario gu et al 2015 have demonstrated that the n deposition began to stabilize in 2001 2005 due to the decline in wet nh4 deposition however the wet nh4 deposition in the tgrr increased from 1996 to 2010 and then decreased while the wet no3 deposition increased from 1996 to 2005 and then remained stable from 2006 to 2015 as shown in fig a4 the dry no3 and nh4 deposition remained stable from 2006 to 2015 therefore we setup three scenarios for comparison in the first scenario s1 the wet and dry n deposition were set to 0 to obtain the baseline n flow form different land use types to water bodies in the second scenario s2 and third scenario s3 the actual deposition data and the high n deposition data from 2001 to 2005 was then used respectively the indirect n deposition and the impacts of the varying n deposition due to air quality improvement were then obtained as follows 8 f n i n d i r e c t t s 2 t s 1 9 f impact t s 3 t s 2 where the fn indirect is the indirect n deposition that is the n transport from air to land surface and then to waters ts1 ts2 and ts3 are the n flow from the tributary watersheds under s1 s2 and s3 respectively fimpact revealed the impacts of the varying n deposition due to air quality improvement 2 5 nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry in this study the river n p stoichiometry under different scenarios was also quantified to reflected variation in n deposition on water quality typically the n p stoichiometry was used to determine the limiting nutrient for water eutrophication conley et al 2009 guildford and hecky 2000 suggested that n p mole ranging from 22 to 50 indicated n and p co limitation both in lakes and oceans worldwide whereas the n p lower than 22 or higher than 50 represented n limited or p limited respectively these thresholds were then used for this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of n flux caused by n deposition estimating the contribution of n deposition is fundamental to the understanding of the watershed n budget and is prerequisite for the formulation of n management zhan et al 2017 however previous studies have focused more on the direct n deposition into water but ignored the quantification of indirect n deposition and the comparison with the varying contribution of n deposition gao et al 2020 peñuelas et al 2012 this part of the n cycle was quantified and presented in fig 2 the indirect n deposition showed an upward trend after 2009 and ranged from 1 04 104 to 1 42 104 t yr 1 in 2006 2015 with a mean value of 1 23 104 t yr 1 the major species were nitrate n organic n and ammonia n which accounted for 63 81 24 92 and 9 83 of the total indirect n deposition table 1 meantime the n flux of tributary stream ranged from 9 02 104 to 16 75 104 t yr 1 in 2006 2015 with a mean value of 11 74 104 t yr 1 nitrate n dominated the total flux followed by organic n and ammonia n which accounted for 71 00 23 00 and 4 00 of the river n table 1 cropland paddy field and forestland contributed 35 09 27 65 and 20 73 of the n flux and the indirect n deposition accounted for 10 47 and was the fourth contributor table a1 in comparison the total indirect and direct contribution of n deposition is 12 94 while the direct n deposition contributed only 2 47 which indicated that the impacts of n deposition might be underestimated in addition excessive n deposition directly into inland water would increase the n concentration in this study the average n concentration of the streams ranged from 1 61 to 1 90 mg l 1 and the indirect n deposition made the tributary n concentration increase by 0 12 0 17 mg l 1 fig a6 our study provides insight into the n budget in fragile water of tgrr as well as other large receiving waterbodies latimer and charpentier 2010 reported that indirect n deposition accounted for 16 of the n flow to estuaries in southern new england using a watershed loading model studies in the mississippi river and chesapeake bay watershed indicated that approximately 19 5 and 20 30 of the n into the estuaries came from the indirect n deposition sheeder et al 2002 burns et al 2021 robertson and saad 2021 in addition deng et al 2021 revealed that indirect n deposition to n flux of tributary stream was 13 3 15 2 in forest watersheds in china from 2015 to 2017 using the expert coefficient these discrepancies between this study and previous evaluations stem from two explanations firstly the global n deposition have obvious spatial distribution characteristics east asia europe eastern north america and southern brazil were the hotspots for inorganic n deposition and n deposition in east asia presented a downward trend in recent years ackerman et al 2019 the contribution of n deposition depended strongly on the composition of land uses as well secondly the export coefficient and watershed loading models do not consider the migration and transformation of n which might lead to an overestimation of the indirect n deposition chen et al 2019 n deposition is linked to deteriorating water quality and impacts aquatic organisms li et al 2016 research has revealed that n deposition directly into lakes accounts for 13 6 of the annual total n input among the higher deposition regions of east asia and the percentage is as high as 48 in may and june zhan et al 2017 in addition excessive n deposition directly into inland water would increase the n concentration by 76 6 93 9 μg l 1 yr 1 and significantly accelerate the waterbody eutrophication gao et al 2019 compared with the results of this study the impact of atmospheric n deposition on the water quality may be much more serious although the n flow from the watershed already included n deposition to terrestrial areas its accurate quantification is still of great significance esser et al 2011 3 2 response of stream n flow to the variation of n deposition variation in n deposition also affects the migration and transformation of n in terrestrial areas and the subsequent n export to receiving waterbodies sickles and shadwick 2015 this variation caused by the alteration in n deposition was quantified and showed in fig 3 the indirect n deposition ranged from 1 56 104 to 2 51 104 t yr 1 with a mean of 2 09 104 t yr 1 under scenario s3 the major species were nitrate n 1 26 0 13 104 t yr 1 60 38 organic n 0 57 0 16 104 t yr 1 27 41 and ammonia n 0 20 0 05 104 t yr 1 9 40 accounting for 97 19 of the total indirect deposition this also accounted for 16 62 of the n flux of tributary stream table a1 which was higher than that under scenario s2 fig 2 the variation in the indirect n deposition ranged from 0 45 104 to 1 09 104 t yr 1 with a mean of 0 86 104 t yr 1 due to variation in n deposition s2 to s3 and the proportions of nitrate n organic n ammonia n and nitrite n were 55 46 30 97 8 78 and 4 79 respectively the results proved that the extensive biogeochemical reactions in terrestrial area could lead to different fate of imported n among the increments in stream n caused by n deposition the proportions of organic n and nitrite n increased while that of nitrate n decreased the results proved that the extensive biogeochemical reactions in terrestrial area could lead to different fate of imported n based on this study 6 95 and 9 76 of n deposition to terrestrial area would transport into yangtze river under scenarios s2 and s3 respectively table a1 this means that as soil and vegetation will be in n saturation status the n transformation process will accelerate the input into rivers under n deposition studies have shown that nr deposition into the terrestrial area in china was about 2 7 to 4 6 tg n yr 1 gu et al 2015 houlton et al 2006 but the nr transported to rivers reached 18 1 tg n yr 1 this indicates that the additional nr deposition promotes the biogeochemical cycle of n in the terrestrial areas basically rely on redox reaction involving microorganisms schlesinger 2009 n deposition increases the readily available inorganic n in soil which is not sequestered by vegetation and is transformed through denitrification to a gaseous form n2 n2o no depending on the soil physical conditions and oxidation state fowler et al 2013 denier van der gon and bleeker 2005 indicated that terrestrial soils account for 22 of total global denitrification and an average of 150 00 tg n yr 1 was transported to the atmosphere in gaseous form n inputs have been found to influence the emissions of n2o from a variety of ecosystems due to the greatly enhanced denitrification of soil microorganisms mccrackin and elser 2011 the stimulating effect of n deposition on the global grassland n2o emission rate was 1 6 0 14 tg n yr 1 du et al 2021 indeed it has been found that increasing wet ammonia n deposition led to increases in n2o emissions and approximately 3 5 4 7 of deposited n was re emitted in the form of n2o beaulieu et al 2011 therefore nitrate n was depleted by denitrification and resulting in a decrease in the proportion of nitrate n in the n flux of tributary stream fig 4 since inorganic n is a biologically effective fertilizer its increase provided a large amount of available n for organisms and thereby reduced the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms which would also promote more organic n into waterbodies gu et al 2015 jian et al 2016 historical increases in emissions and atmospheric n deposition have been proven to have profound effects on terrestrial ecosystems but the carbon neutral clean air act and their associated rules have led to decrease in the emissions and deposition of reduced n in china yu et al 2019 the cycles of carbon and n are strongly interrelated forest carbon sequestration is driven by net primary production and biomass production hence dynamic replacement may be directly limited by n availability groffman et al 2018 nevertheless most processes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are expected to have a certain degree of hysteresis in response to reduced n deposition and the greatest response delay is related to the slow variation of plant and soil organic matter n pool peñuelas et al 2012 with the decrease in n deposition the core is a comprehensive understanding of how n limitation and excess n can occur simultaneously and how ecosystems can manipulate the reduction of available n while affected by the excess n 3 3 impacts of n deposition on n p ratio anthropogenic activities have significantly changed air quality and the resulting atmospheric n deposition has altered the magnitude of the nutrient status although p was proven to be a limited nutrient for phytoplankton imbalanced human induced inputs of n and p would alter nutrient limitation and affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems loladze and elser 2011 the n p ratio can be used as indicator to codetermine the limiting nutrient for algae in aquatic ecosystems as shown in fig 5 a the n p ratio in the tributaries showed an obvious spatial distribution lower n p ratio appeared in the western streams of tgrr it could be seen that small tributaries always had n p ratios lower than 22 while large tributaries were the opposite however with the decrease in n deposition n p ratio of about 1 4 of the tributaries decreased to below 22 which is the p limitation threshold fig 5a and b the average n p ratios of the tributaries were 25 74 and 23 97 under the s3 and s2 respectively fig a7 this indicated that with the improvement of air quality or the carbon neutral program the reduction of n deposition will lead to changes in the nutrient limitation of waterbodies these are common patterns throughout the world that small tributaries had n p ratios lower than 22 as the intensive agriculture leads to increased particle bound n and p and reduced n p ratios heisler et al 2008 stets et al 2020 tributary inflows could create local variation in algal communities in the receiving waterbody by shifting the relative availability of different nutrients thereby giving competitive advantage to a particular category ho et al 2019 the hydraulic power of high discharge plumes from large streams enables them to transport their nutrients further offshore than smaller streams small plumes typically lack the coherence and momentum to reach the pelagic zone and instead are retained along the riverbank danger et al 2008 the inflows from small tributary streams tend to become trapped near the shore and have a lower n p ratio these small systems should have an effective impact on the nutritional status of the receiving waterbody elser et al 2009 have showed that phytoplankton growth was generally n limited under low n deposition while in high n deposition phytoplankton growth was constantly p limited the results of this study also proved that with the improvement of air quality or the carbon neutral the reduction of n deposition will lead to changes in the nutrient limitation of waterbodies furthermore nutrient enrichment bioassays demonstrated an inverse relationship between phytoplankton n and p limitation liu et al 2012 therefore improving air quality and reducing n deposition will alleviate or even change the nutrient restriction characteristics of aquatic ecosystems even if other n sources remain stable globally n deposition in east asia the united states and europe presented downward trends which mainly benefitted from the clean air act and climate plans houlton et al 2006 sickles and shadwick 2015 zheng et al 2018 weakened phytoplankton p limitation may also repair damaged food webs in freshwater systems because studies proved that p limited algae are poor quality food for zooplankton because of unsuitable biochemical composition or low p content peñuelas et al 2013 3 4 implications and uncertainty with the results presented in this study n deposition to terrestrial areas is an important source of n flux of tributary stream and provides a new source of natural fertilizer for plant and crop growth which can reduce the use of chemical fertilizers yu et al 2019 clarifying the contribution of n deposition helped us understand the sources of nutrients and further helps to formulate better management to reduce the eutrophication of fragile waterbodies in addition with the air quality improvement or carbon neutral actions implementing in many countries and regions the reduced n deposition in regional areas caused by these actions would change the p limitation and nutritional status of aquatic ecosystems in unexpected way which deserve attention elser et al 2009 sickles and shadwick 2015 the quantitative results of this study on the variations in n p ratios are helpful for obtaining a deeper understanding of the cross media effects of altering n deposition in this study the uncertainty of the results come mainly from the swat model and the n deposition data our previous studies shen et al 2008 2010 and 2012 gong et al 2011 have quantified the modelling uncertainty relating to nonpoint source simulation by using the first order error analysis foea and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue those sensitive parameters such as initial scs cn ii value cn2 sol orgn initial humic organic nitrogen in soil layer usle p usle support practice factor sol z depth from soil surface to bottom of layer and esco were selected and defined for different regions land uses and soil types to reach a more accurate simulation besides the uncertainty n deposition data mainly come from the empirical remote model for dry deposition and interpolation method for wet deposition posted on the cern yu et al 2019 have showed that the regression coefficients were greater than 0 6 for both dry and wet n deposition flux figs a12 and a13 indicating a reliable deposition dataset however these deposition data were not calibrated due to the difficulty of obtaining long term and large scale field deposition data which is the major uncertainty source of this study future research is suggested to collect more local data for validating the spatial distribution of n deposition 4 conclusion this study explored the indirect n deposition to the n flux of tributary streams in the tgrr and its spatial temporal variations the contribution of n deposition accounted for approximately 12 94 of the n flux of tributary stream of which the indirect n deposition accounted for approximately 10 47 the indirect n deposition is one of the non negligible sources of n nutrients in aquatic ecosystems especially in areas with high n deposition a better understanding of the contribution of n deposition would help to better watershed management besides the decrease in n deposition in the tgrr has reduced the n p ratio of tributary streams from 25 74 to 23 97 and will be further reduced to 22 04 in the future which would convers aquatic ecosystem from p limitation to n limitation this indicated that the impact of reduced n deposition on the nutrient limitation of ecosystems and aquatic phytoplankton communities

3394,atmospheric deposition has a significant impact on the nutritional status and limitations of aquatic ecosystems however the impacts have considerable uncertainty due to a lack of quantification of the indirect nitrogen n deposition in terms of atmospheric land surface water bodies fluxes in this study we combined monitoring n deposition datasets with semi distributed modeling to characterize the baseline n flow in tributary streams in the three gorges reservoir region of china and predicted the varying impacts of indirect n deposition from 2006 to 2015 this study indicated that the indirect n deposition as an important n source accounted for 10 47 of the total n flow of tributary streams the clean air action or carbon neutral would induce a reduction of deposition and then reduced the tributary n flux by 0 45 104 1 09 104 t yr 1 meanwhile the declining n deposition would result in the tributary n phosphorus p stoichiometry to 22 04 approaching from p limitation to n limitation the variation in n p ratio was smaller in agricultural watersheds than those forest and grass dominated watersheds our finding indicated that process toward mitigating water quality will be difficult without consideration the indirect impacts of n deposition and attention should be paid to variations in nutrient limitation and the plankton communities of inland waters due to the variation of regional or global n deposition keywords atmospheric n deposition n flux water quality tributary stream nitrogen limitation nonpoint source pollution 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential elements for the synthesis of nuclei and proteins the two most important polymers of life the n cycle which has a broad and profound impact on an ecosystem is an important biogeochemical cycle and is entirely dependent on the reduction oxidation reaction primarily mediated by microorganisms and fungi dong et al 2020 peñuelas et al 2013 anthropogenic activities have had great impacts on the global n cycle and led to an increase in the production of reactive n nr erisman et al 2008 fowler et al 2013 this is concerning because the rapid increases in worldwide nr emissions would cause serious air pollution which in turn will induce excessive n deposition in natural ecosystems pan et al 2018 sickles and shadwick 2015 globally nr deposition comes from fossil fuel burning accounting for 25 33 tg n yr 1 while the contribution of fertilizer application reached to 118 tg n yr 1up to 2012 peñuelas et al 2013 only approximately 22 of the total human input of n eventually accumulates in the soil and biomass where 35 enters ocean through atmospheric deposition 17 and river runoff 18 unesco 2007 correspondingly p cycling and deposition are especially slow and low compared with n and the imbalance of n and p has caused major variation in the nutrient limitation and status of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2009 galloway et al 2008 atmospheric n deposition increased from 31 6 to 195 0 tg n yr 1 globally and from 13 2 to 21 0 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in china during the 1980s and 2000s galloway et al 2004 gao et al 2020 liu et al 2013 the excessive n input via atmospheric n wet and dry deposition has noticeable impact on the soil and water chemistry of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems schlesinger 2009 templer et al 2012 aquatic ecosystems receive n from the direct and indirect n deposition for a typical watershed direct n deposition is often defined as the n from atmosphere falling on the targeted water bodies while the indirect n deposition represents the n flux from atmosphere to land surface and then to nearby water bodies dong et al 2020 in china the non point source pollution 14 50 3 10 tg n yr 1 has been identified as the main source of n in inland water of which agricultural emissions accounted for 59 yu et al 2019 n deposition is also important in the n budget of aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2013 the patterns of direct n deposition flux can be obtained from in situ measurements and atmospheric physics chemistry models but the indirect n deposition is still uncertain because of the complex biogeochemical transformation and transportation of different n forms on land surface the isotope method can trace the source of nitrate and researches showed that the contribution of wet deposition reaches 50 or even 67 of nitrate in surface rivers buda and dewalle 2009 chen et al 2012 however this isotopic geochemistry is not enough to reveal the long term and large scale geochemical cycle process of n due to the complexity of the watershed system zhang et al 2018 in the late 20th and early 21st centuries many countries began to implement clean air action to control nr emissions to protect public health which inevitably affected the global n deposition kanter et al 2020 and nutrient balance in aquatic ecosystems gu et al 2015 studies have revealed the global impact of atmospherically deposited n on lakes indicating that human nr has caused an increase in the n p stoichiometry and thus the p limitation of phytoplankton growth and possibly even forest growth elser et al 2009 goswami et al 2018 freshwater phytoplankton assemblages are sensitive to alterations in the n p supply ratio and variations in n inputs will likely induce a shift in phytoplankton community composition peñuelas et al 2013 thus an improved understanding of the variation in n deposition on the n p stoichiometry of aquatic systems is critical for forecasting responses to future decreased n deposition and the potential impact of nutrient limitation on global rivers and lakes in this study we focus on the n flow from atmosphere to land surface and then to the receiving water and quantified the related impacts on n budget and nutrient limitation the n deposition data was integrated with the watershed model to simulate the entire biogeochemical process of n and the impacts of variation of n deposition the three gorges reservoir region tgrr in china was selected for detailed investigation the objectives of this study were to characterize the impacts of indirect n deposition on the transformation of n in the terrestrial area the n flow of tributaries and its implications for aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tgrr 28 10 32 13 n 105 17 110 11 e china which resides in the east asia region and has a high global n deposition flux fig 1 provides an ideal ecosystem to estimate the impact of atmospheric deposition on n flow and the nutritional status of inland waters the study area has experienced severe air pollution due to the development of the chemical industry in chongqing municipality and then air quality has been improving as a result of industry upgrades and pollution control the tgrr watershed covers a total area of 6 6 104 km2 and has approximately 80 tributaries range from just 50 38 km2 to as large as 7039 57 km2 with the area of 16 tributaries greater than 1000 km2 fig 1 dam interception and periodic impoundment of the tgrr have led to a slowdown of water velocity and have prolonged the hydraulic residence time resulting in periodic algal blooms consequently the tgrr has become a hotspot for eutrophication investigations liu et al 2012 2 2 atmospheric deposition data 2 2 1 data for wet n deposition the observational n deposition data were collected from the chinese ecosystem research network cern yu et al 2019 the dataset mainly includes the monitoring data from 41 sites of the cern 43 sites from national nitrogen deposition monitoring network 81 stations from the national acid deposition monitoring network and the monitoring data collected from published papers these datasets were divided into four subsets 1996 2000 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 to study the spatiotemporal impacts of wet n deposition fig a1 the wet deposition data of the tgrr were extracted from the national n deposition dataset fig a2 2 2 2 data for dry n deposition the dry n deposition data for tgrr was extracted from the two subsets 2006 2010 2011 2015 fig a3 of the five year interval dataset released by the chinese ecosystem research network http www cnern org cn this network developed remote sensing models to estimate dry deposition flux using no2 and nh3 satellite and ground measurements jia et al 2016 then the 10 km resolution national dry deposition of no2 hno3 and no3 as well as nh3 and nh4 datasets were obtained and the n dry deposition data of the tgrr is given in fig a4 the observational data on the cern showed that the amount of p deposition was small compared to n therefore this study only focused on the indirect n deposition yu et al 2019 2 3 estimation of tributary n flow caused by n deposition the process based watershed models are used in this study for the quantification of atmospheric land surface waterbody n flux however the construction of watershed models for the entire tgrr is difficult due to the complexity of the models and with a shortage of the observed data singh et al 2005 in this study the parameter sets were firstly obtained from some typical catchments and then expended to the surrounding area based on our proposed small scale watershed extended method swem hong et al 2012 for the tgrr the whole watershed was divided into four parts the yulin xiaojiang daning and xiangxi districts based on data availability and partition homogeneity and four parameter sets were calibrated and validated in construction of topography area size and adequacy of monitoring data then these calibrated parameters were extended to all 80 watersheds in the corresponding districts of the study area fig a5 and 80 watershed models were finally constructed for n flow simulation in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat model which is semi distributed and process based was constructed while the tgrr was divided into multiple sub watersheds and further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus containing homogeneous slope land use and soil characteristics the qual2e equation was selected to describe the processes of nutrient transformation and degradation in the channel as presented in the swat model the detailed description could be found in previous studies teshager et al 2017 chen et al 2019 by coupling n deposition monitoring data with the swat model the no3 and nh4 deposited terrestrially through precipitation were added to the no3 and nh4 pools in the surface 10 mm soil of the corresponding sub watersheds while no3 and nh4 through dry deposition were added to the n pool of the surface soil of the sub watersheds the equation for n deposition in the swat model eqs 1 4 are as follows no 3 r a i n 0 01 r no 3 r day 2 nh 4 r a i n 0 01 r nh 4 r day 3 n o 3 l y 1 no 3 l y 1 no 3 d r y d e p 4 n h 4 l y 1 nh 4 l y 1 nh 4 d r y d e p where no3rain and nh4rain are the amounts of nitrate and ammonium entering the soil through precipitation respectively kg ha 1 rno3 and rnh4 are the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in precipitation respectively mg l 1 rday is the precipitation no3ly 1 and nh4ly 1 are the amounts of nitrate and ammonium in the soil respectively kg ha 1 no3drydep and nh4drydep are the daily dry deposition amounts of nitrate and ammonium respectively kg ha 1 the wet deposition data in the swat model require the concentrations of no3 and nh4 in precipitation while dry deposition can input the no3 and nh4 fluxes directly therefore wet deposition flux was converted into concentration data which is shown as follows 5 c w f w 100 p t where cw is the concentration of no3 and nh4 in precipitation fw is the wet no3 and nh4 flux of each sub watershed in the study area which was obtained by arcgis extracting the average value of all grids in the sub watershed pt is the annual precipitation amount in each sub watershed in the study area which was obtained by the meteorological data in the study area the input data including digital elevation map dem meteorological data land use types soil type and cultivation measures was given in the supporting information si hydrology and water quality data in the past twenty years were collected from local government land and then used for model calibration wastewater treatment plant and industrial enterprise data in the study area were collected and their emissions were mainly obtained through the emission coefficient the average inlet concentrations of tn nh4 and tp of the wastewater treatment plant used in this study were 10 5 mg l 1 37 mg l and 0 29 mg l the impacts of rural and domestic enterprises were calculated according to the pollution production and discharge coefficient and were added as a point source for the sub watersheds of each typical watershed the swat cup was used for calibration as details in si the n flux of tributary stream was calculated as follows 6 q sub i 1 n q i i 1 n j 1 m a sub i j c sub i j 7 t i 1 n t i i 1 n j 1 m t ij where qsub is the total yield of n qi is the yield from part i asub ij is the area of sub watershed j in part i and csub ij is the load intensity of the n from the corresponding sub watersheds t is the n flow from the tributary watersheds ti is the total n flow at the outlet of the watershed in part i and tij is the n flow at the outlet of catchment j in part i the information about the p flow of tributary streams of this study can be found in the previous study chen et al 2021 2 4 n deposition scenario gu et al 2015 have demonstrated that the n deposition began to stabilize in 2001 2005 due to the decline in wet nh4 deposition however the wet nh4 deposition in the tgrr increased from 1996 to 2010 and then decreased while the wet no3 deposition increased from 1996 to 2005 and then remained stable from 2006 to 2015 as shown in fig a4 the dry no3 and nh4 deposition remained stable from 2006 to 2015 therefore we setup three scenarios for comparison in the first scenario s1 the wet and dry n deposition were set to 0 to obtain the baseline n flow form different land use types to water bodies in the second scenario s2 and third scenario s3 the actual deposition data and the high n deposition data from 2001 to 2005 was then used respectively the indirect n deposition and the impacts of the varying n deposition due to air quality improvement were then obtained as follows 8 f n i n d i r e c t t s 2 t s 1 9 f impact t s 3 t s 2 where the fn indirect is the indirect n deposition that is the n transport from air to land surface and then to waters ts1 ts2 and ts3 are the n flow from the tributary watersheds under s1 s2 and s3 respectively fimpact revealed the impacts of the varying n deposition due to air quality improvement 2 5 nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry in this study the river n p stoichiometry under different scenarios was also quantified to reflected variation in n deposition on water quality typically the n p stoichiometry was used to determine the limiting nutrient for water eutrophication conley et al 2009 guildford and hecky 2000 suggested that n p mole ranging from 22 to 50 indicated n and p co limitation both in lakes and oceans worldwide whereas the n p lower than 22 or higher than 50 represented n limited or p limited respectively these thresholds were then used for this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of n flux caused by n deposition estimating the contribution of n deposition is fundamental to the understanding of the watershed n budget and is prerequisite for the formulation of n management zhan et al 2017 however previous studies have focused more on the direct n deposition into water but ignored the quantification of indirect n deposition and the comparison with the varying contribution of n deposition gao et al 2020 peñuelas et al 2012 this part of the n cycle was quantified and presented in fig 2 the indirect n deposition showed an upward trend after 2009 and ranged from 1 04 104 to 1 42 104 t yr 1 in 2006 2015 with a mean value of 1 23 104 t yr 1 the major species were nitrate n organic n and ammonia n which accounted for 63 81 24 92 and 9 83 of the total indirect n deposition table 1 meantime the n flux of tributary stream ranged from 9 02 104 to 16 75 104 t yr 1 in 2006 2015 with a mean value of 11 74 104 t yr 1 nitrate n dominated the total flux followed by organic n and ammonia n which accounted for 71 00 23 00 and 4 00 of the river n table 1 cropland paddy field and forestland contributed 35 09 27 65 and 20 73 of the n flux and the indirect n deposition accounted for 10 47 and was the fourth contributor table a1 in comparison the total indirect and direct contribution of n deposition is 12 94 while the direct n deposition contributed only 2 47 which indicated that the impacts of n deposition might be underestimated in addition excessive n deposition directly into inland water would increase the n concentration in this study the average n concentration of the streams ranged from 1 61 to 1 90 mg l 1 and the indirect n deposition made the tributary n concentration increase by 0 12 0 17 mg l 1 fig a6 our study provides insight into the n budget in fragile water of tgrr as well as other large receiving waterbodies latimer and charpentier 2010 reported that indirect n deposition accounted for 16 of the n flow to estuaries in southern new england using a watershed loading model studies in the mississippi river and chesapeake bay watershed indicated that approximately 19 5 and 20 30 of the n into the estuaries came from the indirect n deposition sheeder et al 2002 burns et al 2021 robertson and saad 2021 in addition deng et al 2021 revealed that indirect n deposition to n flux of tributary stream was 13 3 15 2 in forest watersheds in china from 2015 to 2017 using the expert coefficient these discrepancies between this study and previous evaluations stem from two explanations firstly the global n deposition have obvious spatial distribution characteristics east asia europe eastern north america and southern brazil were the hotspots for inorganic n deposition and n deposition in east asia presented a downward trend in recent years ackerman et al 2019 the contribution of n deposition depended strongly on the composition of land uses as well secondly the export coefficient and watershed loading models do not consider the migration and transformation of n which might lead to an overestimation of the indirect n deposition chen et al 2019 n deposition is linked to deteriorating water quality and impacts aquatic organisms li et al 2016 research has revealed that n deposition directly into lakes accounts for 13 6 of the annual total n input among the higher deposition regions of east asia and the percentage is as high as 48 in may and june zhan et al 2017 in addition excessive n deposition directly into inland water would increase the n concentration by 76 6 93 9 μg l 1 yr 1 and significantly accelerate the waterbody eutrophication gao et al 2019 compared with the results of this study the impact of atmospheric n deposition on the water quality may be much more serious although the n flow from the watershed already included n deposition to terrestrial areas its accurate quantification is still of great significance esser et al 2011 3 2 response of stream n flow to the variation of n deposition variation in n deposition also affects the migration and transformation of n in terrestrial areas and the subsequent n export to receiving waterbodies sickles and shadwick 2015 this variation caused by the alteration in n deposition was quantified and showed in fig 3 the indirect n deposition ranged from 1 56 104 to 2 51 104 t yr 1 with a mean of 2 09 104 t yr 1 under scenario s3 the major species were nitrate n 1 26 0 13 104 t yr 1 60 38 organic n 0 57 0 16 104 t yr 1 27 41 and ammonia n 0 20 0 05 104 t yr 1 9 40 accounting for 97 19 of the total indirect deposition this also accounted for 16 62 of the n flux of tributary stream table a1 which was higher than that under scenario s2 fig 2 the variation in the indirect n deposition ranged from 0 45 104 to 1 09 104 t yr 1 with a mean of 0 86 104 t yr 1 due to variation in n deposition s2 to s3 and the proportions of nitrate n organic n ammonia n and nitrite n were 55 46 30 97 8 78 and 4 79 respectively the results proved that the extensive biogeochemical reactions in terrestrial area could lead to different fate of imported n among the increments in stream n caused by n deposition the proportions of organic n and nitrite n increased while that of nitrate n decreased the results proved that the extensive biogeochemical reactions in terrestrial area could lead to different fate of imported n based on this study 6 95 and 9 76 of n deposition to terrestrial area would transport into yangtze river under scenarios s2 and s3 respectively table a1 this means that as soil and vegetation will be in n saturation status the n transformation process will accelerate the input into rivers under n deposition studies have shown that nr deposition into the terrestrial area in china was about 2 7 to 4 6 tg n yr 1 gu et al 2015 houlton et al 2006 but the nr transported to rivers reached 18 1 tg n yr 1 this indicates that the additional nr deposition promotes the biogeochemical cycle of n in the terrestrial areas basically rely on redox reaction involving microorganisms schlesinger 2009 n deposition increases the readily available inorganic n in soil which is not sequestered by vegetation and is transformed through denitrification to a gaseous form n2 n2o no depending on the soil physical conditions and oxidation state fowler et al 2013 denier van der gon and bleeker 2005 indicated that terrestrial soils account for 22 of total global denitrification and an average of 150 00 tg n yr 1 was transported to the atmosphere in gaseous form n inputs have been found to influence the emissions of n2o from a variety of ecosystems due to the greatly enhanced denitrification of soil microorganisms mccrackin and elser 2011 the stimulating effect of n deposition on the global grassland n2o emission rate was 1 6 0 14 tg n yr 1 du et al 2021 indeed it has been found that increasing wet ammonia n deposition led to increases in n2o emissions and approximately 3 5 4 7 of deposited n was re emitted in the form of n2o beaulieu et al 2011 therefore nitrate n was depleted by denitrification and resulting in a decrease in the proportion of nitrate n in the n flux of tributary stream fig 4 since inorganic n is a biologically effective fertilizer its increase provided a large amount of available n for organisms and thereby reduced the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms which would also promote more organic n into waterbodies gu et al 2015 jian et al 2016 historical increases in emissions and atmospheric n deposition have been proven to have profound effects on terrestrial ecosystems but the carbon neutral clean air act and their associated rules have led to decrease in the emissions and deposition of reduced n in china yu et al 2019 the cycles of carbon and n are strongly interrelated forest carbon sequestration is driven by net primary production and biomass production hence dynamic replacement may be directly limited by n availability groffman et al 2018 nevertheless most processes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are expected to have a certain degree of hysteresis in response to reduced n deposition and the greatest response delay is related to the slow variation of plant and soil organic matter n pool peñuelas et al 2012 with the decrease in n deposition the core is a comprehensive understanding of how n limitation and excess n can occur simultaneously and how ecosystems can manipulate the reduction of available n while affected by the excess n 3 3 impacts of n deposition on n p ratio anthropogenic activities have significantly changed air quality and the resulting atmospheric n deposition has altered the magnitude of the nutrient status although p was proven to be a limited nutrient for phytoplankton imbalanced human induced inputs of n and p would alter nutrient limitation and affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems loladze and elser 2011 the n p ratio can be used as indicator to codetermine the limiting nutrient for algae in aquatic ecosystems as shown in fig 5 a the n p ratio in the tributaries showed an obvious spatial distribution lower n p ratio appeared in the western streams of tgrr it could be seen that small tributaries always had n p ratios lower than 22 while large tributaries were the opposite however with the decrease in n deposition n p ratio of about 1 4 of the tributaries decreased to below 22 which is the p limitation threshold fig 5a and b the average n p ratios of the tributaries were 25 74 and 23 97 under the s3 and s2 respectively fig a7 this indicated that with the improvement of air quality or the carbon neutral program the reduction of n deposition will lead to changes in the nutrient limitation of waterbodies these are common patterns throughout the world that small tributaries had n p ratios lower than 22 as the intensive agriculture leads to increased particle bound n and p and reduced n p ratios heisler et al 2008 stets et al 2020 tributary inflows could create local variation in algal communities in the receiving waterbody by shifting the relative availability of different nutrients thereby giving competitive advantage to a particular category ho et al 2019 the hydraulic power of high discharge plumes from large streams enables them to transport their nutrients further offshore than smaller streams small plumes typically lack the coherence and momentum to reach the pelagic zone and instead are retained along the riverbank danger et al 2008 the inflows from small tributary streams tend to become trapped near the shore and have a lower n p ratio these small systems should have an effective impact on the nutritional status of the receiving waterbody elser et al 2009 have showed that phytoplankton growth was generally n limited under low n deposition while in high n deposition phytoplankton growth was constantly p limited the results of this study also proved that with the improvement of air quality or the carbon neutral the reduction of n deposition will lead to changes in the nutrient limitation of waterbodies furthermore nutrient enrichment bioassays demonstrated an inverse relationship between phytoplankton n and p limitation liu et al 2012 therefore improving air quality and reducing n deposition will alleviate or even change the nutrient restriction characteristics of aquatic ecosystems even if other n sources remain stable globally n deposition in east asia the united states and europe presented downward trends which mainly benefitted from the clean air act and climate plans houlton et al 2006 sickles and shadwick 2015 zheng et al 2018 weakened phytoplankton p limitation may also repair damaged food webs in freshwater systems because studies proved that p limited algae are poor quality food for zooplankton because of unsuitable biochemical composition or low p content peñuelas et al 2013 3 4 implications and uncertainty with the results presented in this study n deposition to terrestrial areas is an important source of n flux of tributary stream and provides a new source of natural fertilizer for plant and crop growth which can reduce the use of chemical fertilizers yu et al 2019 clarifying the contribution of n deposition helped us understand the sources of nutrients and further helps to formulate better management to reduce the eutrophication of fragile waterbodies in addition with the air quality improvement or carbon neutral actions implementing in many countries and regions the reduced n deposition in regional areas caused by these actions would change the p limitation and nutritional status of aquatic ecosystems in unexpected way which deserve attention elser et al 2009 sickles and shadwick 2015 the quantitative results of this study on the variations in n p ratios are helpful for obtaining a deeper understanding of the cross media effects of altering n deposition in this study the uncertainty of the results come mainly from the swat model and the n deposition data our previous studies shen et al 2008 2010 and 2012 gong et al 2011 have quantified the modelling uncertainty relating to nonpoint source simulation by using the first order error analysis foea and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue those sensitive parameters such as initial scs cn ii value cn2 sol orgn initial humic organic nitrogen in soil layer usle p usle support practice factor sol z depth from soil surface to bottom of layer and esco were selected and defined for different regions land uses and soil types to reach a more accurate simulation besides the uncertainty n deposition data mainly come from the empirical remote model for dry deposition and interpolation method for wet deposition posted on the cern yu et al 2019 have showed that the regression coefficients were greater than 0 6 for both dry and wet n deposition flux figs a12 and a13 indicating a reliable deposition dataset however these deposition data were not calibrated due to the difficulty of obtaining long term and large scale field deposition data which is the major uncertainty source of this study future research is suggested to collect more local data for validating the spatial distribution of n deposition 4 conclusion this study explored the indirect n deposition to the n flux of tributary streams in the tgrr and its spatial temporal variations the contribution of n deposition accounted for approximately 12 94 of the n flux of tributary stream of which the indirect n deposition accounted for approximately 10 47 the indirect n deposition is one of the non negligible sources of n nutrients in aquatic ecosystems especially in areas with high n deposition a better understanding of the contribution of n deposition would help to better watershed management besides the decrease in n deposition in the tgrr has reduced the n p ratio of tributary streams from 25 74 to 23 97 and will be further reduced to 22 04 in the future which would convers aquatic ecosystem from p limitation to n limitation this indicated that the impact of reduced n deposition on the nutrient limitation of ecosystems and aquatic phytoplankton communities
