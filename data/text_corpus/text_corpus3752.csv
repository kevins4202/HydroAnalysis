18760,sub visible particles an often overlooked fine particle 0 45 10 μm with a size between sludge solids and soluble microbial products smp have recently been identified as a critical foulant in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs and our recent new insights into the size fractionation and composition of sub visible particles in anmbrs have enabled fouling to be understood in more depth here we investigated the microbial diversity of the sub visible particles in three size fractions i e 5 10 1 5 and 0 45 1 μm from bulk and cake solutions in a lab scale anmbr and their fouling potential was further explored based on their filtration behavior and biofilm formation results show that with decreasing particle size a significant shift in microbial communities was observed for the sub visible particles in both bulk and cake solutions a with notable decreases in filamentous microbes in the order sja 15 gca004 and anaerolineales of phylum chloroflexi and b with substantial increases in sulfate reducing bacteria i e the family syntrophobacteraceae genus dce29 of family thermodesulfovibrionaceae desulfovibrio and geobacter more importantly the filamentous microbes associated with micro particles 5 10 μm led to higher cake fouling resistances while free living cells in the form of colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm induced severer pore blocking moreover the micro particles had an enhanced capacity to favor biofilm formation od595 1 0 2 5 categorized as highly positive thus potentially aggravating biofouling this work advances our knowledge on the effect of particle size on communities and underlying fouling behavior of microbes associated with fine particles in anmbrs graphical abstract image 1 keywords suspended particles colloids filtration behavior microbial community membrane fouling mbr 1 introduction with increasing global demand for resources there is considerable interest in recovering energy and nutrients from sewage and other wastewaters and this could lead to more economical and sustainable wastewater treatment processes mccarty et al 2011 hering et al 2013 mo and zhang 2013 the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr has been developed as an attractive technology for the treatment of domestic wastewater because of its potential advantages e g efficient organic carbon capture in the form of methane low sludge production and good effluent quality 95 cod removal no effluent solids li et al 2015 wan et al 2016 however a critical challenge in anmbr technologies is to maintain a viable membrane flux without heavy fouling which is a persistent barrier to maximizing net energy production and scaling up the application of this process skouteris et al 2012 lin et al 2013 smith et al 2014 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the composition of the primary foulants and their fouling behavior in anmbrs is essential to address the fouling issue and thus further develop this technology to date considerable effort has been expended on characterizing and identifying membrane foulants drews 2010 meng et al 2017 and it has been widely recognized that the mixed liquor in mbrs including suspended solids and soluble organic matter is the primary source of foulants as such the contribution of sludge properties zhang et al 2017a and the bacterial community ishizaki et al 2016 jo et al 2016 matar et al 2017 and the characteristics of soluble microbial products smp or dissolved organic matter dom shen et al 2012 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 to membrane fouling has received extensive attention over the past decades however the sub visible particles located in a size between the sludge solids and smp dom are often overlooked in mbrs systems this is due to their smaller sizes and lower concentrations compared to visible sludge flocs in addition they may have intentionally been removed from the bulk solution by high speed centrifugation and membrane filtration to sample the dom smp wang et al 2013 hence there are very few publications in the literature on the abundance composition and fouling behavior of sub visible particles in mbrs our recent study demonstrated that sub visible particles in the size range 0 45 10 μm dominated in the bulk solution and particularly had high accumulation potential on membranes i e cake layers in a submerged anmbr sanmbr zhou et al 2016 in addition the presence of various types of microorganisms in on the sub visible particles was verified by fluorescence staining and scanning electron microscopy sem it was found that the micro particles 5 10 μm were mainly composed of filamentous microbes which could play an important role in the formation of biocakes on membranes in this study therefore the lab scale sanmbr used previously continued to be operated with three different membrane fluxes and the sub visible particles in different cake layers were fractionated and analyzed notably the community composition dead end filtration behavior and biofilm formation potential of the microbes associated with sub visible particles were systematically evaluated to give a comprehensive understanding of their fouling potential coupled with other information this may provide greater insights into membrane fouling and hence how to control it in anmbrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 sanmbr operation and sampling a bench scale sanmbr with a working volume of 3 2 l see supporting information si fig s1 was employed for synthetic wastewater treatment si table s1 a flat sheet polyethylene membrane module 0 4 μm pore size kubota japan with a total surface area of 0 1 m2 was submerged in the reactor and continuously sucked without backwashing a sparging rate of 3 4 l per minute lpm specific gas demand per unit membrane area sgdm 1 8 2 4 nm3 m2 h was set using a vacuum pump to recycle biogas from the headspace back to the reactor for the fouling control and liquid mixing zhang et al 2017b the membrane module with a critical flux of 26 l m2 h lmh was operated with different fluxes for three runs i a super low flux of 5 5 lmh ii a super critical flux of 30 lmh and iii a sub critical flux of 20 lmh during this time the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept constant at 12 h by an effluent pump produced permeate 267 ml h in conjunction with a membrane flux pump the rest being recycled back to the reactor in addition sludge retention time srt was set at 200 d and the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss in the reactor kept in the range of 6 7 g l the reactor was immersed in a water bath 36 5 c and the ph of the sludge liquor was maintained at around 6 8 before starting the experiment the reactor was operated for around 3 months to cultivate microbes the inoculum was taken from the sludge digester of a municipal wastewater treatment plant ulu pandan singapore periodically the influent mixed sludge and its supernatant and effluent from the reactor were sampled and the total cod protein nitrogen pn and polysaccharide ps concentrations of these samples measured cake layers were removed from the membrane surface by brushing them into di water with sponges to obtain the cake foulant solutions when the trans membrane pressure tmp reached 25 kpa 30 and 20 lmh and after the membrane was operated for around 80 days at the super low flux 5 5 lmh fig 1 a then sub visible particles were extracted from the bulk sludge liquor and cake foulant solutions with different membranes i e 5 1 and 0 45 μm mce 100 kda pes after removal of the big sludge flocs by low speed centrifugation 1450 g 4 c and 15 min and filtration with 10 μm filter paper more details about this technique can be found in zhou et al 2016 prior to this the particle size distribution of the bulk sludge liquor and cake foulant solutions and their supernatants was measured by laser diffraction analysis sald 3101 shimadzu japan si fig s2 for the membrane selection in the fractionation of sub visible particles fouling resistance of the membranes in the reactor was measured according to darcy s law after serial off line cleaning methods i e cake removal by a sponge brush then submerged in naocl 0 3 12 h and finally in 1 citric acid for 1 h which led to a full recovery of the membrane permeability without much residual fouling 0 03 1 89 of the total resistance in fig 1b 2 2 live dead cell staining and observation to observe the cell morphology of microbes associated with sub visible particles live dead cell staining was conducted using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit including fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto 9 and pi hao et al 2009 briefly 0 5 ml of samples was mixed with 1 5 μl of the syto 9 and pi mixture 1 1 and then incubated in the dark for 15 min at 25 c for microscopic observation eclipse ni u nikon kanagawa japan a minimum of 10 fields of each slide were taken and then processed with imagej software for qualitative and semi quantitative analysis of live dead cell ratios 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis total genome dna of bulk cake sludge and sub visible particle samples was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals singapore as per the manufacturer s instruction nano drop nd 1000 thermo scientific usa was used to check the dna concentration and purity and the quality of dna was also examined using agarose gel electrophoresis afterwards the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna genes was amplified by pcr using a universal primer pro341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 pro805r 3 gactacnvgggtatctaatcc 5 designed for simultaneous analysis of bacteria and archaea takahashi et al 2014 raw sequencing data were determined on the illumina miseq platform at the research technology support facility michigan state university us qiime software was used to process the raw sequencing data caporaso et al 2010 both unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices were used to conduct a principal coordinate analysis pcoa liu et al 2014 a clustering analysis was conducted using the r program lu et al 2016 to link communities of the sub visible particles in the bulk solution with related fouling factors which is based on the pearson s correlation coefficients

the bulk solution of the reactor was evaluated in a stirred dead end filtration cell an effective area of 12 5 cm2 msc100 mosu corp shanghai china zhou et al 2017 and stirring speed was kept at 300 rpm and the tmp constant at 50 kpa the permeate volume was recorded automatically using an electronic scale connected to a personal computer the same polyethylene membrane 0 4 μm pore size kubota japan was used for filtration after soaking in ultrapure water for 24 h and 45 ml particles and colloids smps solutions with a concentration of 30 mg cod l were used to perform the filtration test finally the fouling resistance of fouled membranes including the resistance of the cake layer rcake pore blockage rblock bound fouling rbound and irrecoverable fouling rir was measured according to darcy s law using the following cleaning procedures i e cake removal with sponges backwashing with 50 ml of di water at 50 kpa and 0 3 naocl cleaning for 12 h here the inorganic fouling resistance was not considered as the sub visible particle solutions were composed mainly of organic matter fig 1c 2 5 biofilm formation assay biofilm formation potential of the microbes associated with sub visible particles was analyzed using a 96 well microtiter plate assay coffey et al 2014 guo et al 2017 sub visible particles in the bulk solution i e raw solution 5 10 μm 1 5 μm and 0 45 1 μm were first diluted with the sterile pbs solution ph 7 4 to obtain an od595 value of 0 080 and 50 μl of diluted solution was added with 150 μl of sterile lb medium plus 1 5 g l nahco3 into each well of a sterile polystyrene microtiter plate corning sterile medium without inoculum was used as a blank and was purged by ultrapure nitrogen 99 99 before use the microplate was covered sealed and incubated at 37 c for 60 h under anaerobic conditions afterwards the suspended solution was removed and wells were washed twice with the sterile pbs to fix the biofilm 200 μl of methanol 99 was added to each well for 15 min and then thoroughly air dried then 200 μl of crystal violet 1 was added for 10 min after the excess dye was removed the wells were rinsed with tap water and thoroughly air dried again finally 150 μl of 30 acetic acid was added to each well for 20 min and its absorption was recorded at 595 nm using a microplate reader multiskan fc thermo scientific each sample was replicated in ten wells 2 6 other analysis concentrations of cod and mlss were measured according to apha standard methods apha 1998 ps and pn were quantified by the dubois dubois et al 1951 and lowry lowry et al 1951 methods with glucose and bsa as standards respectively the biogas composition was determined by gc gc 2014 shimadzu japan while the vfa concentrations were determined by hplc prominence uflc shimadzu japan ph orp of the reactor were monitored using a probe inpro 4260 i mettler toledo statistically significant differences were measured by unpaired t test in the software of spss spss 19 0 chicago il usa 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance and filtration behavior of the sub visible particles through the long period of operation i e over three months very good performance of the sanmbr were achieved si fig s3 with high cod removals 97 and no vfas were measured in the effluent around 960 ml of biogas was generated per day and the proportion of methane was constant at 70 the average concentrations of cod ps and pn in the supernatant measurement times n 69 were also stable at 270 56 mg l 38 9 mg l and 87 13 mg l respectively overall steady state conditions of the sanmbr could be considered to be achieved before starting the experiment which is corresponding with the stable microbial community of the reactor see the section of 3 3 with membrane fouling fig 1a a higher flux led to a faster rise in the tmp especially for the membrane operated at the super critical flux of 30 lmh at the super low flux of 5 5 lmh a negligible fouling rate occurred even after three months i e 92 days which was in good agreement with previous studies hwang et al 2008 lew et al 2009 ng and ng 2010 the fouling resistance was dominated by the cake resistance r cake 60 90 which is considered reversible fouling regardless of fluxes fig 1b in particular r cake at 20 lmh accounted for 91 7 of the total filtration resistance fig 1b given that the total permeate volume of the membrane at 20 lmh was 3312 l over the entire operating period i e 69 days a large amount of biomass 8890 mg vss m2 and organics could be rejected si table s2 thus potentially leading to such a high specific cake resistance 3 35 1011 m g vss note that the cake at 5 5 lmh also had a high biomass 5080 mg vss m2 but a lower cake resistance proportion r cake 61 6 correspondingly the tmp value of membrane at 5 5 lmh was stable at a lower level for a long period i e 92 days indicating that the fouling layer formed could be looser specific cake resistance 0 39 1011 m g vss wang et al 2015 thus having a better filterability in contrast a lower biomass concentration in the cake at 30 lmh 3969 mg vss m2 contributed to the most severe fouling 34 days operating time specific cake resistance 4 58 1011 m g vss probably because of stronger drag forces and higher eps in the cake si table s2 thus forming a more compacted cake layer in turn the rejection of organics could be enhanced by the denser layer but consequently this led to a higher organic fouling resistance r organic 16 6 wang et al 2015 which further worsened the filtration in addition the inorganic fouling or chemical scaling of membranes in this work was not serious r inorganic 0 04 0 61 in fig 1b and this was likely due to the low concentration of inorganic matter in the influent moreover the size fractionation analysis showed that the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm were up to around 90 of the total organics i e cod pn and ps of the bulk and cake solutions in the sanmbr dong et al also found that the mixed liquor of a pilot scale anmbr was dominated by particle and colloidal cod dong et al 2015 particularly the micro particles 5 10 μm had a much higher abundance 60 70 in cake solutions regardless of fluxes fig 1c compared with those in the bulk solution 30 40 indicating that the micro particles could have a much higher accumulation rate on membranes likewise lin et al reported that the cake layer had a higher percentage of small particles 5 μm than the bulk sludge in a mesophilic anmbr lin et al 2011b dead end filtration with the sub visible particles in the bulk solution of the sanmbr was further carried out to check their fouling behavior in fig 1d the micro particle 5 10 μm sub micrometer 1 5 μm and colloidal particle 0 45 1 μm solutions needed much longer filtration time i e 649 481 and 431 s respectively for the same permeate volume 45 ml compared with that of the smp solution the fraction of 0 45 μm after removing the sub visible particles it demonstrates that the sub visible particle solutions of 0 45 10 μm induced worse fouling and resulted particularly in a higher cake resistance to filtration 90 of the total fouling resistance compared to the smp solution 0 45 μm the doughnut in fig 1d previously gao et al 2013 and choo et al choo and lee 1996 reported that the particles and colloids 0 1 10 μm in the mixed sludge liquor of anmbrs were probably the main contributor to fouling rather than smps and sludge solids in contrast the smps 0 45 μm resulted in a relatively high pore blocking 45 and bound fouling 26 in spite of a lower cake resistance 17 fig 1d this being in agreement with a recent report by christensen et al 2018 note that the operation conditions of the anmbrs such as srt temperature and gas sparging would definitely impact the size distribution amount and composition of particles and colloids in mixed liquor and thus the fouling potential a longer srt huang et al 2011 martin garcia et al 2011 higher temperature lin et al 2009 and stronger biogas sparging decreased the floc size leading to more fine particles 10 μm and severer fouling certainly the rejection of these particles by membranes the average pore size around 0 4 μm used here would further enhance their accumulation in the reactor and on the membrane surfaces taken together it is quite conceivable that the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm in anmbrs played an important role in membrane fouling due to their high abundance in the bulk solution and high cake fouling potential all these traditional analyses mentioned above on the sub visible particles provided useful information on fouling in sanmbrs however they were only based on their physicochemical properties from the aspect of organic composition and short term filtration given the sub visible particles containing diverse cells attached to them zhou et al 2016 their fouling potential could be more complicated and needs to be reexamined from a biological perspective i e cell morphology community composition and biofilm formation 3 2 live dead cell images of the sub visible particles based on the cell morphology of microbes associated with sub visible particles in different cake layers the sub visible particles of each given size fraction in three cake layers had similar cell structures fig 2 regardless of the flux the micro particles 5 10 μm were richer in filamentous and rod shaped microbes while free single bacilli and cocci became dominant in the sub micrometer 1 5 μm and colloidal 0 45 1 μm particles based on the observation of a number of live dead cell images the abundance of filamentous microbes in all the cake solutions fig 2b g l seemed to be higher than those in the bulk solution fig 2q especially in the 20 and 30 lmh cake probably because of a stronger drag force at higher fluxes kimura et al 2008 tang et al 2011 correspondingly the photometric analysis also showed that the micro particles 5 10 μm that were rich in filamentous cells increased in proportion as a function of increasing fluxes si fig s4 more interestingly the micro particles in the cake layers at 20 and 30 lmh had a higher percentage of live cells 67 71 than those in the bulk solution 62 as well as the bulk sludge flocs 60 p values 0 001 see pie charts in fig 2 this suggests that the filamentous and rod shaped microbes preferred to adhere to membrane surfaces and proliferate in the cake layers meng et al 2006 and bugge et al 2013 also noted that filamentous bacteria strongly impacted on sludge properties and induced a higher fouling potential during membrane filtration this is presumably why the cake layers at the flux of 30 lmh had a higher resistance even with less sludge solids moreover the percentage of dead cells in the sub visible particles increased as their particle size decreased especially in the soluble fractions 0 45 μm 100 kda up to 70 85 this decrease in the cell viability would weaken their biofouling potential these findings above demonstrate that the filamentous and rod shaped microbes on the micro particles could induce severe biofouling i e interacting with other microbes and thus biofilm formation in anmbrs as expected analyzing the community composition of microbes associated with sub visible particles could be useful for understanding their roles in biofouling 3 3 diversity of microbes associated with sub visible particles as indicated by the chao 1 and shannon indexes si fig s5 the cake sludge had a similar microbial diversity to that of the bulk sludge at all three fluxes the pcoa analysis of weighted unifrac distances on community compositions showed that the bulk and cake sludge samples were quite close together red circle in fig 3 further indicating their similar communities independent of membrane fluxes in addition the analysis suggests that the microbial community of the bulk sludge i e 159 231 and 300 days was stable which was consistent with the steady performance during the entire reactor operation more importantly the highest chao 1 and shannon indices were observed with micro particles 5 10 μm compared to the sub micrometer 1 5 μm and colloidal 0 45 1 μm particles regardless of whether they were in the bulk or cake solutions and the microbial diversity of sub visible particles declined with decreasing particle size si fig s5 correspondingly a significant shift in the microbiota with decreasing particle size was also observed in the pcoa plot of fig 3 due to the rejection of large particles by the membrane pore size around 0 4 μm the microbial diversity of the effluent was the lowest in all the samples and displayed an individual group white circle in fig 3 separated from other particle samples white triangles in fig 3 overall particle size provided a greater selective pressure on the community composition of the bulk cake sludge and sub visible particles details on the major community composition of the bulk cake sludge and sub visible particles are shown in fig 4 at the phylum level si fig s6 chloroflexi euryarchaeota and firmicutes were the top three phyla dominating the bulk and cake sludge followed by a few others such as op8 proteobacteria nitrospirae bacteroidetes chlorobi and verrucomicrobia which all have been detected widely in anaerobic systems under various conditions mckeown et al 2009 smith et al 2013 sundberg et al 2013 of these 10 abundant genera 70 of total abundance were commonly shared by the bulk and cake sludge including two genera methanosaeta and trichococcus frequently observed in anaerobic systems one genus dce29 rarely reported before and seven not well described genera i e sja 15 genera incertae sedis g is anaerolinaceae g is gca004 g is bacteroidales g is sha 124 g is melioribacteraceae g is and syntrophaceae g is ziegler et al also demonstrated that the biocake community would become increasingly close to the bulk community over time ziegler et al 2016 in our work the high fouling stage i e 25 kpa of the membranes at 20 and 30 lmh and the long term operation around 80 days at 5 5 lmh could both result in large deposits of bulk sludge onto the membrane the species affiliated with the genus methanosaeta are well known acetoclastic methanogens for methane production sundberg et al 2013 zamanzadeh et al 2016 while the members of trichococcus of phylum firmicutes are fermentative organisms mcilroy et al 2017 compared with the sludge the relative abundance of the two genera was much lower on the sub visible particles in the bulk and cake solutions probably due to following reasons 1 members of methanosaeta and trichococcus are commonly and abundantly present in the granular sludge and sludge flocs li et al 2017 torres et al 2018 where the mass transfer among microorganisms is easier 2 some members of the two genera are present in long filaments liu and seviour 2001 janssen 2003 mizukami et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2015 thus often appearing as large aggregates note that the relative abundance of the other three members i e sja 15 g is anaerolinaceae g is and gca004 g is was also higher in bulk cake sludge and the micro particles but showed a sharp decrease with decreasing particle size in both bulk and cake solutions as is well known many members in the class anaerolineae of phylum chloroflexi are associated with filamentous bacteria yamada et al 2005 which are often present in the large sludge floc particles this could be the main reason why the phylum chloroflexi had a higher abundance in the samples of sludge and micro particles samples 20 30 si fig s6 which is consistent with observations from the images of the live dead cell staining in our work in contrast the genus dce29 had a higher abundance on the sub visible particles than in the sludge for both bulk and cake solutions and increased with decreasing particle size members of dce29 are uncultured bacteria belonging to the family thermodesulfovibrionaceae of phylum nitrospirae which was reported to be responsible for sulfate reduction using hydrogen as electron donors gu et al 2004 kaksonen et al 2004 keyser et al 2007 similar trends were also observed for other minor genera such as methanolinea methanoregulaceae g is proteiniclasticum desulfovibrio aby1 g is nkb15 g is syntrophorhabdaceae g is and helicobacteraceae g is fig 4 coupled with live dead cell staining images fig 2 this data indicates that the microbial members above preferred to live in the form of single free cells that are associated with the colloidal particles there could be several reasons for this i members of the family methanoregulaceae and genus proteiniclasticum appear singly or in pairs with small cells such as rod shaped or coccoid cells zhang et al 2010 oren 2014 leading to low membrane rejection during the fractionation of sub visible particles ii the cyclical sparging of hydrogen sulfide rich biogas 100 ppm in the reactor could enrich sulfate reducing microbes free living in the supernatant i e members in the family syntrophobacteraceae and genera dce29 desulfovibrio and geobacter and meanwhile iii these sulfate reducing microbes castro et al 2000 and members of the family helicobacteraceae mitchell et al 2014 commonly have flagella and fast cell motility thus probably facilitating cells free living the remaining four major genera i e bacteroidales g is sha 124 g is syntrophaceae g is and melioribacteraceae g is as well as minor genera i e clostridiales g is porphyromonadaceae g is dysgonomonas and bacteroides were present at a higher proportion in the colloidal particles of the bulk solution compared to the cake solution members of the orders bacteroidales clostridiales were involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates vanwonterghem et al 2014 which could be as a result of the high levels of glucose fed to the sanmbr in our work moreover the phylum proteobacteria became dominant 78 7 in the sanmbr effluent si fig s6 including chlorobaculum helicobacteraceae g is sulfuricurvum dechloromonas azovibrio rhodocyclaceae g is methylobacterium and methylobacteriaceae g is their presence is probably due to the incomplete rejection of free living cells by the membrane and or the permeation of free dna from the bulk solution into the effluent 3 4 biofilm formation potential of the sub visible particles given the sub visible particles being associated with microbial cells their fouling potential could be greater than a simple physical filtration as this could be substantially magnified by a biotic effect hence the biofilm formation potential of the sub visible particles in the bulk solution was preliminarily explored to estimate their biofouling behavior the raw bulk solution including all fractions of the sub visible particles had the highest potential to form a biofilm od595 2 0 3 5 fig 5 indicating that the microbes in the bulk solution had the strongest ability for attached growth on the 96 well surface more importantly we found that the different fractions of the sub visible particles showed significantly different biofilm formation potential p 0 01 for instance the micro particles had the second highest biofilm formation potential od595 1 0 2 5 followed by the colloidal and sub micrometer particles as expected the micro particles could play an crucial role in the development of biofouling in the sanmbr and recently bar zeev et al proposed that transparent exopolymer particles teps colonized by microbes could substantially accelerate biofilm formation and development bar zeev et al 2012 presumably since the micro particles had the greatest microbial diversity the largest amount of filamentous microbes and the highest ratios of live dead cells this could in turn ensure their biofilm formation potential to be the greatest several previous studies also highlighted that fine sludge particles were responsible for the initial fouling lin et al 2011a lu et al 2016 probably being the precursor of biofilm formation on membranes note that the common lb medium was used here for the biofilm formation test and this is a realistic scenario for the formation of biofilm on the membrane overall such different biofilm formation potentials are strongly related to the microbial community composition of the sub visible particles meanwhile the physiological biochemical characteristics i e cell growth rate phase and quorum signals for regulating eps production of these microbes associated with sub visible particles could also play an important role in biofilm formation vanysacker et al 2014 and this needs to be studied more in the future development of the biofilm incubated with sub visible particles and the related microbial community succession in such a process needs to be carefully investigated as well ultimately linking it with the biofouling process 3 5 linkages between sub visible particles and fouling parameters in fig 6 a great homology in changing patterns red color means positive correlation while blue color means negative correlation was observed in each cluster for the 27 major microbial groups of the sub visible particles relative abundances of the representative microbial groups in each cluster were plotted against the particle size in fig 6b and c to reveal the size dependent fouling behavior of sub visible particles in the sanmbr in cluster 1 the microbial groups associated with filamentous microbes i e methanosaeta sja 15 g is and gca004 g is had a higher relative abundance in the micro particles 5 10 μm and were positively correlated with r cake and biofilm formation indicating their higher cake fouling potential in fig 6b the micro particles associated microbes had a comparably high relative abundance in the cake layer these filamentous organisms could play an important role in cell aggregations and the formation of sludge floc bjornsson et al 2002 larsen et al 2008 probably enhancing the buildup of cake layers on the membrane surfaces larsen et al reported that the filamentous bacteria in activated sludge could produce amyloid like compounds larsen et al 2008 which facilitated the internal adhesion and enhanced biofilm formation due to increasing cell surface hydrophobicity larsen et al 2007 in contrast the increases of populations such as dce29 desulfovibrio syntrophorhabdaceae g is syntrophaceae g is and helicobacteraceae g is with decreasing particle size were mainly related to the severe bound pore blocking and irreversible fouling cluster 2 fig 6c moreover these members had the highest relative abundance on the colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm with the form of free living cells fig 2 indicating their high initial fouling potential in fact compared with the sludge these free single cells associated with colloidal particles could be readily dragged by the suction force of the flux pumps thus attaching onto the membrane recently lu et al reported that small sludge flocs median diameter of 7 2 μm were the initial colonizers and responsible for early biofilm formation on membranes lu et al 2016 in addition many members in custer 2 are involved in the sulfate reducing process and have flagella which could give aid to the initial colonization on membranes clark et al 2007 guttenplan and kearns 2013 krumholz et al 2015 overall the above correlation results demonstrated that the filamentous microbes associated with micro particles could result in greater cake fouling while the free living microbes in the form of colloidal particles could potentially lead to initial fouling and pore blocking considering the largest percentage of micro particles in the bulk solution and their highest accumulation in the cake layer the filamentous microbes associated with micro particles i e members in the class anaerolineae probably play the most important role in the fouling process in this work and hence cake layer fouling dominates as in many mbrs it is expected that the fouling potential will be improved by reducing the amount of sub visible particles in anmbrs and importantly by regulating their communities more studies need to focus on the following aspects for fouling control in anmbrs i the addition of chemicals signal molecules i e flocculants coagulants zhang et al 2017c dong et al 2015 and quorum sensing quenching to reshape the floc structures and communities ii revealing the effect of feed composition loading on the free planktonic microbiota and iii the optimization of sparging rates zhang et al 2017b and scouring modes kim et al 2011 to limit cake formation and thus improve membrane performance 4 concluding remarks the results of this study clearly show that membrane performance was adversely impacted by the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm from the bulk solution in a sanmbr either through direct filtration e g inducing a higher cake fouling resistance or by indirect adhesion e g enhancing biofilm formation this study is the first of its kind to explore the microbial diversity of the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm in the anmbr and then linking them to their fouling potential based on both their filtration behavior and biofilm formation we found that particle size exerted a strong selective pressure on the microbial community of the sub visible particles regardless of membrane flux a significant shift in the microbial community between the sub visible particles was observed for the bulk and cake solutions with the decreasing particle size which resulted in their different fouling behavior the micro particles 5 10 μm were mainly composed of the filamentous microbes in the phylum chloroflexi which was confirmed to have a high cake fouling resistance and favor biofilm formation by contrast the colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm were rich in sulfate reducing bacteria of the phylum proteobacteria and nitrospirae which might be responsible for the initial fouling and pore blocking due to their small size and fast motility with flagella this study provided a deeper understanding of the sub visible particles such as their distribution and abundance in the bulk and cake solutions live dead cell morphology and microbial communities future work is required to evaluate which kind of microbes on the sub visible particles could initially attach to membranes and how they impact on the successive adhesion of other microbes associated with sub visible particles and sludge flocs which could

18760,sub visible particles an often overlooked fine particle 0 45 10 μm with a size between sludge solids and soluble microbial products smp have recently been identified as a critical foulant in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs and our recent new insights into the size fractionation and composition of sub visible particles in anmbrs have enabled fouling to be understood in more depth here we investigated the microbial diversity of the sub visible particles in three size fractions i e 5 10 1 5 and 0 45 1 μm from bulk and cake solutions in a lab scale anmbr and their fouling potential was further explored based on their filtration behavior and biofilm formation results show that with decreasing particle size a significant shift in microbial communities was observed for the sub visible particles in both bulk and cake solutions a with notable decreases in filamentous microbes in the order sja 15 gca004 and anaerolineales of phylum chloroflexi and b with substantial increases in sulfate reducing bacteria i e the family syntrophobacteraceae genus dce29 of family thermodesulfovibrionaceae desulfovibrio and geobacter more importantly the filamentous microbes associated with micro particles 5 10 μm led to higher cake fouling resistances while free living cells in the form of colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm induced severer pore blocking moreover the micro particles had an enhanced capacity to favor biofilm formation od595 1 0 2 5 categorized as highly positive thus potentially aggravating biofouling this work advances our knowledge on the effect of particle size on communities and underlying fouling behavior of microbes associated with fine particles in anmbrs graphical abstract image 1 keywords suspended particles colloids filtration behavior microbial community membrane fouling mbr 1 introduction with increasing global demand for resources there is considerable interest in recovering energy and nutrients from sewage and other wastewaters and this could lead to more economical and sustainable wastewater treatment processes mccarty et al 2011 hering et al 2013 mo and zhang 2013 the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr has been developed as an attractive technology for the treatment of domestic wastewater because of its potential advantages e g efficient organic carbon capture in the form of methane low sludge production and good effluent quality 95 cod removal no effluent solids li et al 2015 wan et al 2016 however a critical challenge in anmbr technologies is to maintain a viable membrane flux without heavy fouling which is a persistent barrier to maximizing net energy production and scaling up the application of this process skouteris et al 2012 lin et al 2013 smith et al 2014 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the composition of the primary foulants and their fouling behavior in anmbrs is essential to address the fouling issue and thus further develop this technology to date considerable effort has been expended on characterizing and identifying membrane foulants drews 2010 meng et al 2017 and it has been widely recognized that the mixed liquor in mbrs including suspended solids and soluble organic matter is the primary source of foulants as such the contribution of sludge properties zhang et al 2017a and the bacterial community ishizaki et al 2016 jo et al 2016 matar et al 2017 and the characteristics of soluble microbial products smp or dissolved organic matter dom shen et al 2012 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 to membrane fouling has received extensive attention over the past decades however the sub visible particles located in a size between the sludge solids and smp dom are often overlooked in mbrs systems this is due to their smaller sizes and lower concentrations compared to visible sludge flocs in addition they may have intentionally been removed from the bulk solution by high speed centrifugation and membrane filtration to sample the dom smp wang et al 2013 hence there are very few publications in the literature on the abundance composition and fouling behavior of sub visible particles in mbrs our recent study demonstrated that sub visible particles in the size range 0 45 10 μm dominated in the bulk solution and particularly had high accumulation potential on membranes i e cake layers in a submerged anmbr sanmbr zhou et al 2016 in addition the presence of various types of microorganisms in on the sub visible particles was verified by fluorescence staining and scanning electron microscopy sem it was found that the micro particles 5 10 μm were mainly composed of filamentous microbes which could play an important role in the formation of biocakes on membranes in this study therefore the lab scale sanmbr used previously continued to be operated with three different membrane fluxes and the sub visible particles in different cake layers were fractionated and analyzed notably the community composition dead end filtration behavior and biofilm formation potential of the microbes associated with sub visible particles were systematically evaluated to give a comprehensive understanding of their fouling potential coupled with other information this may provide greater insights into membrane fouling and hence how to control it in anmbrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 sanmbr operation and sampling a bench scale sanmbr with a working volume of 3

using a vacuum pump to recycle biogas from the headspace back to the reactor for the fouling control and liquid mixing zhang et al 2017b the membrane module with a critical flux of 26 l m2 h lmh was operated with different fluxes for three runs i a super low flux of 5 5 lmh ii a super critical flux of 30 lmh and iii a sub critical flux of 20 lmh during this time the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept constant at 12 h by an effluent pump produced permeate 267 ml h in conjunction with a membrane flux pump the rest being recycled back to the reactor in addition sludge retention time srt was set at 200 d and the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss in the reactor kept in the range of 6 7 g l the reactor was immersed in a water bath 36 5 c and the ph of the sludge liquor was maintained at around 6 8 before starting the experiment the reactor was operated for around 3 months to cultivate microbes the inoculum was taken from the sludge digester of a municipal wastewater treatment plant ulu pandan singapore periodically the influent mixed sludge and its supernatant and effluent from the reactor were sampled and the total cod protein nitrogen pn and polysaccharide ps concentrations of these samples measured cake layers were removed from the membrane surface by brushing them into di water with sponges to obtain the cake foulant solutions when the trans membrane pressure tmp reached 25 kpa 30 and 20 lmh and after the membrane was operated for around 80 days at the super low flux 5 5 lmh fig 1 a then sub visible particles were extracted from the bulk sludge liquor and cake foulant

more details about this technique can be found in zhou et al 2016 prior to this the particle size distribution of the bulk sludge liquor and cake foulant solutions and their supernatants was measured by laser diffraction analysis sald 3101 shimadzu japan si fig s2 for the membrane selection in the fractionation of sub visible particles fouling resistance of the membranes in the reactor was measured according to darcy s law after serial off line cleaning methods i e cake removal by a sponge brush then submerged in naocl 0 3 12 h and finally in 1 citric acid for 1 h which led to a full recovery of the membrane permeability without much residual fouling 0 03 1 89 of the total resistance in fig 1b 2 2 live dead cell staining and observation to observe the cell morphology of microbes associated with sub visible particles live dead cell staining was conducted using a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit including fluorescent nucleic acid stain syto 9 and pi hao et al 2009 briefly 0 5 ml of samples was mixed with 1 5 μl of the syto 9 and pi mixture 1 1 and then incubated in the dark for 15 min at 25 c for microscopic observation eclipse ni u nikon kanagawa japan a minimum of 10 fields of each slide were taken and then processed with imagej software for qualitative and semi quantitative analysis of live dead cell ratios 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis total genome dna of bulk cake sludge and sub visible particle samples was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals singapore as per the manufacturer s instruction nano drop nd 1000 thermo scientific usa was used to check the dna concentration and purity and the quality of dna was also examined using agarose gel electrophoresis afterwards the v3 v4 hypervariable

takahashi et al 2014 raw sequencing data were determined on the illumina miseq platform at the research technology support facility michigan state university us qiime software was used to process the raw sequencing data caporaso et al 2010 both unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices were used to conduct a principal coordinate analysis pcoa liu et al 2014 a clustering analysis was conducted using the r program lu et al 2016 to link communities of the sub visible particles in the bulk solution with related fouling factors which is based on the pearson s correlation coefficients

the bulk solution of the reactor was evaluated in a stirred dead end filtration cell an effective area of 12 5 cm2 msc100 mosu corp shanghai china zhou et al 2017 and stirring speed was kept at 300 rpm and the tmp constant at 50 kpa the permeate volume was recorded automatically using an electronic scale connected to a personal computer the same polyethylene membrane 0 4 μm pore size kubota japan was used for filtration after soaking in ultrapure water for 24 h and 45 ml particles and colloids smps solutions with a concentration of 30 mg cod l were used to perform the filtration test finally the fouling resistance of fouled membranes including the resistance of the cake layer rcake pore blockage rblock bound fouling rbound and irrecoverable fouling rir was measured according to darcy s law using the following cleaning procedures i e cake removal with sponges backwashing with 50 ml of di water at 50 kpa and 0 3 naocl cleaning for 12 h here the inorganic fouling resistance was not considered as the sub visible particle solutions were composed mainly of organic matter fig 1c 2 5 biofilm formation assay biofilm formation potential of the microbes associated with sub visible particles was analyzed using a 96 well microtiter plate assay coffey et al 2014 guo et al 2017 sub visible particles in the bulk solution i e raw solution 5 10 μm 1 5 μm and 0 45 1 μm were first diluted with the sterile pbs solution ph 7 4 to obtain an od595 value of 0 080 and 50 μl of diluted solution was added with 150 μl of sterile lb medium plus 1 5 g l nahco3 into each well of a sterile polystyrene microtiter plate corning sterile medium without inoculum was used as a blank and was purged by ultrapure nitrogen 99 99 before use the microplate was covered sealed and incubated at 37 c for 60 h under anaerobic conditions afterwards the suspended solution was removed and wells were washed twice with the sterile pbs to fix the biofilm 200 μl of methanol 99 was added to each well for 15 min and then thoroughly air dried then 200 μl of crystal violet 1 was added for 10 min after the excess dye was removed the wells were rinsed with tap water and thoroughly air dried again finally 150 μl of 30 acetic acid was added to each well for 20 min and its absorption was recorded at 595 nm using a microplate reader multiskan fc thermo scientific each sample was replicated in ten wells 2 6 other analysis concentrations of cod and mlss were measured according to apha standard methods apha 1998 ps and pn were quantified by the dubois dubois et al 1951 and lowry lowry et al 1951 methods with glucose and bsa as standards respectively the biogas composition was determined by gc gc 2014 shimadzu japan while the vfa concentrations were determined by hplc prominence uflc shimadzu japan ph orp of the reactor were monitored using a probe inpro 4260 i mettler toledo statistically significant differences were measured by unpaired t test in the software of spss spss 19 0 chicago il usa 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance and filtration behavior of the sub visible particles through the long period of operation i e over three months very good performance of the sanmbr were achieved si fig s3 with high cod removals 97 and no vfas were measured in the effluent around 960 ml of biogas was generated per day and the proportion of methane was constant at 70 the average concentrations of cod ps and pn in the supernatant measurement times n 69 were also stable at 270 56 mg l 38 9 mg l and 87 13 mg l respectively overall steady state conditions of the sanmbr could be considered to be achieved before starting the experiment which is corresponding with the stable microbial community of the reactor see the section of 3 3 with membrane fouling fig 1a a higher flux led to a faster rise in the tmp especially for the membrane operated at the super critical flux of 30 lmh at the super low flux of 5 5 lmh a negligible fouling rate occurred even after three months i e 92 days which was in good agreement with previous studies hwang et al 2008 lew et al 2009 ng and ng 2010 the fouling resistance was dominated by the cake resistance r cake 60 90 which is considered reversible fouling regardless of fluxes fig 1b in particular r cake at 20 lmh accounted for 91 7 of the total filtration resistance fig 1b given that the total permeate volume of the membrane at 20 lmh was 3312 l over the entire operating period i e 69 days a large amount of biomass 8890 mg vss m2 and organics could be rejected si table s2 thus potentially leading to such a high specific cake resistance 3 35 1011 m g vss note that the cake at 5 5 lmh also had a high biomass 5080 mg vss m2 but a lower cake resistance proportion r cake 61 6 correspondingly the tmp value of membrane at 5 5 lmh was stable at a lower level for a long period i e 92 days indicating that the fouling layer formed could be looser specific cake resistance 0 39 1011 m g vss wang et al 2015 thus having a better filterability in contrast a lower biomass concentration in the cake at 30 lmh 3969 mg vss m2 contributed to the most severe fouling 34 days operating time specific cake resistance 4 58 1011 m g vss probably because of stronger drag forces and higher eps in the cake si table s2 thus forming a more compacted cake layer in turn the rejection of organics could be enhanced by the denser layer but consequently this led to a higher organic fouling resistance r organic 16 6 wang et al 2015 which further worsened the filtration in addition the inorganic fouling or chemical scaling of membranes in this work was not serious r inorganic 0 04 0 61 in fig 1b and this was likely due to the low concentration of inorganic matter in the influent moreover the size fractionation analysis showed that the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm were up to around 90 of the total organics i e cod pn and ps of the bulk and cake solutions in the sanmbr dong et al also found that the mixed liquor of a pilot scale anmbr was dominated by particle and colloidal cod dong et al 2015 particularly the micro particles 5 10 μm had a much higher abundance 60 70 in cake solutions regardless of fluxes fig 1c compared with those in the bulk solution 30 40 indicating that the micro particles could have a much higher accumulation rate on membranes likewise lin et al reported that the cake layer had a higher percentage of small particles 5 μm than the bulk sludge in a mesophilic anmbr lin et al 2011b dead end filtration with the sub visible particles in the bulk solution of the sanmbr was further carried out to check their fouling behavior in fig 1d the micro particle 5 10 μm sub micrometer 1 5 μm and colloidal particle 0 45 1 μm solutions needed much longer filtration time i e 649 481 and 431 s respectively for the same permeate volume 45 ml compared with that of the smp solution the fraction of 0 45 μm after removing the sub visible particles it demonstrates that the sub visible particle solutions of 0 45 10 μm induced worse fouling and resulted particularly in a higher cake resistance to filtration 90 of the total fouling resistance compared to the smp solution 0 45 μm the doughnut in fig 1d previously gao et al 2013 and choo et al choo and lee 1996 reported that the particles and colloids 0 1 10 μm in the mixed sludge liquor of anmbrs were probably the main contributor to fouling rather than smps and sludge solids in contrast the smps 0 45 μm resulted in a relatively high pore blocking 45 and bound fouling 26 in spite of a lower cake resistance 17 fig 1d this being in agreement with a recent report by christensen et al 2018 note that the operation conditions of the anmbrs such as srt temperature and gas sparging would definitely impact the size distribution amount and composition of particles and colloids in mixed liquor and thus the fouling potential a longer srt huang et al 2011 martin garcia et al 2011 higher temperature lin et al 2009 and stronger biogas sparging decreased the floc size leading to more fine particles 10 μm and severer fouling certainly the rejection of these particles by membranes the average pore size around 0 4 μm used here would further enhance their accumulation in the reactor and on the membrane surfaces taken together it is quite conceivable that the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm in anmbrs played an important role in membrane fouling due to their high abundance in the bulk solution and high cake fouling potential all these traditional analyses mentioned above on the sub visible particles provided useful information on fouling in sanmbrs however they were only based on their physicochemical properties from the aspect of organic composition and short term filtration given the sub visible particles containing diverse cells attached to them zhou et al 2016 their fouling potential could be more complicated and needs to be reexamined from a biological perspective i e cell morphology community composition and biofilm formation 3 2 live dead cell images of the sub visible particles based on the cell morphology of microbes associated with sub visible particles in different cake layers the sub visible particles of each given size fraction in three cake layers had similar cell structures fig 2 regardless of the flux the micro particles 5 10 μm were richer in filamentous and rod shaped microbes while free single bacilli and cocci became dominant in the sub micrometer 1 5 μm and colloidal 0 45 1 μm particles based on the observation of a number of live dead cell images the abundance of filamentous microbes in all the cake solutions fig 2b g l seemed to be higher than those in the bulk solution fig 2q especially in the 20 and 30 lmh cake probably because of a stronger drag force at higher fluxes kimura et al 2008 tang et al 2011 correspondingly the photometric analysis also showed that the micro particles 5 10 μm that were rich in filamentous cells increased in proportion as a function of increasing fluxes si fig s4 more interestingly the micro particles in the cake layers at 20 and 30 lmh had a higher percentage of live cells 67 71 than those in the bulk solution 62 as well as the bulk sludge flocs 60 p values 0 001 see pie charts in fig 2 this suggests that the filamentous and rod shaped microbes preferred to adhere to membrane surfaces and proliferate in the cake layers meng et al 2006 and bugge et al 2013 also noted that filamentous bacteria strongly impacted on sludge properties and induced a higher fouling potential during membrane filtration this is presumably why the cake layers at the flux of 30 lmh had a higher resistance even with less sludge solids moreover the percentage of dead cells in the sub visible particles increased as their particle size decreased especially in the soluble fractions 0 45 μm 100 kda up to 70 85 this decrease in the cell viability would weaken their biofouling potential these findings above demonstrate that the filamentous and rod shaped microbes on the micro particles could induce severe biofouling i e interacting with other microbes and thus biofilm formation in anmbrs as expected analyzing the community composition of microbes associated with sub visible particles could be useful for understanding their roles in biofouling 3 3 diversity of microbes associated with sub visible particles as indicated by the chao 1 and shannon indexes si fig s5 the cake sludge had a similar microbial diversity to that of the bulk sludge at all three fluxes the pcoa analysis of weighted unifrac distances on community compositions showed that the bulk and cake sludge samples were quite close together red circle in fig 3 further indicating their similar communities independent of membrane fluxes in addition the analysis suggests that the microbial community of the bulk sludge i e 159 231 and 300 days was stable which was consistent with the steady performance during the entire reactor operation more importantly the highest chao 1 and shannon indices were observed with micro particles 5 10 μm compared to the sub micrometer 1 5 μm and colloidal 0 45 1 μm particles regardless of whether they were in the bulk or cake solutions and the microbial diversity of sub visible particles declined with decreasing particle size si fig s5 correspondingly a significant shift in the microbiota with decreasing particle size was also observed in the pcoa plot of fig 3 due to the rejection of large particles by the membrane pore size around 0 4 μm the microbial diversity of the effluent was the lowest in all the samples and displayed an individual group white circle in fig 3 separated from other particle samples white triangles in fig 3 overall particle size provided a greater selective pressure on the community composition of the bulk cake sludge and sub visible particles details on the major community composition of the bulk cake sludge and sub visible particles are shown in fig 4 at the phylum level si fig s6 chloroflexi euryarchaeota and firmicutes were the top three phyla dominating the bulk and cake sludge followed by a few others such as op8 proteobacteria nitrospirae bacteroidetes chlorobi and verrucomicrobia which all have been detected widely in anaerobic systems under various conditions mckeown et al 2009 smith et al 2013 sundberg et al 2013 of these 10 abundant genera 70 of total abundance were commonly shared by the bulk and cake sludge including two genera methanosaeta and trichococcus frequently observed in anaerobic systems one genus dce29 rarely reported before and seven not well described genera i e sja 15 genera incertae sedis g is anaerolinaceae g is gca004 g is bacteroidales g is sha 124 g is melioribacteraceae g is and syntrophaceae g is ziegler et al also demonstrated that the biocake community would become increasingly close to the bulk community over time ziegler et al 2016 in our work the high fouling stage i e 25 kpa of the membranes at 20 and 30 lmh and the long term operation around 80 days at 5 5 lmh could both result in large deposits of bulk sludge onto the membrane the species affiliated with the genus methanosaeta are well known acetoclastic methanogens for methane production sundberg et al 2013 zamanzadeh et al 2016 while the members of trichococcus of phylum firmicutes are fermentative organisms mcilroy et al 2017 compared with the sludge the relative abundance of the two genera was much lower on the sub visible particles in the bulk and cake solutions probably due to following reasons 1 members of methanosaeta and trichococcus are commonly and abundantly present in the granular sludge and sludge flocs li et al 2017 torres et al 2018 where the mass transfer among microorganisms is easier 2 some members of the two genera are present in long filaments liu and seviour 2001 janssen 2003 mizukami et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2015 thus often appearing as large aggregates note that the relative abundance of the other three members i e sja 15 g is anaerolinaceae g is and gca004 g is was also higher in bulk cake sludge and the micro particles but showed a sharp decrease with decreasing particle size in both bulk and cake solutions as is well known many members in the class anaerolineae of phylum chloroflexi are associated with filamentous bacteria yamada et al 2005 which are often present in the large sludge floc particles this could be the main reason why the phylum chloroflexi had a higher abundance in the samples of sludge and micro particles samples 20 30 si fig s6 which is consistent with observations from the images of the live dead cell staining in our work in contrast the genus dce29 had a higher abundance on the sub visible particles than in the sludge for both bulk and cake solutions and increased with decreasing particle size members of dce29 are uncultured bacteria belonging to the family thermodesulfovibrionaceae of phylum nitrospirae which was reported to be responsible for sulfate reduction using hydrogen as electron donors gu et al 2004 kaksonen et al 2004 keyser et al 2007 similar trends were also observed for other minor genera such as methanolinea methanoregulaceae g is proteiniclasticum desulfovibrio aby1 g is nkb15 g is syntrophorhabdaceae g is and helicobacteraceae g is fig 4 coupled with live dead cell staining images fig 2 this data indicates that the microbial members above preferred to live in the form of single free cells that are associated with the colloidal particles there could be several reasons for this i members of the family methanoregulaceae and genus proteiniclasticum appear singly or in pairs with small cells such as rod shaped or coccoid cells zhang et al 2010 oren 2014 leading to low membrane rejection during the fractionation of sub visible particles ii the cyclical sparging of hydrogen sulfide rich biogas 100 ppm in the reactor could enrich sulfate reducing microbes free living in the supernatant i e members in the family syntrophobacteraceae and genera dce29 desulfovibrio and geobacter and meanwhile iii these sulfate reducing microbes castro et al 2000 and members of the family helicobacteraceae mitchell et al 2014 commonly have flagella and fast cell motility thus probably facilitating cells free living the remaining four major genera i e bacteroidales g is sha 124 g is syntrophaceae g is and melioribacteraceae g is as well as minor genera i e clostridiales g is porphyromonadaceae g is dysgonomonas and bacteroides were present at a higher proportion in the colloidal particles of the bulk solution compared to the cake solution members of the orders bacteroidales clostridiales were involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates vanwonterghem et al 2014 which could be as a result of the high levels of glucose fed to the sanmbr in our work moreover the phylum proteobacteria became dominant 78 7 in the sanmbr effluent si fig s6 including chlorobaculum helicobacteraceae g is sulfuricurvum dechloromonas azovibrio rhodocyclaceae g is methylobacterium and methylobacteriaceae g is their presence is probably due to the incomplete rejection of free living cells by the membrane and or the permeation of free dna from the bulk solution into the effluent 3 4 biofilm formation potential of the sub visible particles given the sub visible particles being associated with microbial cells their fouling potential could be greater than a simple physical filtration as this could be substantially magnified by a biotic effect hence the biofilm formation potential of the sub visible particles in the bulk solution was preliminarily explored to estimate their biofouling behavior the raw bulk solution including all fractions of the sub visible particles had the highest potential to form a biofilm od595 2 0 3 5 fig 5 indicating that the microbes in the bulk solution had the strongest ability for attached growth on the 96 well surface more importantly we found that the different fractions of the sub visible particles showed significantly different biofilm formation potential p 0 01 for instance the micro particles had the second highest biofilm formation potential od595 1 0 2 5 followed by the colloidal and sub micrometer particles as expected the micro particles could play an crucial role in the development of biofouling in the sanmbr and recently bar zeev et al proposed that transparent exopolymer particles teps colonized by microbes could substantially accelerate biofilm formation and development bar zeev et al 2012 presumably since the micro particles had the greatest microbial diversity the largest amount of filamentous microbes and the highest ratios of live dead cells this could in turn ensure their biofilm formation potential to be the greatest several previous studies also highlighted that fine sludge particles were responsible for the initial fouling lin et al 2011a lu et al 2016 probably being the precursor of biofilm formation on membranes note that the common lb medium was used here for the biofilm formation test and this is a realistic scenario for the formation of biofilm on the membrane overall such different biofilm formation potentials are strongly related to the microbial community composition of the sub visible particles meanwhile the physiological biochemical characteristics i e cell growth rate phase and quorum signals for regulating eps production of these microbes associated with sub visible particles could also play an important role in biofilm formation vanysacker et al 2014 and this needs to be studied more in the future development of the biofilm incubated with sub visible particles and the related microbial community succession in such a process needs to be carefully investigated as well ultimately linking it with the biofouling process 3 5 linkages between sub visible particles and fouling parameters in fig 6 a great homology in changing patterns red color means positive correlation while blue color means negative correlation was observed in each cluster for the 27 major microbial groups of the sub visible particles relative abundances of the representative microbial groups in each cluster were plotted against the particle size in fig 6b and c to reveal the size dependent fouling behavior of sub visible particles in the sanmbr in cluster 1 the microbial groups associated with filamentous microbes i e methanosaeta sja 15 g is and gca004 g is had a higher relative abundance in the micro particles 5 10 μm and were positively correlated with r cake and biofilm formation indicating their higher cake fouling potential in fig 6b the micro particles associated microbes had a comparably high relative abundance in the cake layer these filamentous organisms could play an important role in cell aggregations and the formation of sludge floc bjornsson et al 2002 larsen et al 2008 probably enhancing the buildup of cake layers on the membrane surfaces larsen et al reported that the filamentous bacteria in activated sludge could produce amyloid like compounds larsen et al 2008 which facilitated the internal adhesion and enhanced biofilm formation due to increasing cell surface hydrophobicity larsen et al 2007 in contrast the increases of populations such as dce29 desulfovibrio syntrophorhabdaceae g is syntrophaceae g is and helicobacteraceae g is with decreasing particle size were mainly related to the severe bound pore blocking and irreversible fouling cluster 2 fig 6c moreover these members had the highest relative abundance on the colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm with the form of free living cells fig 2 indicating their high initial fouling potential in fact compared with the sludge these free single cells associated with colloidal particles could be readily dragged by the suction force of the flux pumps thus attaching onto the membrane recently lu et al reported that small sludge flocs median diameter of 7 2 μm were the initial colonizers and responsible for early biofilm formation on membranes lu et al 2016 in addition many members in custer 2 are involved in the sulfate reducing process and have flagella which could give aid to the initial colonization on membranes clark et al 2007 guttenplan and kearns 2013 krumholz et al 2015 overall the above correlation results demonstrated that the filamentous microbes associated with micro particles could result in greater cake fouling while the free living microbes in the form of colloidal particles could potentially lead to initial fouling and pore blocking considering the largest percentage of micro particles in the bulk solution and their highest accumulation in the cake layer the filamentous microbes associated with micro particles i e members in the class anaerolineae probably play the most important role in the fouling process in this work and hence cake layer fouling dominates as in many mbrs it is expected that the fouling potential will be improved by reducing the amount of sub visible particles in anmbrs and importantly by regulating their communities more studies need to focus on the following aspects for fouling control in anmbrs i the addition of chemicals signal molecules i e flocculants coagulants zhang et al 2017c dong et al 2015 and quorum sensing quenching to reshape the floc structures and communities ii revealing the effect of feed composition loading on the free planktonic microbiota and iii the optimization of sparging rates zhang et al 2017b and scouring modes kim et al 2011 to limit cake formation and thus improve membrane performance 4 concluding remarks the results of this study clearly show that membrane performance was adversely impacted by the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm from the bulk solution in a sanmbr either through direct filtration e g inducing a higher cake fouling resistance or by indirect adhesion e g enhancing biofilm formation this study is the first of its kind to explore the microbial diversity of the sub visible particles 0 45 10 μm in the anmbr and then linking them to their fouling potential based on both their filtration behavior and biofilm formation we found that particle size exerted a strong selective pressure on the microbial community of the sub visible particles regardless of membrane flux a significant shift in the microbial community between the sub visible particles was observed for the bulk and cake solutions with the decreasing particle size which resulted in their different fouling behavior the micro particles 5 10 μm were mainly composed of the filamentous microbes in the phylum chloroflexi which was confirmed to have a high cake fouling resistance and favor biofilm formation by contrast the colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm were rich in sulfate reducing bacteria of the phylum proteobacteria and nitrospirae which might be responsible for the initial fouling and pore blocking due to their small size and fast motility with flagella this study provided a deeper understanding of the sub visible particles such as their distribution and abundance in the bulk and cake solutions live dead cell morphology and microbial communities future work is required to evaluate which kind of microbes on the sub visible particles could initially attach to membranes and how they impact on the successive adhesion of other microbes associated with sub visible particles and sludge flocs which could provide new insights into the fouling mechanism of anmbrs declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2014 rott et al 2017 however the removal of these chemicals via so4 based aops remains unknown in this work the kinetics and mechanisms of ntmp degradation and orthophosphate generation in uv persulfate were investigated to examine the reactivity of so4 and ho with ntmp their second order rate constants were determined experimentally by competitive reaction kinetics the impacts of water chemical parameters i e solution ph persulfate dosage and initial ntmp concentration on ntmp degradation were examined the application potential of uv persulfate was also investigated in real ro concentrate based on formation of orthophosphate and the removal of toc the degradation pathways of ntmp were illustrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions ntmp 97 nitrobenzene nb 99 5 and benzoic acid ba 99 were obtained from aldrich spectrum and sigma aldrich respectively the chemical structure of ntmp was shown in fig s1 other chemicals used were reagent grade and purchased from fisher scientiﬁc or sigma aldrich all solutions were prepared using high quality milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm 1 millipore system the real ro concentrate was sampled from a ro based advanced water purification facility in california in july 2018 the major chemical constituents of this ro concentrate were shown in table s1 2 2 experimental setup and analysis to start an experiment solutions containing 0 2 2 mm persulfate and 0 1 0 4 mm ntmp in deionized di were prepared the chosen concentrations of ntmp were similar to the levels observed in ro concentrate to determine the steady state radical concentrations generated during persulfate photolysis 5 μm nitrobenzene nb and 5 μm benzoic acid ba were added as probe compounds prior to each experiment the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted to a target value between 4 and 11 5 by adding hclo4 or naoh without any buffer although the ph was not controlled by buffer during the experiments it only changed slightly p 0 05 within 5 min fig s2 chloride and bicarbonate levels were controlled between 0 and 20 mm the prepared reaction solution was transferred to quartz reaction tubes and placed in a carousel uv reactor ace glass inc equipped with a low pressure uv mercury lamp fig s3 λ 254 nm 1 4 mw cm2 li et al 2018 the experiments were conducted at 22 1 c at predetermined time intervals sacrificial tubes were withdrawn from the reactor for chemical analysis prior to the analysis of ntmp and probe compounds the residual persulfate in the sample was quickly quenched with excess sodium sulfite ntmp was determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 with optimized gradient elution analytical details in text s1 table s2 and fig s4 nb and ba were determined using a liquid chromatography agilent 1200 equipped with an agilent eclipse xdb c18 column and a uv diode array detector analytical details in text s2 patton et al 2018 orthophosphate and ammonia were determined using vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method and phenate method respectively apha 1989 nitrate and nitrite were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ic 120 with as22 column and eluent containing 4 5 mm carbonate and 1 4 mm bicarbonate total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were measured by a toc analyzer coupled with a nitrogen detector aurora 1030 c oi analytical inc the pseudo first order rate constants of ntmp toc nb and ba degradation and orthophosphate generation were modeled and calculated using origin lab version 9 1 hou et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of ntmp in uv persulfate ntmp was efficiently removed with the formation of orthophosphate in uv persulfate system fig 1 the degradation of ntmp and generation of orthophosphate both followed a pseudo first order kinetics model all of r 2 0 95 after 90 min 90 of ntmp was degraded and 70 of total phosphorous in ntmp was released as orthophosphate at ph 7 however the decay of ntmp and the formation of orthophosphate under uv or persulfate alone was negligible the dramatic difference indicated that the degradation of ntmp in uv persulfate resulted from reactive radicals e g so4 and ho from the photolysis of persulfate reactions 1 and 2 table 1 and not from direct photodecomposition of ntmp or persulfate induced chemical oxidation 3 2 reactivity of so4 and ho with ntmp in order to calculate the reaction rate constants of ntmp reacting with ho the concentration of ho radical ho ss was first determined text s3 to quantify the contribution of so4 or ho to ntmp degradation in uv persulfate their steady state concentrations and intrinsic second order reaction rate constants with ntmp were determined based on competition reaction kinetics text s4 nitrobenzene and benzoic acid were used to probe the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho fig s5 based on our experimental data and ho ss the intrinsic second order reaction rate constants of ntmp reacting with ho were calculated as 1 0 108 m 1s 1 1 1 108 m 1s 1 and 1 1 108 m 1s 1 at ph 4 7 and 11 5 respectively text s4 table s3 because these three values were nearly the same an average value of 1 1 0 1 108 m 1s 1 reaction 8 in table 1 was used as the second order reaction constant of ntmp with ho similarly based on experimentally obtained first order rates or second order rate constants reported in prior literature reactions 9 10 in table 1 second order rate constants between ntmp and so4 were calculated to be 2 9 0 6 107 m 1s 1 reaction 7 in table 1 text s4 table s3 3 3 effect of ph ntmp has six pka values which are 0 3 1 5 4 6 5 9 7 3 and 12 1 deluchat et al 1997 therefore ph could affect the ntmp degradation kinetics by changing the speciation of ntmp and radicals distribution experimental results showed that the pseudo first order rate of ntmp degradation k obs ntmp changed slightly between 3 5 10 4 and 3 9 10 4 mj 1cm2 as ph increased from ph 5 5 to ph 10 p 0 05 however the degradation rate in very acidic condition ph 4 k obs ntmp 3 1 10 4 mj 1cm2 and strong basic condition ph 11 5 k obs ntmp 1 2 10 4 mj 1cm2 significantly inhibited p 0 05 fig 2 pseudo first order rate of orthophosphate generation k obs p exhibited the same trend with k obs ntmp although k obs p was higher than k obs ntmp at the same ph fig s6 to elucidate the ph effect the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho were determined text s3 and fig s7 the results showed that ph had little impact on the reactivity of so4 ho with ntmp despite the speciation change of ntmp k ho ntmp 9 9 107 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 ntmp 2 4 3 5 107 m 1 s 1 table s3 so4 ss was 11 54 times higher than ho ss between ph 4 and 11 5 so4 ss slightly varied from 1 4 10 11 to 1 6 10 11 m between ph 4 and 8 5 p 0 05 but dramatically decreased to 1 0 10 11 and 3 10 12 m at ph 10 and 11 5 respectively p 0 05 fig s7 based on the second order reaction rate constants reactions 7 8 in table 1 and the steady state radical concentrations fig s7 the contribution of so4 and ho to ntmp degradation at different phs was calculated respectively fig 2 as expect the calculated pseudo first order rates of ntmp degradation calculated sulfate radical contribution plus calculated hydroxyl radical contribution were nearly identical to the directly observed pseudo first order rates of ntmp degradation k obs ntmp indicating ntmp degradation is attributed to reactions with so4 and ho the results also showed that so4 is the primary radical for ntmp degradation it contributed to 62 95 of ntmp removal fig 2 the dramatic decrease of so4 ss at ph 11 5 highly reduced its contribution to ntmp degradation and consequently slowed down its removal 3 4 effect of initial persulfate concentrations the impacts of initial persulfate concentration on the degradation of ntmp was investigated and was shown to impact the production and scavenging of so4 the degradation rate of ntmp k obs ntmp increased from 0 8 10 4 to 4 3 10 4 mj 1cm2 with increasing persulfate dosage from 0 2 to 2 mm fig 3 the generation rate of orthophosphate k obs p showed similar trends fig s8 specifically a five fold increase in persulfate dosage from 0 2 to 1 0 mm resulting in a five fold increase in the value of k obs ntmp this linear dosage dependence is associated with enhanced radical formation as the dosage of persulfate increased reactions 1 2 in table 1 so4 ss increased from approximately 2 10 12 to 14 10 12 m fig s9 however only 130 rise occurred when the persulfate dosages increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mm fig s9 this is because the generation of so4 and ho can be scavenged via the reaction with excess persulfate and so4 reactions 3 6 in table 1 this scavenging inhibits the degradation of ntmp with increasing persulfate dosage similar trends were also observed in previous studies khan et al 2017 wang et al 2016b 2018 our results showed that the persulfate dosages could increase the ntmp degradation rate but persulfate efficiency could be decreased at a higher dosage therefore in the real water treatment systems the persulfate dosage should be optimized 3 5 effect of initial ntmp concentrations the effect of initial ntmp concentrations on ntmp degradation rate was also investigated results showed that k obs ntmp and k obs p values decreased from 4 3 10 4 mj 1cm2 to 0 8 10 4 mj 1cm2 and 4 1 10 4 mj 1cm2 to 0 5 10 4 mj 1cm2 respectively with increasing initial ntmp dosages from 0 1 to 0 4 mm respectively fig s10 this is consistent with previous studies that increasing target chemicals concentration lead to the reduction of degradation rates in uv persulfate systems liu et al 2016b wang et al 2018 this phenomenon is supported by two mechanisms first ntmp had an inner filter impact on the photolysis of persulfate ε 254 ntmp 1 6 m 1cm 1 vs ε 254 s2o82 18 m 1cm 1 where ntmp at higher concentrations filtered uv light from reaching persulfate which resulted in lower production of so4 second as radical scavengers the high concentration of ntmp and intermediates reduced the steady state concentrations of radicals via competition and consequently decreased the degradation rates of ntmp similarly the results showed that so4 is the main radical for ntmp degradation fig s11 contributed for 75 84 of ntmp degradation and the calculated values of degradation rates of ntmp were closed to k obs ntmp fig 4 3 6 proposed degradation pathway ntmp contains three phosphonate groups c po oh 2 and a center nitrogen atom chemical structures are shown in fig s1 the experimental data showed that as ntmp was degraded total organic carbon toc was consumed fig s12 and orthophosphate was generated fig s13 results showed that the toc degradation rates k obs toc were the same as the orth p generation rates k obs p in all experimental conditions fig 5 a in addition ntmp degradation rates k obs ntmp were higher than the observed orth p generation rates k obs p figs s6 s8 and s10 all these evidences indicated that the c n bond cleavage occurred first followed by the c p bond cleavage the transformation of nitrogen in ntmp during the uv persulfate process was investigated to further confirm the degradation pathway of ntmp analysis showed that neither nitrate nor nitrite was observed in the reaction process while the formation of ammonia was detected the total dissolved nitrogen remained unchanged and the ratio of ammonia to total nitrogen reached 100 at the end of the reaction figs s14 s15 these trends suggest that all nitrogen species from ntmp degradation were ultimately converted to ammonia furthermore a lag period of ammonia formation fig s14 in comparison to a quick removal of toc fig s12 indicated that the cleavage of c n bond occurred prior to the cleavage of c p bond from the ntmp molecule the more details were shown in text s5 based on the analysis of oxidation products the oxidative degradation pathway of ntmp via uv persulfate was proposed fig 5b upon uv photolysis of persulfate one of the c n bond in the ntmp molecule was cleaved to form iminodi methylene phosphonate idmp and hydroxymethylphosphonic acid hmp step 1 in fig 5b idmp was further oxidized to aminotris methylenephosphonic acid amp and hmp step 2 subsequently amp was converted to ammonia and hmp step 3 once hmp was generated it was further oxidized to h3po4 and methanol ch3oh step 4 in addition because the ratio of k obs toc to k obs p was nearly 1 it indicated that methanol was quickly transformed to co2 and h2o for example via intermediate products including formaldehyde ch2o and formic acid hcooh steber and wierich 1987 results also showed the degradation pathway of ntmp by ho was the same as by so4 radical because ntmp degradation processes in uv h2o2 systems were similar with the degradation process in uv persulfate systems e g k obs p k obs toc k obs ntmp also occurred in uv h2o2 systems fig s16 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the pathway of ntmp degradation in persulfate driven oxidation was proposed the degradation pathway via persulfate photolysis oxidation is different from that in the manganese ii catalyzed thermal autoxidation systems nowack and stone 2000 demadis 2006 but is similar with biodegradation pathway of ntmp in water steber and wierich 1987 3 7 ntmp degradation in real ro concentrate ntmp degradation in real ro concentrate in uv persulfate was investigated and the generation of orthophosphate during this process was quantified we found ntmp degradation rate decreased in the real ro concentrate vs the pure water matrix after 120 min of reaction about 40 of ntmp was degraded to orthophosphate while more than 80 of ntmp was degraded in di water fig 6 k obs p value showed approximately 70 decrease in ro concentrate when compared with di water 0 5 10 4 mj 1cm2 in ro concentrate vs 1 7 10 4 mj 1cm2 in di water ro concentrate contains high concentrations of many anions such as cl and hco3 which have been reported to affect uv persulfate to different extents criquet and leitner 2009 deng et al 2013 fang et al 2012 li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 lu et al 2017 in the ro concentrate used this study the concentrations of cl and hco3 were about 20 mm and 10 mm table s1 which produced a 25 and 50 reduction of k obs p values fig 6b respectively these results indicated that the presence of cl and hco3 was the main reason for the reduction of ntmp degradation in roc this adverse impact is attributed to the scavenging of so4 and ho by cl or hco3 to form less reactive of cl cl2 cloh and co3 reactions 13 23 in table 1 chan and chu 2009 crittenden et al 1999 fang et al 2012 furthermore the formation of reactive chlorine species such as cl cl2 may react with the intermediates of ntnp and further influence the degradation of ntmp in the real ro concentrate thus removal or reduction of cl and hco3 concentrations especially hco3 could increase uv persulfate efficiency in ntmp degradation system further studies are needed to explore the high efficiency cl and hco3 removal strategies in the real wastewater although the ntmp degradation rate decreased in the real ro concentrate large scale application of uv persulfate in ntmp removal will be promising first the matrix effect of the real wastewater on uv aops is impossible to avoid in any aop treatment system jing et al 2017 but reducing the concentration of interfering ions such as hco3 by adjusting phs is feasible second the oxidative ability of uv persulfate process could improve by increasing the dosage of persulfate fig 3 and the radiation intensity of uv the optimized dose of persulfate needs further investigation in conjunction with real water matrices increasing the uv radiation intensity will increase the energy consumption however this can be overcome by the integration of recently developed uv light emitting diodes leds which would be more efficient than that of conventional uv disinfection or uv water treatment systems he et al 2014 3 8 economic comparison of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 processes in ntmp degradation uv h2o2 is also one of the most widely used aops methods for organic chemical removal we compared ntmp degradation rates in uv persulfate and uv h2o2 processes at solution phs of 4 7 and 10 fig s17 results showed ntmp degradation in uv persulfate was more efficient than that in uv h2o2 processes at the same oxidant dosage and uv irradiation intensity the pseudo first order rate of orthophosphate generation k obs p in uv persulfate processes were ca 2 5 28 times of that in uv h2o2 processes at phs ranging between 4 and 10 this is mainly because s2o8 2 photolyzes faster than h2o2 and generates higher levels of both so4 and ho li et al 2017 in order to further evaluate the practicability of uv persulfate process for ntmp removal the economic comparison of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 was conducted based on the total cost of electrical energy and the oxidants text s6 xiao et al 2016 based on the calculation we found the total cost per order of ntmp removal is 56 94 lower for uv persulfate process as compared to uv h2o2 processes table s4 indicating uv persulfate process is a more economical approach for ntmp removal our results also showed that neutral ph values are favorable for uv persulfate process 4 conclusions this study is among the first to demonstrate that uv persulfate can be an effective aop for phosphonate antiscalant ntmp elimination direct photolysis of ntmp via low pressure mercury lamp or chemical oxidation by persulfate is inefficient however when combined with persulfate ntmp is removed efficiently due to radical so4 and ho production increased persulfate dosages could significantly increase ntmp removal rate but excess persulfate also signiﬁcantly decreases the persulfate efficiency and increases cost ph values are an important factor that impact the ntmp degradation in the actual engineering application neutral ph values are most suitable for ntmp oxidization in the real ro concentrate ntmp degradation rate decreased due to matrix effect such as cl and hco3 effect our results determined the second order reaction rates of ntmp with two of the main radicals ho and so4 in aop systems which benefits future studies focused on ntmp treatment via advanced oxidization furthermore the ntmp degradation products and pathway has been proposed in this study the degradation of ntmp started with the cleavage of c n bonds and the formed intermediates were eventually mineralized into ammonia phosphate carbon dioxide and water our results showed uv persulfate is a promising technology to remove ntmp and is beneficial to improve

solutions including adsorption via granular ferric hydroxide boels et al 2012 chen et al 2017 filtration using oxide coated media boels et al 2010 and biodegradation by microalgae wang et al 2016b however the adsorption method needs further disposal of the spent media and the handling of desorbed phosphonates the biodegradation by microalgae needs a stringent culture condition and is difficult to operate at a large scale chen et al 2017 wang et al 2016b conventional advanced oxidation processes aops including ozonation and fenton processes have been shown to remove phosphonates greenlee et al 2014 rott et al 2017 although functional ozone usually has low solubility and fenton processes required lower ph conditions to avoid the precipitation of ferric oxide sludge zhang et al 2015 recently persulfate s2o8 2 based aops have received an increasing attention because of their potential to remove organic pollutants in aquatic systems bu et al 2016 li et al 2018 liu et al 2016a b rehman et al 2018 tian et al 2018 xia et al 2017 upon activation by heat uv base or transition metals persulfate generates sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho via subsequent chain reactions reactions 1 and 2 table 1 li et al 2017 liu et al 2016b wang et al 2018 wordofa et al 2017 so4 is a strong oxidant with a similar oxidizing power e0 2 5 3 1 v to ho e0 1 9 2 7 v so4 is more selective toward organic contaminants especially electron rich contaminants in recycled water li et al 2018 in recent years ho based aops have been proposed to remove phosphonates in wastewater greenlee et al 2014 rott et al 2017 however the removal of these chemicals via so4 based aops remains unknown in this work the kinetics and mechanisms of ntmp degradation and orthophosphate generation in uv persulfate were investigated to examine the reactivity of so4 and ho with ntmp their second order rate constants were determined experimentally by competitive reaction kinetics the impacts of water chemical parameters i e solution ph persulfate dosage and initial ntmp concentration on ntmp degradation were examined the application potential of uv persulfate was also investigated in real ro concentrate based on formation of orthophosphate and the removal of toc the degradation pathways of ntmp were illustrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions ntmp 97 nitrobenzene nb 99 5 and benzoic acid ba 99 were obtained from aldrich spectrum and sigma aldrich respectively the chemical structure of ntmp was shown in fig s1 other chemicals used were reagent grade and purchased from fisher scientiﬁc or sigma aldrich all solutions were prepared using high quality milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm 1 millipore system the real ro concentrate was sampled from a ro based advanced water purification facility in california in july 2018 the major chemical constituents of this ro concentrate were shown in table s1 2 2 experimental setup and analysis to start an experiment solutions containing 0 2 2 mm persulfate and 0 1 0 4 mm ntmp in deionized di were prepared the chosen concentrations of ntmp were similar to the levels observed in ro concentrate to determine the steady state radical concentrations generated during persulfate photolysis 5 μm nitrobenzene nb and 5 μm benzoic acid ba were added as probe compounds prior to each experiment the ph of the reaction solution was adjusted to a target value between 4 and 11 5 by adding hclo4 or naoh without any buffer although the ph was not controlled by buffer during the experiments it only changed slightly p 0 05 within 5 min fig s2 chloride and bicarbonate levels were controlled between 0 and 20 mm the prepared reaction solution was transferred to quartz reaction tubes and placed in a carousel uv reactor ace glass inc equipped with a low pressure uv mercury lamp fig s3 λ 254 nm 1 4 mw cm2 li et al 2018 the experiments were conducted at 22 1 c at predetermined time intervals sacrificial tubes were withdrawn from the reactor for chemical analysis prior to the analysis of ntmp and probe compounds the residual persulfate in the sample was quickly quenched with excess sodium sulfite ntmp was determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 with optimized gradient elution analytical details in text s1 table s2 and fig s4 nb and ba were determined using a liquid chromatography agilent 1200 equipped with an agilent eclipse xdb c18 column and a uv diode array detector analytical details in text s2 patton et al 2018 orthophosphate and ammonia were determined using vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method and phenate method respectively apha 1989 nitrate and nitrite were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ic 120 with as22 column and eluent containing 4 5 mm carbonate and 1 4 mm bicarbonate total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were measured by a toc analyzer coupled with a nitrogen detector aurora 1030 c oi analytical inc the pseudo first order rate constants of ntmp toc nb and ba degradation and orthophosphate generation were modeled and calculated using origin lab version 9 1 hou et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of ntmp in uv persulfate ntmp was efficiently removed with the formation of orthophosphate in uv persulfate system fig 1 the degradation of ntmp and generation of orthophosphate both followed a pseudo first order kinetics model all of r 2 0 95 after 90 min 90 of ntmp was degraded and 70 of total phosphorous in ntmp was released as orthophosphate at ph 7 however the decay of ntmp and the formation of orthophosphate under uv or persulfate alone was negligible the dramatic difference indicated that the degradation of ntmp in uv persulfate resulted from reactive radicals e g so4 and ho from the photolysis of persulfate reactions 1 and 2 table 1 and not from direct photodecomposition of ntmp or persulfate induced chemical oxidation 3 2 reactivity of so4 and ho with ntmp in order to calculate the reaction rate constants of ntmp reacting with ho the concentration of ho radical ho ss was first determined text s3 to quantify the contribution of so4 or ho to ntmp degradation in uv persulfate their steady state concentrations and intrinsic second order reaction rate constants with ntmp were determined based on competition reaction kinetics text s4 nitrobenzene and benzoic acid were used to probe the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho fig s5 based on our experimental data and ho ss the intrinsic second order reaction rate constants of ntmp reacting with ho were calculated as 1 0 108 m 1s 1 1 1 108 m 1s 1 and 1 1 108 m 1s 1 at ph 4 7 and 11 5 respectively text s4 table s3 because these three values were nearly the same an average value of 1 1 0 1 108 m 1s 1 reaction 8 in table 1 was used as the second order reaction constant of ntmp with ho similarly based on experimentally obtained first order rates or second order rate constants reported in prior literature reactions 9 10 in table 1 second order rate constants between ntmp and so4 were calculated to be 2 9 0 6 107 m 1s 1 reaction 7 in table 1 text s4 table s3 3 3 effect of ph ntmp has six pka values which are 0 3 1 5 4 6 5 9 7 3 and 12 1 deluchat et al 1997 therefore ph could affect the ntmp degradation kinetics by changing the speciation of ntmp and radicals distribution experimental results showed that the pseudo first order rate of ntmp degradation k obs ntmp changed slightly between 3 5 10 4 and 3 9 10 4 mj 1cm2 as ph increased from ph 5 5 to ph 10 p 0 05 however the degradation rate in very acidic condition ph 4 k obs ntmp 3 1 10 4 mj 1cm2 and strong basic condition ph 11 5 k obs ntmp 1 2 10 4 mj 1cm2 significantly inhibited p 0 05 fig 2 pseudo first order rate of orthophosphate generation k obs p exhibited the same trend with k obs ntmp although k obs p was higher than k obs ntmp at the same ph fig s6 to elucidate the ph effect the steady state concentrations of so4 and ho were determined text s3 and fig s7 the results showed that ph had little impact on the reactivity of so4 ho with ntmp despite the speciation change of ntmp k ho ntmp 9 9 107 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 ntmp 2 4 3 5 107 m 1 s 1 table s3 so4 ss was 11 54 times higher than ho ss between ph 4 and 11 5 so4 ss slightly varied from 1 4 10 11 to 1 6 10 11 m between ph 4 and 8 5 p 0 05 but dramatically decreased to 1 0 10 11 and 3 10 12 m at ph 10 and 11 5 respectively p 0 05 fig s7 based on the second order reaction rate constants reactions 7 8 in table 1 and the steady state radical concentrations fig s7 the contribution of so4 and ho to ntmp degradation at different phs was calculated respectively fig 2 as expect the calculated pseudo first order rates of ntmp degradation calculated sulfate radical contribution plus calculated hydroxyl radical contribution were nearly identical to the directly observed pseudo first order rates of ntmp degradation k obs ntmp indicating ntmp degradation is attributed to reactions with so4 and ho the results also showed that so4 is the primary radical for ntmp degradation it contributed to 62 95 of ntmp removal fig 2 the dramatic decrease of so4 ss at ph 11 5 highly reduced its contribution to ntmp degradation and consequently slowed down its removal 3 4 effect of initial persulfate concentrations the impacts of initial persulfate concentration on the degradation of ntmp was investigated and was shown to impact the production and scavenging of so4 the degradation rate of ntmp k obs ntmp increased from 0 8 10 4 to 4 3 10 4 mj 1cm2 with increasing persulfate dosage from 0 2 to 2 mm fig 3 the generation rate of orthophosphate k obs p showed similar trends fig s8 specifically a five fold increase in persulfate dosage from 0 2 to 1 0 mm resulting in a five fold increase in the value of k obs ntmp this linear dosage dependence is associated with enhanced radical formation as the dosage of persulfate increased reactions 1 2 in table 1 so4 ss increased from approximately 2 10 12 to 14 10 12 m fig s9 however only 130 rise occurred when the persulfate dosages increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mm fig s9 this is because the generation of so4 and ho can be scavenged via the reaction with excess persulfate and so4 reactions 3 6 in table 1 this scavenging inhibits the degradation of ntmp with increasing persulfate dosage similar trends were also observed in previous studies khan et al 2017 wang et al 2016b 2018 our results showed that the persulfate dosages could increase the ntmp degradation rate but persulfate efficiency could be decreased at a higher dosage therefore in the real water treatment systems the persulfate dosage should be optimized 3 5 effect of initial ntmp concentrations the effect of initial ntmp concentrations on ntmp degradation rate was also investigated results showed that k obs ntmp and k obs p values decreased from 4 3 10 4 mj 1cm2 to 0 8 10 4 mj 1cm2 and 4 1 10 4 mj 1cm2 to 0 5 10 4 mj 1cm2 respectively with increasing initial ntmp dosages from 0 1 to 0 4 mm respectively fig s10 this is consistent with previous studies that increasing target chemicals concentration lead to the reduction of degradation rates in uv persulfate systems liu et al 2016b wang et al 2018 this phenomenon is supported by two mechanisms first ntmp had an inner filter impact on the photolysis of persulfate ε 254 ntmp 1 6 m 1cm 1 vs ε 254 s2o82 18 m 1cm 1 where ntmp at higher concentrations filtered uv light from reaching persulfate which resulted in lower production of so4 second as radical scavengers the high concentration of ntmp and intermediates reduced the steady state concentrations of radicals via competition and consequently decreased the degradation rates of ntmp similarly the results showed that so4 is the main radical for ntmp degradation fig s11 contributed for 75 84 of ntmp degradation and the calculated values of degradation rates of ntmp were closed to k obs ntmp fig 4 3 6 proposed degradation pathway ntmp contains three phosphonate groups c po oh 2 and a center nitrogen atom chemical structures are shown in fig s1 the experimental data showed that as ntmp was degraded total organic carbon toc was consumed fig s12 and orthophosphate was generated fig s13 results showed that the toc degradation rates k obs toc were the same as the orth p generation rates k obs p in all experimental conditions fig 5 a in addition ntmp degradation rates k obs ntmp were higher than the observed orth p generation rates k obs p figs s6 s8 and s10 all these evidences indicated that the c n bond cleavage occurred first followed by the c p bond cleavage the transformation of nitrogen in ntmp during the uv persulfate process was investigated to further confirm the degradation pathway of ntmp analysis showed that neither nitrate nor nitrite was observed in the reaction process while the formation of ammonia was detected the total dissolved nitrogen remained unchanged and the ratio of ammonia to total nitrogen reached 100 at the end of the reaction figs s14 s15 these trends suggest that all nitrogen species from ntmp degradation were ultimately converted to ammonia furthermore a lag period of ammonia formation fig s14 in comparison to a quick removal of toc fig s12 indicated that the cleavage of c n bond occurred prior to the cleavage of c p bond from the ntmp molecule the more details were shown in text s5 based on the analysis of oxidation products the oxidative degradation pathway of ntmp via uv persulfate was proposed fig 5b upon uv photolysis of persulfate one of the c n bond in the ntmp molecule was cleaved to form iminodi methylene phosphonate idmp and hydroxymethylphosphonic acid hmp step 1 in fig 5b idmp was further oxidized to aminotris methylenephosphonic acid amp and hmp step 2 subsequently amp was converted to ammonia and hmp step 3 once hmp was generated it was further oxidized to h3po4 and methanol ch3oh step 4 in addition because the ratio of k obs toc to k obs p was nearly 1 it indicated that methanol was quickly transformed to co2 and h2o for example via intermediate products including formaldehyde ch2o and formic acid hcooh steber and wierich 1987 results also showed the degradation pathway of ntmp by ho was the same as by so4 radical because ntmp degradation processes in uv h2o2 systems were similar with the degradation process in uv persulfate systems e g k obs p k obs toc k obs ntmp also occurred in uv h2o2 systems fig s16 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the pathway of ntmp degradation in persulfate driven oxidation was proposed the degradation pathway via persulfate photolysis oxidation is different from that in the manganese ii catalyzed thermal autoxidation systems nowack and stone 2000 demadis 2006 but is similar with biodegradation pathway of ntmp in water steber and wierich 1987 3 7 ntmp degradation in real ro concentrate ntmp degradation in real ro concentrate in uv persulfate was investigated and the generation of orthophosphate during this process was quantified we found ntmp degradation rate decreased in the real ro concentrate vs the pure water matrix after 120 min of reaction about 40 of ntmp was degraded to orthophosphate while more than 80 of ntmp was degraded in di water fig 6 k obs p value showed approximately 70 decrease in ro concentrate when compared with di water 0 5 10 4 mj 1cm2 in ro concentrate vs 1 7 10 4 mj 1cm2 in di water ro concentrate contains high concentrations of many anions such as cl and hco3 which have been reported to affect uv persulfate to different extents criquet and leitner 2009 deng et al 2013 fang et al 2012 li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 lu et al 2017 in the ro concentrate used this study the concentrations of cl and hco3 were about 20 mm and 10 mm table s1 which produced a 25 and 50 reduction of k obs p values fig 6b respectively these results indicated that the presence of cl and hco3 was the main reason for the reduction of ntmp degradation in roc this adverse impact is attributed to the scavenging of so4 and ho by cl or hco3 to form less reactive of cl cl2 cloh and co3 reactions 13 23 in table 1 chan and chu 2009 crittenden et al 1999 fang et al 2012 furthermore the formation of reactive chlorine species such as cl cl2 may react with the intermediates of ntnp and further influence the degradation of ntmp in the real ro concentrate thus removal or reduction of cl and hco3 concentrations especially hco3 could increase uv persulfate efficiency in ntmp degradation system further studies are needed to explore the high efficiency cl and hco3 removal strategies in the real wastewater although the ntmp degradation rate decreased in the real ro concentrate large scale application of uv persulfate in ntmp removal will be promising first the matrix effect of the real wastewater on uv aops is impossible to avoid in any aop treatment system jing et al 2017 but reducing the concentration of interfering ions such as hco3 by adjusting phs is feasible second the oxidative ability of uv persulfate process could improve by increasing the dosage of persulfate fig 3 and the radiation intensity of uv the optimized dose of persulfate needs further investigation in conjunction with real water matrices increasing the uv radiation intensity will increase the energy consumption however this can be overcome by the integration of recently developed uv light emitting diodes leds which would be more efficient than that of conventional uv disinfection or uv water treatment systems he et al 2014 3 8 economic comparison of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 processes in ntmp degradation uv h2o2 is also one of the most widely used aops methods for organic chemical removal we compared ntmp degradation rates in uv persulfate and uv h2o2 processes at solution phs of 4 7 and 10 fig s17 results showed ntmp degradation in uv persulfate was more efficient than that in uv h2o2 processes at the same oxidant dosage and uv irradiation intensity the pseudo first order rate of orthophosphate generation k obs p in uv persulfate processes were ca 2 5 28 times of that in uv h2o2 processes at phs ranging between 4 and 10 this is mainly because s2o8 2 photolyzes faster than h2o2 and generates higher levels of both so4 and ho li et al 2017 in order to further evaluate the practicability of uv persulfate process for ntmp removal the economic comparison of uv persulfate and uv h2o2 was conducted based on the total cost of electrical energy and the oxidants text s6 xiao et al 2016 based on the calculation we found the total cost per order of ntmp removal is 56 94 lower for uv persulfate process as compared to uv h2o2 processes table s4 indicating uv persulfate process is a more economical approach for ntmp removal our results also showed that neutral ph values are favorable for uv persulfate process 4 conclusions this study is among the first to demonstrate that uv persulfate can be an effective aop for phosphonate antiscalant ntmp elimination direct photolysis of ntmp via low pressure mercury lamp or chemical oxidation by persulfate is inefficient however when combined with persulfate ntmp is removed efficiently due to radical so4 and ho production increased persulfate dosages could significantly increase ntmp removal rate but excess persulfate also signiﬁcantly decreases the persulfate efficiency and increases cost ph values are an important factor that impact the ntmp degradation in the actual engineering application neutral ph values are most suitable for ntmp oxidization in the real ro concentrate ntmp degradation rate decreased due to matrix effect such as cl and hco3 effect our results determined the second order reaction rates of ntmp with two of the main radicals ho and so4 in aop systems which benefits future studies focused on ntmp treatment via advanced oxidization furthermore the ntmp degradation products and pathway has been proposed in this study the degradation of ntmp started with the cleavage of c n bonds and the formed intermediates were eventually mineralized into ammonia phosphate carbon dioxide and water our results showed uv persulfate is a promising technology to remove ntmp and is beneficial to improve

18762,although landfill is suspected to be releasing microplastics to the environment there is few empirical researches carried out to clarify suspicions of landfills as potential sources of microplastics twelve leachate samples from four active and two closed municipal solid waste landfills were investigated microplastics were found in all the landfill leachate samples in total seventeen different types of plastics were identified in the leachate samples with calculated concentration ranging from 0 42 to 24 58 items l polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types

indispensable in contemporary daily life the development of plastic has been increasing considerably since the 1950s in the year 2017 the world plastic production reached 348 million tons plasticeurope 2018 approximately 50 of plastics are used for single use disposable products hopewell et al 2009 a large amount of abandoned plastics accumulating in the environment has been causing serious environmental problems barnes et al 2009 in recent years microplastics have been receiving considerable attentions microplastics defined as plastic particles 5 mm can be divided in to primary microplastics intentionally produced small plastic particles and secondary microplastics formed from breakdown of larger plastic material according to sources arthur et al 2009 microplastics are widespread and ubiquitous in environment their occurrence have been reported in marine bergmann et al 2015 desforges et al 2014 law et al 2014 wieczorek et al 2018 woodall et al 2014 fresh water imhof et al 2013 yonkos et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 atmosphere dris et al 2016 gasperi et al 2018 prata 2017 soil nizzetto et al 2016b zubris and richards 2005 and wastewater treatment plants carr et al 2016 mahon et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 there is no doubt that the best way to eliminate microplastics pollution is to control and prevent plastics from entering the environment the control strategies are determined by sources so it is of great importance to understand the sources and pathways for microplastics to the environment arthur et al 2009 browne et al 2011 the major release of microplastics to the environment is generally recognized as the result of inappropriate waste management and improper human behavior barnes et al 2009 jambeck et al 2015 plastic beads used

sundt et al 2014 fiber loss from textile during washing hernandez et al 2017 were also reported to have been releasing microplastics to environment despite of the large number of existing researches covering the abundance composition sources and impact of microplastics as a new environmental challenge their sources are not comprehensively understood sundt et al 2014 landfilling as a widely applied strategy in the world for the disposal of waste was estimated to store 21 42 of the global plastic waste production nizzetto et al 2016a a large amount of plastics are buried in landfills as relatively closely sealed containers with complex biochemical reactions and physical changes plastic waste buried in landfills are subjected to much more severe environmental conditions e g leachate

and ramesh 2017 zettler et al 2013 all of the above factors may lead to the fragmentation of plastics to microplastics and small plastic debris would be carried out by the discharge of leachate imhof et al 2013 believed the land based source of microplastics entering the lake may originate from landfill experts on landfilling and hazardous substances in norway believe that landfills might have been leaking microplastic sundt et al 2014 alimi et al 2018 thought microplastics may be introduced to soils by landfill leachate however microplastic pollution has not been a widely considered topic in the field of waste treatment industry praagh et al 2018 in previous works kilponen 2016 assessed microplastics in a brook which was the recipient of leachate from an old closed landfill russo 2018 studied the treated leachate from eight waste treatment facility to investigate the spread of microplastics via leachate in sweden nordic council of ministers commissioned a project to investigate the occurrence of microplastics in landfill leachate in the nordic countries praagh et al 2018 until now empirical researches carried out on microplastics in landfills are still rare in order to clarify the suspicion of landfills as sources of microplastics and address the importance of microplastic researches on landfills we investigated the occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in landfill leachate from six different msw landfills and discussed the potentiality of msw landfills as sources of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization leachate sampling was conducted at six msw landfills from four different cities shanghai wuxi suzhou and changzhou in china leachate samples were collected from collecting wells or and equalization basins considering the access to the pre treatment leachate information about the investigated landfills and sampling sites is listed in table 1 for each individual sampling site 24 l leachate was collected in a pe bucket the buckets were well sealed and brought back to the laboratory for subsequent study basic physicochemical properties including ph chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 dissolved organic carbon doc ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and dissolved nitrogen dn were studied table 2 information about methodology for measurements was provided in si 1 2 2 method for the extraction and identification of microplastics the method applied for extraction and identification of microplastics in leachate was a modification of noaa laboratory methods masura et al 2015 2 2 1 extraction of microplastics the sample was filtered through a stack of stainless steel sieves φa 20 cm with descending mesh sizes of 150 75 45 and 25 μm all the solid screened out on the four sieves was carefully rinsed into a 500 ml beaker with distilled water then wet peroxide oxidation was performed to remove natural organic materials 40 ml 0 05 m fe ii solution and 40 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide was added into the beaker additional fe ii solution and hydrogen peroxide were supplemented until the mixture turned clear and no foam was floating on the surface then the mixture was filtered with a vacuum filter through a 0 45 μm filter membrane then a dual density separation was conducted to remove inorganic and the remaining natural organic material the first step was to remove the inorganic matter particles contained on the filter membrane was rinsed with sodium iodide solution 1 7 g cm3 into a 50 ml beaker nuelle et al 2014 after 2 h settling the supernatant was filtered with a vacuum filter through a 0 45 μm filter membrane then the particles on the filter membrane was rinsed with ethanol 0 79 g cm3 into a 50 ml beaker and the supernatant was discarded after 2 h settling the particles were then rinsed into the vacuum filter with a 0 45 μm filter membrane every density separation was conducted for three times after filtering the filter membrane was placed in a clean glass petri dish and dried at ambient temperature 2 2 2 sorting and identification sorting was based on the structure properties of the debris particles with consolidated structure that would not fragment into smaller parts in response to the stress from a tweezer were picked out for some samples it seemed neither practical nor viable to identify all the particles thus it was necessary to take subsamples murphy et al 2016 however the size of suspicious plastic particles ranged from 25 μm to 13 mm it is unreasonable to take subsample right after the exaction in order to get as much information about microplastics as possible in this study bigger 1 mm and conspicuous particles which could be easily manipulated by tweezer was firstly picked out subsamples were taken from the remaining smaller particles with modified method described in a study on marine snow zhao et al 2017 the remaining particles were resuspended with v1 ml ethanol in a tube the tube was shaken slightly to make the liquid homogeneous then v2 ml of the liquid was deposited on a potassium bromide window disk φa 12 mm and dried at ambient temperature in a clean glass petri dish the ratio of subsample was determined according to the pre experiment experience to control the amount of particles in subsamples less than 100 particles 1 mm were examined by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrometer in attenuated total reflectance atr mode thermo scientific nicolet 6700 particles 1 mm were examined using the micro ftir in transmission mode thermo scientific nicolet in 10 and all the spectrums were matched with the hummel polymer and additives library the concentration all plastic particles from the leachate was estimated using equation 1 1 concentration of plastic particles per

contamination mitigation all apparatuses sampling buckets stainless sieves beakers petri dishes tubes and vacuum filter used in the experiment were carefully cleaned with tap water for several times and then with distilled water for three times before use the sieves beakers and filter were covered with aluminum foil during procedure and the sorting of suspicious particles was conducted in a vertical flow cabinet to avoid the contamination of the airborne microplastics a cotton lab coat and butyronitrile gloves were worn all the time during the sampling process and lab work lab blank control group were conducted to evaluate the contamination during the procedure the triplicate blanks were made by collecting distilled water in pre cleaned plastic bucket for 10 h i e equal to the time spent between sampling and lab work at ambient temperature and then treated the same extraction sorting and identification procedure as the leachate samples as referring to talvitie et al 2017 3 results in order to avoid false positive result caused by the airborne microplastics main fibers during sampling and lab work stages fibers in all leachate samples were excluded in this study as a result 2 67 1 70 per 24 l non fiber plastic particles were found in blank control group si 2 comparing to the amount of plastic items found in leachate samples contamination during the procedure was acceptable which suggested that the results were reliable plastic particles were indeed found in all the 12 leachate samples from active landfills and closed landfills in total 621 plastic items were identified by ftir from the leachate samples according to equation 1 the concentration of microplastics in the 12 samples is calculated as showed in table 3 the concentration were different among samples ranging from 0 42 items l to 24 58 items l the lowest concentration of microplastics was found in s9 while the highest concentration of microplastics was found in s4 which is about 58 times the concentration of s9 the concentration of microplastics will affect the bioavailability with the increase of the concentration the bioavailability also increase auta et al 2017 wright et al 2013 nearly all the researches on microplastics have reported the concentration however there is no standardized analytical methods for the exaction identification and quantification due to the different

characteristics of microplastics the identified microplastics were categorized into 5 groups lines flakes fragments pellets and foams lines were elongated particles with one dimension greater than the other two flakes were sheets of plastic with their thickness significantly lower than other two dimensions fragments were pieces of irregular thick plastic with all three size dimensions comparable pellets were spherical particles foams were particles with spongy texture van der hal et al 2017 zobkov and esiukova 2017 fragments and flakes were found in all samples pellets were only found in s2

respectively fig 2 a line flake foam and fragment composed the majority 99 36 of all the plastic particles nearly all microplastics found in landfill leachate were with irregular shape and rough edges fig 3 shape is connected with the sources of microplastics antunes et al 2018 found resin pellet were the dominant category near industrial areas and high concentration of fragment and foam in fishing port antunes et al 2018 in domestic sewage and waste water treat plant plastic beads found in personal care products and fibers from the washing of polyester or other synthetic textile are two main microplastic inputs fendall and sewell 2009 hernandez et al 2017 the irregular shapes and rough edges of microplastics found in the landfill leachate indicated the fragment progress of larger plastic waste buried in landfill morét ferguson et al 2010 microplastics were found in both active and closed landfill leachate considering the substantial plastics buried in landfills the fragmentation implies a long term process of generation accumulation and release of microplastics in the landfills the size refers to the largest length of the plastic particles only microplastics 100 μm were detected in this study because large plastic items would ultimately degrade in to microplastics law and thompson 2014 plastic items 5 mm were also included in this study size distribution was different in all the samples plastic items 5 mm were found in s3 s4 and s5 no microplastics 1000 μm were found in s5 fig 1b in total 27 4 35 plastic items from the samples were larger than 5 mm the size of most plastic items was 100 1000 μm 74 88 the number of plastics items increased with the decreasing of size fig 2b the predominance of small microplastics implies that the fragmentation in the landfills is severe and smaller plastic debris is easier to be carried out by leachate size is very important when considering which potential organisms may ingest the microplastics and how the plastic debris may absorb organic pollutants morét ferguson et al 2010 as the size of the microplastic decline microplastics can be ingested by a wider range of organisms cozar et al 2014 meanwhile small particles with high surface to volume ratio of microplastics strongly increase the amount of contaminants absorbed from the ambient environment per gram plastic bouwmeester et al 2015 it has been reported that the concentration of microplastics using 80 μm mesh is up to 100 000 times higher than using 450 μm mesh ospar 2009 it is impossible to identify all the microplastics in samples and the selection of the lower limit of size would have a significant effect on the quantification of microplastics 4 discussion 4 1 potential pathways for plastic debris in landfills to the environment microplastics in leachate can be carried into the environment through leachate leakage and discharge of leachate collecting and treatment systems despite carefully controlled manufacturing and installation defects in geomembranes landfill liner occur leakage through landfill liners would be a pathway for microplastics to enter the environment foose et al 2001 leachate is a kind of heavily polluted water its treatment is much more complex than that of municipal wastewater during treatment leachate is collected in an equalization basin and then transferred to subsequent treatments including biological and physical chemical treatments renou et al 2008 wiszniowski et al 2006 membrane treatment is also widely applied in order to remove complex chemicals from the leachate peters 1998 though even the treatment process of municipal waste water can remove more than 98 microplastics magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 but it should be emphasized that microplastics won t be thermally chemically or biologically degraded during the treatment process treatment only changes the distribution of microplastics in raw leachate microplastics with high density modified by weathering and biofouling moret ferguson et al 2010 would deposit in the bottom of the equalization basin and the microplastics entering the subsequent treatment work would be distributed into the sludge and even the final effluent the re distribution of microplastics and subsequent treatment of sludge would determine the load and pathways for microplastics to the environment which should call for rigorous management of leachate treatment facilities according to the results in this study microplastics were also found in closed landfill leachate collecting and treatment of closed landfill leachate is conducted for 30 years in us and eu in china the post close care should be conducted until the pollutant in leachate meet a series of standards mnistry of ecology and environment prc 2008 us epa 2012 eur lex 1999 fragmentation and release of microplastics is a long term process but microplastic is not listed as pollutant in the any country s regulations of landfill after the stop of post closure care microplastics in leachate would be discharged directly in to natural water bodies to be noticed we measured the microplastics concentration was 0 42 24 58 items l in our leachate taken from the southern china while it was 0 4 51 items l in the leachates from nordic countries praagh et al 2018 the proportion of plastics in municipal solid waste in china is slightly low compared to that in western countries yang et al 2018 the former is 12 9 5 3 in wet basis for the waste in 18 chinese cities while the latter is 16 1 in wet basis for danish waste yang et al 2018 in contrast leachate generation rate in the southern china is significantly high accumulated leachate generation in 15 cities located in the southern china is estimated to be 1300 3200 l t waste or 1970 540 l t waste for a 100 years period yang et al 2015 while the leachate generation in ämmässuo landfill in finland is estimated to be 1430 l waste for a 100 years period niskanen et al 2009 therefore taking all these information for accounting the issue of microplastics released from leachate into environment requires more attention it is reasonable to believe that most microlastics are contained in landfills instead of being carried out by leachate in some countries landfill mining is conducted to excavate screen and separate the materials in landfills it is a strategy addressed to the pollution concerns of landfills limitations on urban development and recovery of deposited material of landfill krook et al 2012 several studies considered the predominantly fine soil like fraction of a landfill can potentially be applied as compost or soil fertilizer for soil amendments if mature organic content is relatively high and heavy metals is low hogland et al 2004 joseph et al 2003 quaghebeur et al 2013 the soil application of the fine solid like fraction of landfill bodies may introduce microplastics into the terrestrial environment microplastics are likely to accumulate in soils meanwhile microplastics in soil may be transported and redistributed by wind or carried by surface run off to the aquatic environment duis and coors 2016 zubris and richards 2005 besides microplastics contained in landfills may also be released via positive ventilation in aerated bioreactor landfills or natural ventilation in closed landfills the microplastics deep in landfill bodies will then flow with the airstream 4 2 future research directions barnes et al 2009 pointed out that placing plastics in landfill may simply be sorting a problem for the future the occurrence of microplastics in landfill leachate is an alarm of this concern it is economically and technologically unfeasible to remove microplastics from the environment preventing inputs of plastic microplastic during all stages of plastic life circle to the environment is essential to solve microplastic problem brandon et al 2016 eriksen et al 2018 jambeck et al 2015 more researches should concentrate on microplastic sources and serve for solutions researches is urgently need on establishing a standardized microplastic analytical methods for different objects it is essential for sound evaluation meaningful comparison and monitoring hidalgo ruz et al 2012 shim et al 2017 spatiotemporal variability in microplastic can cause great difference in investigating the concentration of microplastics law et al 2014 long term monitoring is necessary to get more information of microplastics in landfill temporal pattern should be conducted in further studies the variation of microplastics in leachate may also be effected by landfill conditions msw composition age status active and closed and technology of landfills which should also be considered in further studies the removal of microplastics during leachate treatment process is connected with loads and possible pathways for microplastics entering to the environment identifying the removal effectiveness at different stages of treatment will help understand the re distribution of microplastics during the treatment process and help take actions to avoid the release of microplastics 5 conclusion microplastics were identified in the leachate from both active and closed landfills the results provided important information on the possibility of landfills as a source of microplastics to confirm the role msw landfills play as a source of microplastics more studies are needed results of these studies may will have an important impact on landfill management and even the disposal of plastic waste acknowledgement the authors

18762,although landfill is suspected to be releasing microplastics to the environment there is few empirical researches carried out to clarify suspicions of landfills as potential sources of microplastics twelve leachate samples from four active and two closed municipal solid waste landfills were investigated microplastics were found in all the landfill leachate samples in total seventeen different types of plastics were identified in the leachate samples with calculated concentration ranging from 0 42 to 24 58 items l polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types

indispensable in contemporary daily life the development of plastic has been increasing considerably since the 1950s in the year 2017 the world plastic production reached 348 million tons plasticeurope 2018 approximately 50 of plastics are used for single use disposable products hopewell et al 2009 a large amount of abandoned plastics accumulating in the environment has been causing serious environmental problems barnes et al 2009 in recent years microplastics have been receiving considerable attentions microplastics defined as plastic particles 5 mm can be divided in to primary microplastics intentionally produced small plastic particles and secondary microplastics formed from breakdown of larger plastic material according to sources arthur et al 2009 microplastics are widespread and ubiquitous in environment their occurrence have been reported in marine bergmann et al 2015 desforges et al 2014 law et al 2014 wieczorek et al 2018 woodall et al 2014 fresh water imhof

2016 mahon et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 there is no doubt that the best way to eliminate microplastics pollution is to control and prevent plastics from entering the environment the control strategies are determined by sources so it is of great importance to understand the sources and pathways for microplastics to the environment arthur et al 2009 browne et al 2011 the major release of microplastics to the environment is generally recognized as the result of inappropriate waste management and improper human behavior barnes et al 2009 jambeck et al 2015 plastic beads used

sundt et al 2014 fiber loss from textile during washing hernandez et al 2017 were also reported to have been releasing microplastics to environment despite of the large number of existing researches covering the abundance composition sources and impact of microplastics as a new environmental challenge their sources are not comprehensively understood sundt et al 2014 landfilling as a widely applied strategy in the world for the disposal of waste was estimated to store 21 42 of the global plastic waste production nizzetto et al 2016a a large amount of plastics are buried in landfills as

and ramesh 2017 zettler et al 2013 all of the above factors may lead to the fragmentation of plastics to microplastics and small plastic debris would be carried out by the discharge of leachate imhof et al 2013 believed the land based source of microplastics entering the lake may originate from landfill experts on landfilling and hazardous substances in norway believe that landfills might have been leaking microplastic sundt et al 2014 alimi et al 2018 thought microplastics may be introduced to soils by landfill leachate however microplastic pollution has not been a widely considered topic in the field of waste treatment industry praagh et al 2018 in previous works kilponen 2016 assessed microplastics in a brook which was the recipient of leachate from an old closed landfill russo 2018 studied the treated leachate from eight waste treatment facility to investigate the spread of microplastics via leachate in sweden nordic council of ministers commissioned a project to investigate the occurrence of microplastics in landfill leachate in the nordic countries praagh et al 2018 until now empirical researches carried out on microplastics in landfills are still rare in order to clarify the suspicion of landfills as sources of microplastics and address the importance of microplastic researches on landfills we investigated the occurrence and characteristics of microplastics in landfill leachate from six different msw landfills and discussed the potentiality of msw landfills as sources of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization leachate sampling was conducted at six msw landfills from four different cities shanghai wuxi suzhou and changzhou in china leachate samples were collected from collecting wells or and equalization basins considering the access to the pre treatment leachate information about the investigated landfills and sampling sites is listed in table 1 for each individual sampling site 24 l leachate was collected in a pe bucket the buckets were well sealed and brought back to the laboratory for subsequent study basic physicochemical properties including ph chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 dissolved organic carbon doc ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and dissolved nitrogen dn were studied table 2 information about methodology for measurements was provided in si 1 2 2 method for the extraction and identification of microplastics the method applied for extraction and identification of microplastics in leachate was a modification of noaa laboratory methods masura et al 2015 2 2 1 extraction of microplastics the sample was filtered through a stack of stainless steel sieves φa 20 cm with descending mesh sizes of 150 75 45 and 25 μm all the solid screened out on the four sieves was carefully rinsed into a 500 ml beaker with distilled water then wet peroxide oxidation was performed to remove natural organic materials 40 ml 0 05 m fe ii solution and 40 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide was added into the beaker additional fe ii solution and hydrogen peroxide were supplemented until the mixture turned clear and no foam was floating on the surface then the mixture was filtered with a vacuum filter through a 0 45 μm filter membrane then a dual density separation was conducted to remove inorganic and the remaining natural organic material the first step was to remove the inorganic matter particles contained on the filter membrane was rinsed with sodium iodide solution 1 7 g cm3 into a 50 ml beaker nuelle et al 2014 after 2 h settling the supernatant was filtered with a vacuum filter through a 0 45 μm filter membrane then the particles on the filter membrane was rinsed with ethanol 0 79 g cm3 into a 50 ml beaker and the supernatant was discarded after 2 h settling the particles were then rinsed into the vacuum filter with a 0 45 μm filter membrane every density separation was conducted for three times after filtering the filter membrane was placed in a clean glass petri dish and dried at ambient temperature 2 2 2 sorting and identification sorting was based on the structure properties of the debris particles with consolidated structure that would not fragment into smaller parts in response to the stress from a tweezer were picked out for some samples it seemed neither practical nor viable to identify all the particles thus it was necessary to take subsamples murphy et al 2016 however the size of suspicious plastic particles ranged from 25 μm to 13 mm it is unreasonable to take subsample right after the exaction in order to get as much information about microplastics as possible in this study bigger 1 mm and conspicuous particles which could be easily manipulated by tweezer was firstly picked out subsamples were taken from the remaining smaller particles with modified method described in a study on marine snow zhao et al 2017 the remaining particles were resuspended with v1 ml ethanol in a tube the tube was shaken slightly to make the liquid homogeneous then v2 ml of the liquid was deposited on a potassium bromide window disk φa 12 mm and dried at ambient temperature in a clean glass petri dish the ratio of subsample was determined according to the pre experiment experience to control the amount of particles in subsamples less than 100 particles 1 mm were examined by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrometer in attenuated total reflectance atr mode thermo scientific nicolet 6700 particles 1 mm were examined using the micro ftir in transmission mode thermo scientific nicolet in 10 and all the spectrums were matched with the hummel polymer and additives library the concentration all plastic particles from the leachate was estimated using equation 1 1 concentration of plastic particles per

contamination mitigation all apparatuses sampling buckets stainless sieves beakers petri dishes tubes and vacuum filter used in the experiment were carefully cleaned with tap water for several times and then with distilled water for three times before use the sieves beakers and filter were covered with aluminum foil during procedure and the sorting of suspicious particles was conducted in a vertical flow cabinet to avoid the contamination of the airborne microplastics a cotton lab coat and butyronitrile gloves were worn all the time during the sampling process and lab work lab blank control group were conducted to evaluate the contamination during the procedure the triplicate blanks were made by collecting distilled water in pre cleaned plastic bucket for 10 h i e equal to the time spent between sampling and lab work at ambient temperature and then treated the same extraction sorting and identification procedure as the leachate samples as referring to talvitie et al 2017 3 results in order to avoid false positive result caused by the airborne microplastics main fibers during sampling and lab work stages fibers in all leachate samples were excluded in this study as a result 2 67 1 70 per 24 l non fiber plastic particles were found in blank control group si 2 comparing to the amount of plastic items found in leachate samples contamination during the procedure was acceptable which suggested that the results were reliable plastic particles were indeed found in all the 12 leachate samples from active landfills and closed landfills in total 621 plastic items were identified by ftir from the leachate samples according to equation 1 the concentration of microplastics in the 12 samples is calculated as showed in table 3 the concentration were different among samples ranging from 0 42 items l to 24 58 items l the lowest concentration of microplastics was found in s9 while the highest concentration of microplastics was found in s4 which is about 58 times the concentration of s9 the concentration of microplastics will affect the bioavailability with the increase of the concentration the bioavailability also increase auta et al 2017 wright et al 2013 nearly all the researches on microplastics have reported the concentration however there is no standardized analytical methods for the exaction identification and quantification due to the different methodologies it is difficult to compare the results of different researches hidalgo ruz et al 2012 shim et al 2017 3 1 plastic composition in total 17 different kinds of plastics were found in the

18763,catalyzed h2o2 propagations chp is characterized by the most robust reactivity of any of the in situ chemical oxidation isco technologies because it generates the strong oxidant hydroxyl radical along with nucleophiles reductants such as superoxide radical the most common groundwater contaminants trichloroethylene tce and perchloroethylene pce were used as model contaminants in evaluating the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 dosage on contaminant destruction kinetics both tce and pce degradation rates increased with h2o2 dosages up to 0 1 m and then decreased with higher h2o2 dosages parallel reactions conducted with the addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger 2 propanol and the hydroxyl radical specific probe nitrobenzene confirmed that hydroxyl radical is primarily responsible for tce and pce degradation however 5 20 of their degradation was attributed to a non hydroxyl radical mechanism reactions conducted with the superoxide probe tetranitromethane showed that superoxide generation rates increased with increasing h2o2 doses these results were confirmed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy therefore the non hydroxyl radical pathway for tce and pce degradation at h2o2 0 5 m was likely via nucleophilic attack by superoxide the results of this research demonstrate that contaminants present in the aqueous phase that are reactive with hydroxyl radical require only low doses of h2o2 0 1 m but subsurface systems contaminated with species not reactive with hydroxyl radical e g carbon tetrachloride require h2o2 concentrations 0 5 m graphical

controlled rates koh 109 m 1 s 1 haag and yao 1992 therefore hydroxyl radical has the potential to rapidly oxidize most contaminants found in surface soils and the subsurface if they are in the aqueous phase and are not sorbed or present as nonaqueous phase liquids napls sedlak and andren 1994 in addition non radical pathways can potentially generate ferryl iron feo2 its presence is difficult to differentiate from hydroxyl radical deguillaume et al 2005 barbusiński 2009 as h2o2 concentrations are increased in chp systems hydroxyl radical reacts with the excess h2o2 to generate superoxide radical anion o2 de laat and gallard 1999 3 oh h2o2 o2 h2o h superoxide is a weak nucleophile and reductant frimer 1988 in deionized water it is unreactive with highly chlorinated aliphatic compounds such as carbon tetrachloride hexachloroethane and chloroform halliwell and gutteridge 1985 pignatello 1992 however in the presence of solids or of cosolvents that are less polar than water including h2o2 superoxide reactivity in water increases furman et al 2009 resulting in effective degradation of halogenated aliphatic compounds via nucleophilic attack smith et al 2004 documented that superoxide is unreactive with chloroaliphatic compounds in deionized water however superoxide reactivity increased proportionately with the addition of increasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations the same increase in superoxide reactivity was found when acetone ethylene glycol and other solvents were added to deionized water superoxide systems highly oxidized compounds such as hexachloroethane carbon tetrachloride and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are unreactive with hydroxyl radical but are rapidly degraded in chp systems by superoxide watts et al 1999 teel and watts 2002 che and lee 2011 jho et al 2012 mitchell et al 2014 da silva rackov et al 2016 furthermore superoxide has surfactant like properties and promotes the enhanced desorption of hydrophobic contaminants from solids corbin et al 2007 do and kong 2012 rosas et al 2014 and the enhanced dissolution of napls watts et al 2005 smith et al 2006 these studies which used isco formulations that generate superoxide but do not generate measurable hydroxyl radical activity are consistent with a surfactant like role played by superoxide these results corroborate field data showing that chp isco injections result in contaminant rebound petri et al 2011a the mechanism of enhanced desorption of hydrophobic contaminants and enhanced dissolution of napls by superoxide has yet to be determined the generation of both hydroxyl radical and superoxide has distinct advantages for chp isco when both reactants are generated in chp systems they provide a near universal contaminant destruction matrix in which hydrophobic contaminants that are sorbed or present in napls are released to the aqueous phase and are then oxidized by hydroxyl radical or degraded through nucleophilic attack by superoxide quan et al 2003 smith et al 2009 2015 tce and pce are the most common subsurface contaminants resulting from the improper disposal of industrial chemicals watts 1998 these contaminants are alkenes and therefore react rapidly with hydroxyl radical koh for tce 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 koh for pce 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 tce and pce are degraded by hydroxyl radical to dichloroacetic acid during isco treatment leung et al 1992 the degradation products are then further degraded in the subsurface by natural attenuation watts 1998 however these contaminants are highly chlorinated and may also potentially be degraded by superoxide the pathways of tce and pce transformation in chp systems have yet to be investigated several studies have demonstrated that superoxide generation and reactivity becomes important in chp systems with h2o2 concentrations 0 5 0 17 m teel and watts 2002 smith et al 2004 2006 ahmad et al 2011 however a quantitative assessment of hydroxyl radical generation vs superoxide generation has not been conducted to date therefore the purpose of this research was to investigate the chp conditions that effectively degrade the common groundwater contaminants tce and pce to evaluate hydroxyl radical and superoxide generation as a function of h2o2 concentration and to assess their relative contributions to tce and pce degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals h2o2 50 technical grade iron iii

of 5 μg l as regulated under the u s safe drinking water act groundwater tce and pce concentrations at contaminated sites can range from nondetectable to 105 μg l for example gross and termath 1985

volatilized tce and pce smith et al 2006 the total aqueous solution was 10 ml the initial ph in all chp reactions ranging from 0 01 m h2o2 to 1 m h2o2 was 3 1 the consistency of the ph between reactions suggests that the ph of the reactions in the study was controlled by the iron iii perchlorate catalyst not by h2o2 the ph of the solutions remained constant for 30 min the maximum duration of the reactions hydroxyl radical is generated most effectively at low ph and superoxide is generated more effectively at high ph however the ph of 3 1 used in this study provides sufficient generation of both hydroxyl radical and superoxide afanas ev 1989 watts et al 1999 smith et al 2004 reaction vials and orbo tubes were extracted using 5 ml of hexane at selected time points and tce

results and discussion 3 1 tce and pce degradation by chp loss of tce in chp systems dosed with h2o2 concentrations ranging from 0 01 m to 1 m each initiated with 5 mm iron iii is shown in fig 1 a f control systems containing deionized water in place of h2o2 showed no measurable loss of tce tce was measured in orbo tubes at the end of each reaction tce masses captured in the orbo tubes were negligible confirming that volatilization over the course of the reactions was minimal the loss of tce after 20 min in systems containing 0 01 m and 0 025 m h2o2 was 84 and 97 respectively tce loss was more rapid in systems containing 0 05 m h2o2 98 loss after 15 min and 0 1 m h2o2 97 loss after 7 5 min these results indicate that the rate of tce loss increased with h2o2 concentrations in the range from 0 01 m to 0 1 m confirming that higher h2o2 concentrations increase the generation of reactive species watts et al 2005 however at higher h2o2 concentrations tce loss decreased with 98 loss after 15 min at 0 5 m h2o2 and 95 loss after 20 min at 1 m h2o2 in summary rates of tce loss increased as a function of h2o2 concentrations up to 0 1 m but then decreased with increasing h2o2 concentrations up to 1 m scavenging of hydroxyl radical with 2 propanol fig 1 resulted in no loss of tce in systems with 0 1 m h2o2 but approximately 10 and 20 tce loss occurred with hydroxyl radical scavenging in chp systems with 0 5 m h2o2 and 1 m h2o2 respectively these results suggest that a non hydroxyl radical pathway may be degrading some of the tce at h2o2 concentrations 0 5 m the loss of pce in chp systems with h2o2 concentrations ranging from 0 01 m to 1 m is shown in fig 2 a f parallel control systems containing deionized water in place of h2o2 showed no measurable loss of pce as in the tce systems analysis of orbo tubes showed negligible pce volatilization pce loss over 30 min was 87 in the chp system dosed with 0 01 m h2o2 and was 96 in the presence of 0 025 m h2o2 pce loss increased in chp systems containing 0 05 m h2o2 96 loss after 25 min and 0 1 m h2o2 96 loss after 15 min however when the h2o2 concentration was increased to 0 5 m pce loss was slower with 97 loss after 30 min and in chp systems containing 1 m h2o2 only 87 of the pce was oxidized over 30 min similar to the tce results rates of pce loss increased as a function of h2o2 dosage through 0 1 m and then decreased with h2o2 dosages of 0 5 m and 1 m the addition of 2 propanol to scavenge hydroxyl radical fig 2 resulted in no loss of pce in systems with h2o2 concentrations 1 m h2o2 however approximately 5 pce loss occurred with hydroxyl radical scavenging in chp systems with 1 m h2o2 randomized block design analysis of variance anova confirmed that the difference between the control and scavenged experiments was statistically significant at p 0 05 these results suggest that a non hydroxyl radical pathway may contribute a small amount to pce loss at h2o2 concentrations 1 m first order rate constants for tce and pce loss were derived from the data of figs 1 and 2 and from additional data of chp systems containing 0 25 m and 0 75 m h2o2 and were plotted as a function of h2o2 dosage fig 3 a and b first order rate constants for both tce and pce loss increased as a function of h2o2 dosage reaching a maximum at 0 1 m h2o2 and then decreased at higher h2o2 concentrations the rate of tce loss at 1 m h2o2 was 2 3 lower than at 0 1 m h2o2 fig 3a and the rate of pce loss at 1 m h2o2 was 4 0 lower than in the 0 1 m h2o2 system fig 3b the results of fig 3 are also in agreement with second order rate constants for the attack of hydroxyl radical on tce and pce the second order rate constant for hydroxyl radical attack on tce is 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 which is 1 7 greater than the rate constant for hydroxyl radical attack on pce koh 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 the mean tce pce ratio of first order rate constants shown in fig 3 for the six h2o2 dosages is 1 7 0 34 which is in agreement with hydroxyl radical as the primary transforming species in these chp systems 3 2 generation of hydroxyl radical in chp systems in order to evaluate the pathways of the reactive oxygen species generated as h2o2 dosages are increased in chp systems reactions were conducted using the hydroxyl radical specific probe compound nitrobenzene fig 4 in systems containing 0 05 m and 0 1 m h2o2 dosages 99 nitrobenzene oxidation was achieved within 10 min however with a 0 5 m h2o2 dose nitrobenzene loss was slower with 93 oxidized over 15 min when the h2o2 dose was increased to 1 m nitrobenzene oxidation decreased further with 69 loss over 15 min the results of fig 4 demonstrate that the maximum nitrobenzene oxidation rate was achieved with a dose of 0 1 m h2o2 these results are similar to the data shown in figs 1 and 2 for tce and pce destruction which suggests that hydroxyl radical is the primary reactive oxygen species responsible for tce and pce degradation the results of figs 1 4 can be applied to laboratory treatability studies which are typically conducted to determine appropriate isco process field conditions these results suggest that for contaminants reactive with hydroxyl radical koh 109 m 1 s 1 treatability studies should be conducted with target concentrations in the subsurface of 0 1 m 0 34 h2o2 3 3 generation of superoxide radical anion in chp systems recent studies have shown that oxidized contaminants not reactive with hydroxyl radical such as carbon tetrachloride and chloroform are degraded in chp systems the reactive species that has been proposed for the degradation of such oxidized organic contaminants is superoxide watts et al 1999 smith et al 2004 mitchell et al 2014 to evaluate the role of superoxide in the degradation of tce and pce loss of the superoxide probe tetranitromethane was evaluated in chp systems with h2o2 dosages ranging from 0 05 to 1 m the degradation of tetranitromethane in chp systems over 5 min is shown in fig 5 with 0 05 m and 0 1 m h2o2 dosages tetranitromethane degradation was 69 and 78 respectively when the h2o2 dosage was increased to 0 5 m and 1 m tetranitromethane degradation increased to 81 and 83 respectively unlike the findings of nitrobenzene oxidation rates tetranitromethane degradation increased with increasing concentrations of h2o2 even above 0 1 m h2o2 similar results were documented by smith et al 2004 as h2o2 concentrations in chp systems increased from 0 1 m to 1 m greater carbon tetrachloride transformation was observed and was proposed to be due to increased superoxide generation the results of fig 5 suggest that because superoxide is very effective at h2o2 concentrations 0 1 m 0 34 laboratory treatability studies should provide 0 1 m h2o2 to the subsurface if the contaminants are not reactive with hydroxyl radical but are degraded by superoxide e g carbon tetrachloride polyfluorinated compounds teel and watts 2002 smith et al 2004 mitchell et al 2014 3 4 kinetic analysis first order rate constants for nitrobenzene oxidation and tetranitromethane degradation were derived from the data of figs 4 and 5 and from additional data of chp systems containing 0 25 m and 0 75 m h2o2 and plotted as a function of h2o2 dosage fig 6 nitrobenzene oxidation rates which are proportional to hydroxyl radical generation rates reached a maximum at 0 1 m h2o2 fig 6a these results are similar to the results of fig 3a and b for tce and pce degradation rate constants in contrast the results of fig 6b demonstrate that relative superoxide generation rates as measured by tetranitromethane degradation continued to increase with increasing h2o2 concentrations these results are in agreement with the formation of superoxide through the propagation reaction shown in equation 2 as the h2o2 concentration increases h2o2 reacts with hydroxyl radical to generate superoxide which then degrades tetranitromethane 3 5 scavenging experiments the results of the scavenging experiments in figs 1 and 2 suggest that at h2o2 concentrations 0 5 m tce and pce are partially degraded by a non hydroxyl radical mechanism superoxide reactivity as measured by tetranitromethane degradation fig 5 was also highest at h2o2 concentrations 0 5 m the most common pathway described for the degradation of chloroaliphatic compounds by superoxide is through nucleophilic attack roberts and sawyer 1981 tce and pce are susceptible to nucleophilic attack but at relatively slow rates first order rate constants for nucleophilic attack via hydrolysis are 1 07 10 12 min 1 for tce and 1 37 10 15 min 1 for pce jeffers et al 1989 the increase in non hydroxyl radical degradation of tce and pce with increasing superoxide concentrations is consistent with an sn2 mechanism in which the degradation rate is dependent on the concentrations of both superoxide and tce or pce furthermore an sn2 mechanism is consistent with the results shown in figs 1 and 2 because tce degradation by superoxide was greater than pce degradation which is consistent with a more crowded transition state for pce relative to tce larsen and weber 1994 net first order rate constants for hydroxyl radical only degradation of tce and pce were calculated from the data of fig 3 by subtracting rates of reactions scavenged with 2 propanol from rates of reactions without scavenger the net first order rate constants for tce and pce degradation vs first order rate constants for oxidation of the hydroxyl radical probe nitrobenzene from fig 6a at all hydrogen peroxide doses are shown in fig 7 the relationships are linear with a slope of 1 17 for tce vs nitrobenzene figs 7a and 0 70 for pce vs nitrobenzene fig 7b the slope of these lines is consistent with the known first order reaction rate constants with hydroxyl radical for nitrobenzene koh 3 9 109 m 1s 1 tce koh 4 0 109 m 1s 1 and pce koh 2 8 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the ratio of the rate constants is 1 03 for tce to nitrobenzene and 0 72 for pce to nitrobenzene the linear fit of nitrobenzene oxidation rates vs the net hydroxyl radical only tce and pce degradation rates provides further evidence that hydroxyl radical is the primary species for tce and pce degradation first order rate constants for tce and pce degradation in reactions scavenged with 2 propanol in which degradation was the result of a non hydroxyl radical pathway shown in fig 3 were plotted against the first order rate constants for tetranitromethane degradation shown in fig 6b the result shown in fig 8 is a linear relationship with a slope of 0 022 for tce figs 8a and 0 0058 for pce fig 8b the results of fig 8 provide further evidence that superoxide is the non hydroxyl radical species responsible for a small portion of tce and pce degradation in chp systems 3 6 electron spin resonance spectroscopy the presence of both hydroxyl radical and superoxide in the chp systems was investigated by the addition of the spin trapping agent dmpo followed by esr spectroscopy analysis in the 0 1 m h2o2 chp system a distinct signal was seen for the hydroxyl radical adduct dmpo oh hyperfine splitting constants of an 14 6 g and ah 14 6 g confirming the presence of hydroxyl radical in the system fig 9 a when the h2o2 concentration was increased to 1 m the intensity of the dmpo oh hydroxyl radical adduct decreased significantly and a superoxide adduct dmpo ooh was present hyperfine splitting constants of an 14 4 g ah β 11 3 g and ah α 1 1 g confirming a decrease in hydroxyl radical generation and an increase in superoxide generation in chp systems at higher h2o2 concentrations the esr results from the two chp systems are consistent with esr spectra and hyperfine splitting constants obtained for superoxide and hydroxyl radical in other studies finkelstein et al 1980 yim et al 1990 zhao et al 2001 the results documented herein are based on conditions not generally applicable to full scale isco injections for example iron iii perchlorate was used as a catalyst because perchlorate does not quench hydroxyl radical but would not be used in the field because perchlorate is a groundwater pollutant watts 1998 most groundwaters do not contain soluble iron in mm concentrations however the subsurface is rich in iron and manganese oxides and oxyhydroxides which are effective chp catalysts tyre et al 1991 leung et al 1992 teel et al 2001 2007 because of the significant range of subsurface mineral contents soil organic matter and porosity laboratory treatability studies are always conducted to provide dosing criteria prior to conducting full scale isco injections the fundamental approach presented in this paper provides a rational basis for conducting such treatability studies interpreting their results and troubleshooting in the field treatability studies on groundwater containing contaminants reactive with hydroxyl radical would potentially investigate several doses of h2o2 at concentrations 0 1 m in contrast these results can be applied to treatability studies of contaminants not reactive with hydroxyl radical by applying several hydrogen peroxide doses of 0 1 m 3 7 practical applications the results of this research demonstrate that if a contaminant reacts rapidly with hydroxyl radical and it is not sorbed or present in a napl phase relatively low concentrations of h2o2 are effective in its destruction examples of such contaminants include tce pce 1 4 dioxane and methyl tert butyl ether mtbe because hydroxyl radical reacts rapidly with most contaminants of concern contaminant destruction to mcls 5 μg l is theoretically possible however if the contaminant exhibits low reactivity with hydroxyl radical but is degraded by superoxide in the presence of cosolvents or solids smith et al 2004 furman et al 2009 then higher h2o2 concentrations 0 1 m are necessary to promote superoxide generation and also to provide sufficient cosolvent in the system to enhance superoxide reactivity smith et al 2004 for example groundwater contaminated with carbon tetrachloride or chloroform which are unreactive with hydroxyl radical would require higher h2o2 concentrations that generate superoxide and increase its reactivity because superoxide lifetime and generation rates are greater at high ph afanas ev 1989 the superoxide degradation pathway is minimized under the ph conditions used in this study more alkaline conditions could be used if the superoxide pathway is to be optimized such as in the degradation of pfoa described by mitchell et al 2014 in addition any contaminant that is sorbed or present as a napl will require higher h2o2 concentrations to generate superoxide to promote the enhanced desorption of hydrophobic contaminants and the enhanced dissolution of napls corbin et al 2007 smith et al 2006 2009 2015 enhanced desorption and dissolution of contaminants increases their concentration in the aqueous phase where they can then be destroyed by hydroxyl radical superoxide or both hydrogen peroxide represents the primary cost of chp isco for soil and groundwater remediation the findings of this research provide guidelines for injecting the doses that provide the most effective and efficient use of hydrogen peroxide 4 conclusions tce and pce oxidation rates in chp systems increased to a maximum at 0 1 m h2o2 and then decreased at higher h2o2 concentrations hydroxyl radical is the reactive species primarily responsible for tce and pce degradation at h2o2 dosages 0 1 m superoxide generation increased with increasing

18763,catalyzed h2o2 propagations chp is characterized by the most robust reactivity of any of the in situ chemical oxidation isco technologies because it generates the strong oxidant hydroxyl radical along with nucleophiles reductants such as superoxide radical the most common groundwater contaminants trichloroethylene tce and perchloroethylene pce were used as model contaminants in evaluating the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 dosage on contaminant destruction kinetics both tce and pce degradation rates increased with h2o2 dosages up to 0 1 m and then decreased with higher h2o2 dosages parallel reactions conducted with the addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger 2 propanol and the hydroxyl radical specific probe nitrobenzene confirmed that hydroxyl radical is primarily responsible for tce and pce degradation however 5 20 of their degradation was attributed to a non hydroxyl radical mechanism reactions conducted with the superoxide probe tetranitromethane showed that superoxide generation rates increased with increasing h2o2 doses these results were confirmed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy therefore the non hydroxyl radical pathway for tce and pce degradation at h2o2 0 5 m was likely via nucleophilic attack by superoxide the results of this research demonstrate that contaminants present in the aqueous phase that are reactive with hydroxyl

compounds such as carbon tetrachloride hexachloroethane and chloroform halliwell and gutteridge 1985 pignatello 1992 however in the presence of solids or of cosolvents that are less polar than water including h2o2 superoxide reactivity in water increases furman et al 2009 resulting in effective degradation of halogenated aliphatic compounds via nucleophilic attack smith et al 2004 documented that superoxide is unreactive with chloroaliphatic compounds in deionized water however superoxide reactivity increased proportionately with the addition of increasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations the same increase in superoxide reactivity was found when acetone ethylene glycol and other solvents were added to deionized water superoxide systems highly oxidized compounds such as hexachloroethane carbon tetrachloride and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are unreactive with hydroxyl radical but are rapidly degraded in chp systems by superoxide watts et al 1999 teel and watts 2002 che and lee 2011 jho et al 2012 mitchell et al 2014 da silva rackov et al 2016 furthermore superoxide has surfactant like properties and promotes the enhanced desorption of hydrophobic contaminants from solids corbin et al 2007 do and kong 2012 rosas et al 2014 and the enhanced dissolution of napls watts et al 2005 smith et al 2006 these studies which used isco formulations that generate superoxide but do not generate measurable hydroxyl radical activity are consistent with a surfactant like role played by superoxide these results corroborate field data showing that chp isco injections result in contaminant rebound petri et al 2011a the mechanism of enhanced desorption of hydrophobic contaminants and enhanced dissolution of napls by superoxide has yet to be determined the generation of both hydroxyl radical and superoxide has distinct advantages for chp isco when both reactants are generated in chp systems they provide a near universal contaminant destruction matrix in which hydrophobic contaminants that are sorbed or present in napls are released to the aqueous phase and are then oxidized by hydroxyl radical or degraded through nucleophilic attack by superoxide quan et al 2003 smith et al 2009 2015 tce and pce are the most common subsurface contaminants resulting from the improper disposal of industrial chemicals watts 1998 these contaminants are alkenes and therefore react rapidly with hydroxyl radical koh for tce 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 koh for pce 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 tce and pce are degraded by hydroxyl radical to dichloroacetic acid during isco treatment leung et al 1992 the degradation products are then further degraded in the subsurface by natural attenuation watts 1998 however these contaminants are highly chlorinated and may also potentially be degraded by superoxide the pathways of tce and pce transformation in chp systems have yet to be investigated several studies have demonstrated that superoxide generation and reactivity becomes important in chp systems with h2o2 concentrations 0 5 0 17 m teel and watts 2002 smith et al 2004 2006 ahmad et al 2011 however a quantitative assessment of hydroxyl radical generation vs superoxide generation has not been conducted to date therefore the purpose of this research was to investigate the chp conditions that effectively degrade the common groundwater contaminants tce and pce to evaluate hydroxyl radical and superoxide generation as a function of h2o2 concentration and to assess their relative contributions to tce and pce degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals h2o2 50 technical grade iron iii

ultrapure system 2 2 model contaminants probe compounds and scavengers tce and pce were used as model contaminants to study degradation kinetics as a function of h2o2 concentrations in chp systems the initial concentrations of tce and pce were 100 μm these concentrations of tce and pce are mid range in relation to those commonly found in the field and are above the maximum contaminant levels mcls of 5 μg l as regulated under the u s safe drinking water act groundwater tce and pce concentrations at contaminated sites can range from nondetectable to 105 μg l for example gross and termath 1985 documented tce concentrations up to 10 000 μg l in groundwater at wartsmith air force base oscoda michigan u s and boone et al 1986 reported total chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations of 160 000 μg

compounds to identify the generation of reactive oxygen species in chp systems the initial concentrations of nitrobenzene and tetranitromethane were 1 mm and 300 μm respectively the probe compound concentrations were based on analytical detection limits and the linear range for analysis nitrobenzene was used as an oxidant probe to detect hydroxyl radical because it has high reactivity with hydroxyl radical koh 3 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 but not with reductants or nucleophiles ahmad et al 2012 tetranitromethane was used as a superoxide probe because it has high reactivity with

mm iron iii perchlorate the reaction systems consisted of h2o2 iron iii and one of the model contaminants tce or pce or probe compounds nitrobenzene or tetranitromethane the iron iii catalyzed system provided a superoxide driven chp reaction equation 2 all reactions were conducted in capped 20 ml borosilicate vials an orbo 32 gas absorbent tube was inserted into the teflon cap to capture any volatilized tce and pce smith et al 2006 the total aqueous solution was 10 ml the initial ph in all chp reactions ranging from 0 01 m h2o2 to 1 m h2o2 was 3 1 the consistency of the ph between reactions suggests that the ph of the reactions in the study was controlled by the iron iii perchlorate catalyst not by h2o2 the ph of the solutions remained constant for 30 min the maximum duration of the reactions hydroxyl radical is generated most effectively at low ph and superoxide is generated more effectively at high ph however the ph of 3 1 used in this study provides sufficient generation of both hydroxyl radical and superoxide afanas ev 1989 watts et al 1999 smith et al 2004 reaction vials and orbo tubes were extracted using 5 ml of hexane at selected time points and tce pce nitrobenzene and tetranitromethane concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography gc chromatographic conditions are described in section 2 5 in addition control experiments were conducted

the initial and final oven temperatures were 100 c and 160 c respectively with a program rate of 30 c min for tce or pce the program for tetranitromethane was 50 c and 160 c at a rate of 50 c min

results and discussion 3 1 tce and pce degradation by chp loss of tce in chp systems dosed with h2o2 concentrations ranging from 0 01 m to 1 m each initiated with 5 mm iron iii is shown in fig 1 a f control systems containing deionized water in place of h2o2 showed no measurable loss of tce tce was measured in orbo tubes at the end of each reaction tce masses captured in the orbo tubes were negligible confirming that volatilization over the course of the reactions was minimal the loss of tce after 20 min in systems containing 0 01 m and 0 025 m h2o2 was 84 and 97 respectively tce loss was more rapid in systems containing 0 05 m h2o2 98 loss after 15 min and 0 1 m h2o2 97 loss after 7 5 min these results indicate that the rate of tce loss increased with h2o2 concentrations in the range from 0 01 m to 0 1 m confirming that higher h2o2 concentrations increase the generation of reactive species watts et al 2005 however at higher h2o2 concentrations tce loss decreased with 98 loss after 15 min at 0 5 m h2o2 and 95 loss after 20 min at 1 m h2o2 in summary rates of tce loss increased as a function of h2o2 concentrations up to 0 1 m but then decreased with increasing h2o2 concentrations up to 1 m scavenging of hydroxyl radical with 2 propanol fig 1 resulted in no loss of tce in systems with 0 1 m h2o2 but approximately 10 and 20 tce loss occurred with hydroxyl radical scavenging in chp systems with 0 5 m h2o2 and 1 m h2o2 respectively these results suggest that a non hydroxyl radical pathway may be degrading some of the tce at h2o2 concentrations 0 5 m the loss of pce in chp systems with h2o2 concentrations ranging from 0 01 m to 1 m is shown in fig 2 a f parallel control systems containing deionized water in place of h2o2 showed no measurable loss of pce as in the tce systems analysis of orbo tubes showed negligible pce volatilization pce loss over 30 min was 87 in the chp system dosed with 0 01 m h2o2 and was 96 in the presence of 0 025 m h2o2 pce loss increased in chp systems containing 0 05 m h2o2 96 loss after 25 min and 0 1 m h2o2 96 loss after 15 min however when the h2o2 concentration was increased to 0 5 m pce loss was slower with 97 loss after 30 min and in chp systems containing 1 m h2o2 only 87 of the pce was oxidized over 30 min similar to the tce results rates of pce loss increased as a function of h2o2 dosage through 0 1 m and then decreased with h2o2 dosages of 0 5 m and 1 m the addition of 2 propanol to scavenge hydroxyl radical fig 2 resulted in no loss of pce in systems with h2o2 concentrations 1 m h2o2 however approximately 5 pce loss occurred with hydroxyl radical scavenging in chp systems with 1 m h2o2 randomized block design analysis of variance anova confirmed that the difference between the control and scavenged experiments was statistically significant at p 0 05 these results suggest that a non hydroxyl radical pathway may contribute a small amount to pce loss at h2o2 concentrations 1 m first order rate constants for tce and pce loss were derived from the data of figs 1 and 2 and from additional data of chp systems containing 0 25 m and 0 75 m h2o2 and were plotted as a function of h2o2 dosage fig 3 a and b first order rate constants for both tce and pce loss increased as a function of h2o2 dosage reaching a maximum at 0 1 m h2o2 and then decreased at higher h2o2 concentrations the rate of tce loss at 1 m h2o2 was 2 3 lower than at 0 1 m h2o2 fig 3a and the rate of pce loss at 1 m h2o2 was 4 0 lower than in the 0 1 m h2o2 system fig 3b the results of fig 3 are also in agreement with second order rate constants for the attack of hydroxyl radical on tce and pce the second order rate constant for hydroxyl radical attack on tce is 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 which is 1 7 greater than the rate constant for hydroxyl radical attack on pce koh 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 the mean tce pce ratio of first order rate constants shown in fig 3 for the six h2o2 dosages is 1 7 0 34 which is in agreement with hydroxyl radical as the primary transforming species in these chp systems 3 2 generation of hydroxyl radical in chp systems in order to evaluate the pathways of the reactive oxygen species generated as h2o2 dosages are increased in chp systems reactions were conducted using the hydroxyl radical specific probe compound nitrobenzene fig 4 in systems containing 0 05 m and 0 1 m h2o2 dosages 99 nitrobenzene oxidation was achieved within 10 min however with a 0 5 m h2o2 dose nitrobenzene loss was slower with 93 oxidized over 15 min when the h2o2 dose was increased to 1 m nitrobenzene oxidation decreased further with 69 loss over 15 min the results of fig 4 demonstrate that the maximum nitrobenzene oxidation rate was achieved with a dose of 0 1 m h2o2 these results are similar to the data shown in figs 1 and 2 for tce and pce destruction which suggests that hydroxyl radical is the primary reactive oxygen species responsible for tce and pce degradation the results of figs 1 4 can be applied to laboratory treatability studies which are typically conducted to determine appropriate isco process field conditions these results suggest that for contaminants reactive with hydroxyl radical koh 109 m 1 s 1 treatability studies should be conducted with target concentrations in the subsurface of 0 1 m 0 34 h2o2 3 3 generation of superoxide radical anion in chp systems recent studies have shown that oxidized contaminants not reactive with hydroxyl radical such as carbon tetrachloride and chloroform are degraded in chp systems the reactive species that has been proposed for the degradation of such oxidized organic contaminants is superoxide watts et al 1999 smith et al 2004 mitchell et al 2014 to evaluate the role of superoxide in the degradation of tce and pce loss of the superoxide probe tetranitromethane was evaluated in chp systems with h2o2 dosages ranging from 0 05 to 1 m the degradation of tetranitromethane in chp systems over 5 min is shown in fig 5 with 0 05 m and 0 1 m h2o2 dosages tetranitromethane degradation was 69 and 78 respectively when the h2o2 dosage was increased to 0 5 m and 1 m tetranitromethane degradation increased to 81 and 83 respectively unlike the findings of nitrobenzene oxidation rates tetranitromethane degradation increased with increasing concentrations of h2o2 even above 0 1 m h2o2 similar results were documented by smith et al 2004 as h2o2 concentrations in chp systems increased from 0 1 m to 1 m greater carbon tetrachloride transformation was observed and was proposed to be due to increased superoxide generation the results of fig 5 suggest that because superoxide is very effective at h2o2 concentrations 0 1 m 0 34 laboratory treatability studies should provide 0 1 m h2o2 to the subsurface if the contaminants are not reactive with hydroxyl radical but are degraded by superoxide e g carbon tetrachloride polyfluorinated compounds teel and watts 2002 smith et al 2004 mitchell et al 2014 3 4 kinetic analysis first order rate constants for nitrobenzene oxidation and tetranitromethane degradation were derived from the data of figs 4 and 5 and from additional data of chp systems containing 0 25 m and 0 75 m h2o2 and plotted as a function of h2o2 dosage fig 6 nitrobenzene oxidation rates which are proportional to hydroxyl radical generation rates reached a maximum at 0 1 m h2o2 fig 6a these results are similar to the results of fig 3a and b for tce and pce degradation rate constants in contrast the results of fig 6b demonstrate that relative superoxide generation rates as measured by tetranitromethane degradation continued to increase with increasing h2o2 concentrations these results are in agreement with the formation of superoxide through the propagation reaction shown in equation 2 as the h2o2 concentration increases h2o2 reacts with hydroxyl radical to generate superoxide which then degrades tetranitromethane 3 5 scavenging experiments the results of the scavenging experiments in figs 1 and 2 suggest that at h2o2 concentrations 0 5 m tce and pce are partially degraded by a non hydroxyl radical mechanism superoxide reactivity as measured by tetranitromethane degradation fig 5 was also highest at h2o2 concentrations 0 5 m the most common pathway described for the degradation of chloroaliphatic compounds by superoxide is through nucleophilic attack roberts and sawyer 1981 tce and pce are susceptible to nucleophilic attack but at relatively slow rates first order rate constants for nucleophilic attack via hydrolysis are 1 07 10 12 min 1 for tce and 1 37 10 15 min 1 for pce jeffers et al 1989 the increase in non hydroxyl radical degradation of tce and pce with increasing superoxide concentrations is consistent with an sn2 mechanism in which the degradation rate is dependent on the concentrations of both superoxide and tce or pce furthermore an sn2 mechanism is consistent with the results shown in figs 1 and 2 because tce degradation by superoxide was greater than pce degradation which is consistent with a more crowded transition state for pce relative to tce larsen and weber 1994 net first order rate constants for hydroxyl radical only degradation of tce and pce were calculated from the data of fig 3 by subtracting rates of reactions scavenged with 2 propanol from rates of reactions without scavenger the net first order rate constants for tce and pce degradation vs first order rate constants for oxidation of the hydroxyl radical probe nitrobenzene from fig 6a at all hydrogen peroxide doses are shown in fig 7 the relationships are linear with a slope of 1 17 for tce vs nitrobenzene figs 7a and 0 70 for pce vs nitrobenzene fig 7b the slope of these lines is consistent with the known first order reaction rate constants with hydroxyl radical for nitrobenzene koh 3 9 109 m 1s 1 tce koh 4 0 109 m 1s 1 and pce koh 2 8 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the ratio of the rate constants is 1 03 for tce to nitrobenzene and 0 72 for pce to nitrobenzene the linear fit of nitrobenzene oxidation rates vs the net hydroxyl radical only tce and pce degradation rates provides further evidence that hydroxyl radical is the primary species for tce and pce degradation first order rate constants for tce and pce degradation in reactions scavenged with 2 propanol in which degradation was the result of a non hydroxyl radical pathway shown in fig 3 were plotted against the first order rate constants for tetranitromethane degradation shown in fig 6b the result shown in fig 8 is a linear relationship with a slope of 0 022 for tce figs 8a and 0 0058 for pce fig 8b the results of fig 8 provide further evidence that superoxide is the non hydroxyl radical species responsible for a small portion of tce and pce degradation in chp systems 3 6 electron spin resonance spectroscopy the presence of both hydroxyl radical and superoxide in the chp systems was investigated by the addition of the spin trapping agent dmpo followed by esr spectroscopy analysis in the 0 1 m h2o2 chp system a distinct signal was seen for the hydroxyl radical adduct dmpo oh hyperfine splitting constants of an 14 6 g and ah 14 6 g confirming the presence of hydroxyl radical in the system fig 9 a when the h2o2 concentration was increased to 1 m the intensity of the dmpo oh hydroxyl radical adduct decreased significantly and a superoxide adduct dmpo ooh was present hyperfine splitting constants of an 14 4 g ah β 11 3 g and ah α 1 1 g confirming a decrease in hydroxyl radical generation and an increase in superoxide generation in chp systems at higher h2o2 concentrations the esr results from the two chp systems are consistent with esr spectra and hyperfine splitting constants obtained for superoxide and hydroxyl radical in other studies finkelstein et al 1980 yim et al 1990 zhao et al 2001 the results documented herein are based on conditions not generally applicable to full scale isco injections for example iron iii perchlorate was used as a catalyst because perchlorate does not quench hydroxyl radical but would not be used in the field because perchlorate is a groundwater pollutant watts 1998 most groundwaters do not contain soluble iron in mm concentrations however the subsurface is rich in iron and manganese oxides and oxyhydroxides which are effective chp catalysts tyre et al 1991 leung et al 1992 teel et al 2001 2007 because of the significant range of subsurface mineral contents soil organic matter and porosity laboratory treatability studies are always conducted to provide dosing criteria prior to conducting full scale isco injections the fundamental approach presented in this paper provides a rational basis for conducting such treatability studies interpreting their results and troubleshooting in the field treatability studies on groundwater containing contaminants reactive with hydroxyl radical would potentially investigate several doses of h2o2 at concentrations 0 1 m in contrast these results can be applied to treatability studies of contaminants not reactive with hydroxyl radical by applying several hydrogen peroxide doses of 0 1 m 3 7 practical applications the results of this research demonstrate that if a contaminant reacts rapidly with hydroxyl radical and it is not sorbed or present in a napl phase relatively low concentrations of h2o2 are effective in its destruction examples of such contaminants include tce pce 1 4 dioxane and methyl tert butyl ether mtbe because hydroxyl radical reacts rapidly with most contaminants of concern contaminant destruction to mcls 5 μg l is theoretically possible however if the contaminant exhibits low reactivity with hydroxyl radical but is degraded by superoxide in the presence of cosolvents or solids smith et al 2004 furman et al 2009 then higher h2o2 concentrations 0 1 m are necessary to promote superoxide generation and also to provide sufficient cosolvent in the system to enhance superoxide reactivity smith et al 2004 for example groundwater contaminated with carbon tetrachloride or chloroform which are unreactive with hydroxyl radical would require higher h2o2 concentrations that generate superoxide and increase its reactivity because superoxide lifetime and generation rates are greater at high ph afanas ev 1989 the superoxide degradation pathway is minimized under the ph conditions used in this study more alkaline conditions could be used if the superoxide pathway is to be optimized such as in the degradation of pfoa described by mitchell et al 2014 in addition any contaminant that is sorbed or present as a napl will require higher h2o2 concentrations to generate superoxide to promote the enhanced desorption of hydrophobic contaminants and the enhanced dissolution of napls corbin et al 2007 smith et al 2006 2009 2015 enhanced desorption and dissolution of contaminants increases their concentration in the aqueous phase where they can then be destroyed by hydroxyl radical superoxide or both hydrogen peroxide represents the primary cost of chp isco for soil and groundwater remediation the findings of this research provide guidelines for injecting the doses that provide the most effective and efficient use of hydrogen peroxide 4 conclusions tce and pce oxidation rates in chp systems increased to a maximum at 0 1 m h2o2 and then decreased at higher h2o2 concentrations hydroxyl radical is the reactive species primarily responsible for tce and pce degradation at h2o2 dosages 0 1 m superoxide generation increased with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentrations superoxide was partially responsible for tce and pce degradation at h2o2 concentrations 0 1 m declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known

conventional microbial degradation at controlling the formation of n dbps in this study the biodegradability of 20 aas was investigated and the impacts of microbial degradation for the selected 6 typical aas on the formation of n dbps haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides and traditional carbonaceous dbp chloroform were investigated the results indicated that glycine arginine aspartic acid asparagine alanine and serine were susceptible to biodegradation and the formation potentials fps of dbps were remarkably reduced after biodegradation the highest chloroform fp reduction rates from tryptophan and tyrosine were 85 4 and 56 2 respectively the fps of dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetamide were also reduced after biodegradation of the all selected aa samples during chlor am ination dichloroacetamide fps decreased continuously with incubation time during chlorination for phenylalanine asparagine aspartic acid and the mixed aas and the highest reduction rates were 78 7 74 6 46 7 and 35 3 respectively the results of integrated toxicity analysis indicated that the pre treatment of microbial degradation significantly decreased the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from aas moreover the microbial community analysis revealed that proteobacteria was predominant at phylum level in the mixed aa sample and the dominant genera were acinetobacter and pseudomonas

carbon filtration on the control of individual dbp precursors and dbps in drinking water have been studied however it is difficult to distinguish whether the removal of dbp precursors is mainly attributed to the biodegradation or the adsorption in biological activated carbon filtration chu et al 2012b more importantly little has been known about the dominant microbial species involved in the biodegradation of dbp precursors the amino acids aromatic group and amines liu et al 2017 in general the role of microorganisms in removing aas and controlling n dbp formation is unknown it is

from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china the characteristics of the 20 aas investigated in this study are shown in table 1 all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water produced from a millipore milli q gradient water purification system 18 mω cm billerica ma usa all chemicals used in the study were at least analytical reagent ar grade except where otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 solution preparations stock solutions 1 mg l as n for the 20 aas were prepared with ultrapure water and stored in the dark at 4 c usually the concentrations of aas range from μg l to mg l in surface waters and don level in the source water can reach several mg l dotson and westerhoff 2009 sharma and sohn 2012 also if the initial concentration of these aas used was too low the microbial degradation trend of organic nitrogen can not be effectively reflected therefore this study selected the 1 mg l as the initial concentration of aas moreover mixed solutions of 6 free aas for phe trp asn asp his and tyr phe trp asn asp his tyr 1 1 1 1 1 1 marked as mixed aas were also prepared for comparing dbp formation a free chlorine stock solution was prepared by diluting naocl solution active chlorine 5 with ultrapure water the fresh monochloramine nh2cl solutions were prepared following the procedures of mitch mitch and sedlak 2002 by slowly adding a prepared sodium hypochlorite solution to a chilled ammonium chloride solution with a molar ratio of hypochlorite to ammonia as 1 1 3 the inoculum in this study mixed liquid suspended solids mlss was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china once the mlss was brought back to the laboratory it was immediately diluted to 150 mg l as mother liquor it is noted that the mlss was chosen as an inoculum source for determining the biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen bdon in drinking water this was because mlss contains bacterial species commonly found in natural waters and it can degrade a range of complex natural and synthetic organics wadhawan et al 2014 moreover mlss has also been proven to be a reliable inoculum for determining biodegradable dissolved organic carbon in drinking water khan et al 2005 2 2 2 bdon bioassay the bioassay procedure used for determining the drinking water bdon by wadhawan et al 2014 was also used to determine the biodegradability of the 20 aas the dissolved organic nitrogen don value of the mlss mother liquor was measured before inoculating to the bottles and the detected don concentration was below the detection limit of 0 1 mg l therefore the bdon level contained in the inoculum can be ignored aa samples 200 ml were mixed with 2 ml of the inoculum in 250 ml amber bottles under the same conditions 200 ml aa samples were incubated with 2 ml of sterile water for the reference group the solutions were shaken thoroughly to aerate and then incubated at 25 c for a specific period of time in order to ensure complete ammonification of the don 14 day incubation periods were used in this study in accordance with previous studies seitzinger et al 2002 wiegner and seitzinger 2004 calculated according to equation 1 bdon relies on don changes in the aa water samples before and after incubation as follows 1 bdon don i don f where doni and donf represent the don before and after incubation respectively bdon values were calculated on the basis of don reduction or bdon removal during incubation usually bdon analysis is affected by the amount of inoculum added khan et al 2009 high amounts of inoculum will increase errors due to endogenous decay while less inoculum will lead to underestimated bdon values in this study three initial 0 5 1 5 and 3 0 mg l mlss dilutions were prepared with ultrapure water since glycine gly was one of the simplest aa in the 20 free aas and it was a standard don compound therefore 200 ml of the standard gly solution was mixed with 2 ml of the prepared mlss in a 250 ml amber bottle to determine the optimum inoculum concentration 2 2 3 disinfection experiments phe trp tyr asn asp and his have been reported to form highly toxic n dbps chu et al 2010b 2012a shah and mitch 2012 therefore these 6 aas were chosen for dbp fp tests the batch experiment containing 7 groups phe trp tyr asn asp and his groups as well as the 6 aa mixture group was conducted in sealed 40 ml amber glass bottles under headspace free conditions in the dark at 25 0 5 c based on the methods developed in previous studies krasner et al 2007 chu et al 2013 the free chlorine condition was achieved by the addition of sufficient chlorine to break free any ammonia the disinfectant dosages for fp tests were calculated by equation 2 for free chlorine or equation 3 for the chloramines krasner et al 2007 the solutions were buffered at ph 7 with phosphate salts 0 2 m sodium monohydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 and 0 3 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 prior to dbp fp tests at the end of the predetermined reaction time dbps were immediately extracted by adding 2 ml methyl tert butyl ether to a 10 ml sample and then shaking the sample for 5 min using a multi tube vortex mixer dmt

specific detection details can be found in a previous study chu et al 2010b other detailed information about the analytical method used for dbps is available in the supplementary materials table s1 2 4 microbial diversity analysis 2 4 1 dna extraction and pcr amplification water samples were collected from the mixed aas group on day 0 immediately after inoculation 1 3 7 and 14 days after inoculation for the sequencing measurements the water samples were filtered through 0 2 μm filter membranes and the microorganisms in the solutions were retained on the membranes afterwards the microbial dna was extracted from the prepared membranes using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s protocols the final dna concentrations and purifications were determined using a nano drop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa and the dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene were amplified with primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat using a thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa chu et al 2015 ou et al 2018 the details for the pcr amplification are available in the supplementary materials section s1 2 4 2 illumina miseq sequencing the purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired end sequenced 2 300 on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa according to the standard protocols by shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd china the sequencing data processing is as follows raw fastq files were demultiplexed quality filtered by trimmomatic and merged by flash with the following criteria i the reads were truncated at any site receiving an average quality score 20 over a 50 bp sliding window ii primers were exactly matched allowing 2 nucleotide mismatching and reads containing ambiguous bases were removed iii sequences whose overlap longer than 10 bp were merged according to the overlap sequence the operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with 97 similarity cut offs using uparse version7 1 http drive5 com uparse and the chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analysed using the rdp classifier algorithm http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu123 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimisation of the inoculum concentration to determine the optimal inoculum concentration the biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen bdon levels in glycine gly solutions with three inoculated sizes 0 5 1 5 and 3 mg l respectively were determined and are shown in fig s1 as depicted in fig s1 during the first 7 days bdon concentrations in all the samples increased with incubation time and then fewer changes were observed during the subsequent incubations in addition the bdon concentration in the sample with 0 5 mg l mlss was always lower than that in the samples with 1 5 and 3 mg l mlss no significant bdon differences were observed in the samples inoculated with 1 5 and 3 mg l mlss the inoculum size should be minimized to limit the release of soluble microbial products but too small of an inoculum size can lead to an underestimated bdon therefore based on the above results 1 5 mg l mlss was decided as the optimal inoculum concentration for further experiments 3 2 biodegradability of the 20 free aas fig 1 presents the biodegradability of the 20 aas by calculating the bdon proportion on different incubation days to the initial don concentration bdon doni simsek et al 2016 the closer to the centre of the circle the poorer the biodegradability of the present aa as shown in fig 1 the don in the 20 aas had different sensitivities to biodegradation for example 92 0 of gly 85 0 of asp and 81 0 of ala were mineralized into nh3 n while only 39 0 of met was mineralized into nh3 n after 14 days of incubation according to the biodegradation sensitivity the aas were divided into three categories 1 large biodegradation the red font in fig 1 gly arginine arg aspartic acid asp asparagine asn alanine ala and serine ser 2 moderate biodegradation the purple font in fig 1 tyrosine tyr phenylalanine phe glutamic acid glu glutamine gln threonine thr tryptophan trp histidine his isoleucine lle leucine leu proline pro and lysine lys 3 slight biodegradation the black font in fig 1 valine val cysteine cys and methionine met among the 20 aas gly was the most sensitive to biodegradation and this can be explained by the fact that gly is the simplest aa with a relatively smaller structure and the smallest side chain containing only one hydrogen conversely met has a longer structure with more side chains making it less amenable to biodegradation dias and alexander 1971 3 3 impact of biodegradation on thm formation chloroform cf was the most commonly detected c dbp in the water samples fig 2 a and fig 2b show the effects of microbial degradation of the selected precursors on cf formation potential fp during chlor am ination as illustrated in fig 2a tryptophan trp and tyrosine tyr the purple font in fig 2a had higher cf fps before inoculation with mlss and they were the main precursors of cf while the cf fps of tyr and trp decreased with time after inoculation during chlorination cf fp of tyr decreased by 31 2 38 7 51 2 and 56 2 within 1 3 7 and 14 days after inoculation fig 2a in addition a similar pattern was observed for trp where cf fp was reduced by 64 3 80 7 81 0 and 85 4 respectively within 1 3 7 and 14 days after inoculation during chlorination fig 2a during chloramination the cf fp from all the aa samples remarkably decreased fig 2b however no change in the cf fp with time was observed for the sterile reference groups fig 2c and d as mentioned in the literature hureiki et al 1994 activated aromatic structures are important cf precursors and trp and tyr belong to the aromatic aas explaining the high reaction activity observed with chlorine and chloramine during this study previous studies speculated that cf formation of tyr was related to the ring opening of chlorophenol intermediates during chlor am ination chu et al 2009 2012a another study discovered that some microorganisms were versatile aromatic degraders for phenolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatics such as indole qiao et al 2015 therefore the decrease of cf fp can be potentially explained by microbial degradation that reduces the aromatic structure and chlorophenol intermediates structure of tyr and trp moreover it was clearly observed that the cf fp for trp decreased more than tyr this may be caused by the difference between their chemical structures trp has a benzene aromatic hydrocarbon structure and an indole group heterocyclic aromatic while tyr has only a benzene aromatic hydrocarbon structure biodegradation destroyed the aromatic structure in trp more than in tyr resulting in a higher cf fp reduction rate in trp however cf fp from the mixed aas dramatically increased during chlorination after the 7 and 14 days of incubation moreover the cf fp did not decrease during chlorination of phe asn asp and his separately the increase of cf fp in mixed aas could be explained by that the biodegradation products of phe asn asp and his may form cf more favorably during chlor am ination 3 4 impact of biodegradation on han formation dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan were the dominant han species detected in the drinking water samples this study mainly focused on the chlorinated and chloraminated dcan because the tcan concentrations in the aa samples were below the detection limit approx 0 1 μg l fig 3 a and fig 3b present the effect of microbial degradation on dcan fp during chlorination and chloramination of the selected aas for all the aas dcan fp decreased sharply with the incubation time during both chlorination and chloramination for example comparing the reference group without mlss the dcan fp from phe trp tyr asn asp his and the mixed aas during chlorination decreased by 76 6 96 8 89 5 93 8 99 9 74 6 and 99 5 after the 7 day incubations a similar pattern was observed for chloramination where the produced dcan from all the aas was below the detection limit after 3 day incubations while there was no dcan fp change observed with time for the group without mlss fig 3c and d additionally it was observed that dcan fp of all aas was 1 3 orders of magnitude higher during chlorination than chloramination this can be explained by the fact that chloramine is a weaker oxidant than chlorine in general microbial degradation resulted in the decrease of dcan fp notably the dcan fp decreased more in asp and asn groups than in the phe trp and his groups a previous study found that conventional treatment integrated with biologically activated carbon bac filtration dramatically reduced the dcan fp by around 80 compared with the conventional treatment chu et al 2012b another study indicated that micro ozone pre treatment combined with conventional treatment and bac resulted in around a 51 1 greater reduction of dcan fp compared to other treatments hu et al 2018 these results demonstrate that microbial action in bac might play an indispensable role in removing the dcan precursors as shown in fig 3a and b when mlss was introduced in the water samples there was a significant decrease in dcan fp after 3 days of incubation for all the aas during chlorination and chloramination there were no obvious changes in dcan fp during chlorination and chloramination for the period from day 7 to day 14 overall the dcan fp achieved a good reduction after the microbial degradation of the aa samples during chlor am ination generally there was a greater dcan fp decrease for the precursors with stronger biodegradability the decrease of don in aas was caused by microbial degradation fig s2 showed the relationship between don degradation rate and the decrease rate of dcan formation during chlorination in mixed aas it can be seen that the decrease rate of dcan formation was higher than the corresponding don degradation rate fig s2 inferring that the decrease of dcan formation was partly due to the ammonification of don in mixed aas and another potential reason might be that the biodegradation products of mixed aas was difficult to produce dcan moreover a linear relationship between don degradation rate and the decrease rate of dcan formation was observed in mixed aas indicating that with the don microbial degradation the chlorinated product dcan of aas would decrease accordingly 3 5 impact of biodegradation on ham formation the dichloroacetamide dcam and trichloroacetamide tcam formed during chlor am ination in aa groups with and without mlss incubation are shown in fig 4 dcam and tcam were detectable in all the aa samples in this study during chlorination and this is consistent with a previous study chu et al 2010b phe asn and asp the purple font in fig 4a were found to possess much higher dcam fp values than the other precursors during chlorination indicating that they were the main dcam precursors during chlorination dcam fp decreased continuously with mlss incubation time for phe asn and asp groups and the highest reduction rates were 78 7 74 6 and 46 7 respectively apparently asn and asp were susceptible to biodegradation and the degradation of asn and asp resulted in the decrease of dcam fp though phe was amenable to biodegradation it had an even higher reduction rate this might be caused not only by the degradation of phe but also the low reactivity of the phe degradation products with chlorine in addition it was clear that there were no changes in the reference group samples fig 4 c d g and h as shown in fig 4a and b dcam clearly decreased during the first day after mlss inoculation for all the aa groups during chlor am ination and dcam was below the detection limit after 3 days of incubation during chloramination this indicates that the biodegradation of aas reduced the production of dcam as for trp tyr and his the dcam fps were extremely low initially and slightly increased after inoculation this might be explained by the release of microbial metabolites and intracellular matter that increased the formation of dcam at present biological treatment processes e g biological activated carbon have been increasingly added to drinking water treatment plants the degradation efficiency of aas can be improved by strengthening the biological treatment capacity such as inoculating microorganisms which can degrade aas in biological treatment process then the microbial metabolites can be absorbed by activated carbon and removed with sand membrane filtration in drinking water treatment plants azami et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2013 therefore microbial metabolites and intracellular matter may not be considered as a serious issue fig 4e and f show that tcam fps from all the aas were greatly reduced with incubation time during chlor am ination indicating that phe trp tyr asn asp and his were biodegradable although the biodegradability among them was slightly different dcam and tcam fps decreased by 35 3 and 98 9 respectively for the mixed aa group during chlorination the greater decrease of hams in the mixed aas may be caused by the synergistic microbial degradation of mixed aas this implies that the microbial degradation of the mixed aas may eventually inhibit the production of dcam and tcam during subsequent chlorination and chloramination 3 6 the integrated toxic risks in order to further compare the integrated toxicity of the detected thms hans and hams formed in different groups with and without the pre treatment of microbial biodegradation this study calculated the toxicity of each dbp using the integrated toxicity analysis method as stated in previous studies yang et al 2014 chu et al 2016 the calculation formula is shown in equation 4 4 itrv x ctv x fp x itrvx integrated toxic risk value for x ctvx combined toxicity value m 1 of each detected x fpx formation potential nm of each x x cf dcan dcam tcam the combined toxicity values of each dbp are present in table s2 in detail and fig 5 shows the integrated toxicity of dbps formed in each aa group as shown in fig 5 the integrated toxicity risk values of dbps for all the selected samples after the 14 days of incubation were much lower than those without the incubation although the cf fps of phe asn asp his and mixed aas fig 2a and the dcam fps of trp tyr and his fig 4a increased this is mainly attributable to the great decrease of dcan fig 3a and dcan has higher combined toxicity plewa et al 2008 table s2 overall the pre treatment of microbial degradation evidently decreased the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from aas 3 7 microbial diversity and composition 3 7 1 microbial diversity and similarity the initial mlss the inoculum sample was labelled as d0 and the mixed aa inoculated with mlss for 1 3 7 and 14 days were labelled as d1 d3 d7 and d14 respectively the selected alpha diversity parameters chao index shannon index and coverage index are present in table 2 the coverage index values for all the 5 samples were over 0 99 and fig s3 shows that the five curves tended to be flat with the increase of sequence numbers indicating that the sequence numbers can represent almost all microbial community in each sample lemos et al 2011 the results of shannon and chao index indicated that the microbial community diversity decreased with the incubation time probably with the degradation of aas the dominant microbial communities changed the veen analyses fig 6 is used to compare the similarity and the difference of the bacterial communities among the 5 samples it depicts that 148 otus were shared by the 5 samples while 32 unique otus were contained in d0 only 1 in d1 none in d3 and d7 17 in d14 indicating that the bacterial communities in d1 d3 d7 and d14 samples were highly similar the unique otus numbers decreased with the incubation time implying the dominance of some species along with the incubation time 3 7 2 microbial structure and composition the assignment and relative abundance of the 16s rrna gene based microbial taxonomy for the microbial communities with incubation times is presented in fig 7 a at phylum level and in fig 7b at the genus level the bacterial community in the initial sample was the most diverse and several phyla including proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were dominant during the period from day 1 to day 14 after inoculation the microbial community became less diverse specifically proteobacteria became predominant at phylum level and the dominant genera became pseudomonas acinetobacter and comamonas within 14 days after inoculation the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 28 3 in d0 but it dramatically increased to 83 3 94 9 in d1 d14 this phenomenon proves the speculation of fig 6 it indicates that proteobacteria was dominant in degrading aas correspondingly the relative abundance of acinetobacter pseudomonas and comamonas increased from less than 1 to 26 5 49 1 23 1 24 1 and 12 4 respectively bacteroidetes as the second dominant phylum accounted for 2 3 3 5 4 5 and 12 6 on days 1 3 7 and 14 respectively the dominant bacteria detected in this study were in line with previous studies hu et al 2012 ma et al 2013 wang et al 2018 for example some researchers reported that either proteobacteria or bacteroidetes was the dominant phylum in the activated sludge samples collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants aeration tanks hu et al 2012 it is known that municipal wastewater usually contains high amounts of organic matter such as carbohydrates proteins aas fatty acids and esters importantly activated sludge systems can be used to remove dissolved and colloidal state biodegradable organic compounds and the reported dominant bacteria in activated sludge is proteobacteria and or bacteroidetes ma et al 2013 hu et al 2012 indicating proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the potential contributors for biodegradable organic compound degradation furthermore a recent survey indicated that proteobacteria was predominant during regrowth after water disinfection becerra castro et al 2016 as for the genus level previous studies showed that the acinetobacter species can degrade chlorophenols and cyprodinil kim and hao 1999 chen et al 2018 the aas contain the phenol and benzene ring in their chemical structures and this could explain the sharp increase in the acinetobacter relative abundance this indicates that acinetobacter may play an important role in decreasing dbps fps moreover pseudomonas has a strong ability to decompose protein like compounds it has been reported that pseudomonas is responsible for the removal of organic matter under aerobic conditions mujtaba et al 2017 pseudomonas is also able to degrade dioxin like and phenolic compounds hong et al 2000 kurzbaum et al 2017 therefore the proteobacteria species may play an extremely important role in degrading aas and reducing dbp fps based on the discussion above and the predominant bacteria observed in fig 5a it can be speculated that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the main contributors to aa degradation 4 conclusions according to the biodegradation sensitivity results gly arg asp asn ala and ser were susceptible to biodegradation tyr phe glu gln thr trp his lle leu pro and lys were amenable to biodegradation during chlor am ination the trp and tyr cf fps decreased by 85 4 and 56 2 after microbial degradation but did not decrease for phe asn asp and his dcan fps decreased sharply from all the selected aa samples during chlor am ination and the stronger biodegradability of dbps precursors the higher the dcan fp reduction the highest dcam fps reductions were 78 7 74 6 46 7 and 35 3 for phe asn asp and the mixed aas respectively the tcam fps of all the selected precursors were greatly reduced during both chlorination and chloramination moreover the pre treatment of microbial degradation eveidently decreased the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from aas therefore microbial degradation of aa has a great potential for controlling dbps fp additionally the most dominant phylum in the mixed aa sample was proteobacteria in which acinetobacter and pseudomonas were the predominant genus proteobacteria may play an extremely important role in degrading aas and reducing dbp fps in the future drinking water treatment plants can strengthen the biological treatment capacity by inoculating microorganisms

18764,nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps in chlorinated drinking water are receiving increasing attention due to their elevated toxicities an effective strategy to control the formation of n dbps is to reduce their nitrogenous precursors e g amino acids aas believed to be the important n dbp precursors before disinfection so far little information is available about the effectiveness of conventional microbial degradation at controlling the formation of n dbps in this study the biodegradability of 20 aas was investigated and the impacts of microbial degradation for the selected 6 typical aas on the formation of n dbps haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides and traditional carbonaceous dbp chloroform were investigated the results indicated that glycine arginine aspartic acid asparagine alanine and serine were susceptible to biodegradation and the formation potentials fps of dbps were remarkably reduced after biodegradation the highest chloroform fp reduction rates from tryptophan and tyrosine were 85 4 and 56 2 respectively the fps of dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetamide were also reduced after biodegradation of the all selected aa samples during chlor am ination dichloroacetamide fps decreased continuously with incubation time during chlorination for phenylalanine asparagine aspartic acid and the mixed aas and the highest reduction rates were 78 7 74 6 46 7 and 35 3 respectively the results of integrated toxicity analysis indicated that the pre treatment of microbial degradation significantly decreased the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from aas moreover the microbial community analysis revealed that proteobacteria was predominant at phylum level in the mixed aa sample and the dominant genera were acinetobacter and pseudomonas proteobacteria may play an important role in controlling dbp precursor graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products chloroform haloacetonitriles haloacetamides amino acids microbial

disinfectants to produce numerous disinfection by products dbps that are associated with adverse human health effects including bladder cancer rectal cancer and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes plewa and wagner 2015 richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 villanueva et al 2007 bove et al 2002 since the identification of chloroform cf as a dbp in 1974 rook 1974 bellar et al 1974 more than 700 dbps have been reported in the literature yang and zhang 2016 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 richardson and postigo 2015 pan et al 2016 carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as trihalomethanes thms are frequently identified in treated water korshin et al 2002 goslan et al 2009 krasner et al 2006 these dbps were widely regulated richardson 2011 u s environmental protection agency 2006 nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams are of growing concern due to their higher cyto and genotoxicities in mammalian cell assays than the currently regulated c dbps plewa et al 2002 2008 plewa 2008 muellner et al 2007 dissolved organic nitrogen don such as amino acids aas and proteinaceous compounds in source waters are important halogenated n dbp precursors lee et al 2007 westerhoff and mash 2002 chu et al 2010a bond et al 2011 many of these compounds are characterised by low molecular weights and high hydrophilicities with poor removal efficiencies in conventional water treatment plants that employ coagulation sedimentation filtration systems dotson and westerhoff 2009 chu et al 2011a more importantly aas constitute an important class in the don pool and they were highlighted as key precursors of regulated and unregulated dbps chu et al 2010b shah and mitch 2012 it has been demonstrated that thms could form from all aas although yields varied with aas species and associated side chains hong et al 2009 besides ueno et al 1996 showed that dichloroacetonitrile dcan could be produced from the chlorination of many common aas moreover 7 aas namely phenylalanine phe tryptophan trp tyrosine tyr asparagine asn aspartic acid asp histidine his and glutamine were reported to form hams during chlorination chu et al 2010b in recent years waters discharged with wastewater or algal blooms have been used as drinking water sources due to the high demands resulting from population growth these source waters usually have higher don levels and in which aas constitute an important class of don pool westerhoff and mash 2002 dotson and westerhoff 2009 also the 20 free aas are commonly identified in raw waters dotson and westerhoff 2009 chen et al 2003 hagedorn et al 2000 for example dotson and westerhoff 2009 reported that the typical organic nitrogen compound aas occurred at concentrations between 50 and 1000 μg l in river streams and lakes generally the high molecular weight organics e g proteins are easier to remove during conventional water treatment e g coagulation sedimentation filtration in drinking water treatment plants lee and westerhoff 2006 but don compounds with low molecular weight e g aas can pass through the conventional water treatment processes and can react with chlorine to form dbps dotson and westerhoff 2009 lee and westerhoff 2006 chu et al 2011b fortunately biological treatment processes such as biological contact oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration have been increasingly added to existing drinking water treatment plants resulting in the reduced formation of several dbps during subsequent chlorination tang and xie 2016 chu et al 2012b 2014 karnik et al 2005 however sometimes biological contact oxidation and biological activated carbon filtration can also cause the increase in n dbps during chlorination chu et al 2011a 2014 liu et al 2017 at present the impact of biological activated carbon filtration on the control of individual dbp precursors and dbps in drinking water have been studied however it is difficult to distinguish whether the removal of dbp precursors is mainly attributed to the biodegradation or the adsorption in biological activated carbon filtration chu et al 2012b more importantly little has been known about the dominant microbial species involved in the biodegradation of dbp precursors the amino acids aromatic group and amines liu et al 2017 in general the role of microorganisms in removing aas and controlling n dbp formation is unknown it is necessary to identify the microorganisms associated with the biodegradation of dbp precursors and strengthen the biological treatment process of drinking water the objective of this study was to explore the impact of traditional biodegradation on the formation potentials fps of thms hans and hams from a range of typical aas phe trp tyr asn asp his and their mixed solutions furthermore the biodegradability of 20 aas and the microbial community structure characteristics in a mixed aa sample were also investigated this study was expected to provide the basic information for controlling

from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china the characteristics of the 20 aas investigated in this study are shown in table 1 all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water produced from a millipore milli q gradient water purification system 18 mω cm billerica ma usa all chemicals used in the study were at least analytical reagent ar grade except where otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 solution preparations stock solutions 1 mg l as n for the 20 aas were prepared with ultrapure water and stored in the dark at 4 c usually the concentrations of aas range from μg l to mg l in surface waters and don level in the source water can reach several mg l dotson and westerhoff 2009 sharma and sohn 2012 also if the initial concentration of these aas used was too low the microbial degradation trend of organic nitrogen can not be effectively reflected therefore this study selected the 1 mg l as the initial concentration of aas moreover mixed solutions of 6 free aas for phe trp asn asp his and tyr phe trp asn asp his tyr 1 1 1 1 1 1 marked as mixed aas were also prepared for comparing dbp formation a free chlorine stock solution was prepared by diluting naocl solution active chlorine 5 with ultrapure water the fresh monochloramine nh2cl solutions were prepared following the procedures of mitch mitch and sedlak 2002 by slowly adding a prepared sodium hypochlorite solution to a chilled ammonium chloride solution with a molar ratio of hypochlorite to ammonia as 1 1 3 the inoculum in this study mixed liquid suspended solids mlss was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china once the mlss was brought back to the laboratory it was immediately diluted to 150 mg l as mother liquor it is noted that the mlss was chosen as an inoculum source for determining the biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen bdon in drinking water this was because mlss contains bacterial species commonly found in natural waters and it can degrade a range of complex natural and synthetic organics wadhawan et al 2014 moreover mlss has also been proven to be a reliable inoculum for determining biodegradable dissolved organic carbon in drinking water khan et al 2005 2 2 2 bdon bioassay the bioassay procedure used for determining the drinking water bdon by wadhawan et al 2014 was also used to determine the biodegradability of the 20 aas the dissolved organic nitrogen don value of the mlss mother liquor was measured before inoculating to the bottles and the detected don concentration was below the detection limit of 0 1 mg l therefore the bdon level contained in the inoculum can be ignored aa samples 200 ml were mixed with 2 ml of the inoculum in 250 ml amber bottles under the same conditions 200 ml aa samples were incubated with 2 ml of sterile water for the reference group the solutions were shaken thoroughly to aerate and then incubated at 25 c for a specific period of time in order to ensure complete ammonification of the don 14 day incubation periods were used in this study in accordance with previous studies seitzinger et al 2002 wiegner and seitzinger 2004 calculated according to equation 1 bdon relies on don changes in the aa water samples before and after incubation as follows 1 bdon don i don f where doni and donf represent the don before and after incubation respectively bdon values were calculated on the basis of don reduction or bdon removal during incubation usually bdon analysis is affected by the amount of inoculum added khan et al 2009 high amounts of inoculum will increase errors due to endogenous decay while less inoculum will lead to underestimated bdon values in this study three initial 0 5 1 5 and 3 0 mg l mlss dilutions were prepared with ultrapure water since glycine gly was one of the simplest aa in the 20 free aas and it was a standard don compound therefore 200 ml of the standard gly solution was mixed with 2 ml of the prepared mlss in a 250 ml amber bottle to determine the optimum inoculum concentration 2 2 3 disinfection experiments phe trp tyr asn asp and his have been reported to form highly toxic n dbps chu et al 2010b 2012a shah and mitch 2012 therefore these 6 aas were chosen for dbp fp tests the batch experiment containing 7 groups phe trp tyr asn asp and his groups as well as the 6 aa mixture group was conducted in sealed 40 ml amber glass bottles under headspace free conditions in the dark at 25 0 5 c based on the methods developed in previous studies krasner et al 2007 chu et al 2013 the free chlorine condition was achieved by the addition of sufficient chlorine to break free any ammonia the disinfectant dosages for fp tests were calculated by equation 2 for free chlorine or equation 3 for the chloramines krasner et al 2007 the solutions were buffered at ph 7 with phosphate salts 0 2 m sodium monohydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 and 0 3 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 prior to dbp fp tests at the end of the predetermined reaction time dbps were immediately extracted by adding 2 ml methyl tert butyl ether to a 10 ml sample and then shaking the sample for 5 min using a multi tube vortex mixer dmt

specific detection details can be found in a previous study chu et al 2010b other detailed information about the analytical method used for dbps is available in the supplementary materials table s1 2 4 microbial diversity analysis 2 4 1 dna extraction and pcr amplification water samples were collected from the mixed aas group on day 0 immediately after inoculation 1 3 7 and 14 days after inoculation for the sequencing measurements the water samples were filtered through 0 2 μm filter membranes and the microorganisms in the solutions were retained on the membranes afterwards the microbial dna was extracted from the prepared membranes using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s protocols the final dna concentrations and purifications were determined using a nano drop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa and the dna quality was checked by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene were amplified with primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat using a thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa chu et al 2015 ou et al 2018 the details for the pcr amplification are available in the supplementary materials section s1 2 4 2 illumina miseq sequencing the purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired end sequenced 2 300 on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa according to the standard protocols by shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd china the sequencing data processing is as follows raw fastq files were demultiplexed quality filtered by trimmomatic and merged by flash with the following criteria i the reads were truncated at any site receiving an average quality score 20 over a 50 bp sliding window ii primers were exactly matched allowing 2 nucleotide mismatching and reads containing ambiguous bases were removed iii sequences whose overlap longer than 10 bp were merged according to the overlap sequence the operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with 97 similarity cut offs using uparse version7 1 http drive5 com uparse and the chimeric sequences were identified and removed using uchime the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analysed using the rdp classifier algorithm http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu123 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimisation of the inoculum concentration to determine the optimal inoculum concentration the biodegradable dissolved organic nitrogen bdon levels in glycine gly solutions with three inoculated sizes 0 5 1 5 and 3 mg l respectively were determined and are shown in fig s1 as depicted in fig s1 during the first 7 days bdon concentrations in all the samples increased with incubation time and then fewer changes were observed during the subsequent incubations in addition the bdon concentration in the sample with 0 5 mg l mlss was always lower than that in the samples with 1 5 and 3 mg l mlss no significant bdon differences were observed in the samples inoculated with 1 5 and 3 mg l mlss the inoculum size should be minimized to limit the release of soluble microbial products but too small of an inoculum size can lead to an underestimated bdon therefore based on the above results 1 5 mg l mlss was decided as the optimal inoculum concentration for further experiments 3 2 biodegradability of the 20 free aas fig 1 presents the biodegradability of the 20 aas by calculating the bdon proportion on different incubation days to the initial don concentration bdon doni simsek et al 2016 the closer to the centre of the circle the poorer the biodegradability of the present aa as shown in fig 1 the don in the 20 aas had different sensitivities to biodegradation for example 92 0 of gly 85 0 of asp and 81 0 of ala were mineralized into nh3 n while only 39 0 of met was mineralized into nh3 n after 14 days of incubation according to the biodegradation sensitivity the aas were divided into three categories 1 large biodegradation the red font in fig 1 gly arginine arg aspartic acid asp asparagine asn alanine ala and serine ser 2 moderate biodegradation the purple font in fig 1 tyrosine tyr phenylalanine phe glutamic acid glu glutamine gln threonine thr tryptophan trp histidine his isoleucine lle leucine leu proline pro and lysine lys 3 slight biodegradation the black font in fig 1 valine val cysteine cys and methionine met among the 20 aas gly was the most sensitive to biodegradation and this can be explained by the fact that gly is the simplest aa with a relatively smaller structure and the smallest side chain containing only one hydrogen conversely met has a longer structure with more side chains making it less amenable to biodegradation dias and alexander 1971 3 3 impact of biodegradation on thm formation chloroform cf was the most commonly detected c dbp in the water samples fig 2 a and fig 2b show the effects of microbial degradation of the selected precursors on cf formation potential fp during chlor am ination as illustrated in fig 2a tryptophan trp and tyrosine tyr the purple font in fig 2a had higher cf fps before inoculation with mlss and they were the main precursors of cf while the cf fps of tyr and trp decreased with time after inoculation during chlorination cf fp of tyr decreased by 31 2 38 7 51 2 and 56 2 within 1 3 7 and 14 days after inoculation fig 2a in addition a similar pattern was observed for trp where cf fp was reduced by 64 3 80 7 81 0 and 85 4 respectively within 1 3 7 and 14 days after inoculation during chlorination fig 2a during chloramination the cf fp from all the aa samples remarkably decreased fig 2b however no change in the cf fp with time was observed for the sterile reference groups fig 2c and d as mentioned in the literature hureiki et al 1994 activated aromatic structures are important cf precursors and trp and tyr belong to the aromatic aas explaining the high reaction activity observed with chlorine and chloramine during this study previous studies speculated that cf formation of tyr was related to the ring opening of chlorophenol intermediates during chlor am ination chu et al 2009 2012a another study discovered that some microorganisms were versatile aromatic degraders for phenolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatics such as indole qiao et al 2015 therefore the decrease of cf fp can be potentially explained by microbial degradation that reduces the aromatic structure and chlorophenol intermediates structure of tyr and trp moreover it was clearly observed that the cf fp for trp decreased more than tyr this may be caused by the difference between their chemical structures trp has a benzene aromatic hydrocarbon structure and an indole group heterocyclic aromatic while tyr has only a benzene aromatic hydrocarbon structure biodegradation destroyed the aromatic structure in trp more than in tyr resulting in a higher cf fp reduction rate in trp however cf fp from the mixed aas dramatically increased during chlorination after the 7 and 14 days of incubation moreover the cf fp did not decrease during chlorination of phe asn asp and his separately the increase of cf fp in mixed aas could be explained by that the biodegradation products of phe asn asp and his may form cf more favorably during chlor am ination 3 4 impact of biodegradation on han formation dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetonitrile tcan were the dominant han species detected in the drinking water samples this study mainly focused on the chlorinated and chloraminated dcan because the tcan concentrations in the aa samples were below the detection limit approx 0 1 μg l fig 3 a and fig 3b present the effect of microbial degradation on dcan fp during chlorination and chloramination of the selected aas for all the aas dcan fp decreased sharply with the incubation time during both chlorination and chloramination for example comparing the reference group without mlss the dcan fp from phe trp tyr asn asp his and the mixed aas during chlorination decreased by 76 6 96 8 89 5 93 8 99 9 74 6 and 99 5 after the 7 day incubations a similar pattern was observed for chloramination where the produced dcan from all the aas was below the detection limit after 3 day incubations while there was no dcan fp change observed with time for the group without mlss fig 3c and d additionally it was observed that dcan fp of all aas was 1 3 orders of magnitude higher during chlorination than chloramination this can be explained by the fact that chloramine is a weaker oxidant than chlorine in general microbial degradation resulted in the decrease of dcan fp notably the dcan fp decreased more in asp and asn groups than in the phe trp and his groups a previous study found that conventional treatment integrated with biologically activated carbon bac filtration dramatically reduced the dcan fp by around 80 compared with the conventional treatment chu et al 2012b another study indicated that micro ozone pre treatment combined with conventional treatment and bac resulted in around a 51 1 greater reduction of dcan fp compared to other treatments hu et al 2018 these results demonstrate that microbial action in bac might play an indispensable role in removing the dcan precursors as shown in fig 3a and b when mlss was introduced in the water samples there was a significant decrease in dcan fp after 3 days of incubation for all the aas during chlorination and chloramination there were no obvious changes in dcan fp during chlorination and chloramination for the period from day 7 to day 14 overall the dcan fp achieved a good reduction after the microbial degradation of the aa samples during chlor am ination generally there was a greater dcan fp decrease for the precursors with stronger biodegradability the decrease of don in aas was caused by microbial degradation fig s2 showed the relationship between don degradation rate and the decrease rate of dcan formation during chlorination in mixed aas it can be seen that the decrease rate of dcan formation was higher than the corresponding don degradation rate fig s2 inferring that the decrease of dcan formation was partly due to the ammonification of don in mixed aas and another potential reason might be that the biodegradation products of mixed aas was difficult to produce dcan moreover a linear relationship between don degradation rate and the decrease rate of dcan formation was observed in mixed aas indicating that with the don microbial degradation the chlorinated product dcan of aas would decrease accordingly 3 5 impact of biodegradation on ham formation the dichloroacetamide dcam and trichloroacetamide tcam formed during chlor am ination in aa groups with and without mlss incubation are shown in fig 4 dcam and tcam were detectable in all the aa samples in this study during chlorination and this is consistent with a previous study chu et al 2010b phe asn and asp the purple font in fig 4a were found to possess much higher dcam fp values than the other precursors during chlorination indicating that they were the main dcam precursors during chlorination dcam fp decreased continuously with mlss incubation time for phe asn and asp groups and the highest reduction rates were 78 7 74 6 and 46 7 respectively apparently asn and asp were susceptible to biodegradation and the degradation of asn and asp resulted in the decrease of dcam fp though phe was amenable to biodegradation it had an even higher reduction rate this might be caused not only by the degradation of phe but also the low reactivity of the phe degradation products with chlorine in addition it was clear that there were no changes in the reference group samples fig 4 c d g and h as shown in fig 4a and b dcam clearly decreased during the first day after mlss inoculation for all the aa groups during chlor am ination and dcam was below the detection limit after 3 days of incubation during chloramination this indicates that the biodegradation of aas reduced the production of dcam as for trp tyr and his the dcam fps were extremely low initially and slightly increased after inoculation this might be explained by the release of microbial metabolites and intracellular matter that increased the formation of dcam at present biological treatment processes e g biological activated carbon have been increasingly added to drinking water treatment plants the degradation efficiency of aas can be improved by strengthening the biological treatment capacity such as inoculating microorganisms which can degrade aas in biological treatment process then the microbial metabolites can be absorbed by activated carbon and removed with sand membrane filtration in drinking water treatment plants azami et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2013 therefore microbial metabolites and intracellular matter may not be considered as a serious issue fig 4e and f show that tcam fps from all the aas were greatly reduced with incubation time during chlor am ination indicating that phe trp tyr asn asp and his were biodegradable although the biodegradability among them was slightly different dcam and tcam fps decreased by 35 3 and 98 9 respectively for the mixed aa group during chlorination the greater decrease of hams in the mixed aas may be caused by the synergistic microbial degradation of mixed aas this implies that the microbial degradation of the mixed aas may eventually inhibit the production of dcam and tcam during subsequent chlorination and chloramination 3 6 the integrated toxic risks in order to further compare the integrated toxicity of the detected thms hans and hams formed in different groups with and without the pre treatment of microbial biodegradation this study calculated the toxicity of each dbp using the integrated toxicity analysis method as stated in previous studies yang et al 2014 chu et al 2016 the calculation formula is shown in equation 4 4 itrv x ctv x fp x itrvx integrated toxic risk value for x ctvx combined toxicity value m 1 of each detected x fpx formation potential nm of each x x cf dcan dcam tcam the combined toxicity values of each dbp are present in table s2 in detail and fig 5 shows the integrated toxicity of dbps formed in each aa group as shown in fig 5 the integrated toxicity risk values of dbps for all the selected samples after the 14 days of incubation were much lower than those without the incubation although the cf fps of phe asn asp his and mixed aas fig 2a and the dcam fps of trp tyr and his fig 4a increased this is mainly attributable to the great decrease of dcan fig 3a and dcan has higher combined toxicity plewa et al 2008 table s2 overall the pre treatment of microbial degradation evidently decreased the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from aas 3 7 microbial diversity and composition 3 7 1 microbial diversity and similarity the initial mlss the inoculum sample was labelled as d0 and the mixed aa inoculated with mlss for 1 3 7 and 14 days were labelled as d1 d3 d7 and d14 respectively the selected alpha diversity parameters chao index shannon index and coverage index are present in table 2 the coverage index values for all the 5 samples were over 0 99 and fig s3 shows that the five curves tended to be flat with the increase of sequence numbers indicating that the sequence numbers can represent almost all microbial community in each sample lemos et al 2011 the results of shannon and chao index indicated that the microbial community diversity decreased with the incubation time probably with the degradation of aas the dominant microbial communities changed the veen analyses fig 6 is used to compare the similarity and the difference of the bacterial communities among the 5 samples it depicts that 148 otus were shared by the 5 samples while 32 unique otus were contained in d0 only 1 in d1 none in d3 and d7 17 in d14 indicating that the bacterial communities in d1 d3 d7 and d14 samples were highly similar the unique otus numbers decreased with the incubation time implying the dominance of some species along with the incubation time 3 7 2 microbial structure and composition the assignment and relative abundance of the 16s rrna gene based microbial taxonomy for the microbial communities with incubation times is presented in fig 7 a at phylum level and in fig 7b at the genus level the bacterial community in the initial sample was the most diverse and several phyla including proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were dominant during the period from day 1 to day 14 after inoculation the microbial community became less diverse specifically proteobacteria became predominant at phylum level and the dominant genera became pseudomonas acinetobacter and comamonas within 14 days after inoculation the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 28 3 in d0 but it dramatically increased to 83 3 94 9 in d1 d14 this phenomenon proves the speculation of fig 6 it indicates that proteobacteria was dominant in degrading aas correspondingly the relative abundance of acinetobacter pseudomonas and comamonas increased from less than 1 to 26 5 49 1 23 1 24 1 and 12 4 respectively bacteroidetes as the second dominant phylum accounted for 2 3 3 5 4 5 and 12 6 on days 1 3 7 and 14 respectively the dominant bacteria detected in this study were in line with previous studies hu et al 2012 ma et al 2013 wang et al 2018 for example some researchers reported that either proteobacteria or bacteroidetes was the dominant phylum in the activated sludge samples collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants aeration tanks hu et al 2012 it is known that municipal wastewater usually contains high amounts of organic matter such as carbohydrates proteins aas fatty acids and esters importantly activated sludge systems can be used to remove dissolved and colloidal state biodegradable organic compounds and the reported dominant bacteria in activated sludge is proteobacteria and or bacteroidetes ma et al 2013 hu et al 2012 indicating proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the potential contributors for biodegradable organic compound degradation furthermore a recent survey indicated that proteobacteria was predominant during regrowth after water disinfection becerra castro et al 2016 as for the genus level previous studies showed that the acinetobacter species can degrade chlorophenols and cyprodinil kim and hao 1999 chen et al 2018 the aas contain the phenol and benzene ring in their chemical structures and this could explain the sharp increase in the acinetobacter relative abundance this indicates that acinetobacter may play an important role in decreasing dbps fps moreover pseudomonas has a strong ability to decompose protein like compounds it has been reported that pseudomonas is responsible for the removal of organic matter under aerobic conditions mujtaba et al 2017 pseudomonas is also able to degrade dioxin like and phenolic compounds hong et al 2000 kurzbaum et al 2017 therefore the proteobacteria species may play an extremely important role in degrading aas and reducing dbp fps based on the discussion above and the predominant bacteria observed in fig 5a it can be speculated that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes are the main contributors to aa degradation 4 conclusions according to the biodegradation sensitivity results gly arg asp asn ala and ser were susceptible to biodegradation tyr phe glu gln thr trp his lle leu pro and lys were amenable to biodegradation during chlor am ination the trp and tyr cf fps decreased by 85 4 and 56 2 after microbial degradation but did not decrease for phe asn asp and his dcan fps decreased sharply from all the selected aa samples during chlor am ination and the stronger biodegradability of dbps precursors the higher the dcan fp reduction the highest dcam fps reductions were 78 7 74 6 46 7 and 35 3 for phe asn asp and the mixed aas respectively the tcam fps of all the selected precursors were greatly reduced during both chlorination and chloramination moreover the pre treatment of microbial degradation eveidently decreased the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from aas therefore microbial degradation of aa has a great potential for controlling dbps fp additionally the most dominant phylum in the mixed aa sample was proteobacteria in which acinetobacter and pseudomonas were the predominant genus proteobacteria may play an extremely important role in degrading aas and reducing dbp fps in the future drinking water treatment plants can strengthen the biological treatment capacity by inoculating microorganisms that can degrade n dbp precursors in biological treatment process e g biological activated carbon filtration to improve the control efficiency of n dbps in don rich waters acknowledgements the authors
