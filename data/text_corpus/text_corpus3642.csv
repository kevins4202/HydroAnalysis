18210,remote sensing reflectance rrs values measured by satellite sensors involve large amounts of uncertainty leading to non negligible noise in remote chlorophyll a chl a concentration estimation this work distinguished between two main stages in the case of estimating distributions of chl a within the gulf of st lawrence canada at the model building stage the retrieval algorithm used both in situ chl a measurements and the corresponding moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis l2 level data estimated rrs at 412 443 469 488 531 547 555 645 667 678 nm at a 1 km spatial resolution during 2004 2013 through the training and validation of various models and rrs combinations of the considered eight techniques including support vector regression artificial neural networks gradient boosting machine random forests standard ci oc3m multiple linear regression generalized addictive regression principal component regression the support vector regression svr technique was shown to have the best performance in chl a concentration estimation using rrs at 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm the accuracy indicators for both the training 850 and the validation 213 datasets were found to be very good to excellent e g the r 2 value varied between 0 7058 and 0 9068 at the space time estimation stage this work took a step forward by using the bayesian maximum entropy bme theory to further process the svr estimated chl a concentrations by incorporating the inherent spatiotemporal dependency of physical chl a distribution a 56 improvement was achieved in the reduction of the mean uncertainty of the validation data decreased considerably from 1 2222 to 0 5322 mg m3 then this novel bme svr framework was employed to estimate the daily chl a concentrations in the gulf of st lawrence during jan 1 dec 31 of 2017 1 km spatial resolution the results showed that the daily mean chl a concentration varied from 1 6630 to 3 3431 mg m3 and that the daily mean chl a uncertainty reduction of the composite bme svr vs the svr estimation had a maximum reduction value of 1 0082 and an average reduction value of 0 6173 mg m3 the monthly spatial chl a distribution covariances showed that the highest chl a concentration variability occurred during november and that the spatiotemporal chl a concentration pattern changed a lot during the period august to november in conclusion the proposed bme svr was shown to be a promising remote chl a retrieval approach that exhibited a significant ability in reducing the non negligible uncertainty and improving the accuracy of remote sensing chl a concentration estimates keywords chlorophyll a modis machine learning uncertainty bayesian maximum entropy support vector regression 1 introduction chlorophyll a chl a serves as a bioindicator of phytoplankton biomass in aquatic environments kasprzak et al 2008 a certain amount of phytoplankton can generate oxygen into the aquatic environment and capture the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by a photosynthesis process simultaneously improving water quality and contributing to greenhouse gas reduction buchan et al 2014 durham et al 2015 however the phytoplankton on an aquatic environment surface will grow rapidly causing algal bloom in a short time period with increasing entrophication levels i e nitrogen or phosphorus concentration especially in the water bodies mainly influenced by anthropogenic activities e g estuaries lakes and reservoirs ma et al 2015 watson et al 2016 such algal blooms will cause serious aquatic environment problems and ecosystem damage such as dissolved oxygen level reduction and toxic metabolites accumulation further threatening human health paerl and otten 2013 watson et al 2016 jeppesen et al 2018 therefore gaining a better understanding of the chl a status in aquatic environments is of great concern to the public although in situ water samples have been collected to measure chl a concentration by buoys or cruises the sampling coverage is still limited as regards large spatial and temporal scales and most importantly both sampling and chemical analysis are costly and time consuming during the past several decades satellites have been proven to be a cost efficient tool for observing aquatic chl a concentrations at large spatial and temporal scales mainly due to their inherent optical characteristics babin et al 1996 in 1978 the coastal zone color scanner experiment czcs was the first instrument used to measure ocean color and it was followed by the sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs in 1997 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis in 2002 the medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris in 2002 the geostationary ocean color imager goci in 2011 and the visible and infrared imager radiometer suite viirs in 2012 bailey and werdell 2006 with these sensors various algorithms for retrieving chl a concentrations have been developed for example o reilly et al 1998 developed a series of band ratio algorithms called ocx algorithms and found that the oc4 algorithm showed a robust performance in retrieving the chl a concentration over a three orders of magnitude range hu et al 2012 proposed a color index algorithm to get the chl a concentration below 0 25 mg m3 i e the difference between green band reflectance and a reference linear combination of blue and red bands reflectance these two algorithms form the mainstream approach of chl a concentration retrieval used by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa however these algorithms cannot fit all water optical situations especially case 2 waters such as coastal water with the increasing impact of anthropogenic activities on coastal areas the coastal water components such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom suspended sediment ss phytoplankton and nutrition and their variations become increasingly complicated leading to a more optically complex coastal ecosystem because phytoplankton ss and cdom simultaneously dominate the optical properties of these waters morel and prieur 1977 dierssen 2010 hence local algorithms have been developed for various types of water bodies especially for optically complex waters gitelson et al 2007 van der woerd and pasterkamp 2008 gitelson et al 2011 le et al 2011 2013a despite the development of several chl a retrieval algorithms achieved worldwide there is still the important challenge of generating accurate chl a concentrations in coastal waters using remote sensing data hu et al 2012 the sensors equipped on satellite are used to measure the water spectral reflectance from space due to the long distance optical transmission from the sea surface to the satellite e g air molecule scattering and aerosol scattering will influence the light transmission the optical signal received by the sensors does not solely capture the in water spectral reflectance directly thus some meta processes such as radiometric calibration atmospheric correction etc are implemented to obtain the water spectral reflectance i e remote sensing reflectance rrs mélin et al 2016 qi et al 2017 more detailed information about the atmospheric correction can be found in the sub section 2 1 any error in these processes or parameters determination such as the above water downward irradiance and extra atmospheric solar irradiance etc will introduce uncertainty in the rrs and further retrieved chl a stamnes et al 2003 lee et al 2010 zibordi et al 2011 hu et al 2013 to mitigate or avoid the uncertainties generated by the atmospheric correction process most of the above local chl a concentration retrieval algorithms employed in situ spectral instruments to measure the water spectral reflectance rather than directly using rrs measured by satellite instruments although these algorithms provide sufficient theoretical explanation and evidence that the chl a concentrations are closely related to some reflectance values at specific bands according to the optical properties the large amount of uncertainty involved in rrs from the satellites were not fully taken into consideration especially when such algorithms were employed to massively retrieve chl a concentrations across large spatiotemporal scales moreover no algorithm can achieve totally accurate sea surface chl a estimation accordingly the chl a retrieval algorithm will also generate uncertainty in chl a concentration estimation machine learning ml techniques capable of self learning self adapting and self organizing have been shown to be powerful and efficient tools in the study of non linear and non gaussian systems in many scientific fields including environmental engineering chemical science epidemiology medical image analysis zoology biology and ecology cutler et al 2007 hong et al 2015 jordan and mitchell 2015 criminisi 2016 xiao et al 2017 butler et al 2018 he and christakos 2018 he et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 recently with the increasing popularity of ml techniques in earth sciences these techniques have proven their usefulness in the remote sensing field due to the complex relationship between remote sensing data and real world observations mountrakis et al 2011 belgiu and drăguţ 2016 lary et al 2016 for example keiner 1999 employed neural networks to estimate oceanic chlorophyll concentration by using the five visible wavebands 412 443 490 510 and 555 nm of seawifs data and it was found that it performed better than the oc2 algorithm the same seawifs data were used by camps valls et al 2006 to explore the performance of the relevance vector machine rvm technique and it was found that the rvm outperformed certain empirical algorithms including morel 1 morel 3 calcofi 2 band cubic calcofi 2 band linear oc2 oc4 and back propagation neural network for the coastal waters vilas et al 2011 employed neural network to estimate the chl a concentration in the coastal waters of galician rias using 150 matched in situ chl a and meris remote sensing data additionally kim et al 2014 have tested the random forest support vector machine and cubist techniques for estimating chl a concentrations on the west coast of south korean using goci remote sensing data and found that the support vector machine technique performed best whereas the number of in situ measurements used in modeling was only 63 both of them used rather small sets for training and validating the proposed chl a retrieval algorithms i e machine learning techniques therefore it is valuable to test the application of ml technique with large number of data samples for coastal chl a concentration retrieval using modis data despite their usefulness in observing natural attributes occurring on the earth s surface remote sensing techniques still have certain shortcomings one shortcoming is the issue of missing data due to swath width sun glint and the presence of clouds maritorena et al 2010 shi et al 2015a to resolve this issue the bayesian maximum entropy approach bme christakos 2000 has been successfully employed in a multi satellite data fusion context thus allowing a much better coverage of remote sensing data shi et al 2015a e g used bme to fuse the ocean color data from seawifs meris and modis in which case data coverage improved from below 20 for a single sensor to approximately 97 i e an almost five fold improvement in coverage moreover various spatial resolutions of remote sea surface temperature from modis and amsr e were merged to get a complete spatial coverage of sea surface temperature by the bme approach li et al 2013 the second shortcoming is that although remote sensing products are always characterized by in situ uncertainty most studies attempt to quantify uncertainty by comparing the remote sensing products with the in situ observations mélin et al 2007 antoine et al 2008 cui et al 2014 moore et al 2015 but very few published studies have discussed ways to handle or reduce this uncertainty especially in optically complex waters foody and atkinson 2003 given that bme has already shown a remarkable ability to solve the first shortcoming and it has been also shown to reduce space time estimation uncertainty he and christakos 2018 it is worth exploring its ability to solve the second shortcoming of remote sensing above by employing the probability theory to quantify and handle the uncertainty and assimilating the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the chl a i e the spatiotemporal dependency of chl a for further reducing the uncertainty of chl a estimates in view of the above considerations the main objectives of the present work are twofold to account for chl a data uncertainty and to improve the space time chl a estimation accuracy in the coastal and optically complex waters of the study region gulf of st lawrence gsl in eastern canada to achieve these objectives the developments introduced in this work are as follows a a local ml model that establishes a relationship between large datasets of sea surface chl a concentrations and the matching modis remote sensing observations in the study region during the period 2004 2013 while accounting for relevant dataset and algorithm uncertainties b a geostatistics technique to update the ml chl a concentration estimates to significantly improve chl a concentration retrieval accuracy c an adequate quantitative characterization of the chl a distribution in the study region during a later year 2017 by using the developed ml model to retrieve the chl a concentrations based on modis remote sensing data during the same year d covariance models to represent space time dependency characterization of the chl a distribution during 2017 in our methodological framework the purpose of the analysis for the gsl region during 2004 2013 is to develop an algorithm of sea surface chl a concentration retrieval that can be used to retrieve chl a concentrations at gsl whereas the purpose of the analysis for the gsl region during 2017 will be to gain the knowledge of chl a concentration levels and the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a at gsl during the more recent year 2017 to provide scientific support for ocean management purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study domain and data collection the gulf of st lawrence gsl is a large coastal ecosystem that covers approximately 291 thousands km 2 and is located in eastern canada fig 1 gsl connects canada and north atlantic and provides a large amount of commercial fish catch to canada the space time domain defined by the gsl region during the period 2004 2013 is denoted as g s l 04 13 while the space time domain at the same region during 2017 is denoted as g s l 17 herein for modeling and space time estimation purposes in situ chl a data should be distinguished from modis data it should be also noticed that no in situ chl a data are available after 2013 accordingly in the following data in the g s l 04 13 domain will be used for chl a model building purposes whereas data in the g s l 17 domain will be used for space time chl a concentration estimation purposes there are two key features of the g s l 04 13 domain that make chl a retrieval a difficult matter i the gsl region receives freshwater runoff with large amounts of colored dissolved organic matter cdom from the great lakes and several surrounding rivers koutitonsky 1991 and the cdom can influence light absorption in blue bands larouche and boyer villemaire 2010 ii strong seasonal variability of the physical system has been observed in the gsl region e g ice covers the region during winter and then the ice melts during spring mei et al 2010 to obtain a relative comprehensive dataset under various oceanographic conditions surface chl a concentration data 4346 data in total were collected from the high resolution conductivity temperature depth data ctd of the world ocean database during the period 2004 2013 boyer et al 2013 the surface chl a concentration data from ctd after 2013 was not available to the authors during the current study the modis satellite data used in this study were downloaded from nasa s ocean color web https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov the total reflectance ℜ t measured by modis can be decomposed into several parts as eq 1 shows 1 ℜ t ℜ r ℜ a t ℜ f t ℜ g t ℜ w where ℜ r is the reflectance due to air molecule rayleigh scattering ℜ a is the reflectance due to aerosol scatting and the interaction effects between air molecule and aerosol ℜ f is the reflectance due to whitecaps and foam just above the sea surface ℜ g is the reflectance due to sun glint ℜ w is the water leaving reflectance which includes the bio optical properties information of the water t and t are diffuse transmittance in the viewing direction and direct transmittance between water and sensor respectively it should be noticed that more than 90 ℜ t comes from atmosphere i e the ℜ w accounts for less than 10 ℜ t stamnes et al 2003 atmospheric correction processing is implemented to retrieve ℜ w from ℜ t and it generates level 2 ocean color images from level 1b images mobley et al 2016 the main steps for atmospheric correction include a correcting the gas absorption such as ozone no2 b correcting polarization c quantifying and removing the ℜ f d quantifying and removing the ℜ r e quantifying and removing the ℜ g f quantifying and removing the ℜ a g normalizing the ℜ w h estimating the reflectance within the near infrared band and test its change if the change is large repeat the steps e h otherwise continue to the step i bandpass correction spectral out of band correction j bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf correction and finally obtaining the remote sensing reflectance values rrs at various spectral bands which will be used to retrieve chl a in the current study more detailed information can be found in mobley et al 2016 daily level 2 ocean color images with approximately 1 km spatial resolution were obtained from modis on the aqua satellite during both 2004 2013 and 2017 the images were atmospherically corrected by nasa using the near infrared approach with updated aerosol models gordon and wang 1994 ahmad et al 2010 the rrs of all spectral bands including 412 443 469 488 531 547 555 645 667 678 nm with spatial coordinates were extracted from the modis data in some of the literature such as cannizzaro and carder 2006 le et al 2013a in situ surface reflectance measurements were taken for verifying the rrs from satellite or algorithm development however no in situ reflectance spectra were included in the current study because they are not available to the authors based on these datasets an outline of the overall methodological framework proposed in this work can be found in fig s1 note that the analysis in the left column refers to the period 2004 2013 g s l 04 13 and the analysis in the right column to the year 2017 g s l 17 firstly the chl a retrieval algorithm ml model was developed and validated by using in situ surface chl a and modis data collected in g s l 04 13 domain i e left column of fig s1 then the developed chl a retrieval algorithm was applied to retrieve the chl a concentrations during 2017 by using the modis data collected in the g s l 17 domain i e right column of fig s1 2 2 data pre processing two conditions were considered when matching in situ chl a observations of the g s l 04 13 study domain with modis data a the nearest searching method was used to find the modis data that are closest to each of the in situ observations more specifically the spatial and temporal distances were calculated between each of the in situ chl a observations and the modis data then the nearest searching method determined the modis data space time closest to the in situ chl a observations with some restrictions i e spatial distance less than 0 0105 approximately the spatial resolution of modis data 1 km in the study area and temporal distance equals to 0 b to reduce the potential errors due to the atmospheric correlation algorithm noise and the satellite sensor uncertainty a searching radius of 0 017 i e approximately a 3 3 pixel window centered at the location of each modis datum obtained by condition a above was used to search for neighbor modis data then the set of the average reflectance values of the neighbor modis data was regarded as the final modis dataset matched to the corresponding in situ observations if the number of neighbor data was greater than 4 i e at least half of the 3 3 pixel window contains valid modis data harding et al 2005 le et al 2013a following this process 1063 matched pairs were finally obtained for developing the chl a concentration retrieval algorithm in the g s l 17 study domain 289245 grids spatial locations with 1 km 1 km resolution were generated for estimating the distribution of chl a concentrations during various time instants of the g s l 17 domain the above process was also implemented for matching the spatial locations of these grids and the modis data during various time instants fig s1 following the matching process all grids were projected from the wgs 1984 coordinate system with the coordinates unit degree to the albers coordinate system with the coordinates unit meter because i the unit of the coordinates in wgs 1984 cannot precisely represent the euclidean distance between two locations in the real world and ii the euclidean distance based geostatistical technique will be further used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of the chl a concentration 2 3 support vector regression support vector regression svr is a supervised ml technique that makes no assumptions regarding the data distribution mountrakis et al 2011 by employing a kernel function e g radial basis function sigmoid or polynomial the svr maps the original dataset x i y i i 1 2 n x i and y i denote respectively the reflectance values at selected spectral bands from modis data and the ground measurements of chl a concentration to a higher dimensionality domain via 2 x i φ x i where φ is a mapping operator then the linear regression model 3 y i f x i θ t φ x i θ 0 is considered in the higher dimensionality domain to minimize the empirical loss function 4 min 1 2 θ 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i θ t φ x i θ 0 ε ξ i θ t φ x i θ 0 y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where θ is the weights vector ξ i and ξ i are positive slack variables associated with a permitted prediction error ε ε 0 is a constant c is the penalization parameter applied to the committed errors that can balance the minimization of errors and the regularization term camps valls et al 2006 one way to solve this minimization problem is to introduce lagrange multipliers that account for the differentials of the loss function then the simple form 5 θ ˆ i 1 n α i α i φ x i can be used to estimate θ by employing the karush kuhn tucker conditions and quadratic programming procedures fletchere 1987 then the svr form can be written as 6 y ˆ x i 1 n s α i α i κ x i x θ ˆ 0 where α i and α i are lagrange multiplies corresponding to the two constraints with ξ i and ξ i in eq 4 κ is the kernel function with κ x i x φ x i t φ x x i is the data used to build the svr model and x is the new vector data used in estimation and n s denoting the number of non zero lagrange multipliers with n s n the lagrange multipliers are non zero only for those x i y i data with prediction errors ε and these data are called support vectors on the other hand data with prediction errors ε have zero lagrange multipliers and would not be used in the minimization process approximately 80 of the matched data 850 data in total were used to train the svr model and the remaining data 213 data were used to validate and test the performance of the model the mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 of a simple linear regression model combining the chl a concentration observations and model estimates were employed to assess the svr prediction accuracy to develop an optimal model based on the available data and take full advantage of the svr technique a traversal method was employed to try all combinations of two three four five and six bands selected from the ten bands of the modis spectral reflectance values mentioned earlier in sub section 2 1 at the training stage the radial basis function served as the kernel function κ x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 searching the local optimal model in each combination of bands the value of parameter c in eq 4 was set to vary from 1 to 20 whereas another parameter γ of the kernel function was set to vary from 1 to 500 for comparison purposes four traditional statistical methods standard ci oc3m method multiple linear regression mlr generalized addictive regression gar principle component regression pcr and four machine learning methods artificial neural networks ann gradient boosting machine gbm and random forests rf were also tested detailed information about these methods can be found in supporting information text s1 sensitivity analysis was implemented to explore the influence of each of the selected bands to optimal svr text s2 2 4 quantifying the uncertainty of svr estimates in practice the in situ spectral observations are usually employed to assess the uncertainty of the rrs maritorena and siegel 2005 antoine et al 2008 which are mainly generated from the atmospheric correction process hu et al 2013 the uncertainty generated by the chl a retrieval algorithm would be always quantified through comparing the in situ chl a observations and chl a estimations hu et al 2012 le et al 2013b although other sources of uncertainty exist in the remote sensing observations zhu et al 2013 we quantified the uncertainty from two main sources i e the rrs from atmospheric correlation and chl a retrieval algorithm using the optimal svr model and the modis data the chl a concentrations were estimated in the g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 domains for validation and estimation purposes respectively similarly according to the relationship between the svr based chl a estimates and the observations in the validation stage sub section 2 3 a simple linear regression model the observation value and svr estimates were respectively regarded as independent and dependent variables was employed to calibrate the svr based chl a values to account for both the uncertainty of the modis data and the uncertainty generated by svr modeling in terms of this linear regression model a more realistic form of the calibrated svr based chl a values can be expressed in terms of a gaussian distribution with mean value and variance calculated from respectively the svr estimates and the nearest eight scatter points of the corresponding observations this calibrated chl a data with uncertainty expressed by its variance can be regarded as soft chl a data for further analysis technical details concerning soft chl a data generation is found in the supporting information text s3 in order to validate the ability of the soft chl a data above to account for uncertainty in the following sub section 2 5 a geostatistical technique will be used to estimate the chl a concentrations at points with known observed values by using the soft chl a data above the technique s performance will be assessed by its mae rmse and r 2 accuracy indicators 2 5 bme theory and spatiotemporal mapping of chl a in order to properly handle the soft chl a data generated in sub section 2 4 and present the spatial chl a distributions at various time instants the bme theory of geostatistics was employed to analyze the composite space time variation of chl a concentrations methodologically at each point p s t of the space time study domains g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 where s is the spatial vector location and t is the time instant the bme theory jointly represents the lawful space time chl a variation physically expressed by the chl a law of change and the in situ uncertainty of chl a concentrations in terms of the spatiotemporal random field model s trf christakos 1992 2017 x p f x p χ where x p denotes the space time chl a distribution the means that x p is completely characterized by its probability density function pdf f x p χ with χ denoting a chl a realization at any space time point p

outline of the bme method whereas all technical details can be found in the relevant literature e g christakos 2000 i the initial prior pdf f g obtained on the basis of the core or general g kb i e

processing the available site specific s kb which includes all soft chl a data with a gaussian distribution form sub section 2 4 we notice that the number of hard data ground chl a observations collected in the g s l 04 13 domain was rather small compared to the number of soft data generated from remote sensing whereas no hard data was collected in the g s l 17 domain therefore in the present work only soft chl a data with a gaussian distribution form f s were considered as the s kb in the g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 domains by integrating f g and f s the bme method provides the posterior i e updated pdf of the x p concentrations as 9 f x p s χ s a 1 f g p s χ s f s p s χ s d χ s where a is a normalization parameter it should be noticed that bme was only employed here to update the prior pdf i e the soft data points were regarded as unsampled points at which the posterior pdf was derived by bme many software libraries have been developed on the basis of bme theory including the bme library bmelib the spatiotemporal epistemic knowledge synthesis graphical user interface seks gui the bme graphical user interface bmegui and the space time analysis rendering with bme star bme e g christakos et al 2002 yu et al 2007 jat et al 2018 he and kolovos 2018 all of these software libraries can be used to implement the bme method in this work the bmelib functions based on the matlab platform were used to validate the performance of both i the bme svr approach by comparing its outcomes with the ground chl a concentrations collected in the g s l 04 13 space time domain and ii the bme svr mapping of the spatiotemporal chl a distribution in the g s l 17 space time domain the expected value of the posterior f x of eq 9 at each soft chl a data point p s was considered as the chl a estimate for final mapping purposes and the f x standard deviation was regarded as the associated mapping uncertainty at p s 2 6 spatiotemporal chl a characteristics in gsl to assess the spatiotemporal chl a characteristics in the domain g s l 17 the empirical covariances of the spatial distributions of the monthly averaged chl a concentrations were calculated then a set of basic covariance models including the gaussian exponential and spherical models and their linear combinations were fitted to the empirical covariance values by using the particle swarm optimization pso technique eberhart and kennedy 1995 shi and eberhart 1999 poli et al 2007 pso simulates the social activities of a group of birds searching for food briefly a number of particles are set in the search space of the covariance function and each particle will give a goodness of fit at its own current location randomly introducing velocity to each particle and the particles will move to new locations by combining their own history locations and the best location with the best goodness of fit among all particles through a number of interactions the best location i e the final fitted values of the parameters in the covariance models is obtained among the considered covariance models the fitted model with the smallest residual was chosen as the theoretical covariance model of the corresponding monthly mean chl a concentrations further the corresponding covariance parameters correlation ranges and sills were compared sill is an indicator of the spatial chl a variability whereas the correlation range is a measure of the maximum chl a correlation distance separating two locations i e beyond this distance the chl a concentrations are uncorrelated more detailed information about the covariance function can be found in the supporting information text s4 concluding the methodological part of this work in table 1 we present a summary of the separate analysis stages in the g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 domains the g s l 04 13 analysis both in situ chl a data and modis data were available is concerned with the development of the bme svr model for retrieving chl a concentrations at gsl whereas the g s l 17 analysis only modis data were available focuses on the application of the built bme svr model to retrieve chl a concentrations 3 results the numerical results of the various implementation stages of the chl a retrieval approach described above are discussed next 3 1 description of in situ chl a concentrations and the reflectance spectra fig s6 shows that low in situ chl a observation values and high chl a values are clustered at adjacent time instance across the entire period from 2004 to 2013 totally 1063 modis ctd paired data were matched for developing the chl a retrieval algorithm in the g s l 04 13 domain in which 850 and 213 data were randomly chosen as training and validation data sets respectively the minimum maximum and mean in situ chl a observation values of training vs validation data sets are 0 vs 0 0110 mg m3 34 6890 vs 36 5580 mg m3 and 2 3697 vs 2 1525 mg m3 respectively the remote sensing reflectance values of these training and validation data sets are shown in fig s7 generally most of the reflectance spectra including both training and validation data sets show an increasing decreasing stable trend with increasing wavelength but the peaks of the reflectance values may occur at various wavelengths e g 448 531 547 or 555 nm poor linear relationships between reflectance values at different single band or basic band ratio and in situ chl a were found with the entire data set including both training and validation data sets please see table s1 3 2 chl a retrieval algorithm eight methods were tested by considering various spectral band combinations of modis and the corresponding in situ chl a data table 2 shows the optimal results of each method among which the svr with 5 selected modis bands were 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm clearly exhibited the best performance for chl a concentration estimation purposes the parameters c and γ of the optimal svr were found to be 8 4 and 22 86 respectively most reflectance spectra of the five selected bands show an increasing decreasing trend with the largest reflectance value at 531 nm among the five bands 412 nm band and 443 nm band exhibit the greatest amount of cdom and chl a absorption respectively moreover the chl a absorption at 678 nm is also very strong more detailed discussion can be found in the discussion section the results of the accuracy analysis can be summarized as follows between the in situ observations and estimated chl a concentrations obtained by the svr technique the training and validation r 2 values were equal to 0 9068 and 0 7058 respectively the training and validation mae values were equal to 0 4434 and 1 5841 mg m3 respectively and the training and validation rmse values were equal to 1 2188 and 2 2499 respectively noticeably the ml techniques ann gbm rf svr showed better performance than the traditional methods ci oc3m mlr gar pcr in terms of the training mae rmse and r 2 values specifically the accuracy of the svr technique using the training dataset was approximately 6 times larger than the general chl a retrieval algorithm ci oc3m in terms of the mae values 0 4434 vs 2 5265 mg m3 the validation plots observed vs estimated chl a values of figs 2 a and 2b shows the svr performance using training and validation datasets in which the red line and green line represent respectively the 1 1 line and the linear regression fit of the scatter points we observe that the developed svr technique may over estimate chl a at low concentration levels whereas it may under estimate chl a at high concentration levels 3 3 reduction of chl a estimation uncertainty by means of bme after converting all svr based chl a concentration estimates in the space time domain g s l 04 13 into soft chl a data the bme method was employed to update these soft chl a data in the validation dataset comparing the performance of the svr technique vs the combined bme svr technique we found that the latter to yield higher chl a estimation accuracy than the former see validation plots in fig 2b and c in particular the mean mae value decreased from 1 5841 svr to 1 5698 mg m3 bme svr the rmse value decreased from 2 2499 to 2 2213 mg m3 and the r 2 value increased from 0 7058 to 0 7130 fig 2b vs 2c also the mean uncertainty decreased from 1 2222 to 0 5322 mg m3 i e a 56 improvement given that the ranges of chl a concentrations can vary considerably among different water types e g in a water type the chl a concentrations range from 0 to 2 5 mg m3 whereas in another the chl a concentrations range from 0 to 5 mg m3 the relative performance of the svr vs the bme svr techniques for these different ranges should be displayed accordingly considering various thresholds can provide more detailed information about this relative performance under various conditions furthermore the mean mae value and uncertainty of the svr based and the bme svr based chl a estimates were calculated and compared for various thresholds so fig 2d shows that the mean mae value reduction between svr based vs bme svr based chl a estimation displays an increasing then decreasing then stable trend as a function of the threshold whereas the uncertainty reduction displays a decreasing then stable then increasing trend given the series of thresholds considered ranging from 0 021 to 36 551 mg m3 the mean mae reduction for all considered data originated from the validation dataset is 0 0143 mg m3 ranging from 0 0047 to 0 0174 mg m3 and the mean uncertainty reduction is 0 6900 mg m3 ranging from 0 3788 to 0 6933 mg m3 specifically when the threshold is below 0 731 mg m3 the mean mae value reduction fluctuated around 0 moreover the mean mae value reduction reaches its peak at thresholds between 2 841 and 2 931 mg m3 on the other hand the mean uncertainty reduction reaches the first peak at the threshold 0 211 mg m3 and the second peak at thresholds larger than 28 931 mg m3 sensitivity analysis text s2 showed that the optimal svr model was most sensitive to the rrs at 678 nm and the following 531 488 443 412 nm fig s2 3 4 spatiotemporal mapping of chl a in 2017 after matching the remote sensing data at the 289245 grids generated for mapping purposes the temporal coverage of remote sensing data ranges from 0 to 97 days during the entire 365 days of the g s l 17 domain fig 3 the spatial coverage ranges from 0 to 166026 grid nodes covering 57 40 of the entire gsl study area and the monthly mean coverage exhibited an increasing then decreasing trend from january to december of 2017 fig 4 the minimum and maximum average coverage rate occurred during december 5 54 and july 22 50 of 2017 respectively fig 4 then the combined bme svr technique fig s1 right column was employed to retrieve chl a concentrations fig s9 shows that the daily mean chl a concentration varies from 1 6630 to 3 3431 mg m3 and it exhibits less variability during winter december january and february than during other months using both fourier and wavelet techniques bloomfield 2004 cazelles et al 2008 zhang and moore 2011 xiao et al 2019 a 50 days period of the daily mean chl a was detected for 2017 i e a seasonal variation detailed in formation can be found in text s5 the monthly mean chl a concentrations in the g s l 17 domain are plotted in fig 5 generally the chl a concentrations at the west part of the study area are greater than at the east part and there exists a large area of high chl a concentration during july october and november it is noteworthy that by introducing bme to svr based chl a retrieval the uncertainty of remote chl a estimation reduces significantly fig 6 the daily mean uncertainty reduction between bme svr based chl a estimation vs svr based chl a estimation had a maximum value of 1 0082 mg m3 and an average value of 0 6173 mg m3 the monthly mean uncertainty of chl a estimation in the gsl region can be found in fig s10 3 5 characterization of the chl a distribution in 2017 using the monthly mean chl a concentrations fig 5 the monthly empirical covariance values were calculated and fitted the shapes of the fitted covariances are described by the analytical forms of the theoretical models of table 3 we observed that the covariance value of each of the 12 months decreased with increasing spatial distance and finally approached practically zero values after the specified spatial ranges fig 7 this implies that the chl a distribution is spatially homogeneous however the origins and shapes of the covariances vary during different months during all months the slopes of the theoretical covariances are non zero see linear covariance shapes at origin confirming the spatially irregular physical variation of the chl a concentrations table 3 specifically the covariance values at the spatial origin s 0 define the covariance sills with values ranging between 0 4734 and 1 0728 mg m3 2 it was found that the optimal fitted theoretical covariance models of chl a concentrations i during january february and september involved a linear combination of the exponential and spherical components ii during march april may november and december involved a linear combination of exponential components iii during june july and august involved a linear combination of gaussian and spherical models and iv during october involved a linear combination of spherical models to a certain extent the spatiotemporal chl a distribution patterns are consistent during the same season in terms of the analytical forms of the fitted theoretical covariance models in table 3 noteworthy the theoretical models are different from each other during the months of august november indicating that the chl a pattern changes a lot during this period regarding the sill of these fitted theoretical covariances their values increase rapidly from august to november and reaches its peak 1 0728 mg m3 2 during november but the values of sill fluctuate from december to august the maximum spatial correlation range of the chl a concentration varies between 170 and 403 9 km the physical interpretation of the covariance shapes and numerical parameters above will be explored in the discussion section below 4 discussion 4 1 determination of optically complex water some of the research literatures report that the reflectance or absorption values for specific spectral bands increase with increasing chl a concentration leading to a potential way for detecting algal blooms ahn et al 2006 vazyulya et al 2014 in addition the ratio of the reflectance values at 443 nm and 547 nm was found to be correlated with chl a concentrations gitelson et al 2007 ha et al 2014 however the reflectance values in the current study are not in line with the findings described above table s1 and the multiple linear regression results shown in table 2 i e a non linear system exists between the optical characteristics reflectance spectra and chl a concentration in gsl region with regard to the reflectance spectra used in the current study complex water conditions were included in the current study i e 1 oligotrophic waters with highest reflectance values in blue bands mesotrphic and eutrophic waters with the peak of reflectance spectra moving from blue band to green band carder et al 2005 cannizzaro and carder 2006 2 high bottom albedo may result in high reflectance values especially in shallow regions in terms of the literature carder et al 2005 3 cdom and suspended sediment exhibit exponentially decreasing absorption with increasing wavelength and can affect the blue band greater than longer wavelength bands darecki and stramski 2004 cannizzaro and carder 2006 vazyulya et al 2014 sá et al 2015 leading to no obvious absorption signal of chl a at its maximum absorption band 440 nm where strong cdom and suspended sediment absorption occurs 4 compared to the four kinds of water types detected in ahn et al 2006 the gsl water also has similar kinds of water i e algal bloom mixed type algal bloom and suspended sediments turbid water and clear water with the 10 years of spectra and corresponding in situ chl a dataset the coastal water variability of gsl can be fully accounted for besides the satellite based optical reflectance values modis with non negligible uncertainty were collected for developing a chl a retrieval algorithm given the above discussions the gsl water system seems to be complex and non linear 4 2 development of support vector regression on chl a retrieval a main outcome of the present study is the successful development of an ml technique support vector regression svr for estimation of chl a distributions the poor performance results r 2 0 1 table 2 of the non ml techniques indicate that the particular coastal water system is too complicated to be characterized by the traditional methods and the global ocean algorithm ci oc3m which proven not to be suitable for chl a retrieval in coastal water darecki and stramski 2004 le et al 2011 novoa et al 2011 on the other hand the ml techniques ann gbm rf svr performed better than the traditional techniques in terms of r 2 values 0 1 table 2 because these ml techniques have been generally proven to successfully handle non linear systems like the water system discussed in sub section 4 1 zhong et al 2018 pointed out that the ml techniques computational intelligence are effective tools that can handle complexities and uncertain systems in the field of remote sensing among the ml techniques used in the present study the svr technique exhibited the best performance the r 2 values for training and validation were 0 9068 and 0 7058 respectively unlike the pcr technique that uses dimensionality reduction to obtain effective information text s1 the svr technique maps the original data onto a higher dimensionality domain which can be regarded as a magnifying glass to explore micro evidence for making full use of the available information noble 2006 svr can achieve a unique and optimal solution due to the minimizing loss function process eq 4 displaying superior ability than the local minima error algorithm in ann chevalier et al 2011 these are why in the present study the svr technique can outperform the other techniques in chl a concentration retrieval moreover if in situ optical spectral information becomes available e g reflectance values with less uncertainty compared to satellite remote sensing data the svr technique can perform even better than it did in the present study an svr algorithm with five spectral band input including the bands at the wavelength 412 443 488 531 678 nm was developed for chl a estimation purposes among the five spectral bands 412 and 443 nm are the blue spectral bands 488 and 531 nm are the green bands whereas 678 nm is the red band i e the blue green and red bands were all taken into consideration it has been reported that the reflectance values at red and near infrared nir spectral regions are less affected by the presence of suspended particles and cdom than the other bands and that the chl a exhibits maximum local optical absorption around 675 nm gurlin et al 2011 blondeau patissier et al 2014 in other words the reflectance values at these spectral regions can provide less influenced optical information about chl a concentrations in waters than the reflectance values at the other spectral regions and the red or nir based algorithm shows good performance in the remote estimation of chl a concentrations gons et al 2000 moses et al 2009 2013 2019 lunetta et al 2009 bagheri et al 2012 le et al 2013a xie et al 2015 regarding the uncertainty term the rrs values from red band have the smallest uncertainty compared to the rrs values from blue and green band hu et al 2013 cui et al 2014 moore et al 2015 mélin et al 2016 that may be the reasons why the rrs at 678 nm showed the most powerful ability to influence the optimal svr model in the current study fig s2 carder et al 2005 found that the algorithm accuracy can improve two fold in chl retrieval when red band reflectance was employed and the rrs values at 678 nm from red spectral bands have been previously considered in many chl a retrieval studies tzortziou et al 2007 le et al 2013b as the other four bands selected in this work it has been reported in the literature morel and gentili 2009 that the 412 and 443 nm bands are sensitive to cdom and influenced by chlorophyll concentration whereas the blue green 490 and 555 nm bands which are close to the 488 and 531 nm bands considered in the present study were dominated by chlorophyll concentration and influenced by cdom moreover the 412 443 and 531 nm bands were reported to be useful in distinguishing various water types shanmugam 2011 and they may show powerful ability for retrieve chl a in the optically complex water considering the various impact factors on these bands the optimal svr model built in the current study shows less sensitivity to these bands than the red band fig s2 the mainstream retrieval techniques such as the ocx algorithms also take into consideration the blue bands that range from 443 to 516 nm phytoplankton absorption has been found to be an important factor influencing reflectance at 443 nm shanmugam 2011 4 3 incorporating with bme for reducing uncertainty of chl a estimates other outcomes of the present study are the quantification of the uncertainty of remote chl a estimation obtained by the svr algorithm and the uncertainty reduction using the bme technique despite the fact that satellite remote sensing reflectance values have considerable uncertainty as is stated in foody and atkinson 2003 the matter has received only limited attention moreover data uncertainty will propagate from the input of the chl a retrieval model to the output leading to uncertain chl a concentration estimates zhao and kockelman 2002 as described in sub section 2 4 the uncertainty of rrs majorly stems from the atmospheric correction process hu et al 2013 the modis data used in the current study were atmospherically corrected using the nir approach it assumes that zero water leaving reflectance occurs at the nir and the aerosol reflectance at the other bands i e red green and blue bands can be estimated by the spectral extrapolation from the nir gordon and wang 1994 it was found that the shorter the wavelength is e g blue band the greater bias results from atmospheric correction leading to very low rrs values at blue band wang et al 2009 actually negative rrs values for the blue band were found in some modis images used in the current study and they were excluded this indicates that the nir atmospheric correction approach may give imprecise rrs values for the blue band with large amount of uncertainty because high chl and suspended sediments have high reflectance values at nir leading to the failure of the zero water leaving reflectance at nir band wang et al 2007 chen et al 2013 goyens et al 2013 hammond et al 2017 and wanders et al 2012 respectively pointed out that the chl a concentrations and the satellite uncertainty are spatially correlated therefore geostatistical technique like bme may be suitable for accounting for the spatiotemporal variability of both chl a and the corresponding satellite uncertainty because the tobler s first law of geostatitics expresses that everything is correlated with everything else and the near things are more correlated than the farther ones tobler 1970 the core function of geostatistical technique is the covariance function or semivariogram function it has also been applied in chl estimations using gaussian process regression blix et al 2017 mapping the uncertainty of modis chl products moore et al 2009 merging chl products from various sensor shi et al 2015a detecting mesoscale variability doney et al 2003 detecting the spatial pattern of intra seasonal variability of chl legaard and thomas 2007 and so on using the method described in sub section 2 4 the mean uncertainty of the chl a concentration estimate in the validation dataset was found to be equal to 1 2222 mg m3 which is rather high compared to the mean chl a concentration estimate of 2 4225 mg m3 fortunately the bme method can effectively handle this issue although bme has been applied in the fusion of remote sensing products from various satellites li et al 2013 shi et al 2015a tang et al 2015 the present work is the first time that bme has been applied in the case of the original remote sensing estimation in conditions of uncertainty it is noteworthy that with the help of bme the mean uncertainty was reduced to 0 5322 mg m3 from 1 2222 mg m3 while the accuracy increased in terms of the mae rmse and r 2 values the mae value and the rmse decreased respectively from 1 5841 to 1 5698 mg m3 and from 2 2499 to 2 2213 mg m3 whereas the r 2 value increased from 0 7058 to 0 7130 in this case bme exhibits several powerful features that have been highlighted in he and kolovos 2018 a bme can fully handle uncertain chl a data without any restrictive prior assumption as well as non linear complex coastal ecosystems e g the svr based chl a estimates with uncertainty b bme can update the prior svr based chl a concentration estimates by assimilating auxiliary chl a information from neighboring space time points i e it accounts for the spatiotemporal chl a dependency and generates more accurate less uncertain bme svr based chl a estimates in other words the bme svr outputs can account for both the optical properties of chl a in optically complex coastal waters and the physical chl a pattern across space time leading to more precise estimation than by only accounting for optical properties of chl a i e including spatiotemporal correlation can improve the model results hammond et al 2017 these bme svr features are in line with the perspective that the more information is used the less uncertain the results will be i e a better understanding of the natural phenomena will be gained the same perspective has been found to also hold in the cases of the bme lur bme gwr and bme ann techniques see e g the studies by reyes and serre 2014 he and christakos 2018 xiao et al 2018 c the bme technique is more sensitivity to high space time resolution data than coarser data he et al 2019 i e the modis data with 1 km spatial resolution and 1 day temporal resolution is rather suitable for bme space time analysis d unlike the mainstream chl a algorithms such as hu et al 2012 which only can give a simple estimation error such as mae rmse etc bme offers physical knowledge based posterior probability density distribution of the natural attribute chl a in the current study which can give a complete uncertainty assessment christakos and serre 2000 4 4 explanations of the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a distributions in 2017 high nutrient river discharge from inland watershed will lead to higher chl a concentration at locations with smaller distance to coastline than the farther ones le et al 2014 which is in accordance with the findings in the current study that the west part has higher chl a concentration than the east part the analytical forms of the fitted theoretical covariance models with their parameters sills and maximum spatial correlation ranges determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of chl a concentrations in the gsl region generally the shape of the theoretical covariance c x s represents the manner in which chl a concentrations are interrelated or manifest dependence with varying s whereas the covariance magnitude measures the strength of this dependence i e the covariance magnitude indicates how the corresponding chl a concentrations at one location responds in relation to chl a changes at another location the 170 403 9 km spatial correlation range detected in the current study indicates that chl a distribution shows a mesoscale characteristic according to doney et al 2003 the open sea area around gsl displays a smaller spatial correlation range than the gsl region further indicating that the gsl region is a more complex system than the water body around it given that the plankton communities are sensitive to temperature variation in the gsl region mei et al 2010 zhai et al 2011 the chl a concentration representing the phytoplankton biomass may vary considerably at certain gsl parts dominated by temperature especially at the southwestern part fig 5 particularly the air temperature will reach its peak in august zhai et al 2011 which may favor phytoplankton growth however it takes phytoplankton a certain time lag to respond to the temperature variation and as a result the variability of chl a concentrations represented by the covariance sill reaches its peak in november another peak of the sill value was observed during april which may reflect the spring phytoplankton bloom in gsl fuentes yaco et al 1997 mei et al 2010 i e the sill has a potential ability to account for phytoplankton bloom and it can be regarded as an indicator of bloom characterization two bloom periods of chl a were also found in the coastal area of namibian vorrath et al 2018 except temperature several natural processes may influence the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a distribution 1 eddies were found in gsl lie and el sabh 1983 fouest et al 2005 and it can dominate the migration of surface chl a by the currents and pump the nutrients from the deeper sea to the surface for chl a growth crawford et al 2005 chelton et al 2011 gaube et al 2013 i e the high chl a regions in terms of spatial correlation range may be related to the eddy edge and the suitable nutrient may cause algal bloom leading to high variability of chl a in terms of sill 2 wind can influence the ocean movement such as ekman transport and further impact the distribution of nutrient and phytoplankton production le et al 2019 therefore seasonal variability of wind lie and el sabh 1983 may also influence the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a in practice the maximum spatial correlation range determines the influence radius of chl a concentrations providing useful scientific support to water quality management i e the manager can easily estimate the distance within which the chl a concentrations are spatially correlated 4 5 limitations and future work certain limitations of this work should be mentioned a the performance of the algorithm proposed in the current work could be improved if some other auxiliary variables were available such as the nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved organic matter which can serve as the input variables to svr or bme and the bme svr framework could be further validated in 2017 if in situ chl a concentration data were available for the authors b as is shown in the figures the coverage of modis aqua data is not always very good especially during winter due to e g ice layer covers therefore future work should focus on merging chl a concentrations from various sensors or satellites such as modis terra seawifs and viirs c in addition optically complex waters can be subdivided into several independent types with similar optical characteristics by using some optical based classification method such as normalized trough depth 675 ntd675m fuzzy c means algorithm and chl a retrieval algorithm can be built separately for each type for more accurate chl a estimation le et al 2011 moore et al 2014 sun et al 2012 2014 shi et al 2013 thus it is also worthy to explore the performance of svr bme in classified optically complex waters after solving the above considerations long term remote monitoring of chl a in gsl can be achieved by using remote sensing data such as the other long term studies of different water component le et al 2013b 2013c shi et al 2015b 2018 2019 fu et al 2016 sravanthi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 if global in situ chl a observations are available a global algorithm based on bme svr can be established for global remote chl a estimation 5 conclusions accurate estimation of chl a in gsl a coastal water from optical remote sensing with rigorously accounting for data uncertainty has been a challenging task due to the complex optical components in it and non negligible uncertainties in the satellite derive rrs and chl a retrieval algorithm in the present study with five satellite estimated rrs at 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm svr showed the best performance for locally regionally retrieving chl a concentration among considered eight methods including ci oc3m mlr gar pcr ann gbm rf and svr using bme theory to further process the svr estimated chl a concentration can significantly reduce its uncertainty the monthly spatial chl a distribution covariances in gsl during 2017 showed that the highest chl a concentration variability occurred during november and the spatiotemporal chl a concentration pattern changed a lot during the period august to november providing scientific supports for ocean management purposes it is hoped that the synthetic framework bme svr developed in the present study could attract the interests of researchers for introducing an integrated machine learning and geostatistical techniques into the field of remote sensing and could be also applied in other complex natural attribute studies such as sea surface temperature sea surface salinity sea surface height cdom secchi disk depth total suspended matter etc in conditions of uncertainty especially in the field of remote sensing

18210,remote sensing reflectance rrs values measured by satellite sensors involve large amounts of uncertainty leading to non negligible noise in remote chlorophyll a chl a concentration estimation this work distinguished between two main stages in the case of estimating distributions of chl a within the gulf of st lawrence canada at the model building stage the retrieval algorithm used both in situ chl a measurements and the corresponding moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis l2 level data estimated rrs at 412 443 469 488 531 547 555 645 667 678 nm at a 1 km spatial resolution during 2004 2013 through the training and validation of various models and rrs combinations of the considered eight techniques including support vector regression artificial neural networks gradient boosting machine random forests standard ci oc3m multiple linear regression generalized addictive regression principal component regression the support vector regression svr technique was shown to have the best performance in chl a concentration estimation using rrs at 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm the accuracy indicators for both the training 850 and the validation 213 datasets were found to be very good to excellent e g the r 2 value varied between 0 7058 and 0 9068 at the space time estimation stage this work took a step forward by using the bayesian maximum entropy bme theory to further process the svr estimated chl a concentrations by incorporating the inherent spatiotemporal dependency of physical chl a distribution a 56 improvement was achieved in the reduction of the mean uncertainty of the validation data decreased considerably from 1 2222 to 0 5322 mg m3 then this novel bme svr framework was employed to estimate the daily chl a concentrations in the gulf of st lawrence during jan 1 dec 31 of 2017 1 km spatial resolution the results showed that the daily mean chl a concentration varied from 1 6630 to 3 3431 mg m3 and that the daily mean chl a uncertainty reduction of the composite bme svr vs the svr estimation had a maximum reduction value of 1 0082 and an average reduction value of 0 6173 mg m3 the monthly spatial chl a distribution covariances showed that the highest chl a concentration variability occurred during november and that the spatiotemporal chl a concentration pattern changed a lot during the period august to november in conclusion the proposed bme svr was shown to be a promising remote chl a retrieval approach that exhibited a significant ability in reducing the non negligible uncertainty and improving the accuracy of remote sensing chl a concentration estimates keywords chlorophyll a modis machine learning uncertainty bayesian maximum entropy support vector regression 1 introduction chlorophyll a chl a serves as a bioindicator of phytoplankton biomass in aquatic environments kasprzak et al 2008 a certain amount of phytoplankton can generate oxygen into the aquatic environment and capture the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by a photosynthesis process simultaneously improving water quality and contributing to greenhouse gas reduction buchan et al 2014 durham et al 2015 however the phytoplankton on an aquatic environment surface will grow rapidly causing algal bloom in a short time period with increasing entrophication levels i e nitrogen or phosphorus concentration especially in the water bodies mainly influenced by anthropogenic activities e g estuaries lakes and reservoirs ma et al 2015 watson et al 2016 such algal blooms will cause serious aquatic environment problems and ecosystem damage such as dissolved oxygen level reduction and toxic metabolites accumulation further threatening human health paerl and otten 2013 watson et al 2016 jeppesen et al 2018 therefore gaining a better understanding of the chl a status in aquatic environments is of great concern to the public although in situ water samples have been collected to measure chl a concentration by buoys or cruises the sampling coverage is still limited as regards large spatial and temporal scales and most importantly both sampling and chemical analysis are costly and time consuming during the past several decades satellites have been proven to be a cost efficient tool for observing aquatic chl a concentrations at large spatial and temporal scales mainly due to their inherent optical characteristics babin et al 1996 in 1978 the coastal zone color scanner experiment czcs was the first instrument used to measure ocean color and it was followed by the sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs in 1997 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis in 2002 the medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris in 2002 the geostationary ocean color imager goci in 2011 and the visible and infrared imager radiometer suite viirs in 2012 bailey and werdell 2006 with these sensors various algorithms for retrieving chl a concentrations have been developed for example o reilly et al 1998 developed a series of band ratio algorithms called ocx algorithms and found that the oc4 algorithm showed a robust performance in retrieving the chl a concentration over a three orders of magnitude range hu et al 2012 proposed a color index algorithm to get the chl a concentration below 0 25 mg m3 i e the difference between green band reflectance and a reference linear combination of blue and red bands reflectance these two algorithms form the mainstream approach of chl a concentration retrieval used by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa however these algorithms cannot fit all water optical situations especially case 2 waters such as coastal water with the increasing impact of anthropogenic activities on coastal areas the coastal water components such as colored dissolved organic matter cdom suspended sediment ss phytoplankton and nutrition and their variations become increasingly complicated leading to a more optically complex coastal ecosystem because phytoplankton ss and cdom simultaneously dominate the optical properties of these waters morel and prieur 1977 dierssen 2010 hence local algorithms have been developed for various types of water bodies especially for optically complex waters gitelson et al 2007 van der woerd and pasterkamp 2008 gitelson et al 2011 le et al 2011 2013a despite the development of several chl a retrieval algorithms achieved worldwide there is still the important challenge of generating accurate chl a concentrations in coastal waters using remote sensing data hu et al 2012 the sensors equipped on satellite are used to measure the water spectral reflectance from space due to the long distance optical transmission from the sea surface to the satellite e g air molecule scattering and aerosol scattering will influence the light transmission the optical signal received by the sensors does not solely capture the in water spectral reflectance directly thus some meta processes such as radiometric calibration atmospheric correction etc are implemented to obtain the water spectral reflectance i e remote sensing reflectance rrs mélin et al 2016 qi et al 2017 more detailed information about the atmospheric correction can be found in the sub section 2 1 any error in these processes or parameters determination such as the above water downward irradiance and extra atmospheric solar irradiance etc will introduce uncertainty in the rrs and further retrieved chl a stamnes et al 2003 lee et al 2010 zibordi et al 2011 hu et al 2013 to mitigate or avoid the uncertainties generated by the atmospheric correction process most of the above local chl a concentration retrieval algorithms employed in situ spectral instruments to measure the water spectral reflectance rather than directly using rrs measured by satellite instruments although these algorithms provide sufficient theoretical explanation and evidence that the chl a concentrations are closely related to some reflectance values at specific bands according to the optical properties the large amount of uncertainty involved in rrs from the satellites were not fully taken into consideration especially when such algorithms were employed to massively retrieve chl a concentrations across large spatiotemporal scales moreover no algorithm can achieve totally accurate sea surface chl a estimation accordingly the chl a retrieval algorithm will also generate uncertainty in chl a concentration estimation machine learning ml techniques capable of self learning self adapting and self organizing have been shown to be powerful and efficient tools in the study of non linear and non gaussian systems in many scientific fields including environmental engineering chemical science epidemiology medical image analysis zoology biology and ecology cutler et al 2007 hong et al 2015 jordan and mitchell 2015 criminisi 2016 xiao et al 2017 butler et al 2018 he and christakos 2018 he et al 2018 nelson et al 2018 recently with the increasing popularity of ml techniques in earth sciences these techniques have proven their usefulness in the remote sensing field due to the complex relationship between remote sensing data and real world observations mountrakis et al 2011 belgiu and drăguţ 2016 lary et al 2016 for example keiner 1999 employed neural networks to estimate oceanic chlorophyll concentration by using the five visible wavebands 412 443 490 510 and 555 nm of seawifs data and it was found that it performed better than the oc2 algorithm the same seawifs data were used by camps valls et al 2006 to explore the performance of the relevance vector machine rvm technique and it was found that the rvm outperformed certain empirical algorithms including morel 1 morel 3 calcofi 2 band cubic calcofi 2 band linear oc2 oc4 and back propagation neural network for the coastal waters vilas et al 2011 employed neural network to estimate the chl a concentration in the coastal waters of galician rias using 150 matched in situ chl a and meris remote sensing data additionally kim et al 2014 have tested the random forest support vector machine and cubist techniques for estimating chl a concentrations on the west coast of south korean using goci remote sensing data and found that the support vector machine technique performed best whereas the number of in situ measurements used in modeling was only 63 both of them used rather small sets for training and validating the proposed chl a retrieval algorithms i e machine learning techniques therefore it is valuable to test the application of ml technique with large number of data samples for coastal chl a concentration retrieval using modis data despite their usefulness in observing natural attributes occurring on the earth s surface remote sensing techniques still have certain shortcomings one shortcoming is the issue of missing data due to swath width sun glint and the presence of clouds maritorena et al 2010 shi et al 2015a to resolve this issue the bayesian maximum entropy approach bme christakos 2000 has been successfully employed in a multi satellite data fusion context thus allowing a much better coverage of remote sensing data shi et al 2015a e g used bme to fuse the ocean color data from seawifs meris and modis in which case data coverage improved from below 20 for a single sensor to approximately 97 i e an almost five fold improvement in coverage moreover various spatial resolutions of remote sea surface temperature from modis and amsr e were merged to get a complete spatial coverage of sea surface temperature by the bme approach li et al 2013 the second shortcoming is that although remote sensing products are always characterized by in situ uncertainty most studies attempt to quantify uncertainty by comparing the remote sensing products with the in situ observations mélin et al 2007 antoine et al 2008 cui et al 2014 moore et al 2015 but very few published studies have discussed ways to handle or reduce this uncertainty especially in optically complex waters foody and atkinson 2003 given that bme has already shown a remarkable ability to solve the first shortcoming and it has been also shown to reduce space time estimation uncertainty he and christakos 2018 it is worth exploring its ability to solve the second shortcoming of remote sensing above by employing the probability theory to quantify and handle the uncertainty and assimilating the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the chl a i e the spatiotemporal dependency of chl a for further reducing the uncertainty of chl a estimates in view of the above considerations the main objectives of the present work are twofold to account for chl a data uncertainty and to improve the space time chl a estimation accuracy in the coastal and optically complex waters of the study region gulf of st lawrence gsl in eastern canada to achieve these objectives the developments introduced in this work are as follows a a local ml model that establishes a relationship between large datasets of sea surface chl a concentrations and the matching modis remote sensing observations in the study region during the period 2004 2013 while accounting for relevant dataset and algorithm uncertainties b a geostatistics technique to update the ml chl a concentration estimates to significantly improve chl a concentration retrieval accuracy c an adequate quantitative characterization of the chl a distribution in the study region during a later year 2017 by using the developed ml model to retrieve the chl a concentrations based on modis remote sensing data during the same year d covariance models to represent space time dependency characterization of the chl a distribution during 2017 in our methodological framework the purpose of the analysis for the gsl region during 2004 2013 is to develop an algorithm of sea surface chl a concentration retrieval that can be used to retrieve chl a concentrations at gsl whereas the purpose of the analysis for the gsl region during 2017 will be to gain the knowledge of chl a concentration levels and the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a at gsl during the more recent year 2017 to provide scientific support for ocean management purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study domain and data collection the gulf of st lawrence gsl is a large coastal ecosystem that covers approximately 291 thousands km 2 and is located in eastern canada fig 1 gsl connects canada and north atlantic and provides a large amount of commercial fish catch to canada the space time domain defined by the gsl region during the period 2004 2013 is denoted as g s l 04 13 while the space time domain at the same region during 2017 is denoted as g s l 17 herein for modeling and space time estimation purposes in situ chl a data should be distinguished from modis data it should be also noticed that no in situ chl a data are available after 2013 accordingly in the following data in the g s l 04 13 domain will be used for chl a model building purposes whereas data in the g s l 17 domain will be used for space time chl a concentration estimation purposes there are two key features of the g s l 04 13 domain that make chl a retrieval a difficult matter i the gsl region receives freshwater runoff with large amounts of colored dissolved organic matter cdom from the great lakes and several surrounding rivers koutitonsky 1991 and the cdom can influence light absorption in blue bands larouche and boyer villemaire 2010 ii strong seasonal variability of the physical system has been observed in the gsl region e g ice covers the region during winter and then the ice melts during spring mei et al 2010 to obtain a relative comprehensive dataset under various oceanographic conditions surface chl a concentration data 4346 data in total were collected from the high resolution conductivity temperature depth data ctd of the world ocean database during the period 2004 2013 boyer et al 2013 the surface chl a concentration data from ctd after 2013 was not available to the authors during the current study the modis satellite data used in this study were downloaded from nasa s ocean color web https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov the total reflectance ℜ t measured by modis can be decomposed into several parts as eq 1 shows 1 ℜ t ℜ r ℜ a t ℜ f t ℜ g t ℜ w where ℜ r is the reflectance due to air molecule rayleigh scattering ℜ a is the reflectance due to aerosol scatting and the interaction effects between air molecule and aerosol ℜ f is the reflectance due to whitecaps and foam just above the sea surface ℜ g is the reflectance due to sun glint ℜ w is the water leaving reflectance which includes the bio optical properties information of the water t and t are diffuse transmittance in the viewing direction and direct transmittance between water and sensor respectively it should be noticed that more than 90 ℜ t comes from atmosphere i e the ℜ w accounts for less than 10 ℜ t stamnes et al 2003 atmospheric correction processing is implemented to retrieve ℜ w from ℜ t and it generates level 2 ocean color images from level 1b images mobley et al 2016 the main steps for atmospheric correction include a correcting the gas absorption such as ozone no2 b correcting polarization c quantifying and removing the ℜ f d quantifying and removing the ℜ r e quantifying and removing the ℜ g f quantifying and removing the ℜ a g normalizing the ℜ w h estimating the reflectance within the near infrared band and test its change if the change is large repeat the steps e h otherwise continue to the step i bandpass correction spectral out of band correction j bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf correction and finally obtaining the remote sensing reflectance values rrs at various spectral bands which will be used to retrieve chl a in the current study more detailed information can be found in mobley et al 2016 daily level 2 ocean color images with approximately 1 km spatial resolution were obtained from modis on the aqua satellite during both 2004 2013 and 2017 the images were atmospherically corrected by nasa using the near infrared approach with updated aerosol models gordon and wang 1994 ahmad et al 2010 the rrs of all spectral bands including 412 443 469 488 531 547 555 645 667 678 nm with spatial coordinates were extracted from the modis data in some of the literature such as cannizzaro and carder 2006 le et al 2013a in situ surface reflectance measurements were taken for verifying the rrs from satellite or algorithm development however no in situ reflectance spectra were included in the current study because they are not available to the authors based on these datasets an outline of the overall methodological framework proposed in this work can be found in fig s1 note that the analysis in the left column refers to the period 2004 2013 g s l 04 13 and the analysis in the right column to the year 2017 g s l 17 firstly the chl a retrieval algorithm ml model was developed and validated by using in situ surface chl a and modis data collected in g s l 04 13 domain i e left column of fig s1 then the developed chl a retrieval algorithm was applied to retrieve the chl a concentrations during 2017 by using the modis data collected in the g s l 17 domain i e right column of fig s1 2 2 data pre processing two conditions were considered when matching in situ chl a observations of the g s l 04 13 study domain with modis data a the nearest searching method was used to find the modis data that are closest to each of the in situ observations more specifically the spatial and temporal distances were calculated between each of the in situ chl a observations and the modis data then the nearest searching method determined the modis data space time closest to the in situ chl a observations with some restrictions i e spatial distance less than 0 0105 approximately the spatial resolution of modis data 1 km in the study area and temporal distance equals to 0 b to reduce the potential errors due to the atmospheric correlation algorithm noise and the satellite sensor uncertainty a searching radius of 0 017 i e approximately a 3 3 pixel window centered at the location of each modis datum obtained by condition a above was used to search for neighbor modis data then the set of the average reflectance values of the neighbor modis data was regarded as the final modis dataset matched to the corresponding in situ observations if the number of neighbor data was greater than 4 i e at least half of the 3 3 pixel window contains valid modis data harding et al 2005 le et al 2013a following this process 1063 matched pairs were finally obtained for developing the chl a concentration retrieval algorithm in the g s l 17 study domain 289245 grids spatial locations with 1 km 1 km resolution were generated for estimating the distribution of chl a concentrations during various time instants of the g s l 17 domain the above process was also implemented for matching the spatial locations of these grids and the modis data during various time instants fig s1 following the matching process all grids were projected from the wgs 1984 coordinate system with the coordinates unit degree to the albers coordinate system with the coordinates unit meter because i the unit of the coordinates in wgs 1984 cannot precisely represent the euclidean distance between two locations in the real world and ii the euclidean distance based geostatistical technique will be further used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of the chl a concentration 2 3 support vector regression support vector regression svr is a supervised ml technique that makes no assumptions regarding the data distribution mountrakis et al 2011 by employing a kernel function e g radial basis function sigmoid or polynomial the svr maps the original dataset x i y i i 1 2 n x i and y i denote respectively the reflectance values at selected spectral bands from modis data and the ground measurements of chl a concentration to a higher dimensionality domain via 2 x i φ x i where φ is a mapping operator then the linear regression model 3 y i f x i θ t φ x i θ 0 is considered in the higher dimensionality domain to minimize the empirical loss function 4 min 1 2 θ 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i θ t φ x i θ 0 ε ξ i θ t φ x i θ 0 y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where θ is the weights vector ξ i and ξ i are positive slack variables associated with a permitted prediction error ε ε 0 is a constant c is the penalization parameter applied to the committed errors that can balance the minimization of errors and the regularization term camps valls et al 2006 one way to solve this minimization problem is to introduce lagrange multipliers that account for the differentials of the loss function then the simple form 5 θ ˆ i 1 n α i α i φ x i can be used to estimate θ by employing the karush kuhn tucker conditions and quadratic programming procedures fletchere 1987 then the svr form can be written as 6 y ˆ x i 1 n s α i α i κ x i x θ ˆ 0 where α i and α i are lagrange multiplies corresponding to the two constraints with ξ i and ξ i in eq 4 κ is the kernel function with κ x i x φ x i t φ x x i is the data used to build the svr model and x is the new vector data used in estimation and n s denoting the number of non zero lagrange multipliers with n s n the lagrange multipliers are non zero only for those x i y i data with prediction errors ε and these data are called support vectors on the other hand data with prediction errors ε have zero lagrange multipliers and would not be used in the minimization process approximately 80 of the matched data 850 data in total were used to train the svr model and the remaining data 213 data were used to validate and test the performance of the model the mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 of a simple linear regression model combining the chl a concentration observations and model estimates were employed to assess the svr prediction accuracy to develop an optimal model based on the available data and take full advantage of the svr technique a traversal method was employed to try all combinations of two three four five and six bands selected from the ten bands of the modis spectral reflectance values mentioned earlier in sub section 2 1 at the training stage the radial basis function served as the kernel function κ x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 searching the local optimal model in each combination of bands the value of parameter c in eq 4 was set to vary from 1 to 20 whereas another parameter γ of the kernel function was set to vary from 1 to 500 for comparison purposes four traditional statistical methods standard ci oc3m method multiple linear regression mlr generalized addictive regression gar principle component regression pcr and four machine learning methods artificial neural networks ann gradient boosting machine gbm and random forests rf were also tested detailed information about these methods can be found in supporting information text s1 sensitivity analysis was implemented to explore the influence of each of the selected bands to optimal svr text s2 2 4 quantifying the uncertainty of svr estimates in practice the in situ spectral observations are usually employed to assess the uncertainty of the rrs maritorena and siegel 2005 antoine et al 2008 which are mainly generated from the atmospheric correction process hu et al 2013 the uncertainty generated by the chl a retrieval algorithm would be always quantified through comparing the in situ chl a observations and chl a estimations hu et al 2012 le et al 2013b although other sources of uncertainty exist in the remote sensing observations zhu et al 2013 we quantified the uncertainty from two main sources i e the rrs from atmospheric correlation and chl a retrieval algorithm using the optimal svr model and the modis data the chl a concentrations were estimated in the g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 domains for validation and estimation purposes respectively similarly according to the relationship between the svr based chl a estimates and the observations in the validation stage sub section 2 3 a simple linear regression model the observation value and svr estimates were respectively regarded as independent and dependent variables was employed to calibrate the svr based chl a values to account for both the uncertainty of the modis data and the uncertainty generated by svr modeling in terms of this linear regression model a more realistic form of the calibrated svr based chl a values can be expressed in terms of a gaussian distribution with mean value and variance calculated from respectively the svr estimates and the nearest eight scatter points of the corresponding observations this calibrated chl a data with uncertainty expressed by its variance can be regarded as soft chl a data for further analysis technical details concerning soft chl a data generation is found in the supporting information text s3 in order to validate the ability of the soft chl a data above to account for uncertainty in the following sub section 2 5 a geostatistical technique will be used to estimate the chl a concentrations at points with known observed values by using the soft chl a data above the technique s performance will be assessed by its mae rmse and r 2 accuracy indicators 2 5 bme theory and spatiotemporal mapping of chl a in order to properly handle the soft chl a data generated in sub section 2 4 and present the spatial chl a distributions at various time instants the bme theory of geostatistics was employed to analyze the composite space time variation of chl a concentrations methodologically at each point p s t of the space time study domains g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 where s is the spatial vector location and t is the time instant the bme theory jointly represents the lawful space time chl a variation physically expressed by the chl a law of change and the in situ uncertainty of chl a concentrations in terms of the spatiotemporal random field model s trf christakos 1992 2017 x p f x p χ where x p denotes the space time chl a distribution the means that x p is completely characterized by its probability density function pdf f x p χ with χ denoting a chl a realization at any space time point p in conditions of uncertainty to construct the final posterior pdf f x at each soft point p s of the space time domains g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 of interest bme integrates what follows is a brief outline of the bme method whereas all technical details can be found in the relevant literature e g christakos 2000 i the initial prior pdf f g obtained on the basis of the core or general g kb i e

processing the available site specific s kb which includes all soft chl a data with a gaussian distribution form sub section 2 4 we notice that the number of hard data ground chl a observations collected in the g s l 04 13 domain was rather small compared to the number of soft data generated from remote sensing whereas no hard data was collected in the g s l 17 domain therefore in the present work only soft chl a data with a gaussian distribution form f s were considered as the s kb in the g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 domains by integrating f g and f s the bme method provides the posterior i e updated pdf of the x p concentrations as 9 f x p s χ s a 1 f g p s χ s f s p s χ s d χ s where a is a normalization parameter it should be noticed that bme was only employed here to update the prior pdf i e the soft data points were regarded as unsampled points at which the posterior pdf was derived by bme many software libraries have been developed on the basis of bme theory including the bme library bmelib the spatiotemporal epistemic knowledge synthesis graphical user interface seks gui the bme graphical user interface bmegui and the space time analysis rendering with bme star bme e g christakos et al 2002 yu et al 2007 jat et al 2018 he and kolovos 2018 all of these software libraries can be used to implement the bme method in this work the bmelib functions based on the matlab platform were used to validate the performance of both i the bme svr approach by comparing its outcomes with the ground chl a concentrations collected in the g s l 04 13 space time domain and ii the bme svr mapping of the spatiotemporal chl a distribution in the g s l 17 space time domain the expected value of the posterior f x of eq 9 at each soft chl a data point p s was considered as the chl a estimate for final mapping purposes and the f x standard deviation was regarded as the associated mapping uncertainty at p s 2 6 spatiotemporal chl a characteristics in gsl to assess the spatiotemporal chl a characteristics in the domain g s l 17 the empirical covariances of the spatial distributions of the monthly averaged chl a concentrations were calculated then a set of basic covariance models including the gaussian exponential and spherical models and their linear combinations were fitted to the empirical covariance values by using the particle swarm optimization pso technique eberhart and kennedy 1995 shi and eberhart 1999 poli et al 2007 pso simulates the social activities of a group of birds searching for food briefly a number of particles are set in the search space of the covariance function and each particle will give a goodness of fit at its own current location randomly introducing velocity to each particle and the particles will move to new locations by combining their own history locations and the best location with the best goodness of fit among all particles through a number of interactions the best location i e the final fitted values of the parameters in the covariance models is obtained among the considered covariance models the fitted model with the smallest residual was chosen as the theoretical covariance model of the corresponding monthly mean chl a concentrations further the corresponding covariance parameters correlation ranges and sills were compared sill is an indicator of the spatial chl a variability whereas the correlation range is a measure of the maximum chl a correlation distance separating two locations i e beyond this distance the chl a concentrations are uncorrelated more detailed information about the covariance function can be found in the supporting information text s4 concluding the methodological part of this work in table 1 we present a summary of the separate analysis stages in the g s l 04 13 and g s l 17 domains the g s l 04 13 analysis both in situ chl a data and modis data were available is concerned with the development of the bme svr model for retrieving chl a concentrations at gsl whereas the g s l 17 analysis only modis data were available focuses on the application of the built bme svr model to retrieve chl a concentrations 3 results the numerical results of the various implementation stages of the chl a retrieval approach described above are discussed next 3 1 description of in situ chl a concentrations and the reflectance spectra fig s6 shows that low in situ chl a observation values and high chl a values are clustered at adjacent time instance across the entire period from 2004 to 2013 totally 1063 modis ctd paired data were matched for developing the chl a retrieval algorithm in the g s l 04 13 domain in which 850 and 213 data were randomly chosen as training and validation data sets respectively the minimum maximum and mean in situ chl a observation values of training vs validation data sets are 0 vs 0 0110 mg m3 34 6890 vs 36 5580 mg m3 and 2 3697 vs 2 1525 mg m3 respectively the remote sensing reflectance values of these training and validation data sets are shown in fig s7 generally most of the reflectance spectra including both training and validation data sets show an increasing decreasing stable trend with increasing wavelength but the peaks of the reflectance values may occur at various wavelengths e g 448 531 547 or 555 nm poor linear relationships between reflectance values at different single band or basic band ratio and in situ chl a were found with the entire data set including both training and validation data sets please see table s1 3 2 chl a retrieval algorithm eight methods were tested by considering various spectral band combinations of modis and the corresponding in situ chl a data table 2 shows the optimal results of each method among which the svr with 5 selected modis bands were 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm clearly exhibited the best performance for chl a concentration estimation purposes the parameters c and γ of the optimal svr were found to be 8 4 and 22 86 respectively most reflectance spectra of the five selected bands show an increasing decreasing trend with the largest reflectance value at 531 nm among the five bands 412 nm band and 443 nm band exhibit the greatest amount of cdom and chl a absorption respectively moreover the chl a absorption at 678 nm is also very strong more detailed discussion can be found in the discussion section the results of the accuracy analysis can be summarized as follows between the in situ observations and estimated chl a concentrations obtained by the svr technique the training and validation r 2 values were equal to 0 9068 and 0 7058 respectively the training and validation mae values were equal to 0 4434 and 1 5841 mg m3 respectively and the training and validation rmse values were equal to 1 2188 and 2 2499 respectively noticeably the ml techniques ann gbm rf svr showed better performance than the traditional methods ci oc3m mlr gar pcr in terms of the training mae rmse and r 2 values specifically the accuracy of the svr technique using the training dataset was approximately 6 times larger than the general chl a retrieval algorithm ci oc3m in terms of the mae values 0 4434 vs 2 5265 mg m3 the validation plots observed vs estimated chl a values of figs 2 a and 2b shows the svr performance using training and validation datasets in which the red line and green line represent respectively the 1 1 line and the linear regression fit of the scatter points we observe that the developed svr technique may over estimate chl a at low concentration levels whereas it may under estimate chl a at high concentration levels 3 3 reduction of chl a estimation uncertainty by means of bme after converting all svr based chl a concentration estimates in the space time domain g s l 04 13 into soft chl a data the bme method was employed to update these soft chl a data in the validation dataset comparing the performance of the svr technique vs the combined bme svr technique we found that the latter to yield higher chl a estimation accuracy than the former see validation plots in fig 2b and c in particular the mean mae value decreased from 1 5841 svr to 1 5698 mg m3 bme svr the rmse value decreased from 2 2499 to 2 2213 mg m3 and the r 2 value increased from 0 7058 to 0 7130 fig 2b vs 2c also the mean uncertainty decreased from 1 2222 to 0 5322 mg m3 i e a 56 improvement given that the ranges of chl a concentrations can vary considerably among different water types e g in a water type the chl a concentrations range from 0 to 2 5 mg m3 whereas in another the chl a concentrations range from 0 to 5 mg m3 the relative performance of the svr vs the bme svr techniques for these different ranges should be displayed accordingly considering various thresholds can provide more detailed information about this relative performance under various conditions furthermore the mean mae value and uncertainty of the svr based and the bme svr based chl a estimates were calculated and compared for various thresholds so fig 2d shows that the mean mae value reduction between svr based vs bme svr based chl a estimation displays an increasing then decreasing then stable trend as a function of the threshold whereas the uncertainty reduction displays a decreasing then stable then increasing trend given the series of thresholds considered ranging from 0 021 to 36 551 mg m3 the mean mae reduction for all considered data originated from the validation dataset is 0 0143 mg m3 ranging from 0 0047 to 0 0174 mg m3 and the mean uncertainty reduction is 0 6900 mg m3 ranging from 0 3788 to 0 6933 mg m3 specifically when the threshold is below 0 731 mg m3 the mean mae value reduction fluctuated around 0 moreover the mean mae value reduction reaches its peak at thresholds between 2 841 and 2 931 mg m3 on the other hand the mean uncertainty reduction reaches the first peak at the threshold 0 211 mg m3 and the second peak at thresholds larger than 28 931 mg m3 sensitivity analysis text s2 showed that the optimal svr model was most sensitive to the rrs at 678 nm and the following 531 488 443 412 nm fig s2 3 4 spatiotemporal mapping of chl a in 2017 after matching the remote sensing data at the 289245 grids generated for mapping purposes the temporal coverage of remote sensing data ranges from 0 to 97 days during the entire 365 days of the g s l 17 domain fig 3 the spatial coverage ranges from 0 to 166026 grid nodes covering 57 40 of the entire gsl study area and the monthly mean coverage exhibited an increasing then decreasing trend from january to december of 2017 fig 4 the minimum and maximum average coverage rate occurred during december 5 54 and july 22 50 of 2017 respectively fig 4 then the combined bme svr technique fig s1 right column was employed to retrieve chl a concentrations fig s9 shows that the daily mean chl a concentration varies from 1 6630 to 3 3431 mg m3 and it exhibits less variability during winter december january and february than during other months using both fourier and wavelet techniques bloomfield 2004 cazelles et al 2008 zhang and moore 2011 xiao et al 2019 a 50 days period of the daily mean chl a was detected for 2017 i e a seasonal variation detailed in formation can be found in text s5 the monthly mean chl a concentrations in the g s l 17 domain are plotted in fig 5 generally the chl a concentrations at the west part of the study area are greater than at the east part and there exists a large area of high chl a concentration during july october and november it is noteworthy that by introducing bme to svr based chl a retrieval the uncertainty of remote chl a estimation reduces significantly fig 6 the daily mean uncertainty reduction between bme svr based chl a estimation vs svr based chl a estimation had a maximum value of 1 0082 mg m3 and an average value of 0 6173 mg m3 the monthly mean uncertainty of chl a estimation in the gsl region can be found in fig s10 3 5 characterization of the chl a distribution in 2017 using the monthly mean chl a concentrations fig 5 the monthly empirical covariance values were calculated and fitted the shapes of the fitted covariances are described by the analytical forms of the theoretical models of table 3 we observed that the covariance value of each of the 12 months decreased with increasing spatial distance and finally approached practically zero values after the specified spatial ranges fig 7 this implies that the chl a distribution is spatially homogeneous however the origins and shapes of the covariances vary during different months during all months the slopes of the theoretical covariances are non zero see linear covariance shapes at origin confirming the spatially irregular physical variation of the chl a concentrations table 3 specifically the covariance values at the spatial origin s 0 define the covariance sills with values ranging between 0 4734 and 1 0728 mg m3 2 it was found that the optimal fitted theoretical covariance models of chl a concentrations i during january february and september involved a linear combination of the exponential and spherical components ii during march april may november and december involved a linear combination of exponential components iii during june july and august involved a linear combination of gaussian and spherical models and iv during october involved a linear combination of spherical models to a certain extent the spatiotemporal chl a distribution patterns are consistent during the same season in terms of the analytical forms of the fitted theoretical covariance models in table 3 noteworthy the theoretical models are different from each other during the months of august november indicating that the chl a pattern changes a lot during this period regarding the sill of these fitted theoretical covariances their values increase rapidly from august to november and reaches its peak 1 0728 mg m3 2 during november but the values of sill fluctuate from december to august the maximum spatial correlation range of the chl a concentration varies between 170 and 403 9 km the physical interpretation of the covariance shapes and numerical parameters above will be explored in the discussion section below 4 discussion 4 1 determination of optically complex water some of the research literatures report that the reflectance or absorption values for specific spectral bands increase with increasing chl a concentration leading to a potential way for detecting algal blooms ahn et al 2006 vazyulya et al 2014 in addition the ratio of the reflectance values at 443 nm and 547 nm was found to be correlated with chl a concentrations gitelson et al 2007 ha et al 2014 however the reflectance values in the current study are not in line with the findings described above table s1 and the multiple linear regression results shown in table 2 i e a non linear system exists between the optical characteristics reflectance spectra and chl a concentration in gsl region with regard to the reflectance spectra used in the current study complex water conditions were included in the current study i e 1 oligotrophic waters with highest reflectance values in blue bands mesotrphic and eutrophic waters with the peak of reflectance spectra moving from blue band to green band carder et al 2005 cannizzaro and carder 2006 2 high bottom albedo may result in high reflectance values especially in shallow regions in terms of the literature carder et al 2005 3 cdom and suspended sediment exhibit exponentially decreasing absorption with increasing wavelength and can affect the blue band greater than longer wavelength bands darecki and stramski 2004 cannizzaro and carder 2006 vazyulya et al 2014 sá et al 2015 leading to no obvious absorption signal of chl a at its maximum absorption band 440 nm where strong cdom and suspended sediment absorption occurs 4 compared to the four kinds of water types detected in ahn et al 2006 the gsl water also has similar kinds of water i e algal bloom mixed type algal bloom and suspended sediments turbid water and clear water with the 10 years of spectra and corresponding in situ chl a dataset the coastal water variability of gsl can be fully accounted for besides the satellite based optical reflectance values modis with non negligible uncertainty were collected for developing a chl a retrieval algorithm given the above discussions the gsl water system seems to be complex and non linear 4 2 development of support vector regression on chl a retrieval a main outcome of the present study is the successful development of an ml technique support vector regression svr for estimation of chl a distributions the poor performance results r 2 0 1 table 2 of the non ml techniques indicate that the particular coastal water system is too complicated to be characterized by the traditional methods and the global ocean algorithm ci oc3m which proven not to be suitable for chl a retrieval in coastal water darecki and stramski 2004 le et al 2011 novoa et al 2011 on the other hand the ml techniques ann gbm rf svr performed better than the traditional techniques in terms of r 2 values 0 1 table 2 because these ml techniques have been generally proven to successfully handle non linear systems like the water system discussed in sub section 4 1 zhong et al 2018 pointed out that the ml techniques computational intelligence are effective tools that can handle complexities and uncertain systems in the field of remote sensing among the ml techniques used in the present study the svr technique exhibited the best performance the r 2 values for training and validation were 0 9068 and 0 7058 respectively unlike the pcr technique that uses dimensionality reduction to obtain effective information text s1 the svr technique maps the original data onto a higher dimensionality domain which can be regarded as a magnifying glass to explore micro evidence for making full use of the available information noble 2006 svr can achieve a unique and optimal solution due to the minimizing loss function process eq 4 displaying superior ability than the local minima error algorithm in ann chevalier et al 2011 these are why in the present study the svr technique can outperform the other techniques in chl a concentration retrieval moreover if in situ optical spectral information becomes available e g reflectance values with less uncertainty compared to satellite remote sensing data the svr technique can perform even better than it did in the present study an svr algorithm with five spectral band input including the bands at the wavelength 412 443 488 531 678 nm was developed for chl a estimation purposes among the five spectral bands 412 and 443 nm are the blue spectral bands 488 and 531 nm are the green bands whereas 678 nm is the red band i e the blue green and red bands were all taken into consideration it has been reported that the reflectance values at red and near infrared nir spectral regions are less affected by the presence of suspended particles and cdom than the other bands and that the chl a exhibits maximum local optical absorption around 675 nm gurlin et al 2011 blondeau patissier et al 2014 in other words the reflectance values at these spectral regions can provide less influenced optical information about chl a concentrations in waters than the reflectance values at the other spectral regions and the red or nir based algorithm shows good performance in the remote estimation of chl a concentrations gons et al 2000 moses et al 2009 2013 2019 lunetta et al 2009 bagheri et al 2012 le et al 2013a xie et al 2015 regarding the uncertainty term the rrs values from red band have the smallest uncertainty compared to the rrs values from blue and green band hu et al 2013 cui et al 2014 moore et al 2015 mélin et al 2016 that may be the reasons why the rrs at 678 nm showed the most powerful ability to influence the optimal svr model in the current study fig s2 carder et al 2005 found that the algorithm accuracy can improve two fold in chl retrieval when red band reflectance was employed and the rrs values at 678 nm from red spectral bands have been previously considered in many chl a retrieval studies tzortziou et al 2007 le et al 2013b as the other four bands selected in this work it has been reported in the literature morel and gentili 2009 that the 412 and 443 nm bands are sensitive to cdom and influenced by chlorophyll concentration whereas the blue green 490 and 555 nm bands which are close to the 488 and 531 nm bands considered in the present study were dominated by chlorophyll concentration and influenced by cdom moreover the 412 443 and 531 nm bands were reported to be useful in distinguishing various water types shanmugam 2011 and they may show powerful ability for retrieve chl a in the optically complex water considering the various impact factors on these bands the optimal svr model built in the current study shows less sensitivity to these bands than the red band fig s2 the mainstream retrieval techniques such as the ocx algorithms also take into consideration the blue bands that range from 443 to 516 nm phytoplankton absorption has been found to be an important factor influencing reflectance at 443 nm shanmugam 2011 4 3 incorporating with bme for reducing uncertainty of chl a estimates other outcomes of the present study are the quantification of the uncertainty of remote chl a estimation obtained by the svr algorithm and the uncertainty reduction using the bme technique despite the fact that satellite remote sensing reflectance values have considerable uncertainty as is stated in foody and atkinson 2003 the matter has received only limited attention moreover data uncertainty will propagate from the input of the chl a retrieval model to the output leading to uncertain chl a concentration estimates zhao and kockelman 2002 as described in sub section 2 4 the uncertainty of rrs majorly stems from the atmospheric correction process hu et al 2013 the modis data used in the current study were atmospherically corrected using the nir approach it assumes that zero water leaving reflectance occurs at the nir and the aerosol reflectance at the other bands i e red green and blue bands can be estimated by the spectral extrapolation from the nir gordon and wang 1994 it was found that the shorter the wavelength is e g blue band the greater bias results from atmospheric correction leading to very low rrs values at blue band wang et al 2009 actually negative rrs values for the blue band were found in some modis images used in the current study and they were excluded this indicates that the nir atmospheric correction approach may give imprecise rrs values for the blue band with large amount of uncertainty because high chl and suspended sediments have high reflectance values at nir leading to the failure of the zero water leaving reflectance at nir band wang et al 2007 chen et al 2013 goyens et al 2013 hammond et al 2017 and wanders et al 2012 respectively pointed out that the chl a concentrations and the satellite uncertainty are spatially correlated therefore geostatistical technique like bme may be suitable for accounting for the spatiotemporal variability of both chl a and the corresponding satellite uncertainty because the tobler s first law of geostatitics expresses that everything is correlated with everything else and the near things are more correlated than the farther ones tobler 1970 the core function of geostatistical technique is the covariance function or semivariogram function it has also been applied in chl estimations using gaussian process regression blix et al 2017 mapping the uncertainty of modis chl products moore et al 2009 merging chl products from various sensor shi et al 2015a detecting mesoscale variability doney et al 2003 detecting the spatial pattern of intra seasonal variability of chl legaard and thomas 2007 and so on using the method described in sub section 2 4 the mean uncertainty of the chl a concentration estimate in the validation dataset was found to be equal to 1 2222 mg m3 which is rather high compared to the mean chl a concentration estimate of 2 4225 mg m3 fortunately the bme method can effectively handle this issue although bme has been applied in the fusion of remote sensing products from various satellites li et al 2013 shi et al 2015a tang et al 2015 the present work is the first time that bme has been applied in the case of the original remote sensing estimation in conditions of uncertainty it is noteworthy that with the help of bme the mean uncertainty was reduced to 0 5322 mg m3 from 1 2222 mg m3 while the accuracy increased in terms of the mae rmse and r 2 values the mae value and the rmse decreased respectively from 1 5841 to 1 5698 mg m3 and from 2 2499 to 2 2213 mg m3 whereas the r 2 value increased from 0 7058 to 0 7130 in this case bme exhibits several powerful features that have been highlighted in he and kolovos 2018 a bme can fully handle uncertain chl a data without any restrictive prior assumption as well as non linear complex coastal ecosystems e g the svr based chl a estimates with uncertainty b bme can update the prior svr based chl a concentration estimates by assimilating auxiliary chl a information from neighboring space time points i e it accounts for the spatiotemporal chl a dependency and generates more accurate less uncertain bme svr based chl a estimates in other words the bme svr outputs can account for both the optical properties of chl a in optically complex coastal waters and the physical chl a pattern across space time leading to more precise estimation than by only accounting for optical properties of chl a i e including spatiotemporal correlation can improve the model results hammond et al 2017 these bme svr features are in line with the perspective that the more information is used the less uncertain the results will be i e a better understanding of the natural phenomena will be gained the same perspective has been found to also hold in the cases of the bme lur bme gwr and bme ann techniques see e g the studies by reyes and serre 2014 he and christakos 2018 xiao et al 2018 c the bme technique is more sensitivity to high space time resolution data than coarser data he et al 2019 i e the modis data with 1 km spatial resolution and 1 day temporal resolution is rather suitable for bme space time analysis d unlike the mainstream chl a algorithms such as hu et al 2012 which only can give a simple estimation error such as mae rmse etc bme offers physical knowledge based posterior probability density distribution of the natural attribute chl a in the current study which can give a complete uncertainty assessment christakos and serre 2000 4 4 explanations of the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a distributions in 2017 high nutrient river discharge from inland watershed will lead to higher chl a concentration at locations with smaller distance to coastline than the farther ones le et al 2014 which is in accordance with the findings in the current study that the west part has higher chl a concentration than the east part the analytical forms of the fitted theoretical covariance models with their parameters sills and maximum spatial correlation ranges determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of chl a concentrations in the gsl region generally the shape of the theoretical covariance c x s represents the manner in which chl a concentrations are interrelated or manifest dependence with varying s whereas the covariance magnitude measures the strength of this dependence i e the covariance magnitude indicates how the corresponding chl a concentrations at one location responds in relation to chl a changes at another location the 170 403 9 km spatial correlation range detected in the current study indicates that chl a distribution shows a mesoscale characteristic according to doney et al 2003 the open sea area around gsl displays a smaller spatial correlation range than the gsl region further indicating that the gsl region is a more complex system than the water body around it given that the plankton communities are sensitive to temperature variation in the gsl region mei et al 2010 zhai et al 2011 the chl a concentration representing the phytoplankton biomass may vary considerably at certain gsl parts dominated by temperature especially at the southwestern part fig 5 particularly the air temperature will reach its peak in august zhai et al 2011 which may favor phytoplankton growth however it takes phytoplankton a certain time lag to respond to the temperature variation and as a result the variability of chl a concentrations represented by the covariance sill reaches its peak in november another peak of the sill value was observed during april which may reflect the spring phytoplankton bloom in gsl fuentes yaco et al 1997 mei et al 2010 i e the sill has a potential ability to account for phytoplankton bloom and it can be regarded as an indicator of bloom characterization two bloom periods of chl a were also found in the coastal area of namibian vorrath et al 2018 except temperature several natural processes may influence the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a distribution 1 eddies were found in gsl lie and el sabh 1983 fouest et al 2005 and it can dominate the migration of surface chl a by the currents and pump the nutrients from the deeper sea to the surface for chl a growth crawford et al 2005 chelton et al 2011 gaube et al 2013 i e the high chl a regions in terms of spatial correlation range may be related to the eddy edge and the suitable nutrient may cause algal bloom leading to high variability of chl a in terms of sill 2 wind can influence the ocean movement such as ekman transport and further impact the distribution of nutrient and phytoplankton production le et al 2019 therefore seasonal variability of wind lie and el sabh 1983 may also influence the spatiotemporal pattern of chl a in practice the maximum spatial correlation range determines the influence radius of chl a concentrations providing useful scientific support to water quality management i e the manager can easily estimate the distance within which the chl a concentrations are spatially correlated 4 5 limitations and future work certain limitations of this work should be mentioned a the performance of the algorithm proposed in the current work could be improved if some other auxiliary variables were available such as the nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved organic matter which can serve as the input variables to svr or bme and the bme svr framework could be further validated in 2017 if in situ chl a concentration data were available for the authors b as is shown in the figures the coverage of modis aqua data is not always very good especially during winter due to e g ice layer covers therefore future work should focus on merging chl a concentrations from various sensors or satellites such as modis terra seawifs and viirs c in addition optically complex waters can be subdivided into several independent types with similar optical characteristics by using some optical based classification method such as normalized trough depth 675 ntd675m fuzzy c means algorithm and chl a retrieval algorithm can be built separately for each type for more accurate chl a estimation le et al 2011 moore et al 2014 sun et al 2012 2014 shi et al 2013 thus it is also worthy to explore the performance of svr bme in classified optically complex waters after solving the above considerations long term remote monitoring of chl a in gsl can be achieved by using remote sensing data such as the other long term studies of different water component le et al 2013b 2013c shi et al 2015b 2018 2019 fu et al 2016 sravanthi et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 if global in situ chl a observations are available a global algorithm based on bme svr can be established for global remote chl a estimation 5 conclusions accurate estimation of chl a in gsl a coastal water from optical remote sensing with rigorously accounting for data uncertainty has been a challenging task due to the complex optical components in it and non negligible uncertainties in the satellite derive rrs and chl a retrieval algorithm in the present study with five satellite estimated rrs at 412 443 488 531 and 678 nm svr showed the best performance for locally regionally retrieving chl a concentration among considered eight methods including ci oc3m mlr gar pcr ann gbm rf and svr using bme theory to further process the svr estimated chl a concentration can significantly reduce its uncertainty the monthly spatial chl a distribution covariances in gsl during 2017 showed that the highest chl a concentration variability occurred during november and the spatiotemporal chl a concentration pattern changed a lot during the period august to november providing scientific supports for ocean management purposes it is hoped that the synthetic framework bme svr developed in the present study could attract the interests of researchers for introducing an integrated machine learning and geostatistical techniques into the field of remote sensing and could be also applied in other complex natural attribute studies such as sea surface temperature sea surface salinity sea surface height cdom secchi disk depth total suspended matter etc in conditions of uncertainty especially in the field of remote sensing

18211,trichloroethylene tce is a groundwater pollutant that is prevalent worldwide in contaminated groundwater tce can be biodegraded following either reductive dechlorination or aerobic co metabolic oxidation however since the co metabolic process is not accompanied by indicative and easily detectable transformation products little is known about its prominence in the environment to estimate the environmental importance of the oxidative process a regional groundwater survey was conducted in this survey polluted water from 100 wells along the israeli coastal aquifer was sampled geochemical data indicated oxic conditions prevailing in most sites the sampled groundwater was used for microcosm experiments functional gene analysis and tce compound specific isotope analysis δ13c and δ37cl enrichments of methane and toluene oxidizers in microcosms indicated the high potential of the indigenous microbial community to co metabolically oxidize tce this was further reinforced by the high abundance of mmox and phe functional genes quantified in some of the sites yet lower abundance of tod functional gene was found finally compound specific isotope analysis was used to assess the magnitude of tce oxidation in practice applying the isotopic tool for scattered points on a regional scale demanded the consideration of a wide δ13c range of source tce hampering the ability to detect small shifts of a single permil thus despite the high potential for the oxidation process no evidence was attained for the natural occurrence of the process and significant isotopic shifts were restricted to actively treated sites only this limitation should be considered in future regional scale studies in which no single source is defined graphical abstract image 1 keywords

al 2010 shukla et al 2014 smidt and de vos 2004 suttinun et al 2013 in the reductive process the halogenated compounds serve as an electron acceptor leading to the formation and often accumulation of indicative less chlorinated transformation products abe et al 2009 aeppli et al 2010 chang et al 2011 dolinová et al 2017 hunkeler et al 2011 1999 imfeld et al 2011 liang et al 2017 shani et al 2013 wiegert et al 2012 these products are of increasing toxicity especially vinyl chloride vc epa 2000 the lower chlorinated ethylene have a lower tendency to undergo reductive dechlorination but increasing tendency to undergo the oxidative pathway as such metabolic oxidation of vc is common dolinová et al 2017 while for tce it has only rarely been reported dey and roy 2009 mukherjee and roy 2012 schmidt et al 2014 co metabolic oxidation of tce has been reported for a relatively large number of microbial strains arp et al 2001 dolinová et al 2017 in the co metabolic process tce is fortuitously oxidized by oxygenases with a broad substrate range these oxygenases are induced by the presence of bacterial growth substrates auxiliary substrates such as methane ethene ammonium and aromatic hydrocarbons arp et al 2001 oxidative co metabolism of tce leads to products such as tce epoxide 1 2 dihyroxy tce or chloral hydrate which are of lower toxicity than vc and thus the extent of this process in affected environments is of great interest however since this degradation route is not accompanied by the accumulation of easily detectable transformation products little is known about its actual occurrence in contaminated aquifers part of the strategy to elucidate the co metabolic oxidation of tce in affected environments is quantifying functional genes using microbial functional genes a relatively conserved region encoding for an enzyme of interest can provide insights into the composition abundance and structure of microbial communities fortney et al 2015 roh et al 2010 functional genes can also provide insights into the microbial communities related to the degradation of specific pollutants of interest baek et al 2009 baldwin et al 2003 biomarkers 2012 brisson et al 2012 chiang et al 2012 clingenpeel et al 2005 futagami et al 2008 guan et al 2013 he et al 2007 hendrickx et al 2005 hunkeler et al 2011 larentis et al 2013 lee et al 2008 maphosa et al 2010 martinez lavanchy et al 2015 miller et al 2002 nebe et al 2009 rahman et al 2011 sercu et al 2013 vilchez vargas et al 2013 2010 in the specific case of tce co metabolic oxidation the functional genes encoding for oxygenases of methanotrophs and toluene oxidizers may be relevant regarding methanotrophs it was shown that different forms of methane monooxygenase mmo can fortuitously oxidize tce nearly all characterized methanotrophs possess the particulate form of mmo pmmo while some also possess the soluble form of mmo smmo ross and rosenzweig 2017 despite its lower abundance among methanotrophs smmo has a wider substrate range than pmmo and is capable of degrading tce at a rate that is faster by an order of magnitude sullivan et al 1998 therefore mmox encoding for smmo enzyme may be a more specific functional gene marker for tce co metabolism arp et al 2001 regarding the toluene oxidizers toluene oxidation can be achieved via five different biochemical pathways differing in the position of oxygenase attack each of the pathways is catalyzed by a distinct enzyme baldwin et al 2014 cao et al 2009 from these five distinct enzymes four can co metabolize tce toluene 2 monooxygenase toluene 3 monooxygenase toluene 4 monooxygenase and toluene dioxygenase dolinová et al 2017 the presence of toluene 2 3 and 4 monooxygenase can be assessed using phe functional gene and the presence of toluene dioxygenase can assess by using tod functional gene a complementary approach for gaining direct evidence for degradation processes is by using compound specific isotope analysis csia aelion et al 2009 csia is based on the fact that bonds with lighter isotopes are normally cleaved slightly more quickly than bonds with heavy isotopes on the other hand often negligible isotope effects are evident in processes in which inner bonds remain intact such as diffusion dilution or sorption braeckevelt et al 2012 höhener et al 2012 meckenstock et al 2004 wanner and hunkeler 2015 thus isotope shifts are almost exclusively related to degradation processes consequently a direct indication of degradation can be obtained and its extent may be assessed even without the need for concentration based mass balances since kinetic isotope effects are reaction specific multi element isotope analysis is even more powerful as it may provide insight on the transformation mechanisms elsner et al 2005 for tce distinguishing between reductive dechlorination and co metabolic oxidation can theoretically be achieved using multi element 37cl and 13c isotopic effects while c cl bond cleavage in reductive dechlorination affects both elements λ 3 4 5 7 audí miró et al 2013 cretnik et al 2013 kuder et al 2013 cc bond cleavage in co metabolic oxidation will normally affect only carbon 10 9 to 38 gafni et al 2020 exceptional is co metabolic oxidation by methanotrophs which was shown to affect both carbon and chlorine to similar extents λ 1 1 1 7 gafni et al 2020 nevertheless the magnitude of carbon and chlorine isotope effects by methanotrophs is rather low thus may not have a significant mark this may lead to an underestimation of the overall co metabolic oxidation since methanotrophs contribution may be below detection the role of other co metabolic groups such as toluene oxidizers gafni et al 2020 2018 may still result in a significant mark this work aimed to identify the relevance of aerobic co metabolic degradation of tce in polluted groundwater the potential for tce co metabolic oxidation in the contaminated groundwater was assessed by enriching indigenous tce co metabolizing cultures with either toluene or methane as auxiliary substrates and by quantifying functional genes evidence for the occurrence of the process in practice was further obtained by analyzing the stable isotope composition of tce δ37cl and δ13c in the polluted groundwater in multiple sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and groundwater sampling the israeli coastal aquifer is one of the most important resources for israel s fresh water supply 23 of the fresh water supply in 2016 providing an average of 250 106 m3 annually reshef 2017a this aquifer stretches along israel s coastline up to the foothills of the carmel mountains in the north the western boundary of the aquifer forms the interface with seawater to the east the aquifer wedges towards other lithological units stratigraphically this aquifer consists of sedimentary rocks of the kurkar group which mainly comprises relatively highly permeable sands and sandstone as well as layers of lower permeability this group is underlain by inclined low permeability shale and marls the saqiya group with a maximal depth of 180 m below mean sea level in the southern coastal plain gvirtzman and reiss 1965 the majority of israel s industrial sites are located above the israeli coastal aquifer groundwater underneath these sites is routinely monitored by the israel water authority with 800 designated monitoring wells graber et al 2008 reshef 2017b tce and pce are the most frequently discovered industrial pollutants in this monitoring system sagi ben moshe et al 2015 ten sites were selected for this study in which historical tce concentrations of 50 μg l 1 were measured for site description see si none of the sites has a single contamination sources with known location and the contamination in the different sites can date decades back since the groundwater flow regime in this aquifer changes locally and periodically following changes in water abstraction and as a result of the limited number of monitoring wells in the sites no classical plumes can be drawn this does not enable to track isotope shifts along a flow line as often done in other studies e g aeppli et al

geochemical data from one of the sites site t were not available thus the geochemical results of 85 wells only are presented geochemical conditions varied between the contaminated sites table s3 dissolved oxygen do values ranged from 0 1 to 5 4 mg l 1 being 1 0 mg l 1 in 44 of the samples and oxidation reduction potential orp values ranged from 264 to 270 mv electrical conductivity ec was highly variable as well ranging from 340 to 4857 μs cm 1 the ph presented a relatively narrow range of 6 3 7 7 table 1 the low do and orp values in some of the wells including most wells in site a four wells in site imi an and a single well in site e indicate the potential for reductive tce dechlorination in these specific locations 3 2 voc concentrations molar fraction of chlorinated ethylenes fig 1 and btex concentration table 2 varied between the contaminated sites tables s4 and s5 respectively tce was found in nine of the ten sites a total of 92 wells at concentrations of up to 5 104 μg l 1 in sites in which tce was not detected it was reported in historical sampling pce was found in eight out of ten sites with concentrations ranging from 3 to 1 104 μg l 1 in four of these sites pce predominated over tce implying that tce may possibly also be a product of pce reductive dehalogenation dce cis and trans isomers were detected in six sites with the cis isomer dominating in site a the average cis dce concentrations were even higher than tce and pce vc was detected in three out of the ten sites site a site e and imi na with concentrations of up to 5 102 7 103 μg l 1 the detection of cis dce and vc is a clear indicator of ongoing reductive dechlorination in sites a and imi an reductive dechlorination is also supported by the relatively low do and orp concentrations monitored table 1 in site e the monitored geochemical conditions do not support the existence of reductive dechlorination nevertheless anaerobic niches within this site that are not captured by the monitoring wells can explain the presence of these indicative transformation products btex may serve as an auxiliary substrate for tce co metabolizing bacteria and their concentrations were monitored in all sites as well in brief btex was detected in five sites only table 2 the highest btex concentrations were detected in site a with a concentration of up to 104 μg l 1 historical data unpublished data indicated the former presence of btex in sites is h is ph and is br as well however to the best of our knowledge btex is absent from sites is a is s imi rh and imi an 3 3 microcosm experiments groundwater bacteria were enriched with the selective growth medium to identify tce co metabolic oxidation potential in the aquifer groundwater from six different sites was used as an inoculum for the enrichment cultures is h is br is ph is a is s and site a table s6 no active remediation occurred in these sites prior to sampling the arbitrary criterion for a positive tce co metabolic oxidation potential was defined as a concentration decrease of 30 compared to an abiotic control in total 24 and 18 of the tested groundwater samples presented a positive degradation potential when amended with either toluene or methane respectively in five of the six sites tested at least one groundwater sample had a positive tce co metabolic oxidation potential with either toluene or methane as a carbon source an exception is a culture retrieved from site is a which failed to co metabolize tce however only one well was sampled at this site it should be noted that in the microcosm experiments a high tce concentration 5000 μg l 1 was amended which could result in a toxic effect on enzymatic activity mills et al 2018 this as well as the fact that not all bacteria can be successfully cultured under lab conditions implies that the results provided a lower boundary for co metabolic degradation potential within the examined sites samples presenting a positive degradation potential originated from diverse environments in terms of geochemical parameters and contaminant levels which does not differ from samples presenting a negative co metabolic oxidation potential the microbial potential to co metabolize tce was not correlated to the presence of btex in groundwater samples for example the two wells in site is s demonstrated a positive co metabolic potential with toluene as a carbon source although btex was not detected in this site as an opposite example only one well out of eight in site is h presented a positive co metabolic potential despite the detection of btex in this site isotope effects in tce co metabolic oxidation by groundwater enrichment cultures is reported elsewhere gafni et al 2020 3 4 functional gene quantification dna was extracted from 37 groundwater samples that were retrieved from a total of seven different sites six of them were not actively remediated is h is br is a is s and site a while the seventh site e was treated in a pilot study with the commercial kb1 reductive de chlorination culture functional genes were quantified for toluene oxidizers genes phe and tod and methanotrophs gene mmox fig 2 while mmox and phe were present in all samples tod was detected in only 78 of the samples concentration ranges were 9 102 4 108 copies l 1 for mmox 4 103 8 108 copies l 1 for the and 1 103 8 106 copies l 1 for tod it is expected that with the increase in degrader abundances the potential for in situ biodegradation will increase thouand et al 2011 in our case it may indicate whether degraders are present in sufficient quantities for oxidizing tce however there is no explicit threshold number for degraders at which tce oxidation is more likely to occur in contrast to the reductive dechlorination of tce where the dehalococcoides 16s rrna gene is a well established predictor lebrón et al 2011 functional gene thresholds for the aerobic process have only recently been examined wiedemeier et al 2017 and are less conclusive recently the relationship between the tce co metabolism rate and functional gene abundance has been thoroughly investigated in 19 microcosms retrieved from five different sites across the united states wiedemeier et al 2017 out of 19 microcosms eight presented tce co metabolism with half lives of 0 26 105 years lower oxidation rates were correlated to lower gene abundances while gene copies exceeding 106 107 and 105 copies l 1 for mmox phe and tod respectively resulted in half lives of up to 0 26 years other field studies correlating gene abundance to tce co metabolism present abundances of 105 copies l 1 for mmox and phe chiang et al 2012 paszczynski et al 2011 sadeghi and chiang 2016 and 108 copies l 1 for tod chiang et al 2012 these latter thresholds however do not provide evidence for the oxidation rate abundancies of 106 107 and 105 copies l 1 for mmox phe and tod genes were formerly correlated with high degradation rates with half lives in the order of up to single decades wiedemeier et al 2017 these abundances were determined in 25 16 and 14 wells respectively out of a total of 37 wells sampled in other studies abundances of 105 copies l 1 for mmox and tod were set as a threshold for tce co metabolism but without providing an expected rate for the process chiang et al 2012 paszczynski et al 2011 sadeghi and chiang 2016 these abundances where found in 30 and 32 wells respectively functional gene quantification in tce co metabolic oxidation suffers from the fact that these genes are ubiquitous and not explicit for tce oxidation chiang et al 2012 liang et al 2017 sadeghi and chiang 2016 wiedemeier et al 2017 former attempts to provide intrinsic bioremediation potential have shown that the same functional genes can be abundant in variable oxygen liang et al 2017 sadeghi and chiang 2016 and tce concentrations chiang et al 2012 liang et al 2017 sadeghi and chiang 2016 furthermore it was observed that the abundance of these genes in wells associated with positive or negative degradation potentials present similar abundancies chiang et al 2012 sadeghi and chiang 2016 wiedemeier et al 2017 indeed our attempts to correlate functional gene abundance with field measured geochemical parameters tce or btex concentrations yielded no significant p 0 05 and 0 01 correlations this reinforces the weakness of this methodology as a sole tool for assessing co metabolic tce oxidation in aquifers fig s1 3 5 isotope composition of tce in groundwater samples isotope analysis of tce in field samples was perform to gain evidence for aerobic co metabolic oxidation in the aquifer tce co metabolic oxidation is typically reflected by strong carbon and negligible chlorine isotope effects with the exception of methanotrophs this theoretically enables to differentiate co metabolic oxidation from reductive dechlorination as the later is accompanied by significant carbon and chlorine isotope effects see fig 3 lower panel for illustration a common stable isotope composition for industrially manufactured tce varies in a range of 4 for δ13c from 31 6 to 27 4 and in a range of 7 for δ37cl from 3 2 to 3 9 shouakar stash et al 2003 in our study the isotope composition of tce was analyzed in seven sites in which concentrations enabled the analysis fig 3 showing values that exceed the industrially manufactured tce the δ13c values ranged between 39 5 0 5 detected in is h and 4 6 0 5 detected in site t and δ37cl values ranged between 2 9 0 5 detected in site a and 4 4 0 5 detected in site e samples with more depleted δ13c values than the commercial range set earlier by shouakar stash et al shouakar stash et al 2003 were detected in five of the sites is h is a imi rh site a and site e with the most depleted value of 39 5 degradation is expected to lead to isotope enrichment and thus cannot explain these depleted values pure phase tce evaporation on the other hand is accompanied by an inverse carbon isotope effect εc between 0 24 and 0 35 huang et al 1999 jeannottat and hunkeler 2012 poulson and drever 1999 yu et al 2014 which may theoretically lead to the depleted δ13c values observed in the groundwater however evaporation is also accompanied by a normal chlorine isotope effect εcl between 1 33 and 1 6 jeannottat and hunkeler 2012 poulson and drever 1999 yu et al 2014 which is not detected in these samples depleted δ13c values were also found in other field investigations δ13c of 40 5 palau et al 2014 suggesting that the range of commercial tce is wider than estimated indeed δ13c values as low as 48 0 were determined for tce when produced from acetylene originating from methane ertl et al 1998 since the relatively depleted δ13c values were detected in variable wells it seems that the tce used in these sites had an original δ13c composition that was more depleted than formerly estimated shouakar stash et al 2003 extending the range of commercial tce δ13c down to 48 0 ertl et al 1998 covers most of the sites tested fig 3 providing no unequivocal proof for tce degradation in most of the sites only two sites exhibited isotopic enrichment that exceeds the commercial tce margins site t and site e in site t the δ13c composition of tce ranged between 29 4 and 4 6 with more enriched values being correlated to lower tce concentrations fig s3 on the other hand the δ37cl composition of tce monitored in this site was rather uniform this site was actively treated by permanganate oxidation a process that leads to a strong δ13c enrichment but no δ37cl enrichment doğan subaşı et al 2017 hunkeler et al 2003 poulson and naraoka 2002 the δ13c composition of tce enabled in this case the evaluation of the treatment s effectiveness in the monitored wells presenting up to 60 oxidation in the wells sampled table s7 in site e one out of 34 wells sampled provided isotopic evidence for biodegradation this well well h4 presented the most enriched δ13c and δ37cl values in this site 26 4 and 4 4 respectively although not exceeding the range for commercial tce composition ertl et al 1998 shouakar stash et al 2003 this relative enrichment can be related to the field test treatment using the kb1 culture which took place in a limited area within this site the kb1 treatment presented a 90 tce concentration decrease in the vicinity of this well s1 13 which theoretically should lead to an enriched carbon isotope composition of up to 0 5 assuming an initial δ13c0 32 3 and an enrichment factor ε of 13 8 slater et al 2001 nevertheless in the three years that passed between treatment and sampling plume transport mixing with fresh tce and possibly also the dissolution of pure tce entrapped in the porous media have likely occurred and diminished this effect the lack of evidence for degradation was most surprising for site imi an in which a high abundance of anaerobic transformation products was detected mostly cis dce but also vc fig 1 the narrow range of δ13c and δ37cl compositions monitored for tce in this site is related to the extensive pumping that took place in this site from 2014 to 2015 leading to a decrease in tce concentrations sagi ben moshe et al 2015 it is possible that the isotope composition of tce in this site was influenced by the dissolution of tce held in ganglia within the porous media or by mixing with other tce sources both driven by the extensive pumping similarly geochemical parameters at site a suggest that tce might have followed reductive dechlorination indeed a clear isotope enrichment trendline is observed in this site however this trendline remains within the margins of commercial tce it should be noted that co contamination of pce was found in sites a and imi an implying tce might have been formed as a degradation product hence the isotopic signature of tce may not only be related to its commercial composition but also influenced by its possible continuous formation from pce despite the aerobic conditions in most of the sites despite the positive potential for co metabolic oxidation in some of the wells and despite the high abundance of functional genes for tce co metabolic oxidation no isotopic evidence for the occurrence of the process in groundwater was obtained this observation may be explained by the fact that no single source is defined in any of the sites and a wide range of commercial tce has to be considered the isotope composition of commercially produced tce is characterized by a very wide composition range δ13c spanning over 20 from 48 0 to 27 4 ertl et al 1998 shouakar stash et al 2003 in practice if a tce source is characterized by a δ13c of 48 0 co metabolic oxidation of 85 must take place by toluene oxidizers before it can be detected assuming εc 11 5 clingenpeel et al 2012 gafni et al 2018 with the low isotope effect accompanying tce co metabolism by methanotrophs chu et al 2004 gafni et al 2018 their contribution cannot even be considered in this scenario one example in which co metabolic oxidation might have occurred but could not be verified is in the industrial site is h here δ13c values spanned over a 10 range from 39 5 to 29 7 while most δ37cl values were not significantly different in this site i aerobic conditions prevail ii a btex co contamination exists iii a high abundance of the phe gene was determined and iv a positive biodegradation potential was identified in microcosms all of this evidence indicates that co metabolic oxidation of tce might have occurred nevertheless we cannot rule out the possibility that the wide δ13c range detected in this site is the result of several isotopically distinct sources 4 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the importance of tce co metabolic oxidation in contaminated sites along the israeli costal aquifer tools determining the potential occurrence of the process provided positive indications most sites are oxic and btex co contamination was observed in some microcosm experiments indicated the presence of indigenous bacteria able to co metabolize tce with methane or toluene as auxiliary substrates finally a high abundance of relevant functional genes of methane or toluene oxidizers was determined in some of the sites though more work is needed to determine gene copy threshold numbers indicative for the process despite the positive indications no proof was gained that tce co metabolic oxidation occurs in practice in the sites tested the very wide δ13c range possible for tce sources hinders the ability to detect processes that lead to isotope shifts of only a few permils

18211,trichloroethylene tce is a groundwater pollutant that is prevalent worldwide in contaminated groundwater tce can be biodegraded following either reductive dechlorination or aerobic co metabolic oxidation however since the co metabolic process is not accompanied by indicative and easily detectable transformation products little is known about its prominence in the environment to estimate the environmental importance of the oxidative process a regional groundwater survey was conducted in this survey polluted water from 100 wells along the israeli coastal aquifer was sampled geochemical data indicated oxic conditions prevailing in most sites the sampled groundwater was used for microcosm experiments functional gene analysis and tce compound specific isotope analysis δ13c and δ37cl enrichments of methane and toluene oxidizers in microcosms indicated the high potential of the indigenous microbial community to co metabolically oxidize tce this was further reinforced by the high abundance of mmox and phe functional genes quantified in some of the sites yet lower abundance of tod functional gene was found finally compound specific isotope analysis was used to assess the magnitude of tce oxidation in practice applying the isotopic tool for scattered points on a regional scale demanded the consideration of a wide δ13c range of source tce hampering the ability to detect small shifts of a single permil thus despite the high potential for the oxidation process no evidence was attained for the natural occurrence of the process and significant isotopic shifts were restricted to actively treated sites only this limitation should be considered in future regional scale studies in which no single source is defined graphical abstract image 1 keywords

al 2010 shukla et al 2014 smidt and de vos 2004 suttinun et al 2013 in the reductive process the halogenated compounds serve as an electron acceptor leading to the formation and often accumulation of indicative less chlorinated transformation products abe et al 2009 aeppli et al 2010 chang et al 2011 dolinová et al 2017 hunkeler et al 2011 1999 imfeld et al 2011 liang et al 2017 shani et al 2013 wiegert et al 2012 these products are of increasing toxicity especially vinyl chloride vc epa 2000 the lower chlorinated ethylene have a lower tendency to undergo reductive dechlorination but increasing tendency to undergo the oxidative pathway as such metabolic oxidation of vc is common dolinová et al 2017 while for tce it has only rarely been reported dey and roy 2009 mukherjee and roy 2012 schmidt et al 2014 co metabolic oxidation of tce has been reported for a relatively large number of microbial strains arp et al 2001 dolinová et al 2017 in the co metabolic process tce is fortuitously oxidized by oxygenases with a broad substrate range these oxygenases are induced by the presence of bacterial growth substrates auxiliary substrates such as methane ethene ammonium and aromatic hydrocarbons arp et al 2001 oxidative co metabolism of tce leads to products such as tce epoxide 1 2 dihyroxy tce or chloral hydrate which are of lower toxicity than vc and thus the extent of this process in affected environments is of great interest however since this degradation route is not accompanied by the accumulation of easily detectable transformation products little is known about its actual occurrence in contaminated aquifers part of the strategy to elucidate the co metabolic oxidation of tce in affected environments is quantifying functional genes using microbial functional genes a relatively conserved region encoding for an enzyme of interest can provide insights into the composition abundance and structure of microbial communities fortney et al 2015 roh et al 2010 functional genes can also provide insights into the microbial communities related to the degradation of specific pollutants of interest baek et al 2009 baldwin et al 2003 biomarkers 2012 brisson et al 2012 chiang et al 2012 clingenpeel et al 2005 futagami et al 2008 guan et al 2013 he et al 2007 hendrickx et al 2005 hunkeler et al 2011 larentis et al 2013 lee et al 2008 maphosa et al 2010 martinez lavanchy et al 2015 miller et al 2002 nebe et al 2009 rahman et al 2011 sercu et al 2013 vilchez vargas et al 2013 2010 in the specific case of tce co metabolic oxidation the functional genes encoding for oxygenases of methanotrophs and toluene oxidizers may be relevant regarding methanotrophs it was shown that different forms of methane monooxygenase mmo can fortuitously oxidize tce nearly all characterized methanotrophs possess the particulate form of mmo pmmo while some also possess the soluble form of mmo smmo ross and rosenzweig 2017 despite its lower abundance among methanotrophs smmo has a wider substrate range than pmmo and is capable of degrading tce at a rate that is faster by an order of magnitude sullivan et al 1998 therefore mmox encoding for smmo enzyme may be a more specific functional gene marker for tce co metabolism arp et al 2001 regarding the toluene oxidizers toluene oxidation can be achieved via five different biochemical pathways differing in the position of oxygenase attack each of the pathways is catalyzed by a distinct enzyme baldwin et al 2014 cao et al 2009 from these five distinct enzymes four can co metabolize tce toluene 2 monooxygenase toluene 3 monooxygenase toluene 4 monooxygenase and toluene dioxygenase dolinová et al 2017 the presence of toluene 2 3 and 4 monooxygenase can be assessed using phe functional gene and the presence of toluene dioxygenase can assess by using tod functional gene a complementary approach for gaining direct evidence for degradation processes is by using compound specific isotope analysis csia aelion et al 2009 csia is based on the fact that bonds with lighter isotopes are normally cleaved slightly more quickly than bonds with heavy isotopes on the other hand often negligible isotope effects are evident in processes in which inner bonds remain intact such as diffusion dilution or sorption braeckevelt et al 2012 höhener et al 2012 meckenstock et al 2004 wanner and hunkeler 2015 thus isotope shifts are almost exclusively related to degradation processes consequently a direct indication of degradation can be obtained and its extent may be assessed even without the need for concentration based mass balances since kinetic isotope effects are reaction specific multi element isotope analysis is even more powerful as it may provide insight on the transformation mechanisms elsner et al 2005 for tce distinguishing between reductive dechlorination and co metabolic oxidation can theoretically be achieved using multi element 37cl and 13c isotopic effects while c cl bond cleavage in reductive dechlorination affects both elements λ 3 4 5 7 audí miró et al 2013 cretnik et al 2013 kuder et al 2013 cc bond cleavage in co metabolic oxidation will normally affect only carbon 10 9 to 38 gafni et al 2020 exceptional is co metabolic oxidation by methanotrophs which was shown to affect both carbon and chlorine to similar extents λ 1 1 1 7 gafni et al 2020 nevertheless the magnitude of carbon and chlorine isotope effects by methanotrophs is rather low thus may not have a significant mark this may lead to an underestimation of the overall co metabolic oxidation since methanotrophs contribution may be below detection the role of other co metabolic groups such as toluene oxidizers gafni et al 2020 2018 may still result in a significant mark this work aimed to identify the relevance of aerobic co metabolic degradation of tce in polluted groundwater the potential for tce co metabolic oxidation in the contaminated groundwater was assessed by enriching indigenous tce co metabolizing cultures with either toluene or methane as auxiliary substrates and by quantifying functional genes evidence for the occurrence of the process in practice was further obtained by analyzing the stable isotope composition of tce δ37cl and δ13c in the polluted groundwater in multiple sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and groundwater sampling the israeli coastal aquifer is one of the most important resources for israel s fresh water supply 23 of the fresh water supply in 2016 providing an average of 250 106 m3 annually reshef 2017a this aquifer stretches along israel s coastline up to the foothills of the carmel mountains in the north the western boundary of the aquifer forms the interface with seawater to the east the aquifer wedges towards other lithological units stratigraphically this aquifer consists of sedimentary rocks of the kurkar group which mainly comprises relatively highly permeable sands and sandstone as well as layers of lower permeability this group is underlain by inclined low permeability shale and marls the saqiya group with a maximal depth of 180 m below mean sea level in the southern coastal plain gvirtzman and reiss 1965 the majority of israel s industrial sites are located above the israeli coastal aquifer groundwater underneath these sites is routinely monitored by the israel water authority with 800 designated monitoring wells graber et al 2008 reshef 2017b tce and pce are the most frequently discovered industrial pollutants in this monitoring system sagi ben moshe et al 2015 ten sites were selected for this study in which historical tce concentrations of 50 μg l 1 were measured for site description see si none of the sites has a single contamination sources with known location and the contamination in the different sites can date decades back since the groundwater flow regime in this aquifer changes locally and periodically following changes in water abstraction and as a result of the limited number of monitoring wells in the sites no classical plumes can be drawn this does not enable to track isotope shifts along a flow line as often done in other studies e g aeppli et al 2010 in total 100 contaminated boreholes were sampled in these distinct sites groundwater was sampled using a micropurge pump operated at low flow 500 ml min 1 each well was purged prior to sampling until oxygen ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were stabilized for dna collection 2 l was sampled and placed in sterile polypropylene bottles samples were kept at 4 c until filtered 24 h after sampling and kept frozen at 80 c after filtration for isotopic analysis at least three 40 ml glass vials with teflon lined septa were sampled vials were either kept at 4 c and analyzed within two weeks from sampling or kept frozen at 20 c for longer preservation periods elsner et al 2006 2 2 microcosm experiments samples from six industrial sites a total of 34 samples were used for assessing tce co metabolic oxidation potential by either toluene oxidizers or methanotrophs for the enrichment of toluene oxidizers groundwater samples were added to a growth medium prepared as described

added to the growth medium and methane 20 ml 99 99 methane was introduced to each bottle using a syringe bottles and vials were incubated inverted in the dark at 30 c on an orbital shaker 180 rpm

geochemical data from one of the sites site t were not available thus the geochemical results of 85 wells only are presented geochemical conditions varied between the contaminated sites table s3 dissolved oxygen do values ranged from 0 1 to 5 4 mg l 1 being 1 0 mg l 1 in 44 of the samples and oxidation reduction potential orp values ranged from 264 to 270 mv electrical conductivity ec was highly variable as well ranging from 340 to 4857 μs cm 1 the ph presented a relatively narrow range of 6 3 7 7 table 1 the low do and orp values in some of the wells including most wells in site a four wells in site imi an and a single well in site e indicate the potential for reductive tce dechlorination in these specific locations 3 2 voc concentrations molar fraction of chlorinated ethylenes fig 1 and btex concentration table 2 varied between the contaminated sites tables s4 and s5 respectively tce was found in nine of the ten sites a total of 92 wells at concentrations of up to 5 104 μg l 1 in sites in which tce was not detected it was reported in historical sampling pce was found in eight out of ten sites with concentrations ranging from 3 to 1 104 μg l 1 in four of these sites pce predominated over tce implying that tce may possibly also be a product of pce reductive dehalogenation dce cis and trans isomers were detected in six sites with the cis isomer dominating in site a the average cis dce concentrations were even higher than tce and pce vc was detected in three out of the ten sites site a site e and imi na with concentrations of up to 5 102 7 103 μg l 1 the detection of cis dce and vc is a clear indicator of ongoing reductive dechlorination in sites a and imi an reductive dechlorination is also supported by the relatively low do and orp concentrations monitored table 1 in site e the monitored geochemical conditions do not support the existence of reductive dechlorination nevertheless anaerobic niches within this site that are not captured by the monitoring wells can explain the presence of these indicative transformation products btex may serve as an auxiliary substrate for tce co metabolizing bacteria and their concentrations were monitored in all sites as well in brief btex was detected in five sites only table 2 the highest btex concentrations were detected in site a with a concentration of up to 104 μg l 1 historical data unpublished data indicated the former presence of btex in sites is h is ph and is br as well however to the best of our knowledge btex is absent from sites is a is s imi rh and imi an 3 3 microcosm experiments groundwater bacteria were enriched with the selective growth medium to identify tce co metabolic oxidation potential in the aquifer groundwater from six different sites was used as an inoculum for the enrichment cultures is h is br is ph is a is s and site a table s6 no active remediation occurred in these sites prior to sampling the arbitrary criterion for a positive tce co metabolic oxidation potential was defined as a concentration decrease of 30 compared to an abiotic control in total 24 and 18 of the tested groundwater samples presented a positive degradation potential when amended with either toluene or methane respectively in five of the six sites tested at least one groundwater sample had a positive tce co metabolic oxidation potential with either toluene or methane as a carbon source an exception is a culture retrieved from site is a which failed to co metabolize tce however only one well was sampled at this site it should be noted that in the microcosm experiments a high tce concentration 5000 μg l 1 was amended which could result in a toxic effect on enzymatic activity mills et al 2018 this as well as the fact that not all bacteria can be successfully cultured under lab conditions implies that the results provided a lower boundary for co metabolic degradation potential within the examined sites samples presenting a positive degradation potential originated from diverse environments in terms of geochemical parameters and contaminant levels which does not differ from samples presenting a negative co metabolic oxidation potential the microbial potential to co metabolize tce was not correlated to the presence of btex in groundwater samples for example the two wells in site is s demonstrated a positive co metabolic potential with toluene as a carbon source although btex was not detected in this site as an opposite example only one well out of eight in site is h presented a positive co metabolic potential despite the detection of btex in this site isotope effects in tce co metabolic oxidation by groundwater enrichment cultures is reported elsewhere gafni et al 2020 3 4 functional gene quantification dna was extracted from 37 groundwater samples that were retrieved from a total of seven different sites six of them were not actively remediated is h is br is a is s and site a while the seventh site e was treated in a pilot study with the commercial kb1 reductive de chlorination culture functional genes were quantified for toluene oxidizers genes phe and tod and methanotrophs gene mmox fig 2 while mmox and phe were present in all samples tod was detected in only 78 of the samples concentration ranges were 9 102 4 108 copies l 1 for mmox 4 103 8 108 copies l 1 for the and 1 103 8 106 copies l 1 for tod it is expected that with the increase in degrader abundances the potential for in situ biodegradation will increase thouand et al 2011 in our case it may indicate whether degraders are present in sufficient quantities for oxidizing tce however there is no explicit threshold number for degraders at which tce oxidation is more likely to occur in contrast to the reductive dechlorination of tce where the dehalococcoides 16s rrna gene is a well established predictor lebrón et al 2011 functional gene thresholds for the aerobic process have only recently been examined wiedemeier et al 2017 and are less conclusive recently the relationship between the tce co metabolism rate and functional gene abundance has been thoroughly investigated in 19 microcosms retrieved from five different sites across the united states wiedemeier et al 2017 out of 19 microcosms eight presented tce co metabolism with half lives of 0 26 105 years lower oxidation rates were correlated to lower gene abundances while gene copies exceeding 106 107 and 105 copies l 1 for mmox phe and tod respectively resulted in half lives of up to 0 26 years other field studies correlating gene abundance to tce co metabolism present abundances of 105 copies l 1 for mmox and phe chiang et al 2012 paszczynski et al 2011 sadeghi and chiang 2016 and 108 copies l 1 for tod chiang et al 2012 these latter thresholds however do not provide evidence for the oxidation rate abundancies of 106 107 and 105 copies l 1 for mmox phe and tod genes were formerly correlated with high degradation rates with half lives in the order of up to single decades wiedemeier et al 2017 these abundances were determined in 25 16 and 14 wells respectively out of a total of 37 wells sampled in other studies abundances of 105 copies l 1 for mmox and tod were set as a threshold for tce co metabolism but without providing an expected rate for the process chiang et al 2012 paszczynski et al 2011 sadeghi and chiang 2016 these abundances where found in 30 and 32 wells respectively functional gene quantification in tce co metabolic oxidation suffers from the fact that these genes are ubiquitous and not explicit for tce oxidation chiang et al 2012 liang et al 2017 sadeghi and chiang 2016 wiedemeier et al 2017 former attempts to provide intrinsic bioremediation potential have shown that the same functional genes can be abundant in variable oxygen liang et al 2017 sadeghi and chiang 2016 and tce concentrations chiang et al 2012 liang et al 2017 sadeghi and chiang 2016 furthermore it was observed that the abundance of these genes in wells associated with positive or negative degradation potentials present similar abundancies chiang et al 2012 sadeghi and chiang 2016 wiedemeier et al 2017 indeed our attempts to correlate functional gene abundance with field measured geochemical parameters tce or btex concentrations yielded no significant p 0 05 and 0 01 correlations this reinforces the weakness of this methodology as a sole tool for assessing co metabolic tce oxidation in aquifers fig s1 3 5 isotope composition of tce in groundwater samples isotope analysis of tce in field samples was perform to gain evidence for aerobic co metabolic oxidation in the aquifer tce co metabolic oxidation is typically reflected by strong carbon and negligible chlorine isotope effects with the exception of methanotrophs this theoretically enables to differentiate co metabolic oxidation from reductive dechlorination as the later is accompanied by significant carbon and chlorine isotope effects see fig 3 lower panel for illustration a common stable isotope composition for industrially manufactured tce varies in a range of 4 for δ13c from 31 6 to 27 4 and in a range of 7 for δ37cl from 3 2 to 3 9 shouakar stash et al 2003 in our study the isotope composition of tce was analyzed in seven sites in which concentrations enabled the analysis fig 3 showing values that exceed the industrially manufactured tce the δ13c values ranged between 39 5 0 5 detected in is h and 4 6 0 5 detected in site t and δ37cl values ranged between 2 9 0 5 detected in site a and 4 4 0 5 detected in site e samples with more depleted δ13c values than the commercial range set earlier by shouakar stash et al shouakar stash et al 2003 were detected in five of the sites is h is a imi rh site a and site e with the most depleted value of 39 5 degradation is expected to lead to isotope enrichment and thus cannot explain these depleted values pure phase tce evaporation on the other hand is accompanied by an inverse carbon isotope effect εc between 0 24 and 0 35 huang et al 1999 jeannottat and hunkeler 2012 poulson and drever 1999 yu et al 2014 which may theoretically lead to the depleted δ13c values observed in the groundwater however evaporation is also accompanied by a normal chlorine isotope effect εcl between 1 33 and 1 6 jeannottat and hunkeler 2012 poulson and drever 1999 yu et al 2014 which is not detected in these samples depleted δ13c values were also found in other field investigations δ13c of 40 5 palau et al 2014 suggesting that the range of commercial tce is wider than estimated indeed δ13c values as low as 48 0 were determined for tce when produced from acetylene originating from methane ertl et al 1998 since the relatively depleted δ13c values were detected in variable wells it seems that the tce used in these sites had an original δ13c composition that was more depleted than formerly estimated shouakar stash et al 2003 extending the range of commercial tce δ13c down to 48 0 ertl et al 1998 covers most of the sites tested fig 3 providing no unequivocal proof for tce degradation in most of the sites only two sites exhibited isotopic enrichment that exceeds the commercial tce margins site t and site e in site t the δ13c composition of tce ranged between 29 4 and 4 6 with more enriched values being correlated to lower tce concentrations fig s3 on the other hand the δ37cl composition of tce monitored in this site was rather uniform this site was actively treated by permanganate oxidation a process that leads to a strong δ13c enrichment but no δ37cl enrichment doğan subaşı et al 2017 hunkeler et al 2003 poulson and naraoka 2002 the δ13c composition of tce enabled in this case the evaluation of the treatment s effectiveness in the monitored wells presenting up to 60 oxidation in the wells sampled table s7 in site e one out of 34 wells sampled provided isotopic evidence for biodegradation this well well h4 presented the most enriched δ13c and δ37cl values in this site 26 4 and 4 4 respectively although not exceeding the range for commercial tce composition ertl et al 1998 shouakar stash et al 2003 this relative enrichment can be related to the field test treatment using the kb1 culture which took place in a limited area within this site the kb1 treatment presented a 90 tce concentration decrease in the vicinity of this well s1 13 which theoretically should lead to an enriched carbon isotope composition of up to 0 5 assuming an initial δ13c0 32 3 and an enrichment factor ε of 13 8 slater et al 2001 nevertheless in the three years that passed between treatment and sampling plume transport mixing with fresh tce and possibly also the dissolution of pure tce entrapped in the porous media have likely occurred and diminished this effect the lack of evidence for degradation was most surprising for site imi an in which a high abundance of anaerobic transformation products was detected mostly cis dce but also vc fig 1 the narrow range of δ13c and δ37cl compositions monitored for tce in this site is related to the extensive pumping that took place in this site from 2014 to 2015 leading to a decrease in tce concentrations sagi ben moshe et al 2015 it is possible that the isotope composition of tce in this site was influenced by the dissolution of tce held in ganglia within the porous media or by mixing with other tce sources both driven by the extensive pumping similarly geochemical parameters at site a suggest that tce might have followed reductive dechlorination indeed a clear isotope enrichment trendline is observed in this site however this trendline remains within the margins of commercial tce it should be noted that co contamination of pce was found in sites a and imi an implying tce might have been formed as a degradation product hence the isotopic signature of tce may not only be related to its commercial composition but also influenced by its possible continuous formation from pce despite the aerobic conditions in most of the sites despite the positive potential for co metabolic oxidation in some of the wells and despite the high abundance of functional genes for tce co metabolic oxidation no isotopic evidence for the occurrence of the process in groundwater was obtained this observation may be explained by the fact that no single source is defined in any of the sites and a wide range of commercial tce has to be considered the isotope composition of commercially produced tce is characterized by a very wide composition range δ13c spanning over 20 from 48 0 to 27 4 ertl et al 1998 shouakar stash et al 2003 in practice if a tce source is characterized by a δ13c of 48 0 co metabolic oxidation of 85 must take place by toluene oxidizers before it can be detected assuming εc 11 5 clingenpeel et al 2012 gafni et al 2018 with the low isotope effect accompanying tce co metabolism by methanotrophs chu et al 2004 gafni et al 2018 their contribution cannot even be considered in this scenario one example in which co metabolic oxidation might have occurred but could not be verified is in the industrial site is h here δ13c values spanned over a 10 range from 39 5 to 29 7 while most δ37cl values were not significantly different in this site i aerobic conditions prevail ii a btex co contamination exists iii a high abundance of the phe gene was determined and iv a positive biodegradation potential was identified in microcosms all of this evidence indicates that co metabolic oxidation of tce might have occurred nevertheless we cannot rule out the possibility that the wide δ13c range detected in this site is the result of several isotopically distinct sources 4 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the importance of tce co metabolic oxidation in contaminated sites along the israeli costal aquifer tools determining the potential occurrence of the process provided positive indications most sites are oxic and btex co contamination was observed in some microcosm experiments indicated the presence of indigenous bacteria able to co metabolize tce with methane or toluene as auxiliary substrates finally a high abundance of relevant functional genes of methane or toluene oxidizers was determined in some of the sites though more work is needed to determine gene copy threshold numbers indicative for the process despite the positive indications no proof was gained that tce co metabolic oxidation occurs in practice in the sites tested the very wide δ13c range possible for tce sources hinders the ability to detect processes that lead to isotope shifts of only a few permils

18212,despite plenty of literatures focused on the application of pre ozonation prior to membrane it was still unclear about the role of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 in reverse osmosis ro membrane fouling mitigation in this study ozone pre treatment 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc dissolved organic carbon was employed to oxidize model biopolymer which was represented by bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa in the presence of ca2 and mg2 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 mm cross flow filtration was conducted to investigate ro membrane fouling by concentration mode the results showed that at appropriate ozone dose there were measurable changes in physicochemical properties of bsa and sa including increases in particle size hydrophilicity density of negative charge and carboxylic groups pre ozonation markedly alleviated ro fouling by bsa at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc when ca2 and mg2 concentrations raised from 0 5 to 2 0 mm since the increase in electrostatic el repulsion and decrease in hydrophobic hp interaction compensated the increase in divalent cation bridging similar results were obtained for sa fouling in the presence of mg2 in contrast the effect of pre ozonation on sa fouling strongly depended on the concentration of ca2 in brief it mitigated sa fouling at 0 5 mm ca2 whereas accelerated irreversible fouling at higher ca2 concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mm due to the overwhelming effect of divalent cation bridging compared to el and hp interactions as revealed by adsorption experiments in situ streaming potential measurement pre ozonation shifted the fouling layer from compact to porous and weakened the adhesion forces between foulants and membrane foulants except for sa containing 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 this study may provide the guidance for the application

the impact of pre ozonation on ro membrane fouling when divalent cations are present it was reported that more ionisable groups e g carboxyl groups in organics generated after ozone oxidation seidel

treatment of landfill leachate brown et al 2008 also concluded that ozone oxidation at high dose enhanced ro membrane fouling resistance they all attributed the negative impact of pre ozonation to the increased particle size of organic matter due to the coagulation of organic matter and divalent cations chandrakanth and amy 1996 in contrast several studies showed that pre ozonation mitigated ro fouling for filtration of surface water and secondary effluent se containing ca2 and mg2 brown et al 2008 stanford et al 2011 wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 found ozone broke the calcium humic acid complexes and alleviated ro fouling the opposite results were probably because of the different solution chemistries and oxidation conditions such as the species and concentration of divalent cations and organics and ozone doses the aim of this project was to offer deep insights into the roles of ca2 and mg2 in pre ozonation for the control of reverse osmosis ro membrane fouling by biopolymer

dose on ro fouling by bsa was investigated in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 as illustrated in fig 1 a the permeate flux reduced slightly by approximately 10 before 300 min but following by dramatic flux decline i e 47 at the second fouling stage 300 700 min for filtration of bsa ca2 without pre ozonation compared to ca2 mg2 led to less bsa fouling with flux loss of approximately 39 as illustrated in fig 1b which was in agreement with the results from previous literature mo et al 2008 and attributed to its weaker bridging affinity with carboxylic groups in bsa molecules li and elimelech 2004 pre ozonation reduced flux decline for bsa filtration with increasing ozone doses in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 it is learned from fig 1 that the flux loss remarkably decreased to 32 and 15 for bsa ca2 and 26 and 11 for bsa mg2 at ozone doses of 0 10 and 0 25 mg o3 mg doc respectively interestingly when ozone dose was up to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc a higher rate of initial fouling took place following by an equilibrium stage without flux decline the severe initial fouling was likely due to the easier deposition of large bsa aggregates on membrane surface kelly and zydney 1995 resulting from the aggregation and cross linking kelly and zydney 1994 it was worth to note that we did not observe this phenomenon at lower ozone dose although aggregation also occurred fig 5a and b suggesting that severe initial fouling only took place when aggregation reached a critical level moreover the bsa aggregates may act as a secondary membrane and detain smaller particles kuberkar and davis 2000 which further prevented the formation of dense fouling layer and flux decline at the second fouling stage accordingly the fouling layer morphology would be observed and discussed using sem images hereinafter in order to assess the affinity of foulants with membrane surface the effect of pre ozonation on membrane fouling reversibility was investigated reversible and irreversible fouling resistances were 0 158 1013 m 1 and 2 44 1013 m 1 for bsa ca2 fig 2a and 0 928 1013 m 1 and 2 06 1013 m 1 for bsa mg2 fig 2b without pre ozonation respectively revealing that bsa fouling was mainly irreversible and ca2 caused more severe irreversible fouling than mg2 similar to flux recovery ozone oxidation at low dose of 0 10 mg o3 mg doc also negligibly reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistance nevertheless ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc decreased irreversible fouling resistances by approximately 38 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 there was no obvious decline of fouling resistance or flux loss when ozone dose further increased to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc in addition we studied the effect of divalent cation concentrations on pre ozonation for mitigation of bsa fouling at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc similar to 0 5 mm divalent cation it also substantially mitigated bsa fouling in the presence of higher divalent cation concentrations when ca2 concentrations increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm pre ozonation dropped flux loss by 36 5 and 36 6 fig s4a in si and irreversible fouling by 48 7 and 45 4 respectively fig s5a in si in a similar manner flux recovery was 22 3 and 41 8 fig s4b in si and irreversible fouling reduction was 47 1 and 39 9 fig s5b in si at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 after ozone oxidation respectively 3 1 2 sa fouling unlike bsa a more severe membrane fouling took place at the initial filtration stage 300 min with flux loss of approximately 37 0 for filtration of sa containing 0 5 mm ca2 without pre ozonation following by a second stage 300 700 min with a slower fouling rate and overall flux loss of 54 as illustrated in fig 3a on the contrary we learned from fig 3b that normalized flux declined slowly and still reached 0 81 after 700 min in the presence of 0 5 mm mg2 as illustrated in fig 4 reversible and irreversible fouling resistances were 0 52 1013 m 1 and 3 50 1013 m 1 for sa ca2 and 0 17 1013 m 1 and 1 47 1013 m 1 for sa mg2 respectively similar to bsa sa mainly caused irreversible fouling i e ratio was larger than 80 the results of both flux and fouling resistance suggested that the presence of ca2 resulted in more severe sa fouling than mg2 lee et al lee and elimelech 2006 attributed this phenomenon to the stronger adhesion force between sa and ca2 in contrast to significant mitigation of bsa fouling pre ozonation only promoted flux recovery by 2 8 fig 3 while reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistance fig 4 for filtration of sa in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 with increasing ozone doses reductions of irreversible fouling resistances were 27 5 and 44 4 for sa ca2 and 9 3 and 35 3 for sa mg2 at ozone dose of 0 10 and 0 25 mg o3 mg doc respectively when ozone dose further increased to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc instead irreversible fouling resistances reduced by 20 2 and 20 8 in the presence of ca2 and mg2 respectively which were lower than those at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc therefore optimal fouling mitigation of bsa and sa achieved at appropriate ozone dose rather than under or over dosing the more severe sa fouling occurred with flux loss of as high as 68 7 and 73 9 at 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 fig s4c in si and 25 5 and 31 4 at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 fig s4d in si respectively meanwhile irreversible fouling resistances markedly accelerated to 4 21 1013 m 1 and 6 66 1013 m 1 for filtration of sa at 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 fig s5c in si respectively while they increased negligibly at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 fig s5d in si on the other hand pre ozonation negligibly increased flux recovery for filtration of sa fig s4c in si but accelerated irreversible fouling resistances by 28 9 and 3 72 figs s5c and si in the presence of 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 respectively in contrast to ca2 pre ozonation effectively mitigated sa fouling at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 figs s4d and s5d in si including flux recovery of 13 4 and 12 2 and irreversible fouling reduction of 23 4 and 28 6 respectively in summary when divalent cation concentrations increased from 0 5 to 1 0 and 2 0 mm pre ozonation was still efficient to mitigate ro fouling by bsa containing ca2 or mg2 and sa containing mg2 on the contrary irreversible fouling reversed from mitigation to aggravation accompanied with negligible flux recovery for filtration of sa containing ca2 3 2 effect of pre ozonation on physicochemical properties of foulants 3 2 1 size plenty of previous works suggested that size of foulants was a major factor influencing pre ozonation for control of ultrafiltration uf cheng et al 2016 yu et al 2017 2018 nanofiltration nf singh et al 2014 yu et al 2018 and ro brown et al 2008 singh et al 2014 membrane fouling consequently we looked into the size variations of bsa and sa containing 0 5 mm of divalent cations as shown in fig 5 the peak values of bsa in size distribution curve were approximately 5 6 nm while larger sa molecules were observed with approximately 31 nm and 25 nm in the presence of ca2 and mg2 respectively pre ozonation caused larger size of bsa and sa particles with increasing ozone doses attributing to the aggregation and cross linking of foulants listiarini et al 2011 yu et al 2017 moreover it was proposed that the organic matter with higher molecule mass or larger size was favor to accumulate on membrane surface due to a slower back diffusion rate of foulants van geluwe et al 2011a 2011b the aggregation of bsa and sa might be disadvantageous to membrane fouling mitigation however it is presented clearly in figs 1 and 3 that pre ozonation increased rather than decreased the permeate flux moreover fouling layer became more porous after pre ozonation regardless of larger foulants deposition which would be discussed by sem images in section 3 5 1 in addition although size of sa molecules sharply increased in both cases of ca2 and mg2 after pre ozonation their membrane fouling behavior was quite different therefore unlike previous literatures we proposed that the size variation of foulants was not a dominant factor influencing pre ozonation for ro membrane fouling mitigation likely due to the different feed water compositions 3 2 2 potentiometric titration carboxylic acidity generally ca2 and mg2 ions bound with the carboxyl groups in organic matter and resulted in severe membrane fouling arkhangelsky et al 2012 thus it was necessary to understand the effect of pre ozonation on the amount of carboxyl groups in bsa and sa which was measured by potentiometric titration using 0 1 m naoh acidity up to ph 8 0 in the titration curves was due to the deprotonation of carboxyl groups while acidity at higher ph was attributed to the phenolic groups collins et al 1986 it was learned from fig 6 that acidity of bsa and sa before pre ozonation sharply increased to 3 40 and 7 21 meq g at ph of 4 0 respectively and then it nearly remained constant at higher phs consequently carboxylic groups predominated on bsa and sa compared to phenolic groups and sa possessed more carboxylic groups than bsa in addition pre ozonation markedly raised the carboxylic acidity of bsa to 5 50 6 64 and 7 24 meq g while those of sa slightly increased to 7 80 7 81 and 8 13 meq g at ozone doses of 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc respectively since carboxylic groups could act as ligand sites to complex with ca2 and mg2 al amoudi 2010 cruz silva et al 2019 pre ozonation enhanced the bridging action between model biopolymer and membrane which might aggravate membrane fouling zhu et al 2010 however as mentioned above pre ozonation reduced membrane fouling by all foulants except for sa in the presence of 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 consequently there were also other factors influencing membrane fouling which would be discussed later 3 2 3 zeta potential the zeta potentials of foulants were investigated since they influenced the electrostatic el interaction between foulants and membrane and further affected membrane fouling liu et al 2018 before pre ozonation zeta potentials of bsa were 7 98 and 14 3 mv while these of sa were 12 8 and 23 7 mv at ph 7 0 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 and mg2 respectively as depicted in fig 7 obviously bsa and sa possessed lower negative charge in the presence of ca2 than that of mg2 since ca2 had stronger complexation and charge neutralization ability with the carboxylic groups adusei gyamfi et al 2019 in addition compared to bsa the more negative charge of sa was due to the higher amount of carboxylic groups fig 6 fig 7 presented that pre ozonation decreased the zeta potentials of all foulants with increasing ozone doses this phenomenon implied that foulants were more negative after ozone oxidation attributing to the generation of carboxylic groups fig 6 it is worth to note that the charge of ro membrane surface was also negative at ph 7 0 fig s6 in si consequently pre ozonation resulted in stronger electrostatic el repulsion between model biopolymer and membrane especially in the presence of mg2 which was conductive to mitigate membrane fouling however effect of ozone oxidation on bsa and sa fouling was different when ca2 and mg2 were present moreover since the ionic strength increased with filtration time el interaction weakened at the second fouling stage due to the decreased debye length tang et al 2011 thus single el repulsion was probably insufficient to explain fouling mechanism 3 2 4 hydrophilic hydrophobic properties it is well known that hydrophilic fraction has a lower fouling potential than hydrophobic one due to the weaker hydrophobic hp interaction between foulants and membrane van geluwe et al 2011a therefore we also studied the hydrophilic hydrophobic properties of foulants before and after pre ozonation bsa and sa were fractionated without ca2 and mg2 since divalent cations would deposit under alkaline conditions during resin fractionation as one can observe in fig 8 before pre ozonation hpi hpo and tpi fractions accounted for 7 3 56 7 and 36 0 in bsa and 27 1 33 7 and 39 2 in sa respectively indicating bsa was much more hydrophobic than sa low ozone dose of 0 10 mg o3 mg doc marginally changed the hydrophilicity of bsa and sa when ozone doses reached 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc the relative amount of hpi fraction enhanced by 10 9 and 13 6 in bsa in company with the decrease in hpo fraction by 6 0 and 11 6 as illustrated in fig 8a respectively as regarding sa hpi fraction only increased by 6 1 and 9 8 accompanied with the decrease in hpo fraction by 3 4 and 5 3 at ozone doses of 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc respectively fig 8b obviously pre ozonation reduced the hydrophobicity of bsa and sa further weakened the hp attraction between foulants and membrane 3 3 effect of pre ozonation on adsorption of foulants on membrane surface the adsorption of foulants on membrane surface reflected the fouling behavior liu et al 2018 which was also influenced by electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interaction and bridging action of divalent cations therefore it was investigated by in situ streaming potential measurement to explore foulants membrane and foulants foulants interactions before and after pre ozonation which was related to the initial fouling and the followed fouling stage where membrane was fully covered by foulants respectively she et al 2016 taimur khan et al 2010 the higher variation of streaming current on adsorption curves reflected more deposition or adsorption capacity of foulants on membrane the faster adsorption rate implied the stronger adhesion force between foulants and membrane liu et al 2018 muff et al 2018 3 3 1 adsorption of foulants on pristine membrane firstly we investigated the effect of ozone dose on adsorption of bsa and sa in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 before pre ozonation ca2 caused higher variation of streaming current and more deposition of bsa and sa on membrane surface than mg2 due to its stronger bridging and neutralization ability with model biopolymer as depicted in fig 9 resulting in more severe model biopolymer fouling of ro membrane in the presence of ca2 than mg2 figs 1 4 pre ozonation negligibly lowered the initial adsorption rate for all foulants which was in line with the similar initial fouling rate at different ozone doses as seen in figs 1 and 3 nevertheless the deposition of all foulants on membrane surface reduced with increasing ozone doses fig 9 adsorption curves of foulants changed negligibly at low ozone dose of 0 10 mg o3 mg doc when increasing ozone dose to 0 25 mg o3 mg doc streaming current of membrane dropped from 16 9 na to 18 2 na for adsorption of bsa ca2 and from 14 8 na to 16 4 na for bsa mg2 after approximately 1700 s of adsorption time in contrast streaming current only decreased from 15 4 na to 16 0 na for sa ca2 and from 19 6 na to 19 9 na for sa mg2 at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc obviously pre ozonation preferred to reduce the adsorbability of bsa on membrane surface compared to sa and mitigated bsa fouling more effectively figs 1 4 no obvious reduction of streaming current was observed if ozone dose further increased to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc it was worth to note that mg2 caused low deposition of sa before and after pre ozonation which was in line with less sa fouling in the presence of 0 5 mm mg2 figs 3b and 4b as illustrated in fig s7a in si when calcium concentration increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm adsorption rate of sa on membrane surface became faster after pre ozonation implying the stronger adhesion force between foulants and membrane which led to severe irreversible fouling fig s5c in si in contrast pre ozonation still lowered adhesion force of bsa membrane at 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 mg2 and sa membrane at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 data not shown and further reduced irreversible fouling fig s5 in si 3 3 2 adsorption of foulants on fouled membrane the adsorption of foulants on the fouled membrane was used to investigate the role of ca2 and mg2 in foulants foulants interactions before and after pre ozonation at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc due to its optimal fouling control as observed in fig 10 ca2 0 5 mm resulted in faster adsorption rate and more deposition of bsa and sa on fouled membrane than mg2 0 5 mm suggesting that calcium caused stronger adhesion force between foulants and foulants as pre ozonation was applied to oxidize biopolymer solutions streaming currents of fouled membrane reduced from 3 09 na to 5 10 na for bsa ca2 and from 4 22 na to 5 56 na for bsa mg2 after 1800 s of adsorption time similarly for adsorption of sa they also dropped from 14 7 na to 15 3 na at 0 5 mm ca2 and from 17 6 na to 18 8 na at 0 5 mm mg2 therefore pre ozonation weakened the adhesion force of foulants foulants in the presence of low concentration of divalent cation moreover the adsorption rate of sa was slow in the presence of mg2 with and without pre ozonation thus mg2 resulted in weak sa sa interaction and less membrane fouling figs 3 and 4 however pre ozonation accelerated adsorption rate of sa by 1 33 and 2 22 times when ca2 concentration increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm fig s7b in si indicating the stronger adhesion force between foulants and foulants which caused more serious membrane fouling figs 3 and 4 in summary adsorption experiments were well consistent with bsa and sa fouling in the presence of ca2 and mg2 before and after pre ozonation we proposed in situ streaming potential measurement may be an ideal and advanced method to predict ro membrane fouling due to its easy operation relative fast analysis and similar experimental conditions with cross flow membrane filtration under a constant pressure 3 4 fouling mechanism it is generally accepted that liftshitz van der walls lw lewis acid base ab and electrostatic el interactions between foulants and membrane influenced membrane fouling in terms of extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory liu et al 2017 the combined lw and ab interactions could be considered as hydrophobic interactions therefore they were simplified to el and hydrophobic hp interactions for ro membrane fouling by biopolymer yin et al 2020 van oss et al 1986 however when ca2 and mg2 were present the biopolymer can also be adsorbed on membrane surface via bridging action of divalent cation li et al 2011 thus membrane fouling should be governed by the synergy among el repulsion hp attraction and divalent cation bridging the schematic diagram of fouling mechanism was illustrated in fig 11 it is learned from section 3 2 that pre ozonation reduced the zeta potential and hydrophobicity of bsa and sa in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 therefore el repulsion increased and hp attraction decreased between foulants and membrane with the increasing ozone doses which was conductive to fouling mitigation besides ozone oxidation generated more carboxylic groups in bsa and sa at higher ozone dose fig 6 and enhanced the bridging action of divalent cations which was detrimental to fouling alleviation the results of adsorption experiment suggested pre ozonation weakened the adhesion forces of foulants membrane and foulants foulants figs 9 and 10 thus the reduced membrane fouling after pre ozonation figs 1 4 was probably due to the overwhelming effect of el and hp interactions compared to divalent cation bridging however if ozone dose was too high 0 5 mg o3 mg doc zeta potential and hydrophobicity of bsa and sa decreased slightly while the divalent cation bridging still enhanced thus it resulted in negligible mitigation of bsa fouling or even more severe irreversible sa fouling at ozone dose of 0 50 mg o3 mg doc compared to those at 0 25 mg o3 mg doc figs 1 4 when the divalent cation concentrations increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm it is reasonable to assume that the divalent cation bridging enhanced accordingly however pre ozonation still mitigated ro fouling by bsa ca2 mg2 and sa mg2 figs s4 and s5 in si since the negative effect of bridging action was compensated by the positive impact of el and hp interactions in contrast the more serious irreversible fouling was observed for filtration of sa ca2 after pre ozonation fig s5c in si this phenomenon can be explained by the following two aspects firstly sa possessed more carboxylic groups than bsa after pre ozonation fig 6 which induced stronger bridging action of divalent cation with sa than bsa meanwhile ca2 had a stronger binding ability with carboxylic groups than mg2 adusei gyamfi et al 2019 as a result the bridging action of ca2 between sa and membrane was strongest after pre ozonation secondly unlike bsa ca2 bridging with sa could form cross linked gel in terms of the egg box model grant et al 1973 as revealed by sem graphs fig 13 fig s8 in si and resulted in severe polysaccharides fouling lee and elimelech 2006 likewise ca2 bridging between sa and membrane enhanced due to the fact that pre ozonation increased the amount of carboxylic groups in sa and the cross linking between ca2 and sa therefore the bridging action of divalent cation play a key role in fouling mechanism rather than el and hp interactions for filtration of sa in the high concentration of ca2 further induced stronger adhesion forces of foulants membrane and foulants foulants fig s7 in si and more serious irreversible fouling after pre ozonation fig s5c in si 3 5 fouling layer autopsy 3 5 1 fouling layer morphology we employed sem to investigate the surface structure and morphology of fouled membrane before and after pre ozonation as seen in figs 12 and 13 membrane surface was covered by foulants and formed a compact fouling layer for filtration of bsa and sa containing 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 in addition sa caused denser and smoother fouling layer compared to bsa especially in the presence of ca2 which was in line with the more severe flux decline figs 1 4 it is learned from figs 12 and 13 that larger complexes of biopolymer divalent cations deposited on membrane surface after pre ozonation due to the aggregation and cross linking of foulants moreover compactness of fouling layer reduced with increasing ozone doses for filtration of bsa ca2 mg2 fig 12 and sa mg2 fig 13 which caused lower filtration resistance along with more flux recovery figs 1 and 3 a possible reason was the aggregation of smaller foulants into larger aggregates fig 5 due to oxidation which the former preferentially deposited on the valleys of membrane surface thus caused valley clogging and dense fouling layer yin et al 2017 in contrast for filtration of sa after pre ozonation the compactness of fouling layer reduced slightly in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 fig 13b d while even enhanced at 1 0 and 2 0 mm calcium fig s8 in si since cross linking of calcium with sa induced the formation of cross linked gel on membrane surface sem graphs suggested pre ozonation markedly lowered filtration resistances for model biopolymer containing divalent cations except for sa ca2 which was in agreement with the filtration experiments figs 1 and 3 fig s4 in si 3 5 2 atr ftir atr ftir was applied to characterize functional groups in fouling layer fig 14 a showed that pristine ro appeared as a standard polyamide pa membrane three peaks at 1660 1588 and 1487 cm 1 were associated to the stretching vibration of co amide i c n h amide ii and c n amide iii respectively park et al 2017 after fouled by bsa at 0 5 mm ca2 and mg2 their intensities markedly weakened as illustrated in fig 14 a and b while three new peaks appeared at 3300 1645 and 1536 cm 1 in ftir graphs attributed to the stretching vibration of oh asymmetry and symmetry stretching vibration of coo in bsa naidja et al 2002 respectively as regarding membrane fouled by sa at 0 5 mm ca2 there were three peaks at around 1020 1588 and 1410 cm 1 assigned to the stretching vibration of c o gómez ordóñez and rupérez 2011 asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylate o c o and deformation vibration of c oh in sa gómez ordóñez and rupérez 2011 leal et al 2008 as illustrated fig 13c respectively we learned from fig 14 that pre ozonation markedly weakened the peaks intensity of bsa in fouling layer but negligibly attenuated those of sa with all ozone doses 0 10 0 50 mg o3 mg doc when 0 5 mm ca2 and mg2 were present which was consistent with more efficient bsa fouling mitigation compared to sa besides intensities of sa were both weak in the presence of mg2 with and without pre ozonation fig 14d implying the lower foulants deposition on membrane surface and less membrane fouling as calcium concentration increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm intensity of sa in fouling layer became stronger after pre ozonation as depicted in fig s9 in si which was in line with the more severe membrane fouling fig s5c in si 4 conclusions for the first time this study investigated the role of ca2 and mg2 in pre ozonation for the mitigation of ro membrane fouling including flux decline and fouling reversibility by model biopolymer bsa and sa we concluded that the following results might partially explain the controversial impact of pre ozonation on membrane fouling control 1 pre ozonation changed the physicochemical properties of bsa and sa as indicated by the increased negative charge particle sizes carboxylic acidity and hydrophilicity 2 fouling mitigation became more effective with increasing ozone doses but high ozone dose 0 5 mg o3 mg doc caused more serious initial ro fouling by bsa and irreversible ro fouling by sa when 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 was present 3 pre ozonation markedly mitigated ro fouling by bsa even if 0 5 2 0 mm ca2 or mg2 were present since the increase in electrostatic el repulsion and decrease in hydrophobic hp interaction compensated the increase in divalent cation bridging however the impact of pre ozonation on ro fouling by sa was quite different in the presence of ca2 and mg2 sa fouling mitigated at 0 5 2 0 mm mg2 and low ca2 concentration 0 5 mm while flux recovery increased negligibly and irreversible fouling accelerated at higher ca2 concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mm attributing to overwhelming effect of divalent cation bridging compared to el and hp interactions 4 the adsorption experiment well predicted ro membrane fouling behavior by in situ streaming potential measurement pre ozonation weakened adhesion forces between model biopolymer and membrane model biopolymer in the presence of ca2 and mg2 except for sa containing high ca2 concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18212,despite plenty of literatures focused on the application of pre ozonation prior to membrane it was still unclear about the role of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 in reverse osmosis ro membrane fouling mitigation in this study ozone pre treatment 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc dissolved organic carbon was employed to oxidize model biopolymer which was represented by bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa in the presence of ca2 and mg2 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 mm cross flow filtration was conducted to investigate ro membrane fouling by concentration mode the results showed that at appropriate ozone dose there were measurable changes in physicochemical properties of bsa and sa including increases in particle size hydrophilicity density of negative charge and carboxylic groups pre ozonation markedly alleviated ro fouling by bsa at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc when ca2 and mg2 concentrations raised from 0 5 to 2 0 mm since the increase in electrostatic el repulsion and decrease in hydrophobic hp interaction compensated the increase in divalent cation bridging similar results were obtained for sa fouling in the presence of mg2 in contrast the effect of pre ozonation on sa fouling strongly depended on the concentration of ca2 in brief it mitigated sa fouling at 0 5 mm ca2 whereas accelerated irreversible fouling at higher ca2 concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mm due to the overwhelming effect of divalent cation bridging compared to el and hp interactions as revealed by adsorption experiments in situ streaming potential measurement pre ozonation shifted the fouling layer from compact to porous and weakened the adhesion forces between foulants and membrane foulants except for sa containing 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 this study may provide the guidance for the application of pre ozonation prior to ro filtration graphical abstract image 1 keywords biopolymer reverse osmosis calcium magnesium pre ozonation membrane fouling 1 introduction biopolymer in effluent organic

alginates by ca2 bridging egg box structure grant et al 1973 lee and elimelech 2006 zhang et al 2018 our latest work yin et al 2020 suggested that pre ozonation was effective to mitigate ro fouling by model biopolymer bovine serum albumin and alginate in the absence of divalent cations which governed by electrostatic el and hydrophobic hp interactions however it is still a controversial issue about the impact of pre ozonation on ro membrane fouling when divalent cations are present it was reported that more ionisable groups e g carboxyl groups in organics generated after ozone oxidation seidel and elimelech 2002 and precipitated with divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 which could exacerbate membrane fouling xue et al 2016 singh et al 2014 observed that pre ozonation aggravated ro fouling for treatment of landfill leachate brown et al 2008 also concluded that ozone oxidation at high dose enhanced ro membrane fouling resistance they all attributed the negative impact of pre ozonation to the increased particle size of organic matter due to the coagulation of organic matter and divalent cations chandrakanth and amy 1996 in contrast several studies showed that pre ozonation mitigated ro fouling for filtration of surface water and secondary effluent se containing ca2 and mg2 brown et al 2008 stanford et al 2011 wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 found ozone broke the calcium humic acid complexes and alleviated ro fouling the opposite results were probably because of the different solution chemistries and oxidation conditions such as the species and concentration of divalent cations and organics and ozone doses the aim of this project was to offer deep insights into the roles of ca2 and mg2 in pre ozonation for the control of reverse osmosis ro membrane fouling by biopolymer which was represented by bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa we examined the effect of ozone dose and divalent cation concentrations on membrane fouling control to explore underlying membrane fouling mechanism the physicochemical properties of bsa and sa were analyzed including size zeta potential hydrophilic hydrophobic properties and carboxylic acidity titration furthermore the adsorption of foulants on pristine and fouled membrane surface was applied to study the foulants membrane and foulants foulants interactions by in situ streaming potential measurement respectively

dissolved organic carbon which were adjusted by dosing time and calculated by eq s 1 in si according to the method of yu et al 2017 to protect ro membrane from oxidative degradation the residue ozone in feed water which was determined by indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 was removed completely by high purity nitrogen 99 99 for 30 min xue et al 2016 after pre ozonation the ph of biopolymer solutions decreased with increasing ozone doses as illustrated in fig s2 in si therefore the ph of ozonated solutions was all adjusted to 7 0 by 0 1 m naoh prior to pump into membrane apparatus 2 3 ro

all organic solutions were filtered by 0 45 μm mixed cellulose mce filter merck millipore usa zeta potential and particle size of bsa and sa ph 7 0 were measured by a zeta sizer instrument nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd uk bsa and sa were fractionated to hydrophilic organic matter hpi transphilic organic matter tpi weak hydrophobic and hydrophobic organic matter hpo by xad 4 sigma usa and xad 8 rohm and haas usa resins according to the method of reference yamamura et al 2014 yu et al 2016 as described in si fig s3 the amounts of carboxylic groups in bsa and sa were determined by potentiometric titration g20 mettler toledo switzerland equipped with a ph electrode dg115 sc using dynamic mode of titration as described in elsewhere ang and elimelech 2007 2 5 adsorption experiment the adsorption of foulants on pristine and fouled membrane was conducted to investigate foulants membrane and foulants foulants interactions by a streaming potential analyzer surpass 3 anton paar austria respectively detailed operation and adsorption mechanism had been introduced in our previous work yin et al 2020 firstly the gap height between two ro membranes 20 mm 10 mm was adjusted to 100 μm then adsorption of bsa and sa 100 mg l solutions containing 0 5 2 0 mm ca2 or mg2 ph 7 0 was measured by recording the streaming current of ro membrane surface as a function of adsorption time in a target pressure of 300 mbar supplied by nitrogen gas 99 99 to study the foulants foulants interaction firstly membrane filtration was conducted under the identical condition with that of fouling experiments i e tmp was 1 mpa flow rate was 0 1 m s filtration time was 700 min to ensure that pristine membrane was fully covered by foulants then adsorption of foulants on fouled membrane was performed as mentioned above 2 6 membrane autopsy membrane morphology was observed by a scanning electron microscope sem s 3400n ii hitachi japan after sputtered with gold under more than five random regions the functional groups in fouling layer were determined by attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir nexus 870 nicolet usa equipped with an atr diamond crystal which recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 and averaged for 64 scans at 4 cm 1 resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux curves and fouling reversibility 3 1 1 bsa fouling the impact of ozone dose on ro fouling by bsa was investigated in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 as illustrated in fig 1 a the permeate flux reduced slightly by approximately 10 before 300 min but following by dramatic flux decline i e 47 at the second fouling stage 300 700 min for filtration of bsa ca2 without pre ozonation compared to ca2 mg2 led to less bsa fouling with flux loss of approximately 39 as illustrated in fig 1b which was in agreement with the results from previous literature mo et al 2008 and attributed to its weaker bridging affinity with carboxylic groups in bsa molecules li and elimelech 2004 pre ozonation reduced flux decline for bsa filtration with increasing ozone doses in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 it is learned from fig 1 that the flux loss remarkably decreased to 32 and 15 for bsa ca2 and 26 and 11 for bsa mg2 at ozone doses of 0 10 and 0 25 mg o3 mg doc respectively interestingly when ozone dose was up to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc a higher rate of initial fouling took place following by an equilibrium stage without flux decline the severe initial fouling was likely due to the easier deposition of large bsa aggregates on membrane surface kelly and zydney 1995 resulting from the aggregation and cross linking kelly and zydney 1994 it was worth to note that we did not observe this phenomenon at lower ozone dose although aggregation also occurred fig 5a and b suggesting that severe initial fouling only took place when aggregation reached a critical level moreover the bsa aggregates may act as a secondary membrane and detain smaller particles kuberkar and davis 2000 which further prevented the formation of dense fouling layer and flux decline at the second fouling stage accordingly the fouling layer morphology would be observed and discussed using sem images hereinafter in order to assess the affinity of foulants with membrane surface the effect of pre ozonation on membrane fouling reversibility was investigated reversible and irreversible fouling resistances were 0 158 1013 m 1 and 2 44 1013 m 1 for bsa ca2 fig 2a and 0 928 1013 m 1 and 2 06 1013 m 1 for bsa mg2 fig 2b without pre ozonation respectively revealing that bsa fouling was mainly irreversible and ca2 caused more severe irreversible fouling than mg2 similar to flux recovery ozone oxidation at low dose of 0 10 mg o3 mg doc also negligibly reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistance nevertheless ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc decreased irreversible fouling resistances by approximately 38 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 there was no obvious decline of fouling resistance or flux loss when ozone dose further increased to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc in addition we studied the effect of divalent cation concentrations on pre ozonation for mitigation of bsa fouling at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc similar to 0 5 mm divalent cation it also substantially mitigated bsa fouling in the presence of higher divalent cation concentrations when ca2 concentrations increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm pre ozonation dropped flux loss by 36 5 and 36 6 fig s4a in si and irreversible fouling by 48 7 and 45 4 respectively fig s5a in si in a similar manner flux recovery was 22 3 and 41 8 fig s4b in si and irreversible fouling reduction was 47 1 and 39 9 fig s5b in si at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 after ozone oxidation respectively 3 1 2 sa fouling unlike bsa a more severe membrane fouling took place at the initial filtration stage 300 min with flux loss of approximately 37 0 for filtration of sa containing 0 5 mm ca2 without pre ozonation following by a second stage 300 700 min with a slower fouling rate and overall flux loss of 54 as illustrated in fig 3a on the contrary we learned from fig 3b that normalized flux declined slowly and still reached 0 81 after 700 min in the presence of 0 5 mm mg2 as illustrated in fig 4 reversible and irreversible fouling resistances were 0 52 1013 m 1 and 3 50 1013 m 1 for sa ca2 and 0 17 1013 m 1 and 1 47 1013 m 1 for sa mg2 respectively similar to bsa sa mainly caused irreversible fouling i e ratio was larger than 80 the results of both flux and fouling resistance suggested that the presence of ca2 resulted in more severe sa fouling than mg2 lee et al lee and elimelech 2006 attributed this phenomenon to the stronger adhesion force between sa and ca2 in contrast to significant mitigation of bsa fouling pre ozonation only promoted flux recovery by 2 8 fig 3 while reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistance fig 4 for filtration of sa in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 with increasing ozone doses reductions of irreversible fouling resistances were 27 5 and 44 4 for sa ca2 and 9 3 and 35 3 for sa mg2 at ozone dose of 0 10 and 0 25 mg o3 mg doc respectively when ozone dose further increased to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc instead irreversible fouling resistances reduced by 20 2 and 20 8 in the presence of ca2 and mg2 respectively which were lower than those at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc therefore optimal fouling mitigation of bsa and sa achieved at appropriate ozone dose rather than under or over dosing the more severe sa fouling occurred with flux loss of as high as 68 7 and 73 9 at 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 fig s4c in si and 25 5 and 31 4 at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 fig s4d in si respectively meanwhile irreversible fouling resistances markedly accelerated to 4 21 1013 m 1 and 6 66 1013 m 1 for filtration of sa at 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 fig s5c in si respectively while they increased negligibly at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 fig s5d in si on the other hand pre ozonation negligibly increased flux recovery for filtration of sa fig s4c in si but accelerated irreversible fouling resistances by 28 9 and 3 72 figs s5c and si in the presence of 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 respectively in contrast to ca2 pre ozonation effectively mitigated sa fouling at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 figs s4d and s5d in si including flux recovery of 13 4 and 12 2 and irreversible fouling reduction of 23 4 and 28 6 respectively in summary when divalent cation concentrations increased from 0 5 to 1 0 and 2 0 mm pre ozonation was still efficient to mitigate ro fouling by bsa containing ca2 or mg2 and sa containing mg2 on the contrary irreversible fouling reversed from mitigation to aggravation accompanied with negligible flux recovery for filtration of sa containing ca2 3 2 effect of pre ozonation on physicochemical properties of foulants 3 2 1 size plenty of previous works suggested that size of foulants was a major factor influencing pre ozonation for control of ultrafiltration uf cheng et al 2016 yu et al 2017 2018 nanofiltration nf singh et al 2014 yu et al 2018 and ro brown et al 2008 singh et al 2014 membrane fouling consequently we looked into the size variations of bsa and sa containing 0 5 mm of divalent cations as shown in fig 5 the peak values of bsa in size distribution curve were approximately 5 6 nm while larger sa molecules were observed with approximately 31 nm and 25 nm in the presence of ca2 and mg2 respectively pre ozonation caused larger size of bsa and sa particles with increasing ozone doses attributing to the aggregation and cross linking of foulants listiarini et al 2011 yu et al 2017 moreover it was proposed that the organic matter with higher molecule mass or larger size was favor to accumulate on membrane surface due to a slower back diffusion rate of foulants van geluwe et al 2011a 2011b the aggregation of bsa and sa might be disadvantageous to membrane fouling mitigation however it is presented clearly in figs 1 and 3 that pre ozonation increased rather than decreased the permeate flux moreover fouling layer became more porous after pre ozonation regardless of larger foulants deposition which would be discussed by sem images in section 3 5 1 in addition although size of sa molecules sharply increased in both cases of ca2 and mg2 after pre ozonation their membrane fouling behavior was quite different therefore unlike previous literatures we proposed that the size variation of foulants was not a dominant factor influencing pre ozonation for ro membrane fouling mitigation likely due to the different feed water compositions 3 2 2 potentiometric titration carboxylic acidity generally ca2 and mg2 ions bound with the carboxyl groups in organic matter and resulted in severe membrane fouling arkhangelsky et al 2012 thus it was necessary to understand the effect of pre ozonation on the amount of carboxyl groups in bsa and sa which was measured by potentiometric titration using 0 1 m naoh acidity up to ph 8 0 in the titration curves was due to the deprotonation of carboxyl groups while acidity at higher ph was attributed to the phenolic groups collins et al 1986 it was learned from fig 6 that acidity of bsa and sa before pre ozonation sharply increased to 3 40 and 7 21 meq g at ph of 4 0 respectively and then it nearly remained constant at higher phs consequently carboxylic groups predominated on bsa and sa compared to phenolic groups and sa possessed more carboxylic groups than bsa in addition pre ozonation markedly raised the carboxylic acidity of bsa to 5 50 6 64 and 7 24 meq g while those of sa slightly increased to 7 80 7 81 and 8 13 meq g at ozone doses of 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc respectively since carboxylic groups could act as ligand sites to complex with ca2 and mg2 al amoudi 2010 cruz silva et al 2019 pre ozonation enhanced the bridging action between model biopolymer and membrane which might aggravate membrane fouling zhu et al 2010 however as mentioned above pre ozonation reduced membrane fouling by all foulants except for sa in the presence of 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 consequently there were also other factors influencing membrane fouling which would be discussed later 3 2 3 zeta potential the zeta potentials of foulants were investigated since they influenced the electrostatic el interaction between foulants and membrane and further affected membrane fouling liu et al 2018 before pre ozonation zeta potentials of bsa were 7 98 and 14 3 mv while these of sa were 12 8 and 23 7 mv at ph 7 0 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 and mg2 respectively as depicted in fig 7 obviously bsa and sa possessed lower negative charge in the presence of ca2 than that of mg2 since ca2 had stronger complexation and charge neutralization ability with the carboxylic groups adusei gyamfi et al 2019 in addition compared to bsa the more negative charge of sa was due to the higher amount of carboxylic groups fig 6 fig 7 presented that pre ozonation decreased the zeta potentials of all foulants with increasing ozone doses this phenomenon implied that foulants were more negative after ozone oxidation attributing to the generation of carboxylic groups fig 6 it is worth to note that the charge of ro membrane surface was also negative at ph 7 0 fig s6 in si consequently pre ozonation resulted in stronger electrostatic el repulsion between model biopolymer and membrane especially in the presence of mg2 which was conductive to mitigate membrane fouling however effect of ozone oxidation on bsa and sa fouling was different when ca2 and mg2 were present moreover since the ionic strength increased with filtration time el interaction weakened at the second fouling stage due to the decreased debye length tang et al 2011 thus single el repulsion was probably insufficient to explain fouling mechanism 3 2 4 hydrophilic hydrophobic properties it is well known that hydrophilic fraction has a lower fouling potential than hydrophobic one due to the weaker hydrophobic hp interaction between foulants and membrane van geluwe et al 2011a therefore we also studied the hydrophilic hydrophobic properties of foulants before and after pre ozonation bsa and sa were fractionated without ca2 and mg2 since divalent cations would deposit under alkaline conditions during resin fractionation as one can observe in fig 8 before pre ozonation hpi hpo and tpi fractions accounted for 7 3 56 7 and 36 0 in bsa and 27 1 33 7 and 39 2 in sa respectively indicating bsa was much more hydrophobic than sa low ozone dose of 0 10 mg o3 mg doc marginally changed the hydrophilicity of bsa and sa when ozone doses reached 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc the relative amount of hpi fraction enhanced by 10 9 and 13 6 in bsa in company with the decrease in hpo fraction by 6 0 and 11 6 as illustrated in fig 8a respectively as regarding sa hpi fraction only increased by 6 1 and 9 8 accompanied with the decrease in hpo fraction by 3 4 and 5 3 at ozone doses of 0 25 and 0 50 mg o3 mg doc respectively fig 8b obviously pre ozonation reduced the hydrophobicity of bsa and sa further weakened the hp attraction between foulants and membrane 3 3 effect of pre ozonation on adsorption of foulants on membrane surface the adsorption of foulants on membrane surface reflected the fouling behavior liu et al 2018 which was also influenced by electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interaction and bridging action of divalent cations therefore it was investigated by in situ streaming potential measurement to explore foulants membrane and foulants foulants interactions before and after pre ozonation which was related to the initial fouling and the followed fouling stage where membrane was fully covered by foulants respectively she et al 2016 taimur khan et al 2010 the higher variation of streaming current on adsorption curves reflected more deposition or adsorption capacity of foulants on membrane the faster adsorption rate implied the stronger adhesion force between foulants and membrane liu et al 2018 muff et al 2018 3 3 1 adsorption of foulants on pristine membrane firstly we investigated the effect of ozone dose on adsorption of bsa and sa in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 before pre ozonation ca2 caused higher variation of streaming current and more deposition of bsa and sa on membrane surface than mg2 due to its stronger bridging and neutralization ability with model biopolymer as depicted in fig 9 resulting in more severe model biopolymer fouling of ro membrane in the presence of ca2 than mg2 figs 1 4 pre ozonation negligibly lowered the initial adsorption rate for all foulants which was in line with the similar initial fouling rate at different ozone doses as seen in figs 1 and 3 nevertheless the deposition of all foulants on membrane surface reduced with increasing ozone doses fig 9 adsorption curves of foulants changed negligibly at low ozone dose of 0 10 mg o3 mg doc when increasing ozone dose to 0 25 mg o3 mg doc streaming current of membrane dropped from 16 9 na to 18 2 na for adsorption of bsa ca2 and from 14 8 na to 16 4 na for bsa mg2 after approximately 1700 s of adsorption time in contrast streaming current only decreased from 15 4 na to 16 0 na for sa ca2 and from 19 6 na to 19 9 na for sa mg2 at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc obviously pre ozonation preferred to reduce the adsorbability of bsa on membrane surface compared to sa and mitigated bsa fouling more effectively figs 1 4 no obvious reduction of streaming current was observed if ozone dose further increased to 0 50 mg o3 mg doc it was worth to note that mg2 caused low deposition of sa before and after pre ozonation which was in line with less sa fouling in the presence of 0 5 mm mg2 figs 3b and 4b as illustrated in fig s7a in si when calcium concentration increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm adsorption rate of sa on membrane surface became faster after pre ozonation implying the stronger adhesion force between foulants and membrane which led to severe irreversible fouling fig s5c in si in contrast pre ozonation still lowered adhesion force of bsa membrane at 1 0 and 2 0 mm ca2 mg2 and sa membrane at 1 0 and 2 0 mm mg2 data not shown and further reduced irreversible fouling fig s5 in si 3 3 2 adsorption of foulants on fouled membrane the adsorption of foulants on the fouled membrane was used to investigate the role of ca2 and mg2 in foulants foulants interactions before and after pre ozonation at ozone dose of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc due to its optimal fouling control as observed in fig 10 ca2 0 5 mm resulted in faster adsorption rate and more deposition of bsa and sa on fouled membrane than mg2 0 5 mm suggesting that calcium caused stronger adhesion force between foulants and foulants as pre ozonation was applied to oxidize biopolymer solutions streaming currents of fouled membrane reduced from 3 09 na to 5 10 na for bsa ca2 and from 4 22 na to 5 56 na for bsa mg2 after 1800 s of adsorption time similarly for adsorption of sa they also dropped from 14 7 na to 15 3 na at 0 5 mm ca2 and from 17 6 na to 18 8 na at 0 5 mm mg2 therefore pre ozonation weakened the adhesion force of foulants foulants in the presence of low concentration of divalent cation moreover the adsorption rate of sa was slow in the presence of mg2 with and without pre ozonation thus mg2 resulted in weak sa sa interaction and less membrane fouling figs 3 and 4 however pre ozonation accelerated adsorption rate of sa by 1 33 and 2 22 times when ca2 concentration increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm fig s7b in si indicating the stronger adhesion force between foulants and foulants which caused more serious membrane fouling figs 3 and 4 in summary adsorption experiments were well consistent with bsa and sa fouling in the presence of ca2 and mg2 before and after pre ozonation we proposed in situ streaming potential measurement may be an ideal and advanced method to predict ro membrane fouling due to its easy operation relative fast analysis and similar experimental conditions with cross flow membrane filtration under a constant pressure 3 4 fouling mechanism it is generally accepted that liftshitz van der walls lw lewis acid base ab and electrostatic el interactions between foulants and membrane influenced membrane fouling in terms of extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory liu et al 2017 the combined lw and ab interactions could be considered as hydrophobic interactions therefore they were simplified to el and hydrophobic hp interactions for ro membrane fouling by biopolymer yin et al 2020 van oss et al 1986 however when ca2 and mg2 were present the biopolymer can also be adsorbed on membrane surface via bridging action of divalent cation li et al 2011 thus membrane fouling should be governed by the synergy among el repulsion hp attraction and divalent cation bridging the schematic diagram of fouling mechanism was illustrated in fig 11 it is learned from section 3 2 that pre ozonation reduced the zeta potential and hydrophobicity of bsa and sa in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 therefore el repulsion increased and hp attraction decreased between foulants and membrane with the increasing ozone doses which was conductive to fouling mitigation besides ozone oxidation generated more carboxylic groups in bsa and sa at higher ozone dose fig 6 and enhanced the bridging action of divalent cations which was detrimental to fouling alleviation the results of adsorption experiment suggested pre ozonation weakened the adhesion forces of foulants membrane and foulants foulants figs 9 and 10 thus the reduced membrane fouling after pre ozonation figs 1 4 was probably due to the overwhelming effect of el and hp interactions compared to divalent cation bridging however if ozone dose was too high 0 5 mg o3 mg doc zeta potential and hydrophobicity of bsa and sa decreased slightly while the divalent cation bridging still enhanced thus it resulted in negligible mitigation of bsa fouling or even more severe irreversible sa fouling at ozone dose of 0 50 mg o3 mg doc compared to those at 0 25 mg o3 mg doc figs 1 4 when the divalent cation concentrations increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm it is reasonable to assume that the divalent cation bridging enhanced accordingly however pre ozonation still mitigated ro fouling by bsa ca2 mg2 and sa mg2 figs s4 and s5 in si since the negative effect of bridging action was compensated by the positive impact of el and hp interactions in contrast the more serious irreversible fouling was observed for filtration of sa ca2 after pre ozonation fig s5c in si this phenomenon can be explained by the following two aspects firstly sa possessed more carboxylic groups than bsa after pre ozonation fig 6 which induced stronger bridging action of divalent cation with sa than bsa meanwhile ca2 had a stronger binding ability with carboxylic groups than mg2 adusei gyamfi et al 2019 as a result the bridging action of ca2 between sa and membrane was strongest after pre ozonation secondly unlike bsa ca2 bridging with sa could form cross linked gel in terms of the egg box model grant et al 1973 as revealed by sem graphs fig 13 fig s8 in si and resulted in severe polysaccharides fouling lee and elimelech 2006 likewise ca2 bridging between sa and membrane enhanced due to the fact that pre ozonation increased the amount of carboxylic groups in sa and the cross linking between ca2 and sa therefore the bridging action of divalent cation play a key role in fouling mechanism rather than el and hp interactions for filtration of sa in the high concentration of ca2 further induced stronger adhesion forces of foulants membrane and foulants foulants fig s7 in si and more serious irreversible fouling after pre ozonation fig s5c in si 3 5 fouling layer autopsy 3 5 1 fouling layer morphology we employed sem to investigate the surface structure and morphology of fouled membrane before and after pre ozonation as seen in figs 12 and 13 membrane surface was covered by foulants and formed a compact fouling layer for filtration of bsa and sa containing 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 in addition sa caused denser and smoother fouling layer compared to bsa especially in the presence of ca2 which was in line with the more severe flux decline figs 1 4 it is learned from figs 12 and 13 that larger complexes of biopolymer divalent cations deposited on membrane surface after pre ozonation due to the aggregation and cross linking of foulants moreover compactness of fouling layer reduced with increasing ozone doses for filtration of bsa ca2 mg2 fig 12 and sa mg2 fig 13 which caused lower filtration resistance along with more flux recovery figs 1 and 3 a possible reason was the aggregation of smaller foulants into larger aggregates fig 5 due to oxidation which the former preferentially deposited on the valleys of membrane surface thus caused valley clogging and dense fouling layer yin et al 2017 in contrast for filtration of sa after pre ozonation the compactness of fouling layer reduced slightly in the presence of 0 5 mm ca2 fig 13b d while even enhanced at 1 0 and 2 0 mm calcium fig s8 in si since cross linking of calcium with sa induced the formation of cross linked gel on membrane surface sem graphs suggested pre ozonation markedly lowered filtration resistances for model biopolymer containing divalent cations except for sa ca2 which was in agreement with the filtration experiments figs 1 and 3 fig s4 in si 3 5 2 atr ftir atr ftir was applied to characterize functional groups in fouling layer fig 14 a showed that pristine ro appeared as a standard polyamide pa membrane three peaks at 1660 1588 and 1487 cm 1 were associated to the stretching vibration of co amide i c n h amide ii and c n amide iii respectively park et al 2017 after fouled by bsa at 0 5 mm ca2 and mg2 their intensities markedly weakened as illustrated in fig 14 a and b while three new peaks appeared at 3300 1645 and 1536 cm 1 in ftir graphs attributed to the stretching vibration of oh asymmetry and symmetry stretching vibration of coo in bsa naidja et al 2002 respectively as regarding membrane fouled by sa at 0 5 mm ca2 there were three peaks at around 1020 1588 and 1410 cm 1 assigned to the stretching vibration of c o gómez ordóñez and rupérez 2011 asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylate o c o and deformation vibration of c oh in sa gómez ordóñez and rupérez 2011 leal et al 2008 as illustrated fig 13c respectively we learned from fig 14 that pre ozonation markedly weakened the peaks intensity of bsa in fouling layer but negligibly attenuated those of sa with all ozone doses 0 10 0 50 mg o3 mg doc when 0 5 mm ca2 and mg2 were present which was consistent with more efficient bsa fouling mitigation compared to sa besides intensities of sa were both weak in the presence of mg2 with and without pre ozonation fig 14d implying the lower foulants deposition on membrane surface and less membrane fouling as calcium concentration increased to 1 0 and 2 0 mm intensity of sa in fouling layer became stronger after pre ozonation as depicted in fig s9 in si which was in line with the more severe membrane fouling fig s5c in si 4 conclusions for the first time this study investigated the role of ca2 and mg2 in pre ozonation for the mitigation of ro membrane fouling including flux decline and fouling reversibility by model biopolymer bsa and sa we concluded that the following results might partially explain the controversial impact of pre ozonation on membrane fouling control 1 pre ozonation changed the physicochemical properties of bsa and sa as indicated by the increased negative charge particle sizes carboxylic acidity and hydrophilicity 2 fouling mitigation became more effective with increasing ozone doses but high ozone dose 0 5 mg o3 mg doc caused more serious initial ro fouling by bsa and irreversible ro fouling by sa when 0 5 mm ca2 or mg2 was present 3 pre ozonation markedly mitigated ro fouling by bsa even if 0 5 2 0 mm ca2 or mg2 were present since the increase in electrostatic el repulsion and decrease in hydrophobic hp interaction compensated the increase in divalent cation bridging however the impact of pre ozonation on ro fouling by sa was quite different in the presence of ca2 and mg2 sa fouling mitigated at 0 5 2 0 mm mg2 and low ca2 concentration 0 5 mm while flux recovery increased negligibly and irreversible fouling accelerated at higher ca2 concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mm attributing to overwhelming effect of divalent cation bridging compared to el and hp interactions 4 the adsorption experiment well predicted ro membrane fouling behavior by in situ streaming potential measurement pre ozonation weakened adhesion forces between model biopolymer and membrane model biopolymer in the presence of ca2 and mg2 except for sa containing high ca2 concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18213,targeted inactivation of bacteria using bacteriophages has been proposed in applications ranging from bioengineering and biofuel production to medical treatments the ability to differentiate between desirable and undesirable organisms such as in targeting filamentous bacteria in activated sludge is a potential advantage over conventional disinfectants like conventional disinfectants bacteriophages exhibit non linear concentration time ct dynamics in achieving bacterial inactivation however there is currently no workable model for predicting these observed non linear inactivation rates this work considers an approach to predicting bacteriophage induced inactivation rates by utilizing classical particle aggregation theory bacteriophage bacteria interactions are represented as a two step process of transport by brownian motion differential settling and shear followed by attachment modifying classical expressions for particle particle aggregation to include bacterial growth death and bacteriophage reproduction the model was calibrated and validated using literature data the calibrated model captures much of the observed non linearity in inactivation rates and reasonably predicts the final host concentration this model was shown to be most useful in systems more likely to reflect an industrial setting where the initial multiplicity of infection or moi the ratio of bacteriophage to host organisms was 1 or greater for systems of an initial moi of less than 1 the model showed increased sensitivity to changes in input parameters and a less pronounced ability to reasonably predict inactivation rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords aggregation bacteriophage disinfection water treatment phage therapy 1 introduction a contemporary need of water quality engineers is the development of targeted disinfection technology one example of where this technology would be beneficial is the activated sludge process the generation of filamentous bacteria often results in sludge bulking thus reducing process efficiency the inactivation of these specific organisms while allowing other necessary and beneficial organisms to remain viable would improve process optimization several disinfection technologies currently exist for water treatment such as chlorination and uv radiation however these methods cannot be used selectively to target microorganisms martins et al 2004 one possible means of organism specific disinfection involves the use of bacteriophages or phages phages are obligate parasites that infect specific bacterial hosts phages are ubiquitous and abundant in the environment with a population estimated to be on the order of 1031 hendrix 2002 phage population is self generated through host specific infection and lysis taken together these features qualify phages as an autocatalytic means of inactivating target organisms upon contact with a bacterium s surface a phage will either form an irreversible attachment mediated by an adequate surface binding protein one which could lead to infection or will only temporarily dwell upon the host surface due to a lack of the necessary binding receptors thus not resulting in infection if infection is successful the host will begin producing replicates of the infecting phage until after some time when the host lyses to release the phage within it thus killing the bacterial host while producing newly formed phages and allowing the process to continue abedon 2009 there are still some challenges which need to be overcome before phages receive a wider acceptance as tools for disinfection and biocontrol for many applications most of which have to do with a lack of a more comprehensive understanding of phage ecology and their impact on environmental microbiomes goodridge 2004 most concerns revolve around questions of both the development of phage resistant hosts and whether or not phages could be over specific in their bacterial inactivation range to be effective disinfectants choi et al 2011 however when it comes to being able to predict the rates of bacterial inactivation by bacteriophages there is still need for a quantitative model for phage bacteria interactions allowing for the possible management of these interactions in an engineered setting to achieve a desired result a review of different models proposed for particular phage host systems was previously summarized by storms and sauvageau 2015 while each of these models have particular strengths there is still a need to predictively model the rate of phage induced disinfection for a broad range of phage host systems where the relative initial concentration of bacteriophage to the concentration of viable hosts referred to as the initial multiplicity of infection or moi may vary hyman and abedon 2009 the current study builds on data produced in one such previous effort conducted by worley morse and gunsch 2015 that illustrated some of the challenges in the development of a more predictive model based upon theory rather than statistical or curve fitting relationships the work presented here continues to advance predictive phage induced bacterial inactivation models by incorporating host infection using classical particle aggregation kinetics and theory as articulated principally by smoluchowski 1917 particle aggregation theory has been used broadly to describe phenomena ranging from the evolution of aerosols friedlander 2000 to the growth of flocs in wastewater treatment o melia 1980 as well as to model phage host attachment schlesinger 1932 delbrück 1940 and schwartz 1976 considered smoluchowski s formulation of particle diffusion and used it to estimate the maximum rate of phage attachment for the purpose of interpreting the dynamics of phage host interactions worley morse and gunsch 2015 implemented smoluchowski s particle particle aggregation terms into population balances to model phage mediated disinfection but considered limited particle transport mechanisms and did not integrate the rate kernels into their population balances the current work approaches the modeling of phage induced bacterial inactivation through the use of population balances and considers three transport mechanisms likely to influence disinfection rates under the hypothesis that particle particle interactions as described by aggregation theory may capture and predict the observed non linearity in concentration time ct curves this is to be done with minimal data fitting and relying upon experimentally and theoretically derived parameter values 2 theory the present model represents phage induced disinfection as two consecutive non reversible reactions 1 p b k 1 i k 2 p where p b and i represent the concentrations of phage uninfected bacteria and infected bacteria respectively in this model the formation of an infected host will be treated as a non reversible attachment between a phage and a healthy bacterium first a second order reaction describes phage bacteria aggregation where the rate constant k 1 encompasses transport of phage p to the bacteria b followed by attachment to yield an infected bacterium i the choice to describe the first step as a second order reaction is to reflect that the formation of an infected host is the product of a two body interaction the next reaction describes the generation of new phage s this is assumed to occur as a first order reaction rate with constant k 2 following the lysis of infected bacteria i since the generation of new phages is assumed to be solely dependent upon the rate of host lysis 2 1 particle aggregation kinetics particle aggregation can be considered to occur as a sequence of physical transport of the particles to a near field region where then chemical factors dominate and determine attachment between the particles following smoluchowski s work the transport parameter is known as the collision frequency β with units of a 2nd order rate constant and the latter as attachment efficiency α from the perspective of phage host interactions α and β were applied to quantify the formation of a phage host complex leading to an infected host so that one may write 2 k 1 α β l 3 m t where the product of α and β provides a numerical representation of the effective collisions in this context the number of phage host collisions resulting in infection as a second order rate constant mathematical expressions representing collision frequency are rooted in the envisioned movement of fluid around particles as they move closer towards one another in one model particle collisions are not affected by the compression of streamlines as they approach one another this so called rectilinear model was first utilized by smoluchowski 1917 a more realistic model for two approaching solid spheres includes this hydrodynamic effect which reduces the number of collisions in comparison with the rectilinear model and is more important for approaching particles of greater difference in size han and lawler 1992 in this work the rectilinear model of the collision rate kernel β was used since analytical solutions for non spherical particles are not available the effect of using the rectilinear model is to combine the hydrodynamic retardation of particle collision with the chemical factors affecting attachment in the parameter α particles may come into contact through three transport mechanisms brownian motion br shear motion s and differential settling ds these three particle collision mechanisms are assumed to be additive the components of the rectilinear collision rate kernel can be described by equations 3 6 han and lawler 1992 o melia 1980 smoluchowski 1917 3 β b r i j 2 k b t 3 μ d i d j 2 d i d j 4 β s i j 1 6 d i d j 3 g 5 β d s i j π g 72 μ ρ p

is the absolute fluid viscosity g is the velocity gradient g is acceleration due to gravity and ρ p and ρ l are the particle and liquid densities respectively the model represents phages as transported to the surface of a bacterium as described by the collision rate kernel once a phage is in the near field of a bacterium the probability of phage attachment to its host is a function of factors including dwell time high affinity receptor surface concentration and phage tail orientation amongst others chatterjee and rothenberg 2012 schwartz 1976 this probability accounting for all of these intricate surface interactions of surface attachment as well as near field hydrodynamic factors is captured by the parameter α the attachment efficiency the attachment efficiency α can be viewed as the ratio of the number of surface contacts leading to attachment to the total number of surface contacts smoluchowski 1917 in addition to the factors cited above particle attachment efficiency is affected by electrostatic repulsive forces van der waals attractive forces as well as hydrophobic and steric interactions derjaguin and landau 1993 verwey and overbeek 1948 therefore α is a global correction parameter converting the value of β the total number of collisions to total number of collisions leading to attachment assumed to yield infection experimental methods exist for determining values of α but were considered to be beyond the scope of the current work without experimentally derived values for α we assume a value of unity this assumption could prove poor for various phage host systems such as those of low surface receptor concentration but may also be a reasonable assumption given the specificity of viral attachment interactions treatment of α as an additional fitting coefficient would certainly lead to improved fits to data however the goal of the current study was to determine the extent to which particle aggregation kinetics can represent the non linearities in the bacterial inactivation process with a minimum of adjustable variables once a phage has infected a susceptible host a phage uses the host s replicating faculties to generate new phages within the host itself ultimately leading to cell lysis and the release of the newly formed phage escherichia coli has been observed to lyse approximately 45 min after infection with λ phage ryan and rutenberg 2007 corresponding to a lysis rate kl of 1 3 3 h 1 in this example we assume here that the phage generation rate k 2 in equation 1 is well approximated by the host lyses rate following infection k l such that 7 k 2 k l 2 2 incorporation into population balances in a system of both bacteria and free phages one would expect to find at any given time uninfected bacteria infected but not yet lysed bacteria unbound or free phage and phage bound to bacteria as a result population balances should account for the growth of bacteria the loss of healthy bacteria and free phage through attachment and phage production through lysis of infected bacteria 8 d b d t μ n e t b α β b p 9 d i d t α β b p k l i 10 d p d t k l i y k i p α β b i p eq 8 describes the change in the uninfected host concentration b in c f u ml as a function of time t in hours by accounting for the net growth rate of the host μ per hour and the loss of uninfected hosts due to phage attachment it is here that the product of α and β ml hour 1 p f u o r c f u 1 act together as a second order rate constant for phage attachment upon phage attachment the host is considered infected i in c f u ml therefore the rate of phage attachment is assumed to be equal to the rate of infection equation 9 here the replication of an infected host is not considered and this model does not account for the formation of phage insensitive bacteria eq 10 described changes in the concentration of free phages p p f u ml that are generated through the lysis of infected hosts according to the burst size y p f u c f u or lost either through inactivation over time according to a first order reaction rate kinact per hour or through attachment to an uninfected host or an already infected host these balances are similar to those used by worley morse and gunsch 2015 differing only in 1 the inclusion of a phage inactivation rate and 2 the allowance of free phage to attach to both uninfected and previously infected hosts both the uninfected and infected host populations were included in the bacteriophage population balance to allow for the possibility that more than one phage could possibly attach to a still viable yet infected host 3 methods the model was calibrated using literature values and theoretical calculations for each of the rate constants with the exception of the growth rate and burst size of the phage host system experimental data collected by worley morse and gunsch 2015 were used to validate the model output for changes in bacteria and phage concentration over time in brief the work performed in their studies explored the extent of phage induced bacterial inactivation as a function of multiplicity of infection across a range of phage host concentrations for a system of escherichia coli k 12 mg1655 and coliphage ec2 worley morse et al 2014 based upon a training sub set of the data a value of 0 098 h 1 and 4 5 p f u c f u 1 was used for the growth rate and burst size of this phage host system respectively the velocity gradient g was assumed to be zero as the experimental design did not involve continuous shear mixing as a result the shear component of the contact frequency did not contribute to the overall contact frequency calculation in this model validation the impact of this decision will be an increased dependency upon the ability of differential settling and brownian motion to describe the inactivation trends and a decreased impact on the use of the rectilinear assumption since e coli is a rod shaped bacterium it was assigned a representative spherical diameter of 1 μm this estimation was based upon calculating the corresponding diameter of a sphere based upon the volume of e coli taken as 0 58 μm3 kubitschek 1990 while the diameter of coliphage ec2 was assigned a representative diameter of 0 1 μm using coliphage t4 size as a model of phage size yap and rossmann 2014 particle density for both phage and bacteria was taken to be 1 105 g ml as reported by martínez salas et al 1981 while the fluid density was treated as the density of water taken to be 1000 kg m 3 the lysis rate was represented by the lysis time of e coli after infection by λ phage as presented earlier in this article section 2 2 considering that the experiments were only conducted over a 4 h period and did not utilize the phage inactivation rate parameter this parameter was disregarded using the assumed values for rate constants the system of differential equations eqs 8 10 was solved numerically using euler integration calculations were carried out using matlab r2019a 64 bit academic use license on a 2018 macbook pro laptop a model matlab script can be found in the supplemental material of this article 4 results and discussion looking first at ct curves fig 1 compares the model outcomes with the experimentally observed data points reported by worley morse and gunsch 2015 where phages were introduced to the system at time 0 the only input parameter values which were changed between runs was the initial phage and host concentrations bacterial inactivation by phages varies as both a function of time and the relative initial concentrations of phage and bacteria or moi for example at a moi of 1 and a phage concentration of 108 plaque forming units per ml approximately 2 h are required to achieve one log inactivation of bacteria were a linear ct applicable this would suggest that at a concentration of 107 p f u ml some 20 h would be required to achieve the same log inactivation while in fact this is observed to occur after approximately 2 5 h this not only demonstrates how poorly a linear ct curve would represent some of these systems but also allows one to comment on the kinetics of the interactions at the highest phage concentration of 108 inactivation curves were more similar than those produced at 107 suggesting that the kinetics approaches more of a first order behavior while at the lowest tested phage concentrations of 106 inactivation curves were more suggestive of strong second order kinetics except at a moi of 1 for example according to plot g where moi is 0 01 the ct curve predicts one log inactivation after about 3 h though no inactivation was observed experimentally taken together these trends would indicate that as moi diverges further from 1 the model begins to show strong bias either towards a pseudo first order or second order reaction rate which would tend to significantly over estimate the rate of disinfection at lower relative phage concentrations when the moi is closer to 1 the model is able to better capture the non linear behavior seen in experimental trials however even at a moi greater than 1 the pseudo first order kinetics better represents the real system than the second order kinetics represents the real system when moi is less than 1 this is a beneficial characteristic of the model since most applications in which disinfection is desired an initial moi of at least 10 is used in order to ensure inactivation occurs abedon 2009 this demonstrates the model s value as a tool for several practical and industrial applications this model s ability to capture both first order and second order kinetic behavior especially at mois approaching 1 demonstrates the utility of smoluchowski 1917 particle aggregation theory to predict rates of phage induced disinfection the non linearity of these ct curves is not trivial to predict particle aggregation theory appears to capture most of the observed non linearity in disinfection rates as observed during early contact times this is an improvement over other previous modeling attempts offered by worley morse and gunsch 2015 the most significant improvement being the ability to generate non linear ct curves as a result of the choice to use aggregation theory rather than data fitting to approximate the rate of phage host attachment the most significant challenge to this model is the difficulty in predicting the disinfection rate of systems of low relative phage concentration moi 1 as previously discussed for its ability to predict disinfection rates this model is best suited for systems of high phage and host concentrations at least 106 cfus or pfus per ml at a moi of 1 or greater looking more closely at the changes in the phage and host concentrations not just the disinfection rate one can see more agreement between the model predictions and experimental outcomes fig 2 a shows strong agreement between the observed and predicted changes in both phage and host concentrations corresponding to the conditions in fig 1c for the two systems where moi is less than 1 plots b and c characteristics of the population balances become more evident for example fig 2b shows a sharp inflection in the phage concentration after about 0 5 h before a sharp increase this is indicative of the loss of free phage as a result of host attachment where the population only begins to increase again once infected hosts begin to lyse and release more free phages this inflection is not as dramatically seen in fig 2c likely resulting from the lower initial free phage concentration fig 2a does not show any significant inflection as the initial phage concentration was higher than the initial host concentration all three models reasonably predict the final host and phage concentrations this is an improvement over the previous modeling work done by worley morse and gunsch 2015 especially with regards to the changes in host concentration under a range of initial conditions this is seen most clearly in the predicted final value of the host concentration this was done by providing a predictive approach to representing changes in host and phage concentrations from both theory and experimentation while also avoiding data fitting compared to other models this effort highlights the ability of particle aggregation theory to reasonably predict the rate of phage mediated disinfection utilizing only a few assumptions and without the employment of fitting parameters this could have significant design implications on water treatment especially regarding the potential of phage based biocontrol efforts in the activated sludge process for different combinations of phage and host systems one would expect the physical parameters likely to change most would be that of burst size and lysis rate to examine model sensitivity the simulated disinfection rates were plotted against the experimentally observed rates to determine an r2 value these r2 values were collected for several different values for different model parameters the model appeared to be most sensitive to changes in burst size y fig 3 shows the changes in r2 as a function of different values of y ranging from 0 no bursting to 100 pfu cfu 1 the conditions of this figure are the same as those provided in fig 1 while allowing only the burst size to vary interestingly the model s sensitivity to changes in burst size was largely confined to the lowest moi condition as moi increased the r2 values remained more consistent model sensitivity toward changes in lysis rate kl was examined for values ranging from 0 to 4 h 1 it was similarly observed that for the moi 0 1 condition that the r2 varied most dramatically with values ranging from 0 24 to 0 73 peaking slightly at a kl of 1 h 1 however for the other moi conditions the r2 stabilized at 0 95 except when kl 0 h 1 no lysis phage inactivation rate had the least effect on model stability where again only for the moi 0 1 condition was the r2 seen to vary between 0 68 and 0 81 for values of 0 2 h 1 this analysis suggests that the model s sensitivity is a function of the ratio of the phage and its host this makes sense given that at higher and higher relative phage concentrations factors such as increased burst size and lysis rates have less and less effect on the uncertainty of the rate of inactivation therefore this analysis corroborates the previous observations that this modeling approach is best suited under conditions of initial moi of 1 or greater at the tested concentrations and has the ability to predict the inactivation rate with minimal data fitting 5 conclusions classical smoluchowski 1917 particle aggregation theory has shown itself to be a useful tool in the construction of phage induced disinfection models in summary this approach is most beneficial under conditions where the initial system moi is 1 or greater granted that both phage and host concentrations are no less than 106 colony or plaque forming units per milliliter this is mostly due to the model s ability to capture both a pseudo first order and second order kinetic behavior depending upon the relative phage and host concentrations using minimal fitting factors while future work will be needed to test this model s applicability to other phage host systems which may behave differently under similar conditions the results presented here suggest that particle aggregation kinetics could provide a stronger foundation for future modeling work more significantly this effort also demonstrates the ability of some complex

18213,targeted inactivation of bacteria using bacteriophages has been proposed in applications ranging from bioengineering and biofuel production to medical treatments the ability to differentiate between desirable and undesirable organisms such as in targeting filamentous bacteria in activated sludge is a potential advantage over conventional disinfectants like conventional disinfectants bacteriophages exhibit non linear concentration time ct dynamics in achieving bacterial inactivation however there is currently no workable model for predicting these observed non linear inactivation rates this work considers an approach to predicting bacteriophage induced inactivation rates by utilizing classical particle aggregation theory bacteriophage bacteria interactions are represented as a two step process of transport by brownian motion differential settling and shear followed by attachment modifying classical expressions for particle particle aggregation to include bacterial growth death and bacteriophage reproduction the model was calibrated and validated using literature data the calibrated model captures much of the observed non linearity in inactivation rates and reasonably predicts the final host concentration this model was shown to be most useful in systems more likely to reflect an industrial setting where the initial multiplicity of infection or moi the ratio of bacteriophage to host organisms was 1 or greater for systems of an initial moi of less than 1 the model showed increased sensitivity to changes in input parameters and a less pronounced ability to

g ml as reported by martínez salas et al 1981 while the fluid density was treated as the density of water taken to be 1000 kg m 3 the lysis rate was represented by the lysis time of e coli after infection by λ phage as presented earlier in this article section 2 2 considering that the experiments were only conducted over a 4 h period and did not utilize the phage inactivation rate parameter this parameter was disregarded using the assumed values for rate constants the system of differential equations eqs 8 10 was solved numerically using euler integration calculations were carried out using matlab r2019a 64 bit academic use license on a 2018 macbook pro laptop a model matlab script can be found in the supplemental material of this article 4 results and discussion looking first at ct curves fig 1 compares the model outcomes with the experimentally observed data points reported by worley morse and gunsch 2015 where phages were introduced to the system at time 0 the only input parameter values which were changed between runs was the initial phage and host concentrations bacterial inactivation by phages varies as both a function of time and the relative initial concentrations of phage and bacteria or moi for example at a moi of 1 and a phage concentration of 108 plaque forming units per ml approximately 2 h are required to achieve one log inactivation of bacteria were a linear ct applicable this would suggest that at a concentration of 107 p f u ml some 20 h would be required to achieve the same log inactivation while in fact this is observed to occur after approximately 2 5 h this not only demonstrates how poorly a linear ct curve would represent some of these systems but also allows one to comment on the kinetics of the interactions at the highest phage concentration of 108 inactivation curves were more similar than those produced at 107 suggesting that the kinetics approaches more of a first order behavior while at the lowest tested phage concentrations of 106 inactivation curves were more suggestive of strong second order kinetics except at a moi of 1 for example according to plot g where moi is 0 01 the ct curve predicts one log inactivation after about 3 h though no inactivation was observed experimentally taken together these trends would indicate that as moi diverges further from 1 the model begins to show strong bias either towards a pseudo first order or second order reaction rate which would tend to significantly over estimate the rate of disinfection at lower relative phage concentrations when the moi is closer to 1 the model is able to better capture the non linear behavior seen in experimental trials however even at a moi greater than 1 the pseudo first order kinetics better represents the real system than the second order kinetics represents the real system when moi is less than 1 this is a beneficial characteristic of the model since most applications in which disinfection is desired an initial moi of at least 10 is used in order to ensure inactivation occurs abedon 2009 this demonstrates the model s value as a tool for several practical and industrial applications this model s ability to capture both first order and second order kinetic behavior especially at mois approaching 1 demonstrates the utility of smoluchowski 1917 particle aggregation theory to predict rates of phage induced disinfection the non linearity of these ct curves is not trivial to predict particle aggregation theory appears to capture most of the observed non linearity in disinfection rates as observed during early contact times this is an improvement over other previous modeling attempts offered by worley morse and gunsch 2015 the most significant improvement being the ability to generate non linear ct curves as a result of the choice to use aggregation theory rather than data fitting to approximate the rate of phage host attachment the most significant challenge to this model is the difficulty in predicting the disinfection rate of systems of low relative phage concentration moi 1 as previously discussed for its ability to predict disinfection rates this model is best suited for systems of high phage and host concentrations at least 106 cfus or pfus per ml at a moi of 1 or greater looking more closely at the changes in the phage and host concentrations not just the disinfection rate one can see more agreement between the model predictions and experimental outcomes fig 2 a shows strong agreement between the observed and predicted changes in both phage and host concentrations corresponding to the conditions in fig 1c for the two systems where moi is less than 1 plots b and c characteristics of the population balances become more evident for example fig 2b shows a sharp inflection in the phage concentration after about 0 5 h before a sharp increase this is indicative of the loss of free phage as a result of host attachment where the population only begins to increase again once infected hosts begin to lyse and release more free phages this inflection is not as dramatically seen in fig 2c likely resulting from the lower initial free phage concentration fig 2a does not show any significant inflection as the initial phage concentration was higher than the initial host concentration all three models reasonably predict the final host and phage concentrations this is an improvement over the previous modeling work done by worley morse and gunsch 2015 especially with regards to the changes in host concentration under a range of initial conditions this is seen most clearly in the predicted final value of the host concentration this was done by providing a predictive approach to representing changes in host and phage concentrations from both theory and experimentation while also avoiding data fitting compared to other models this effort highlights the ability of particle aggregation theory to reasonably predict the rate of phage mediated disinfection utilizing only a few assumptions and without the employment of fitting parameters this could have significant design implications on water treatment especially regarding the potential of phage based biocontrol efforts in the activated sludge process for different combinations of phage and host systems one would expect the physical parameters likely to change most would be that of burst size and lysis rate to examine model sensitivity the simulated disinfection rates were plotted against the experimentally observed rates to determine an r2 value these r2 values were collected for several different values for different model parameters the model appeared to be most sensitive to changes in burst size y fig 3 shows the changes in r2 as a function of different values of y ranging from 0 no bursting to 100 pfu cfu 1 the conditions of this figure are the same as those provided in fig 1 while allowing only the burst size to vary interestingly the model s sensitivity to changes in burst size was largely confined to the lowest moi condition as moi increased the r2 values remained more consistent model sensitivity toward changes in lysis rate kl was examined for values ranging from 0 to 4 h 1 it was similarly observed that for the moi 0 1 condition that the r2 varied most dramatically with values ranging from 0 24 to 0 73 peaking slightly at a kl of 1 h 1 however for the other moi conditions the r2 stabilized at 0 95 except when kl 0 h 1 no lysis phage inactivation rate had the least effect on model stability where again only for the moi 0 1 condition was the r2 seen to vary between 0 68 and 0 81 for values of 0 2 h 1 this analysis suggests that the model s sensitivity is a function of the ratio of the phage and its host this makes sense given that at higher and higher relative phage concentrations factors such as increased burst size and lysis rates have less and less effect on the uncertainty of the rate of inactivation therefore this analysis corroborates the previous observations that this modeling approach is best suited under conditions of initial moi of 1 or greater at the tested concentrations and has the ability to predict the inactivation rate with minimal data fitting 5 conclusions classical smoluchowski 1917 particle aggregation theory has shown itself to be a useful tool in the construction of phage induced disinfection models in summary this approach is most beneficial under conditions where the initial system moi is 1 or greater granted that both phage and host concentrations are no less than 106 colony or plaque forming units per milliliter this is mostly due to the model s ability to capture both a pseudo first order and second order kinetic behavior depending upon the relative phage and host concentrations using minimal fitting factors while future work will be needed to test this model s applicability to other phage host systems which may behave differently under similar conditions the results presented here suggest that particle aggregation kinetics could provide a stronger foundation for future modeling work more significantly this effort also demonstrates the ability of some complex

18214,silver based nanoparticles ag b nps in the environment are of current concern as they may pose risks to human and environmental health even at low concentration levels it is widely known that ag b nps once released from products containing these particles for antimicrobial reasons can pass through wastewater treatment plants to some extent these particles are transported via running waterways and eventually reach the sea however the fate of environmentally relevant ng l 1 traces of ag b nps in seawater has not yet been sufficiently studied analytical techniques capable of determining these ultratraces of ag b nps in seawater are scarce and struggle furthermore with the high chloride content in highly saline matrices such as seawater in this study we extracted ag b nps from matrices with varying salinity via cloud point extraction cpe and determined concentration and size of ag b nps in extracts with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms applying this extraction and measurement technique we were able to investigate the fate of ag b nps with different coatings citrate and the predominant coatings in nature silver sulfide and silver chloride in matrices with increasing salinity and real seawater all types of ag b nps were dissolved in all matrices almost independently of the chemical composition of the nanoparticles nps whereas dissolution rates increased with increasing salinity due to the formation of soluble ag i species and in the presence of chloride agclx 1 x x 1 complexes after an incubation time of not more than 72 h ag b nps were dissolved almost completely during the dissolution process np shrinkage could be clearly observed by sp icp ms supplementary electron microscopy measurements revealed that the sulfur content in silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps increased during the dissolution process finally we were able to investigate the dissolution process of real ag b nps in wastewater after increasing the salinity to seawater levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanoparticles fate seawater cloud point extraction single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry electron microscopy 1 introduction due to the growing use of silver nanoparticles ag nps in commercially available products and applications such as food storage containers sporting goods fabrics food additives in animal feed cosmetics medical devices and many others kim et al 2010 peters et al 2014 these nanoparticles are increasingly released into the environment this has intensified the discussion about concerns regarding environmental compatibility of ag nps several studies have dealt with the toxicity of silver nanoparticles in organs ahamed et al 2010 krug 2014 kumar et al 2017 wiemann et al 2017 and metabolic pathways foldbjerg et al 2009 gopinath et al 2010 park et al 2010 ribeiro et al 2015 wise et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 in addition to silver ions generated by dissolution of nanoparticles ag nps themselves are believed to negatively affect organisms asharani et al 2008 2009 beer et al 2012 kim et al 2009 qian et al 2013 silver in this particulate form is believed to surpass even the ecotoxicological hazards of the corresponding bulk material hansen and baun 2012 pettitt and lead 2013 therefore ag nps should be monitored and analyzed in environmental samples in order to understand their fate and distribution in the environment especially addressing the question of how environmental matrices influence particle dissolution and aggregation pasricha et al 2012 once released into the environment ag nps interact readily with naturally occurring organic and inorganic substances and thus undergo a broad variety of surface modifications which include adsorption of organic molecules present in the environment or reactions with e g dissolved species resulting in ag2s or agcl coatings whereas ag2s dominates environmentally relevant surface modifications kaegi et al 2011 2013 2015 therefore ag nps in the environment are described hereinafter as silver based nanoparticles ag b nps so as to take every kind of surface modification into account li et al showed that over 94 6 of ag b nps were removed from wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent but still resulted in an ag b np concentration ranging from 0 7 to 11 1 ng l 1 in the effluent released into the environment li et al 2016 these nanoparticles are transported in rivers and finally reach the sea and the resulting fate of ag b nps can be characterized by two main processes aggregation and dissolution the derjaguin landau verwey overbeak dlvo theory describes the stability of nanoparticle dispersions in aqueous matrices as an interplay of van der waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion derjaguin and landau 1993 lodeiro et al 2016 quik et al 2014 verwey 1947 once nanoparticles nps are dispersed in matrices of high ionic strength e g seawater the net charge of the particles deriving from the corresponding electric double layer surrounding the particles is reduced this results in an increase of remaining attractive forces encouraging attachment and thus aggregation of nps lodeiro et al 2016 consequently it is believed that ag b nps are not transported long distances in seawater however toncelli et al observed that the dissolution process dominates the fate of ag b nps in seawater at low concentrations ng l 1 range completely compensating for a dlvo type aggregation effect toncelli et al 2017 in general the dissolution of ag b nps is best described by a widely accepted model established by liu and hurt 2010 ag b nps in aqueous matrices undergo a cooperative oxidation process involving dissolved oxygen and protons forming peroxide intermediates and eventually water simultaneously ag 0 is readily oxidized to dissolved ag i which is encouraged by a relatively low redox gap of 0 8 v liu and hurt 2010 toncelli et al 2017 liu and hart did not observe ag b np dissolution in deoxygenated seawater and they were able to decrease it at a reduced ph due to an equilibrium shift liu and hurt 2010 based on their observations and experiments liu and hurt developed the following equation liu and hurt 2010 1 2 a g s 1 2 o 2 a q 2 h 2 a g a q h 2 o l this dissolution process is furthermore influenced by the concentration of ag b nps and the constituents of natural water bodies like natural organic matter nom and in the case of seawater high chloride contents the dissolution rate is accelerated with decreasing ag b np concentration toncelli et al 2017 nom was reported to facilitate dissolution of ag b nps in aqueous matrices by complexation of ag i and shifting of the equilibrium loza et al 2014 chloride present in aqueous matrices is able to eventually trap ag i from the cooperative oxidation of ag 0 to form soluble agclx 1 x x 1 complexes according to the general rules of reaction equilibrium this trapping process might accelerate the dissolution in seawater however liu et al reported that an incubation of ag b nps at mg l 1 range in seawater actually slowed down the dissolution process compared to an incubation in upw in reality the higher ph of seawater in contrast to upw inverts the equilibrium shift induced by the complexation of ag i by cl liu and hurt 2010 however especially for low ag b np concentrations in seawater this may no longer be the case there have been several studies focusing on the fate of ag b nps in seawater teo et al found that the ag b np dissolution at an initial ag b np concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 was much faster in seawater than in ultra pure upw water or lake water teo and pumera 2014 additionally for nanoparticle concentrations of 200 ng l 1 and 2000 ng l 1 a decrease in size and concentration with increasing time was observed when dispersed in seawater with the dissolution rate being influenced by the thickness of the particles coatings toncelli et al 2017 furthermore it has been reported that albeit to a very little extent ag b nps can be freshly formed from an interaction of dissolved ag i with nom toncelli et al 2017 however the ag b np concentrations used in those studies were in the sub μg l 1 to upper μg l 1 range lodeiro et al 2017 teo and pumera 2014 toncelli et al 2017 which by far exceeds concentrations found in natural samples which are typically in the pg l 1 to lower ng l 1 range li et al 2016 sun et al 2016 wimmer et al 2018 furthermore previous studies on the fate of ag b nps in seawater used 200 ng l 1 of polyethyleneimine and polyvinylpyrrilidone coated ag nps for their experiments toncelli et al 2017 which do not exist in nature on the contrary kaegi et al were able to show that ag nps entering a wwtp are sulfidized to a variable degree independent of their original coating kaegi et al 2011 2013 for our work we used naturally relevant silver nanoparticle modifications such as silver sulfide silver chloride and core silver nanoparticles at an environmentally relevant concentration of 50 ng l 1 our goal was to study the fate and stability of the nanoparticles once they were released into a seawater matrix the salinity of seawater which is the mass fraction of dissolved material in seawater is 35 17 g kg 1 the majority of the salinity is represented by cl at a mass fraction of 19 35 g kg 1 followed by na with a mass fraction of 10 78 g kg 1 so4 2 with a mass fraction of 2 71 g kg 1 and mg2 1 28 g kg 1 ca2 0 41 g kg 1 and k 0 40 g kg 1 millero et al 2008 the contribution of nacl to the total cl content calculated from this data is 85 9 such a high salt content causes instrumental problems in icp ms measurement e g cone clogging and both spectral and non spectral interferences dilution of the samples helps to avoid these problems but it also leads to a significant loss of detection power we therefore used cloud point extraction cpe which is a highly selective separation and enrichment technique enabling ag b np extraction from complex aqueous solutions regardless of particle coating and without changing particle size and chemical composition hartmann et al 2013 2014 dissolved silver nom and other particulate matter are tolerated in concentrations up to 100 μg l 1 100 mg l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 respectively after cpe the enriched and separated ag b nps can be forwarded to icp ms measurement for ag concentration analysis and or sp icp ms for particle number and size determination our experiments were furthermore supplemented by transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy to investigate the composition and possible transformation of the nanoparticles during incubation in seawater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ag i icp standard agno3 in 3 hno3 βag 1000 mg l 1

penicillamine and sodium sulfide na2s were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa ca ag nps used in this study exhibited two different size distributions whereas sp icp ms measurements details are given in the supporting information si figs s1 and s2 revealed maximum frequency particle sizes of 24 nm and 58 nm it should be noted that throughout the entire study particle sizes are given as maximum frequency sizes we chose to use the maximum frequency sizes in order to enable comparison among widely varying particle types and size distributions the maximum frequency size is the size that the most frequent particles comprising the entire distribution exhibit on the basis on number frequency in all examined cases this value was identical to the one determined on the basis of mass frequency therefore particle size distributions themselves are usually presented as mass frequency unless otherwise specified since ca ag np dispersions contain impurities of dissolved ag the stock

hydrogen phthalate containing 0 5 10 mg l 1 toc were measured for calibration samples were measured without filtration and further acidified and thoroughly mixed shortly before the measurement started to ensure sample homogeneity and remove inorganic carbonates 2 3 nanoparticle synthesis and characterization silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s np were synthesized according to a procedure published by

changing the water twice a day in order to separate the nanoparticles from the dissolved silver species and matrix constituents the dialyzed np suspensions were then stored in the dark at 5 c and were stable for weeks particle size distribution shape and chemical composition of the synthesized ag2s nps and agcl nps as well as ca ag nps were determined by s tem edx 2 4 incubation and separation of

species and the highly saline matrix duester et al 2016 hartmann et al 2013 hartmann and schuster 2013 in brief 40 ml of each sample were mixed with aqueous solutions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt d penicillamine sodium acetate acetic acid and the surfactant tx 114 hartmann et al 2013 2014 wimmer et al 2018 after incubation at 40 c for 30 min separation of the surfactant phase was enhanced by centrifugation 12 min 4500 g the phase separated mixtures were cooled 5 min ice bath and the aqueous supernatant was then removed by decanting details as well as the trueness and robustness of the cpe procedure are described by hartmann et al 2013 2014 the remaining surfactant droplets containing the extracted and enriched ag b nps were diluted with ethanol 500 μl and upw to a total volume of 10 ml for the icp ms and sp icp ms measurements samples are divided into further sub samples those intended for sp icp ms analysis are forwarded to measurement without further treatment sub samples intended for conventional icp ms analysis are further mixed with hno3 yielding in a final acid concentration of 1 625 v v hno3 is used to dissolve nps in cpe extracts to increase sample homogeneity 2 5 determination of concentration and particle size of ag b nps in cpe extracts conventional icp ms was used to quantify total ag concentration in the cpe extracts in most cases these measurements were supplemented by sp icp ms measurements which allow for the calculation of ag b np particle size in the cpe extracts by measuring the total mass of each single ag b np in the sample and eventually for the calculation of the total concentration of ag b nps by summation of each single ag b np mass calibration was performed with aqueous ag i solutions of known concentration

quantitative sp icp ms measurements were performed with non acidified cpe extracts calibration samples 52 ng l 1 ca aunp dispersion and 1 μg l 1 ag i solution were prepared in a upw matrix including 5

some uncertainties as they assume a spherical shape for all particles and require knowledge about the density ρ of the particulate materials peters et al 2014 which is derived from the bulk materials ag ρ 10 49 g cm 3 agcl ρ 7 23 g cm 3 and ag2s ρ 5 56 g cm 3 according to the gestis substance database dec 2018 in the case of ag b nps in real environmental samples wwtp effluent the np modification is unknown but very likely ag2s kaegi et al 2013 despite its limitations sp icp ms is still the only method able to simultaneously determine concentration and particle size distribution of nps at ng l 1 concentration levels so it is the method of choice size detection limit sdl for sp icp ms measurement of ag b nps was determined to 8 nm transient signals deriving from nanoparticles being atomized in the plasma of the icp ms are registered during the measurement the signal size corresponds to the size of the corresponding nanoparticle i e small particles lead to only very little signals signals of smaller particles in the time resolved sp mass spectra are not distinguishable anymore from signals derived from traces of dissolved ag species or the instrument s background and are thus not applicable for data processing thus concentrations measured by sp icp ms represent the total ag concentration of all particulate ag species sized 8 nm 2 6 characterization of size morphology and chemical composition of ag b nps incubated in real seawaters mass spectrometric analysis was supplemented by electron microscopy to investigate the fate of ag b nps in highly saline matrices to meet limits of detection for tem edx ag b np dispersions were mixed 1 10 with real seawater resulting in a total volume of 1 5 ml and incubated for 1 h afterwards samples were filled in 3 5 kda regenerated cellulose membranes surrounded by 1 l upw to perform a dialysis for 24 h upw was replaced every 4 h dialysis can eliminate both ag i deriving from potentially dissolved ag b nps and the high saline seawater matrix which would otherwise cause incrustations on the tem grid a droplet of each prepared sample was examined by tem edx as described in the instrumentation section and compared to nps which had not been in contact with seawater 2 7 error calculations for all measurements three independent subsamples were treated and measured individually each subsample was measured with three replicates n u n 3 the uncertainty u was calculated via gaussian error propagation based on pipetting uncertainties and standard deviations of the independently measured subsamples blank samples were used to correct ag concentrations in all incubation experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoparticle characterization the chemical composition shape and particle size of the commercially available and synthesized particles were analyzed to gain information about the pristine state of the particles prior to any incubation experiments for this purpose dispersions of the freshly synthesized and purified ca ag nps agcl nps and ag2s nps were prepared on copper grids and investigated with stem and edx stem measurement of both types of ca ag nps showed spherical sole particles with a particle size range of approximately 42 120 nm si fig s1 and 14 100 nm si fig s2 maximum frequency particle sizes were determined by sp icp ms as 24 nm and 58 nm respectively an examplary image of a particle sizing 53 nm and the corresponding edx spectrum are given in fig 1 the particle related signals indicate that the core of the particle consists of pure silver the synthesized agcl nps showed cubic non aggregated particles with a broad size range of approximately 18 200 nm si fig s3 with a maximum frequency particle size of 94 nm determined by sp icp ms fig 2 shows an example of a stem adf image of a agcl np cube with a side length of 100 nm and the corresponding edx spectrum the edx spectrum reveals a ag to cl ratio of 1 1 which complies with the presence of agcl particles fig 3 shows a tem image of the synthesized ag2s nps and the corresponding edx spectrum in this case some bridging between neighboring particles occurred and some particles show small cavities a narrow particle size distribution was observed with a size range of 48 160 nm si fig s4 and a maximum frequency particle size of 82 nm determined by sp icp ms edx measurements revealed a ag to s ratio of 2 1 which indicates the presence of ag2s nps obviously the reaction of ca ag nps with sulfide resulted in the formation of fully sulfurized particles combined with an increase in the average size of the particles from 58 nm to 82 nm si fig s4 3 2 dissolution of differently coated and sized ag b nps incubated in upw artificial seawater and real seawater we examined the fate of differently coated and sized ag b nps in upw artificial seawater and real seawater our preliminary tests prior to the incubation experiments confirmed the applicability of cpe to species selectively extract and enrich ag b nps from saline matrices extraction efficiency for ag b nps even increased from 88 in the upw matrix to 94 in the highly saline matrix moreover the co extraction of soluble ag i species from highly saline matrices into the organic phase amounted to less than one percent therefore cpe is suitable to i quantitatively extract ag b nps from highly saline matrices into the organic phase and to ii perform this process species selectively in other words soluble ag i species deriving from former ag b nps by means of dissolution in saline matrices are prevented from being transported into the organic phase we applied a dual approach for investigating the fate of ag b nps in upw and highly saline matrices first we quantified the total concentration of ag b nps present after a certain incubation time whereby these particles were thus able to resist an occurring np dissolution process concentrations related to ag for these remaining ag b nps in each incubation matrix upw artificial and real seawater with increasing incubation time measured by cpe icp ms are shown in fig 4 and table s1 see si table s1 includes further concentration data measured for the same samples by cpe sp icp ms these concentrations represent the concentration of particles 8 nm second we were able to display the change in sizes of ag b nps being incubated in the different matrices for increasing incubation time by cpe sp icp ms measurements fig 5 all experiments started with an initial ag b np concentration of 50 ng l 1 fig 4 as mentioned above comparison of cpe icp ms and cpe sp icp ms allowed differentiation between concentration of the total amount of particulate ag species and those 8 nm si table s1 in most cases cpe sp icp ms was not able to quantify all particulate species since low concentrations of particles 8 nm were present however no correlation between the appearance of particles 8 nm and incubation time matrix and np coating was detected as already described in the literature cooperative oxidation processes transforming ag 0 to soluble ag i species followed by formation of soluble agclx 1 x x 1 in the presence of chloride levard et al 2012 liu and hurt 2010 lodeiro et al 2017 basically led to dissolution of all types of ag b nps in the three different matrices upw establishes massive dilution pressure readily transforming large parts of particulate ag 0 into dissolved ag i species by an equilibrium shift to dissolved ag species equation 1 which is further promoted by the comparatively low ph of upw 5 6 compared to non purified or natural water 7 8 liu and hurt 2010 after an incubation period of 3 h in the upw matrix only 87 of the initially applied ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size remained as particles it should be noted that the sizes in brackets represent the mean pristine particle size before incubation which is enclosed for the sake of clarity after the same incubation time only 1 of the initially applied ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size remained due to the extremely large intrinsic surface of these small particles oxidation to dissolved ag i is massively promoted for smaller particles zhang et al 2011 after 3 h of incubation in upw 26 of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size remained particulate since the agcl particles initially exhibited a maximum frequency particle size of 94 nm we would suggest a slow dissolution process however we observed quite high dissolution rates for agcl nps which can be explained by the fact that ag in agcl is already present in oxidation state i accelerating the cooperative oxidation process responsible for the dissolution liu and hurt 2010 since 69 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size resisted dissolution after 3 h of incubation the high insolubility of ag2s seems to compensate for the ag oxidation state of i and thus prohibits these particles from fast dissolution the general trend continued with increasing incubation time to 72 h whereby 42 of the initially applied ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size 26 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size 10 of ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 1 of agcl np 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size resisted dissolution overall ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size seemed to be the most stable modification of ag b nps in upw followed by ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size this is somewhat surprising since silver sulfide is one of the most insoluble salts however ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size exceeded this insolubility likely due to the fact that the coating reagent can slow down the oxidative dissolution process citrate coating has already been reported to be able to reduce ag i to ag 0 forming either new particles or being inserted into already existing particles kittler et al 2010 the presence of chloride able to trap ag i and thus shift the dissolution equilibrium liu and hurt 2010 leads to increasing dissolution rates for all types of ag b nps in artificial seawater after an incubation of 3 h only 3 of the initially applied ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size 5 of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size 22 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 39 of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size resisted dissolution and remained particulate after 72 h the dissolution process in seawater was almost finished in contrast to incubation in upw matrix where 11 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 1 4 of the other ag b nps were still present as particulate species again small particle sizes encouraged dissolution as ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size were dissolved significantly faster than ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size again ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and ag2s nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size were more stable than ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size dissolution rates reached their maximum in experiments involving real seawater as the incubation matrix this observation is only partially reflected in the current literature liu et al described that dissolution rates for ag b nps in the mg l 1 range incubated in seawater even decreased to some extent because the comparatively high ph 8 in seawater shifts the equilibrium of the dissolution process at the expense of dissolved ag i species liu and hurt 2010 however reducing the ag b np concentration to an environmentally relevant level of some ng l 1 was reported to accelerate the dissolution process toncelli et al 2017 in our experiment the latter case seems to prevail and it controls the dissolution process in real seawater in general we observed a dramatic drop in the concentration of remaining nps in seawater within the first 3 h whereas only 24 of the initially applied ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size 9 of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size 6 of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 2 of ca ag nps 24 nm maximum frequency size were still present as nps in seawater after incubation for 72 h only 1 9 of ag b nps resisted dissolution in seawater it is remarkable that some particles of all types of ag b nps could still be detected indicating a certain stability of particle traces in seawater this partial dissolution of ag b nps in aqueous matrices even after incubating for several days has also been described by loza et al 2014 again ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size showed only low stability during the incubation experiment in seawater for the aforementioned reasons ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size displayed slightly higher stability very interestingly ag2s nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size even surpassed the stability of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size marginally which could not be observed in any of the incubation experiments described above this observation probably goes along with high concentrations of sulfate present in real seawater which was not the case for upw and artificial seawater indicating the stability of silver sulfide coatings however the presence of sulfide coatings requires the reduction of s vi in sulfate to s ii in sulfide which might take place to a small extent by integrating sulfate into the aforementioned cooperative oxidation reactions liu and hurt 2010 cpe sp icp ms provides an even more detailed insight into the np dissolution process fig 5 as it describes the evolution of particle size distributions over time particle size distributions for ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size are given as normalized mass frequency we chose this kind of presentation because very small particles 8 nm are present to a varying extent in all samples but contribute only very little to the total particle mass however particles 8 nm would misleadingly affect the particle size distributions if presented as normalized number frequency for ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size presenting normalized number frequencies was feasible due to the narrow range of small particle sizes in depth analysis of sp icp ms data revealed additional information regarding particle numbers and their variation after incubation in aqueous matrices table 1 fig 5a shows blank corrected particle size distributions of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size incubated in upw for 1 h 24 h 48 h and 72 h as seen in fig 4 si table s1 the np concentration was reduced by dissolution to 42 within 72 h however the np size distribution did not change during the observed incubation period so the maximum frequency size table 1 stayed constant during the experiment which is due to the fact that primarily small particles were readily dissolved thus not influencing the maximum frequency size of approximately 58 nm we observed a rapid decrease of the total particle number within the first hour of incubation table 1 whereas particles 30 nm in particular were dissolved due to their high intrinsic surface the small particle fraction was dissolved first during the following days almost all particles 30 nm were dissolved whereas the number of particles 30 nm was reduced slightly indicating their predominant stability incubation of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size in artificial seawater fig 5b led to a reduction of the maximum frequency size of the particles from 58 nm to 46 nm within the first day of incubation which goes along with a decrease in np concentration figs 4 and si table s1 table 1 shows that particles 30 nm in particular were dissolved whereas the number of particles 30 nm stayed constant or increased however it is very likely that particles 30 nm were still dissolved but the simultaneous dissolution of particles 30 nm also led to the formation of particles 30 nm after 48 h of incubation the maximum frequency particle size was reduced dramatically to 10 nm because a large proportion of particles was dissolved in this case the number of particles 30 nm and 30 nm was reduced equally in contrast to an incubation of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size in artificial seawater the rapid concentration drop for an incubation in seawater occurred earlier after 24 h of incubation figs 4 and si table s1 this goes along with a strong decrease of the maximum np frequency size from 58 nm to 12 nm after the same incubation period table 1 fig 5c in fig 5c particles exhibiting a maximum frequency particle size of 58 nm with a size range of approximately 14 100 nm were only observable until 1 h of incubation particles 30 nm were almost completely dissolved after 24 h of incubation table 1 again shrinking of particles 30 nm contributed to a constant number of particles 30 nm despite the accelerated dissolution of small particles taking place as well this fast shrinking process was enhanced at an increasing salinity of the incubation matrix for ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size only traces of ag b nps were detectable after 24 h of incubation in seawater fig 4 table s1 the maximum frequency particle size was reduced from 24 nm to approximately 10 nm during the entire incubation period fig 5d moreover a fast drop in the np number was observed after an incubation time of 24 h whereas particles 16 nm accounted for the predominant particulate species table 1 particle size distributions of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size became narrower within the first 24 h of incubation fig 5e whereby maximum frequency particle sizes were hardly reduced from initially 73 nm to 69 nm however we observed a rapid drop in concentration fig 4 table s1 and particle number table 1 whereas nps 30 nm and 30 nm were dissolved equally as expected smaller particles were dissolved faster due to their high intrinsic surface dramatically shrunk ag2s nps formerly exhibiting sizes 30 nm contributed as additional particles 30 nm with decreasing proportion of particles 30 nm and the almost complete dissolution of initial 82 nm particles during the days of incubation the concentration of smaller particles increased in fig 5e thus particles of all sizes were affected by dissolution in seawater whereas the dissolution of initial 82 nm particles resulted in a large number of remaining particles 30 nm after only 1 h of incubation the mean particle size of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size incubated in seawater massively decreased from 94 nm to 15 nm whereas the initial broad particle size distribution approximately ranging from 60 150 nm was completely reversed after 1 h fig 5f see also si fig s6 for another perspective the experiment started with approximately 800 particles 30 nm table 1 and no measurable particles 30 nm but after only 1 h of incubation in seawater the number of particles 30 nm increased dramatically to approximately 7 000 and the number of particles 30 nm doubled this indicates that agcl nps 30 nm were dissolved or even broken up forming thousands of smaller particles with a broad size range from 8 120 nm with an increasing incubation time of 24 h or longer the concentration of particles 30 nm as well as the total concentration of agcl nps still present in seawater was reduced to marginal values thus nps 30 nm were dissolved quickly in seawater in favor of residual smaller particles which contribute only very little to the total concentration of nps present in seawater overall cpe sp icp ms allows for the determination of particle sizes of ag b nps incubated in aqueous matrices at environmentally relevant concentration levels particle sizes were reduced while this process depended on the particle coating and was accelerated by increasing salinity of the incubation media regarding long term incubation of 72 h no relevant ag b np concentrations sustained the most extreme conditions seawater constitutes for all kinds of investigated particles for a short term observation however our results show that larger ag b nps of 30 nm freshly released into seawater are transformed within 72 h to small particles 30 nm this may lead to a short term increase in the environmental eco toxicity and bioavailability of these particles which are believed to be more critical in this respect than larger particles kittler et al 2010 in addition to the concentration and particle size of ag b nps their surface modification and chemical composition influence the eco toxicology of these contaminants in the aqueous environment as a result we supplemented our examination of ag b nps in saline matrices with stem edx measurements no changes in the chemical composition of ca ag nps and agcl nps after incubation for 1 h in sea water were detected by stem edx rather small d 20 nm ag2s nps were detected using stem after incubation in seawater fig 6 furthermore tem images show that ag2s np aggregate and form ag2s bridges to neighboring particles when being incubated in seawater si fig s5 which is not the case for freshly prepared nanoparticle suspensions this is a fully expected result based on the dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 lodeiro et al 2016 quik et al 2014 verwey 1947 increasing ionic strength in sea water reduces particles stability and thus promotes aggregation some of the particles also have cavities edx measurement showed that a ratio of ag s of 1 1 occurred in such particles the signals arising from mg si among others came either from the seawater matrix or tem grids the changing ratio of ag s from the initial 2 1 fig 3 to 1 1 indicates that silver is dissolved while sulfur is accumulating around the particles when incubated in seawater 3 3 influence of incubation temperature and natural organic matter beyond the influence of nanoparticle coatings and matrix composition on the fate of ag b nps in seawater we investigated the effect of increasing incubation temperature on the stability of ag b nps in real seawater see si table s2 for detailed measured values starting again with 50 ng l 1 ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size we found that 55 of the initial nps remained in the solutions after 1 h of incubation at a temperature of 23 c and 61 at a temperature of 60 c after increasing the incubation time to 2 h 49 of the initial nps remained at a temperature of 23 c and 44 remained at a temperature of 60 c comparable concentrations of remaining nps independent of the applied incubation temperature indicates that there is no significant temperature effect on the dissolution of ag b nps in seawater similar observations were made for all other types of ag b nps nom plays an important role in ag b np transformation processes in aqueous environments on the one hand nom is able to decelerate ag b np dissolution effects in natural water bodies by blocking potential ag oxidation sites of the nps after adsorption by serving as an oxidative sink in the cooperative redox system by nom oxidation and finally by allowing a reversible reaction of formed ag i to ag 0 with nom as the reductant liu and hurt 2010 the last point in particular is crucial for an environmentally relevant system containing dissolved ag i species since they are readily reduced to ag 0 by nom forming new ag b nps wimmer et al have already reported on evidences that this process takes place in nature and is responsible for the existence of naturally formed ag b nps in the aqueous environment wimmer et al 2018 as a result we compared dispersions of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size incubated in seawater for 1 h and 72 h with nom 5 mg l 1 and without nom see si table s3 for detailed measured values for ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size after 1 h incubation we found 74 83 with nom remaining particles which were reduced to 16 4 after 72 h in the case of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size 87 91 with nom of initially inserted nps remained as particles after 1 h of incubation whereas only 13 2 were left after 72 h as these values illustrate nom did not protect ag b nps from dissolution in seawater within the first hour of incubation there is no distinct effect of nom observable but after 72 h nom increased the dissolved number of nps for both types of ag b nps dramatically in contrast to common expectations nom did support ag b np dissolution the most likely explanation for this suprising behavior is that nom forms complexes with dissolved ag i species removes them from the ag 0 ag i equilibrium and therefore accelerates the dissolution process liu and hurt 2010 3 4 dissolution of ag b nps in wwtp effluent the main contamination source respectively the main entry phase for ag b nps into the aquatic environment is wastewater released e g by wwtps ag b nps in waste water are usually sulfidized to a large degree and most likely consist of ag2s kaegi et al 2013 in addition to experiments with synthesized particles of known composition we also investigated the fate of real particles in freshly sampled wwtp effluent with and without the addition of sodium chloride which was added to the solutions prior to incubation to obtain a final salt concentration of 31 g l 1 nacl the initial total ag b np concentration in the effluent was 17 45 1 19 ng l 1 measured with cpe icp ms and 9 19 0 02 ng l 1 measured with cpe sp icp ms indicating that the solutions contained significant quantities of small particles 8 nm the mean particle size based on number frequency for particles 8 nm measured by cpe sp icp ms was 22 nm pristine maximum frequency size see fig 7 after incubation for 72 h the solutions contained a total ag b np concentration of 4 60 0 41 ng l 1 and 3 70 0 27 ng l 1 for particles 8 nm with a mean particle size of 14 nm 16 nm maximum frequency size obviously ag b nps contained in the effluent solutions were not stable in this matrix even under dark conditions and the data reveal that mainly small particles were dissolved the addition of sodium chloride prior to incubation increased particle dissolution dramatically after an incubation time of 72 h a total ag b np concentration of 2 86 0 42 ng l 1 and 1 51 0 06 ng l 1 for particles 8 nm with a mean particle size of 11 nm 10 nm maximum frequency size was observed ag b nps that are present in real environmental samples obviously share the fate of particles investigated in the model experiments described above ag b nps dissolve within 72 h to a large extent whereas the dissolution is accelerated in the presence of chloride particle dissolution goes along with the reduced particle sizes presented in fig 7 however dissolution took place more slowly than in the model experiments a complex interrelation between nom present in the wwtp effluent toc 2 3 mg l 1 trapping ag i and shifting the equilibrium towards enhanced dissolution loza et al 2014 and the ability of nom to protect ag b np from dissolution by reduction of ag i to ag 0 forming new particles toncelli et al 2017 is among other things responsible for decreased dissolution rates nevertheless ag b nps initially contained in wwtp effluent and transported by rivers to the sea can be expected to be dissolved within a short period of time 4 conclusion all types of ag b nps were largely dissolved within a reasonable amount of time whereby dissolution rates increased with the salinity of the incubation matrix ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size were dissolved significantly faster than ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size due to their higher intrinsic surface additionally we particularly examined environmentally more relevant ag b nps namely ag2s and agcl nps because these particles are believed to be the most predominant species in the environment kaegi et al 2013 ma et al 2014 nowack et al 2012 sharma et al 2015 ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size displayed higher stability compared to agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size all four examined particle types were dissolved almost completely in real seawater within three days ag b nps as a potential threat to marine environmental health is extensively discussed in the literature however our results confirm that ca ag nps in environmentally relevant concentrations are not stable in seawater for more than three days agcl nps and even ag2s nps share this fate despite the low solubility of the corresponding salts locally arising increased concentrations of soluble ag i species caused by the dissolution of ag b nps may affect the health of the environment but only for a limited time and it may be compensated by a massive dilution effect of ag i in the oceans once ag b nps reach the sea they are dissolved and no longer constitute a significant risk to environmental health funding this research project was financed by the bavarian state ministry for the environment and consumer protection tnt01natfue69458

18214,silver based nanoparticles ag b nps in the environment are of current concern as they may pose risks to human and environmental health even at low concentration levels it is widely known that ag b nps once released from products containing these particles for antimicrobial reasons can pass through wastewater treatment plants to some extent these particles are transported via running waterways and eventually reach the sea however the fate of environmentally relevant ng l 1 traces of ag b nps in seawater has not yet been sufficiently studied analytical techniques capable of determining these ultratraces of ag b nps in seawater are scarce and struggle furthermore with the high chloride content in highly saline matrices such as seawater in this study we extracted ag b nps from matrices with varying salinity via cloud point extraction cpe and determined concentration and size of ag b nps in extracts with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms applying this extraction and measurement technique we were able to investigate the fate of ag b nps with different coatings citrate and the predominant coatings in nature silver sulfide and silver chloride in matrices with increasing salinity and real seawater all types of ag b nps were dissolved in all matrices almost independently of the chemical composition of the nanoparticles nps whereas dissolution rates increased with increasing salinity due to the formation of soluble ag i species and in the presence of chloride agclx 1 x x 1 complexes after an incubation time of not more than 72 h ag b nps were dissolved almost completely during the dissolution process np shrinkage could be clearly observed by sp icp ms supplementary electron microscopy measurements revealed that the sulfur content in silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps increased during the dissolution process finally we were able to investigate the dissolution process of real ag b nps in wastewater after increasing the salinity to seawater levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver nanoparticles fate seawater cloud point extraction single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry electron microscopy 1 introduction due to the growing use of silver nanoparticles ag nps in commercially available products and applications such as food storage containers sporting goods fabrics food additives in animal feed cosmetics medical devices and many others kim et al 2010 peters et al 2014 these nanoparticles are increasingly released into the environment this has intensified the discussion about concerns regarding environmental compatibility of ag nps several studies have dealt with the toxicity of silver nanoparticles in organs ahamed et al 2010 krug 2014 kumar et al 2017 wiemann et al 2017 and metabolic pathways foldbjerg et al 2009 gopinath et al 2010 park et al 2010 ribeiro et al 2015 wise et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 in addition to silver ions generated by dissolution of nanoparticles ag nps themselves are believed to negatively affect organisms asharani et al 2008 2009 beer et al 2012 kim et al 2009 qian et al 2013 silver in this particulate form is believed to surpass even the ecotoxicological hazards of the corresponding bulk material hansen and baun 2012 pettitt and lead 2013 therefore ag nps should be monitored and analyzed in environmental samples in order to understand their fate and distribution in the environment especially addressing the question of how environmental matrices influence particle dissolution and aggregation pasricha et al 2012 once released into the environment ag nps interact readily with naturally occurring organic and inorganic substances and thus undergo a broad variety of surface modifications which include adsorption of organic molecules present in the environment or reactions with e g dissolved species resulting in ag2s or agcl coatings whereas ag2s dominates environmentally relevant surface modifications kaegi et al 2011 2013 2015 therefore ag nps in the environment are described hereinafter as silver based nanoparticles ag b nps so as to take every kind of surface modification into account li et al showed that over 94 6 of ag b nps were removed from wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent but still resulted in an ag b np concentration ranging from 0 7 to 11 1 ng l 1 in the effluent released into the environment li et al 2016 these nanoparticles are transported in rivers and finally reach the sea and the resulting fate of ag b nps can be characterized by two main processes aggregation and dissolution the derjaguin landau verwey overbeak dlvo theory describes the stability of nanoparticle dispersions in aqueous matrices as an interplay of van der waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion derjaguin and landau 1993 lodeiro et al 2016 quik et al 2014 verwey 1947 once nanoparticles nps are dispersed in matrices of high ionic strength e g seawater the net charge of the particles deriving from the corresponding electric double layer surrounding the particles is reduced this results in an increase of remaining attractive forces encouraging attachment and thus aggregation of nps lodeiro et al 2016 consequently it is believed that ag b nps are not transported long distances in seawater however toncelli et al observed that the dissolution process dominates the fate of ag b nps in seawater at low concentrations ng l 1 range completely compensating for a dlvo type aggregation effect toncelli et al 2017 in general the dissolution of ag b nps is best described by a widely accepted model established by liu and hurt 2010 ag b nps in aqueous matrices undergo a cooperative oxidation process involving dissolved oxygen and protons forming peroxide intermediates and eventually water simultaneously ag 0 is readily oxidized to dissolved ag i which is encouraged by a relatively low redox gap of 0 8 v liu and hurt 2010 toncelli et al 2017 liu and hart did not observe ag b np dissolution in deoxygenated seawater and they were able to decrease it at a reduced ph due to an equilibrium shift liu and hurt 2010 based on their observations and experiments liu and hurt developed the following equation liu and hurt 2010 1 2 a g s 1 2 o 2 a q 2 h 2 a g a q h 2 o l this dissolution process is furthermore influenced by the concentration of ag b nps and the constituents of natural water bodies like natural organic matter nom and in the case of seawater high chloride contents the dissolution rate is accelerated with decreasing ag b np concentration toncelli et al 2017 nom was reported to facilitate dissolution of ag b nps in aqueous matrices by complexation of ag i and shifting of the equilibrium loza et al 2014 chloride present in aqueous matrices is able to eventually trap ag i from the cooperative oxidation of ag 0 to form soluble agclx 1 x x 1 complexes according to the general rules of reaction equilibrium this trapping process might accelerate the dissolution in seawater however liu et al reported that an incubation of ag b nps at mg l 1 range in seawater actually slowed down the dissolution process compared to an incubation in upw in reality the higher ph of seawater in contrast to upw inverts the equilibrium shift induced by the complexation of ag i by cl liu and hurt 2010 however especially for low ag b np concentrations in seawater this may no longer be the case there have been several studies focusing on the fate of ag b nps in seawater teo et al found that the ag b np dissolution at an initial ag b np concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 was much faster in seawater than in ultra pure upw water or lake water teo and pumera 2014 additionally for nanoparticle concentrations of 200 ng l 1 and 2000 ng l 1 a decrease in size and concentration with increasing time was observed when dispersed in seawater with the dissolution rate being influenced by the thickness of the particles coatings toncelli et al 2017 furthermore it has been reported that albeit to a very little extent ag b nps can be freshly formed from an interaction of dissolved ag i with nom toncelli et al 2017 however the ag b np concentrations used in those studies were in the sub μg l 1 to upper μg l 1 range lodeiro et al 2017 teo and pumera 2014 toncelli et al 2017 which by far exceeds concentrations found in natural samples which are typically in the pg l 1 to lower ng l 1 range li et al 2016 sun et al 2016 wimmer et al 2018 furthermore previous studies on the fate of ag b nps in seawater used 200 ng l 1 of polyethyleneimine and polyvinylpyrrilidone coated ag nps for their experiments toncelli et al 2017 which do not exist in nature on the contrary kaegi et al were able to show that ag nps entering a wwtp are sulfidized to a variable degree independent of their original coating kaegi et al 2011 2013 for our work we used naturally relevant silver nanoparticle modifications such as silver sulfide silver chloride and core silver nanoparticles at an environmentally relevant concentration of 50 ng l 1 our goal was to study the fate and stability of the nanoparticles once they were released into a seawater matrix the salinity of seawater which is the mass fraction of dissolved material in seawater is 35 17 g kg 1 the majority of the salinity is represented by cl at a mass fraction of 19 35 g kg 1 followed by na with a mass fraction of 10 78 g kg 1 so4 2 with a mass fraction of 2 71 g kg 1 and mg2 1 28 g kg 1 ca2 0 41 g kg 1 and k 0 40 g kg 1 millero et al 2008 the contribution of nacl to the total cl content calculated from this data is 85 9 such a high salt content causes instrumental problems in icp ms measurement e g cone clogging and both spectral and non spectral interferences dilution of the samples helps to avoid these problems but it also leads to a significant loss of detection power we therefore used cloud point extraction cpe which is a highly selective separation and enrichment technique enabling ag b np extraction from complex aqueous solutions regardless of particle coating and without changing particle size and chemical composition hartmann et al 2013 2014 dissolved silver nom and other particulate matter are tolerated in concentrations up to 100 μg l 1 100 mg l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 respectively after cpe the enriched and separated ag b nps can be forwarded to icp ms measurement for ag concentration analysis and or sp icp ms for particle number and size determination our experiments were furthermore supplemented by transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy to investigate the composition and possible transformation of the nanoparticles during incubation in seawater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ag i icp standard agno3 in 3 hno3 βag 1000 mg l 1

are given in the supporting information si figs s1 and s2 revealed maximum frequency particle sizes of 24 nm and 58 nm it should be noted that throughout the entire study particle sizes are given as maximum frequency sizes we chose to use the maximum frequency sizes in order to enable comparison among widely varying particle types and size distributions the maximum frequency size is the size that the most frequent particles comprising the entire distribution exhibit on the basis on number frequency in all examined cases this value was identical to the one determined on the basis of mass frequency therefore particle size distributions themselves are usually presented as mass frequency unless otherwise specified since ca ag np dispersions contain impurities of dissolved ag the stock

effluent samples was determined with a toc l analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan following a standard protocol with potassium hydrogen phthalate as the calibrant therefore aqueous solutions of potassium hydrogen phthalate containing 0 5 10 mg l 1 toc were measured for calibration samples were measured without filtration and further acidified and thoroughly mixed shortly before the measurement started to ensure sample homogeneity and remove inorganic carbonates 2 3 nanoparticle synthesis and characterization silver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s np were synthesized according to a procedure published by hartmann et al 2014 for this purpose 0 2 ml of a 10 mm na2s solution were added to 10 ml of a suspension containing 58 nm ca ag np βag 10 mg l 1 the mixture was stirred for 3 h in the dark at room temperature rt silver chloride nanoparticles agcl nps were prepared following a procedure proposed by zhou et al 2017 in this case 8 5 mg agno3 and 25 mg tx 114 were added to 50 ml of upw the solution was mixed dropwise with 1 ml of a 50 mm nacl solution and was further stirred in the dark at rt for another 30 min the synthesized ag2s and agcl suspensions were dialyzed in the dark for three days changing the water twice a day in order to separate the nanoparticles from the dissolved silver species and matrix constituents the dialyzed np suspensions were then stored in the dark at 5 c and were stable for weeks particle size distribution shape and chemical composition of the synthesized ag2s nps and agcl nps as well as ca ag nps were determined by s tem edx 2 4 incubation and separation of ag b nps from highly saline matrices artificial seawater with 31 g l 1 nacl and real seawater were mixed with aqueous dispersions of ca ag nps 24 nm 58 nm maximum frequency size synthesized agcl nps and ag2s nps to gain dispersions with a volume of 40 ml and an ag concentration of 50 ng l 1 for reasons of comparability similar np dispersions were prepared in upw the influence of nom on the stability of ag b nps in seawater was examined by adding 5 mg l 1 srnom to the aforementioned samples wwtp effluent containing real ag b nps was collected from a plant in southern germany wwtp garching capacity 4 100 m3 day 1 building date 1999 using disposable 500 ml pvc bottles which were rinsed three times with the sample matrix prior to sampling to obtain a final salt concentration of 31 g l 1 nacl was added in small portions while vigorously stirring to avoid localized salt overconcentration all incubation experiments were prepared in triplicate protected from light shaken and incubated for a certain period 1 h 2 h 3 h 24 h 48 h 72 h during incubation ag b nps may be partly or completely dissolved cpe was used for selective enrichment of ag b nps from dissolved silver species and the highly saline matrix duester et al 2016 hartmann et al 2013 hartmann and schuster 2013 in brief 40 ml of each sample were mixed with aqueous solutions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt d penicillamine sodium acetate acetic acid and the surfactant tx 114 hartmann et al 2013 2014 wimmer et al 2018 after incubation at 40 c for 30 min separation of the surfactant phase was enhanced by centrifugation 12 min 4500 g the phase separated mixtures were cooled 5 min ice bath and the aqueous supernatant was then removed by decanting details as well as the trueness and robustness of the cpe procedure are described by hartmann et al 2013 2014 the remaining surfactant droplets containing the extracted and enriched ag b nps were diluted with ethanol 500 μl and upw to a total volume of 10 ml for the icp ms and sp icp ms measurements samples are divided into further sub samples those intended for sp icp ms analysis are forwarded to measurement without further treatment sub samples intended for conventional icp ms analysis are further mixed with hno3 yielding in a final acid concentration of 1 625 v v hno3 is used to dissolve nps in cpe extracts to increase sample homogeneity 2 5 determination of concentration and particle size of ag b nps in cpe extracts conventional icp ms was used to quantify total ag concentration in the cpe extracts in most cases these measurements were supplemented by sp icp ms measurements which allow for the calculation of ag b np particle size in the cpe extracts by measuring the total mass of each single ag b np in the sample and eventually for the calculation of the total concentration of ag b nps by summation of each single ag b np mass calibration was performed with aqueous ag i solutions of known concentration ranging from 5 to 200 ng l 1 limit of detection lod 0 2 ng l 1 background equivalent concentration bec 0 5 ng l 1 since these solutions underwent no cpe they were prepared in a upw matrix acidified to 1 625 v v hno3 including 5 v v of tx 114 10 w w and 5 v v of ethanol which is e g 2 5 ml tx 114 10 w w and 2 5 ml etoh for a total volume of 50 ml to mimic the matrix of the samples after cpe quantitative sp icp ms measurements were performed with non acidified cpe extracts calibration samples 52 ng l 1 ca aunp dispersion and 1 μg l 1 ag i solution were prepared in a upw matrix including 5 v v of tx 114 10 w w and 5 v v of ethanol which is e g 2 5 ml tx 114 10 w w and 2 5 ml etoh for a total volume of 50 ml to mimic the matrix of the samples after cpe the calculations are subject to some uncertainties as they assume a spherical shape for all particles and require knowledge about the density ρ of the particulate materials peters et al 2014 which is derived from the bulk materials ag ρ 10 49 g cm 3 agcl ρ 7 23 g cm 3 and ag2s ρ 5 56 g cm 3 according to the gestis substance database dec 2018 in the case of ag b nps in real environmental samples wwtp effluent the np modification is unknown but very likely ag2s kaegi et al 2013 despite its limitations sp icp ms is still the only method able to simultaneously determine concentration and particle size distribution of nps at ng l 1 concentration levels so it is the method of choice size detection limit sdl for sp icp ms measurement of ag b nps was determined to 8 nm transient signals deriving from nanoparticles being atomized in the plasma of the icp ms are registered during the measurement the signal size corresponds to the size of the corresponding nanoparticle i e small particles lead to only very little signals signals of smaller particles in the time resolved sp mass spectra are not distinguishable anymore from signals derived from traces of dissolved ag species or the instrument s background and are thus not applicable for data processing thus concentrations measured by sp icp ms represent the total ag concentration of all particulate ag species sized 8 nm 2 6 characterization of size morphology and chemical composition of ag b nps incubated in real seawaters mass spectrometric analysis was supplemented by electron microscopy to investigate the fate of ag b nps in highly saline matrices to meet limits of detection for tem edx ag b np dispersions were mixed 1 10 with real seawater resulting in a total volume of 1 5 ml and incubated for 1 h afterwards samples were filled in 3 5 kda regenerated cellulose membranes surrounded by 1 l upw to perform a dialysis for 24 h upw was replaced every 4 h dialysis can eliminate both ag i deriving from potentially dissolved ag b nps and the high saline seawater matrix which would otherwise cause incrustations on the tem grid a droplet of each prepared sample was examined by tem edx as described in the instrumentation section and compared to nps which had not been in contact with seawater 2 7 error calculations for all measurements three independent subsamples were treated and measured individually each subsample was measured with three replicates n u n 3 the uncertainty u was calculated via gaussian error propagation based on pipetting uncertainties and standard deviations of the independently measured subsamples blank samples were used to correct ag concentrations in all incubation experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoparticle characterization the chemical composition shape and particle size of the commercially available and synthesized particles were analyzed to gain information about the pristine state of the particles prior to any incubation experiments for this purpose dispersions of the freshly synthesized and purified ca ag nps agcl nps and ag2s nps were prepared on copper grids and investigated with stem and edx stem measurement of both types of ca ag nps showed spherical sole particles with a particle size range of approximately 42 120 nm si fig s1 and 14 100 nm si fig s2 maximum frequency particle sizes were determined by sp icp ms as 24 nm and 58 nm respectively an examplary image of a particle sizing 53 nm and the corresponding edx spectrum are given in fig 1 the particle related signals indicate that the core of the particle consists of pure silver the synthesized agcl nps showed cubic non aggregated particles with a broad size range of approximately 18 200 nm si fig s3 with a maximum frequency particle size of 94 nm determined by sp icp ms fig 2 shows an example of a stem adf image of a agcl np cube with a side length of 100 nm and the corresponding edx spectrum the edx spectrum reveals a ag to cl ratio of 1 1 which complies with the presence of agcl particles fig 3 shows a tem image of the synthesized ag2s nps and the corresponding edx spectrum in this case some bridging between neighboring particles occurred and some particles show small cavities a narrow particle size distribution was observed with a size range of 48 160 nm si fig s4 and a maximum frequency particle size of 82 nm determined by sp icp ms edx measurements revealed a ag to s ratio of 2 1 which indicates the presence of ag2s nps obviously the reaction of ca ag nps with sulfide resulted in the formation of fully sulfurized particles combined with an increase in the average size of the particles from 58 nm to 82 nm si fig s4 3 2 dissolution of differently coated and sized ag b nps incubated in upw artificial seawater and real seawater we examined the fate of differently coated and sized ag b nps in upw artificial seawater and real seawater our preliminary tests prior to the incubation experiments confirmed the applicability of cpe to species selectively extract and enrich ag b nps from saline matrices extraction efficiency for ag b nps even increased from 88 in the upw matrix to 94 in the highly saline matrix moreover the co extraction of soluble ag i species from highly saline matrices into the organic phase amounted to less than one percent therefore cpe is suitable to i quantitatively extract ag b nps from highly saline matrices into the organic phase and to ii perform this process species selectively in other words soluble ag i species deriving from former ag b nps by means of dissolution in saline matrices are prevented from being transported into the organic phase we applied a dual approach for investigating the fate of ag b nps in upw and highly saline matrices first we quantified the total concentration of ag b nps present after a certain incubation time whereby these particles were thus able to resist an occurring np dissolution process concentrations related to ag for these remaining ag b nps in each incubation matrix upw artificial and real seawater with increasing incubation time measured by cpe icp ms are shown in fig 4 and table s1 see si table s1 includes further concentration data measured for the same samples by cpe sp icp ms these concentrations represent the concentration of particles 8 nm second we were able to display the change in sizes of ag b nps being incubated in the different matrices for increasing incubation time by cpe sp icp ms measurements fig 5 all experiments started with an initial ag b np concentration of 50 ng l 1 fig 4 as mentioned above comparison of cpe icp ms and cpe sp icp ms allowed differentiation between concentration of the total amount of particulate ag species and those 8 nm si table s1 in most cases cpe sp icp ms was not able to quantify all particulate species since low concentrations of particles 8 nm were present however no correlation between the appearance of particles 8 nm and incubation time matrix and np coating was detected as already described in the literature cooperative oxidation processes transforming ag 0 to soluble ag i species followed by formation of soluble agclx 1 x x 1 in the presence of chloride levard et al 2012 liu and hurt 2010 lodeiro et al 2017 basically led to dissolution of all types of ag b nps in the three different matrices upw establishes massive dilution pressure readily transforming large parts of particulate ag 0 into dissolved ag i species by an equilibrium shift to dissolved ag species equation 1 which is further promoted by the comparatively low ph of upw 5 6 compared to non purified or natural water 7 8 liu and hurt 2010 after an incubation period of 3 h in the upw matrix only 87 of the initially applied ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size remained as particles it should be noted that the sizes in brackets represent the mean pristine particle size before incubation which is enclosed for the sake of clarity after the same incubation time only 1 of the initially applied ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size remained due to the extremely large intrinsic surface of these small particles oxidation to dissolved ag i is massively promoted for smaller particles zhang et al 2011 after 3 h of incubation in upw 26 of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size remained particulate since the agcl particles initially exhibited a maximum frequency particle size of 94 nm we would suggest a slow dissolution process however we observed quite high dissolution rates for agcl nps which can be explained by the fact that ag in agcl is already present in oxidation state i accelerating the cooperative oxidation process responsible for the dissolution liu and hurt 2010 since 69 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size resisted dissolution after 3 h of incubation the high insolubility of ag2s seems to compensate for the ag oxidation state of i and thus prohibits these particles from fast dissolution the general trend continued with increasing incubation time to 72 h whereby 42 of the initially applied ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size 26 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size 10 of ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 1 of agcl np 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size resisted dissolution overall ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size seemed to be the most stable modification of ag b nps in upw followed by ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size this is somewhat surprising since silver sulfide is one of the most insoluble salts however ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size exceeded this insolubility likely due to the fact that the coating reagent can slow down the oxidative dissolution process citrate coating has already been reported to be able to reduce ag i to ag 0 forming either new particles or being inserted into already existing particles kittler et al 2010 the presence of chloride able to trap ag i and thus shift the dissolution equilibrium liu and hurt 2010 leads to increasing dissolution rates for all types of ag b nps in artificial seawater after an incubation of 3 h only 3 of the initially applied ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size 5 of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size 22 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 39 of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size resisted dissolution and remained particulate after 72 h the dissolution process in seawater was almost finished in contrast to incubation in upw matrix where 11 of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 1 4 of the other ag b nps were still present as particulate species again small particle sizes encouraged dissolution as ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size were dissolved significantly faster than ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size again ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and ag2s nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size were more stable than ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size dissolution rates reached their maximum in experiments involving real seawater as the incubation matrix this observation is only partially reflected in the current literature liu et al described that dissolution rates for ag b nps in the mg l 1 range incubated in seawater even decreased to some extent because the comparatively high ph 8 in seawater shifts the equilibrium of the dissolution process at the expense of dissolved ag i species liu and hurt 2010 however reducing the ag b np concentration to an environmentally relevant level of some ng l 1 was reported to accelerate the dissolution process toncelli et al 2017 in our experiment the latter case seems to prevail and it controls the dissolution process in real seawater in general we observed a dramatic drop in the concentration of remaining nps in seawater within the first 3 h whereas only 24 of the initially applied ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size 9 of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size 6 of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and 2 of ca ag nps 24 nm maximum frequency size were still present as nps in seawater after incubation for 72 h only 1 9 of ag b nps resisted dissolution in seawater it is remarkable that some particles of all types of ag b nps could still be detected indicating a certain stability of particle traces in seawater this partial dissolution of ag b nps in aqueous matrices even after incubating for several days has also been described by loza et al 2014 again ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size showed only low stability during the incubation experiment in seawater for the aforementioned reasons ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size displayed slightly higher stability very interestingly ag2s nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size even surpassed the stability of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size marginally which could not be observed in any of the incubation experiments described above this observation probably goes along with high concentrations of sulfate present in real seawater which was not the case for upw and artificial seawater indicating the stability of silver sulfide coatings however the presence of sulfide coatings requires the reduction of s vi in sulfate to s ii in sulfide which might take place to a small extent by integrating sulfate into the aforementioned cooperative oxidation reactions liu and hurt 2010 cpe sp icp ms provides an even more detailed insight into the np dissolution process fig 5 as it describes the evolution of particle size distributions over time particle size distributions for ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size and agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size are given as normalized mass frequency we chose this kind of presentation because very small particles 8 nm are present to a varying extent in all samples but contribute only very little to the total particle mass however particles 8 nm would misleadingly affect the particle size distributions if presented as normalized number frequency for ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size presenting normalized number frequencies was feasible due to the narrow range of small particle sizes in depth analysis of sp icp ms data revealed additional information regarding particle numbers and their variation after incubation in aqueous matrices table 1 fig 5a shows blank corrected particle size distributions of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size incubated in upw for 1 h 24 h 48 h and 72 h as seen in fig 4 si table s1 the np concentration was reduced by dissolution to 42 within 72 h however the np size distribution did not change during the observed incubation period so the maximum frequency size table 1 stayed constant during the experiment which is due to the fact that primarily small particles were readily dissolved thus not influencing the maximum frequency size of approximately 58 nm we observed a rapid decrease of the total particle number within the first hour of incubation table 1 whereas particles 30 nm in particular were dissolved due to their high intrinsic surface the small particle fraction was dissolved first during the following days almost all particles 30 nm were dissolved whereas the number of particles 30 nm was reduced slightly indicating their predominant stability incubation of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size in artificial seawater fig 5b led to a reduction of the maximum frequency size of the particles from 58 nm to 46 nm within the first day of incubation which goes along with a decrease in np concentration figs 4 and si table s1 table 1 shows that particles 30 nm in particular were dissolved whereas the number of particles 30 nm stayed constant or increased however it is very likely that particles 30 nm were still dissolved but the simultaneous dissolution of particles 30 nm also led to the formation of particles 30 nm after 48 h of incubation the maximum frequency particle size was reduced dramatically to 10 nm because a large proportion of particles was dissolved in this case the number of particles 30 nm and 30 nm was reduced equally in contrast to an incubation of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size in artificial seawater the rapid concentration drop for an incubation in seawater occurred earlier after 24 h of incubation figs 4 and si table s1 this goes along with a strong decrease of the maximum np frequency size from 58 nm to 12 nm after the same incubation period table 1 fig 5c in fig 5c particles exhibiting a maximum frequency particle size of 58 nm with a size range of approximately 14 100 nm were only observable until 1 h of incubation particles 30 nm were almost completely dissolved after 24 h of incubation table 1 again shrinking of particles 30 nm contributed to a constant number of particles 30 nm despite the accelerated dissolution of small particles taking place as well this fast shrinking process was enhanced at an increasing salinity of the incubation matrix for ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size only traces of ag b nps were detectable after 24 h of incubation in seawater fig 4 table s1 the maximum frequency particle size was reduced from 24 nm to approximately 10 nm during the entire incubation period fig 5d moreover a fast drop in the np number was observed after an incubation time of 24 h whereas particles 16 nm accounted for the predominant particulate species table 1 particle size distributions of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size became narrower within the first 24 h of incubation fig 5e whereby maximum frequency particle sizes were hardly reduced from initially 73 nm to 69 nm however we observed a rapid drop in concentration fig 4 table s1 and particle number table 1 whereas nps 30 nm and 30 nm were dissolved equally as expected smaller particles were dissolved faster due to their high intrinsic surface dramatically shrunk ag2s nps formerly exhibiting sizes 30 nm contributed as additional particles 30 nm with decreasing proportion of particles 30 nm and the almost complete dissolution of initial 82 nm particles during the days of incubation the concentration of smaller particles increased in fig 5e thus particles of all sizes were affected by dissolution in seawater whereas the dissolution of initial 82 nm particles resulted in a large number of remaining particles 30 nm after only 1 h of incubation the mean particle size of agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size incubated in seawater massively decreased from 94 nm to 15 nm whereas the initial broad particle size distribution approximately ranging from 60 150 nm was completely reversed after 1 h fig 5f see also si fig s6 for another perspective the experiment started with approximately 800 particles 30 nm table 1 and no measurable particles 30 nm but after only 1 h of incubation in seawater the number of particles 30 nm increased dramatically to approximately 7 000 and the number of particles 30 nm doubled this indicates that agcl nps 30 nm were dissolved or even broken up forming thousands of smaller particles with a broad size range from 8 120 nm with an increasing incubation time of 24 h or longer the concentration of particles 30 nm as well as the total concentration of agcl nps still present in seawater was reduced to marginal values thus nps 30 nm were dissolved quickly in seawater in favor of residual smaller particles which contribute only very little to the total concentration of nps present in seawater overall cpe sp icp ms allows for the determination of particle sizes of ag b nps incubated in aqueous matrices at environmentally relevant concentration levels particle sizes were reduced while this process depended on the particle coating and was accelerated by increasing salinity of the incubation media regarding long term incubation of 72 h no relevant ag b np concentrations sustained the most extreme conditions seawater constitutes for all kinds of investigated particles for a short term observation however our results show that larger ag b nps of 30 nm freshly released into seawater are transformed within 72 h to small particles 30 nm this may lead to a short term increase in the environmental eco toxicity and bioavailability of these particles which are believed to be more critical in this respect than larger particles kittler et al 2010 in addition to the concentration and particle size of ag b nps their surface modification and chemical composition influence the eco toxicology of these contaminants in the aqueous environment as a result we supplemented our examination of ag b nps in saline matrices with stem edx measurements no changes in the chemical composition of ca ag nps and agcl nps after incubation for 1 h in sea water were detected by stem edx rather small d 20 nm ag2s nps were detected using stem after incubation in seawater fig 6 furthermore tem images show that ag2s np aggregate and form ag2s bridges to neighboring particles when being incubated in seawater si fig s5 which is not the case for freshly prepared nanoparticle suspensions this is a fully expected result based on the dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 lodeiro et al 2016 quik et al 2014 verwey 1947 increasing ionic strength in sea water reduces particles stability and thus promotes aggregation some of the particles also have cavities edx measurement showed that a ratio of ag s of 1 1 occurred in such particles the signals arising from mg si among others came either from the seawater matrix or tem grids the changing ratio of ag s from the initial 2 1 fig 3 to 1 1 indicates that silver is dissolved while sulfur is accumulating around the particles when incubated in seawater 3 3 influence of incubation temperature and natural organic matter beyond the influence of nanoparticle coatings and matrix composition on the fate of ag b nps in seawater we investigated the effect of increasing incubation temperature on the stability of ag b nps in real seawater see si table s2 for detailed measured values starting again with 50 ng l 1 ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size we found that 55 of the initial nps remained in the solutions after 1 h of incubation at a temperature of 23 c and 61 at a temperature of 60 c after increasing the incubation time to 2 h 49 of the initial nps remained at a temperature of 23 c and 44 remained at a temperature of 60 c comparable concentrations of remaining nps independent of the applied incubation temperature indicates that there is no significant temperature effect on the dissolution of ag b nps in seawater similar observations were made for all other types of ag b nps nom plays an important role in ag b np transformation processes in aqueous environments on the one hand nom is able to decelerate ag b np dissolution effects in natural water bodies by blocking potential ag oxidation sites of the nps after adsorption by serving as an oxidative sink in the cooperative redox system by nom oxidation and finally by allowing a reversible reaction of formed ag i to ag 0 with nom as the reductant liu and hurt 2010 the last point in particular is crucial for an environmentally relevant system containing dissolved ag i species since they are readily reduced to ag 0 by nom forming new ag b nps wimmer et al have already reported on evidences that this process takes place in nature and is responsible for the existence of naturally formed ag b nps in the aqueous environment wimmer et al 2018 as a result we compared dispersions of ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size and ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size incubated in seawater for 1 h and 72 h with nom 5 mg l 1 and without nom see si table s3 for detailed measured values for ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size after 1 h incubation we found 74 83 with nom remaining particles which were reduced to 16 4 after 72 h in the case of ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size 87 91 with nom of initially inserted nps remained as particles after 1 h of incubation whereas only 13 2 were left after 72 h as these values illustrate nom did not protect ag b nps from dissolution in seawater within the first hour of incubation there is no distinct effect of nom observable but after 72 h nom increased the dissolved number of nps for both types of ag b nps dramatically in contrast to common expectations nom did support ag b np dissolution the most likely explanation for this suprising behavior is that nom forms complexes with dissolved ag i species removes them from the ag 0 ag i equilibrium and therefore accelerates the dissolution process liu and hurt 2010 3 4 dissolution of ag b nps in wwtp effluent the main contamination source respectively the main entry phase for ag b nps into the aquatic environment is wastewater released e g by wwtps ag b nps in waste water are usually sulfidized to a large degree and most likely consist of ag2s kaegi et al 2013 in addition to experiments with synthesized particles of known composition we also investigated the fate of real particles in freshly sampled wwtp effluent with and without the addition of sodium chloride which was added to the solutions prior to incubation to obtain a final salt concentration of 31 g l 1 nacl the initial total ag b np concentration in the effluent was 17 45 1 19 ng l 1 measured with cpe icp ms and 9 19 0 02 ng l 1 measured with cpe sp icp ms indicating that the solutions contained significant quantities of small particles 8 nm the mean particle size based on number frequency for particles 8 nm measured by cpe sp icp ms was 22 nm pristine maximum frequency size see fig 7 after incubation for 72 h the solutions contained a total ag b np concentration of 4 60 0 41 ng l 1 and 3 70 0 27 ng l 1 for particles 8 nm with a mean particle size of 14 nm 16 nm maximum frequency size obviously ag b nps contained in the effluent solutions were not stable in this matrix even under dark conditions and the data reveal that mainly small particles were dissolved the addition of sodium chloride prior to incubation increased particle dissolution dramatically after an incubation time of 72 h a total ag b np concentration of 2 86 0 42 ng l 1 and 1 51 0 06 ng l 1 for particles 8 nm with a mean particle size of 11 nm 10 nm maximum frequency size was observed ag b nps that are present in real environmental samples obviously share the fate of particles investigated in the model experiments described above ag b nps dissolve within 72 h to a large extent whereas the dissolution is accelerated in the presence of chloride particle dissolution goes along with the reduced particle sizes presented in fig 7 however dissolution took place more slowly than in the model experiments a complex interrelation between nom present in the wwtp effluent toc 2 3 mg l 1 trapping ag i and shifting the equilibrium towards enhanced dissolution loza et al 2014 and the ability of nom to protect ag b np from dissolution by reduction of ag i to ag 0 forming new particles toncelli et al 2017 is among other things responsible for decreased dissolution rates nevertheless ag b nps initially contained in wwtp effluent and transported by rivers to the sea can be expected to be dissolved within a short period of time 4 conclusion all types of ag b nps were largely dissolved within a reasonable amount of time whereby dissolution rates increased with the salinity of the incubation matrix ca ag nps 24 nm pristine maximum frequency size were dissolved significantly faster than ca ag nps 58 nm pristine maximum frequency size due to their higher intrinsic surface additionally we particularly examined environmentally more relevant ag b nps namely ag2s and agcl nps because these particles are believed to be the most predominant species in the environment kaegi et al 2013 ma et al 2014 nowack et al 2012 sharma et al 2015 ag2s nps 82 nm pristine maximum frequency size displayed higher stability compared to agcl nps 94 nm pristine maximum frequency size all four examined particle types were dissolved almost completely in real seawater within three days ag b nps as a potential threat to marine environmental health is extensively discussed in the literature however our results confirm that ca ag nps in environmentally relevant concentrations are not stable in seawater for more than three days agcl nps and even ag2s nps share this fate despite the low solubility of the corresponding salts locally arising increased concentrations of soluble ag i species caused by the dissolution of ag b nps may affect the health of the environment but only for a limited time and it may be compensated by a massive dilution effect of ag i in the oceans once ag b nps reach the sea they are dissolved and no longer constitute a significant risk to environmental health funding this research project was financed by the bavarian state ministry for the environment and consumer protection tnt01natfue69458
