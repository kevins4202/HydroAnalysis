3460,flood forecasting is an essential non engineering measure for flood prevention and disaster reduction many models have been developed to study the complex and highly random rainfall runoff process in recent years artificial intelligence methods such as the artificial neural network ann have attempted to construct rainfall runoff models the more advanced deep learning methods of long short term memory lstm network have been proved to better predict hydrological time series however the selection of lstm hyperparameters in the past mostly relied on the experience of the staff which often led to failure to achieve the best performance the aim of this study is to develop a method to improve flood forecast accuracy and lead time a deep learning neural network model based on lstm networks and particle swarm optimization pso is proposed in this paper the pso algorithm was used to optimize the lstm hyperparameter to improve the ability to learn data sequence features the model focuses on the jingle watershed in the fenhe river and the lushi watershed in the luohe river and was used to predict flood processes using rainfall and runoff observation data from stations in the watersheds we evaluated the performance of the model with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient root mean square error and bias the results show that the pso lstm model outperforms the m eies ann pso ann and lstm at all stations in the watersheds the pso lstm model improves the flood forecasting accuracy at different lead times especially for those exceeding 6 h and has higher prediction accuracy and stability the pso lstm model could be used to improve accuracy in short term flood forecast applications keywords long short term memory particle swarm optimization rainfall runoff flood forecasting 1 introduction floods seriously endanger human lives hinder sustainable socio economic development and cause inestimable damage to densely populated areas in floodplains or downstream from major rivers hu et al 2018 precise flood forecasting can better reduce the risk of flooding and provide timely and efficient environmental information for management decisions sudriani et al 2019 the flood process shows strong nonlinear non stationary and stochastic characteristics due to the comprehensive influence of precipitation events watershed characteristics and natural geographical conditions sahoo et al 2019 in the past decades multiple flood forecasting models have been proposed process and data driven models are the current flood prediction approaches le et al 2019 the setup of process driven models usually requires complex mathematical formulas a large amount of hydrological and meteorological data and an accurate understanding of runoff mechanisms qin et al 2018 each model has applicable conditions such as the swat model and xinanjiang model etc arnold et al 1998 zhao 1992 this concept is subject to many limiting factors that result in poor flood prediction with scientific and technological development tian et al 2018 data acquisition methods gradually diversified and now use remote sensing technology to acquire land use types busico et al 2020 vegetation types tekeli et al 2005 meteorological conditions lu et al 2020 and in depth catchment generation and convergence mechanisms yan et al 2019 traditional hydrological models do not meet the current development needs of hydrological forecasting the second concept is based on the statistical relationship between input and output data which does not consider the physical mechanism of the hydrological process yunpeng et al 2017 it establishes a mathematical analysis of the time series and uses the given sample to discover the statistical or causal relationship between the hydrological variables data driven method has unique advantages for solving numerical prediction problems reconstructing highly nonlinear functions and analyzing time series miao et al 2019 with the rapid development of computer technology data driven models have more applications in the field of hydrological forecasting bafitlhile and li 2019 one of the common data driven models for streamflow forecasting is the artificial neural network ann which is based on the artificial intelligence ai method minns and hall 1996 significant progress has been made in forecasting and simulating hydrological processes and capturing non stationarity dynamism and non linearity in the dataset kisi 2011 however the lack of memory limits ann models when dealing with sequential or time series data such as floods hu et al 2018 le et al 2019 recent breakthroughs in computational science have created a growing interest in ann based deep learning methods in academic and applied scientific circles computational models composed of multiple processing layers can learn representations of data with multiple abstraction levels in deep learning kratzert et al 2018 deep learning discovers intricate structures in extensive data by using stochastic gradient descent to search for a global minimum of the fitness function one of the most active research points in deep learning is modeling sequential data through a recurrent neural network rnn song et al 2012 yang et al 2020 the rnn is particularly suitable for hydrological prediction and gives a precise and timely prediction of time series in systems hopfield 1982 since the late 1990s more modern rnn architectures have been proposed the long short term memory lstm neural network an advanced development of deep learning neural networks which is designed to overcome the problem of gradient disappearance in long term dependent time series of simple rnn neural network input output and forget gates are added to the lstm network model based on a simple rnn neural network yang and yang 2020 lstm has been successfully applied to image recognition the internet of things iot text translation and stock prediction crivellari and beinat 2020 donahue et al 2015 wu et al 2020 domestic and foreign research on lstm in hydrology is gradually emerging liang et al 2018 existing research aims to determine if lstm can predict the runoff process but there are few researches on the influence of hyperparameter settings on model results and how to optimize model hyperparameters to achieve the best simulation results the manual selection of some lstm hyperparameters such as batch size time steps and the cells in the hidden layer has a significant impact on the results the prediction performance of the models trained with different parameters varies greatly thus choosing appropriate model parameters is very important xiang 2019 current lstm hyperparameter selection often relies on experience and a large number of experiments which waste time and computing resources additionally the simulation results often fail to reach optimal states based on multivariate correlations among flood information and time series characteristics a framework for flood simulation and forecast based on a pso lstm model is proposed in this paper first the rainfall and flow data are processed to a size between 0 1 through normalization to facilitate neural network analysis second artificially change the value of the hyperparameter and use the sensitivity analysis method to explore the influence of the hyperparameter on the simulation results subsequently pso lstm is used to predict the future 1 12 h flow process additionally we use the nash efficiency coefficient root mean square error and bias to evaluate the performance of the prediction model and to compare the results with those of m eies ann pso ann and lstm to experimentally verify the model effectiveness 2 methods 2 1 lstm neural network the short term memory neural network is an rnn which allows previously input information to be saved inside the network affecting the output the exponential explosion is called the gradient disappearance which prevents the traditional rnn from learning the long term dependencies in the data bowes et al 2019 compared with the traditional rnn the lstm adds a memory cell unit to the hidden layer replacing the original cell unit in the rnn feature extraction can be performed on sequence data with time periods alhirmizy and qader 2019 fig 1 shows the structure of the memory cell unit in the hidden layer of lstm chen et al 2020 the memory cell unit selectively remembers and forgets the input data and is composed of the input output and forget gates when the input x t passes through the memory cell unit it selectively forgets and stores information the first step of the lstm network process is to pass the forget gate f t which determines what information is discarded by the memory cell unit from the previous state the f t is expressed as equation 1 1 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f where f t represents the forget gate and takes values from 0 1 σ is the logistic sigmoid function w f u f and b f are adjustable weight matrices and a bias vector respectively the next step determines which information is added to the memory cell unit for the update the sigmoid function in input gate i t determines which values to update and a tanh layer generates a potential update vector c t i t and c t are calculated as equation 2 and 3 2 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 3 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c where i t is a vector takes values from 0 1 w i u i and b i are a series of learnable parameters defined for the input gate w c u c and b c are another series of learnable parameters after deciding the discarded and retained information the cell state c t is updated and calculated as equation 4 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where denotes element wise multiplication f t c t 1 defines which information stored in c t 1 will be forgotten and i t c t defines which new information will be added to the cell state c t the final step calculates the output gate o t which determines the hidden state h t the output o t is calculated by the sigmoid function the output h t is obtained by multiplying o t and the tanh output c t as equation 6 5 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where o t is a vector with values ranging from 0 1 w o u o and b 0 are three learnable parameters defined for the input gate 2 2 pso algorithm particle swarm optimization pso was proposed by eberhart and kennedy at the end of the twentieth century and originated from the study of bird migration and foraging behavior kennedy and eberhart 1995 each individual in the group has a specific perception ability perceives the optimal local and global individual positions and adjusts the next behavior according to its current state hauduc et al 2015 in the algorithm individuals are regarded as particles in a multi dimensional search space and each particle is a potential solution to the optimization problem three factors such as the position velocity and fitness value are used to describe the particle characteristics the fitness value is determined by the fitness function the particle independently changes moving direction and distance according to the optimal global fitness value and iteratively reaches the optimal solution suppose that m particles in an n dimensional space form a population x x 1 x 2 x m where x i x i 1 x i 2 x in huda and banka 2020 the current characteristics of the i th particle are expressed as follows 6 x i x i 1 t x i 2 t x in t t 7 v i v i 1 t v i 2 t v in t t 8 p i p i 1 t p i 2 t p in t t 9 p g p g 1 t p g 2 t p gn t t where x i t and x i t are the current location and current velocity respectively p i t and p g t are the best position in the histories of the particle and the entire particle swarm the velocity and position are updated as follows 10 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 t p i t x i t c 2 r 2 t p g t x i t 11 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where v i t 1 and x i t 1 are the speed and position at the next moment c 1 and c 2 are constants that control the maximum step size in the range of 0 2 respectively r 1 and r 2 are random numbers in the range of 0 1 respectively 2 3 pso lstm forecast model the data input to the lstm at each time is in the form of a three dimensional vector containing batch size time steps and cells the process of extracting rainfall and runoff data features within the lstm can be represented as fig 2 fig 2 a and fig 2 b reflect the data processing process in lstm and the simulation demonstration of rainfall and runoff at different times respectively the vector information at each moment passes through the input gate and the forget gate and features that have a causal relationship with the predicted value are selectively retained and passed to the cell at the next moment the function of the forget gate is to filter out the useless features in this process for a specific rainfall runoff process the time step can be artificially set to the number of moments that contain past information and kept constant after the neural network training starts the vector input at the start time t 1 contains the information of the initial rainfall and before the increase in flow at this time the selected time step does not include the signal that causes the future predicted value to change the lstm in the training process is not sensitive to the vector signal or it has extracted features that both rainfall and runoff data are gentle when time elapses to t n the rainstorm event occurs within the selected time step training makes lstm capture these changes in rainfall and flow information such as the location and value of the rainfall peak and whether the runoff starts to rise or not and lstm connects them with the output to form a complex regression relationship in this way the longer the time interval between input and output the harder it is to generate a suitable connection hyperparameters control the network structure of the lstm model yan et al 2019 which determines the simulation results these hyperparameters include batch size time step and cells of the hidden layer batch size represents the number of samples trained at one time by the lstm network time step represents the length of the past data used in the prediction if time step n it means that each future value is related to n values before the current moment as the prediction process progresses these values are slid across the time axis in a sliding window where n is the size of the sliding window eventually reaching the end of time for the dataset cells of hidden layer represents the complexity and learning ability of the lstm network in the flood prediction task they have different degrees of influence on the simulation results we visualize these influences through sensitivity analysis and use lead time to represent the time interval between the predicted moment and the current moment under different lead times the sensitivity to simulated flow is evaluated by changing the value of the hyperparameter each time each time a pair of hyperparameters is selected and their values change within a given range the evaluation index of lstm simulated flow value is used as the target to analyze the influence of hyperparameter changes on the simulation results in order to find the optimal lstm network structure in different foreseeable periods this study combines the pso algorithm with the lstm model to construct the pso lstm model for floods for simulation and forecasting batch size time steps and cells are the optimization objects of the pso algorithm the position of each particle is defined as a three dimensional variable representing the number of batch size time steps and cells in lstm network model the position information of each particle is randomly initialized according to the value range of the parameter the lstm model of each particle is established separately and the flood process is simulated the experimental data is divided into calibration and validation sets which are used to train the lstm model and test the simulation accuracy respectively the nash efficiency coefficient nse of the results of the validation set is used as the particle fitness value each iteration updates the particle position information until the maximum number of iterations is reached the purpose is to find the maximum fitness value fig 3 shows the structure of the pso lstm model 2 4 model setting and parameterization the programming language of choice is python 3 7 the libraries used for preprocessing and managing our data are numpy pandas and pyswarms we use the google tensorflow deep learning framework first we process the data required for the study into a form that can be recognized by lstm each time step of the input contains feature values including the form table 1 where q t is antecedent flow and q t n is current flow k j and n represent the rainfall stations number of feature values and lead time respectively p 1 t n p 2 t n p k t n represent rainfall from the 1st to the k th rainfall stations we used the rainfall station and antecedent flow data to forecast runoff we chose different n values of 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h indicating 6 lead times second the normalization operation is performed normalization is a method of rescaling the data in the original range so that all values range from 0 to 1 if the machine learning model uses the gradient descent method to find the optimal solution dimensions are not uniform and normalization is often necessary to allow convergence for efficient learning all input features meteorological and hydrological variables and output data the discharge are normalized by subtracting the mean value and dividing by the standard deviation the output of the network is retransformed to obtain the final discharge prediction which is an inverse data scaling process the expression is as equation 12 12 x x μ σ where x and x represent the normalized result and sample data respectively μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the sample data respectively the parameters in the pso algorithm and the search parameter range were set the number of particles and the maximum number of iterations were set to 30 and 200 respectively the inertial weight w was 0 8 the sum of learning factors c 1 and c 2 was 2 the lstm is composed of input output and hidden layers the batch size time steps and number of cells are selected as the hyperparameters to be optimized according to the rainfall runoff time series data characteristics the optimization range of the hyperparameters was set to batch size time steps and number of cells of 24 128 4 8 and 32 256 respectively 2 5 performance evaluation criteria in this study the performance of different models is evaluated by statistical error measures including the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and bias the mathematical expressions of these metrics can be described as follows 12 nse 1 i 1 n q 0 q c 2 i 1 n q 0 q c 2 where q 0 m3 s and q c m3 s represent the discharge of the observed and simulated hydrographs respectively q c is the mean value of the observed discharge and n is the data points number nse measures the ability of the model to predict variables different from the mean gives the proportion of the initial variance accounted for by the model and ranges from 1 perfect fit to values closer to 1 provide more accurate predictions 13 rmse i 1 n q 0 q c 2 n the rmse is very sensitive to the maximum and minimum errors enabling it to effectively reflect the accuracy of the prediction results rmse values closer to 0 provide more accurate predictions 13 bias i 1 n q 0 q c i 1 n q 0 the bias can evaluate the accuracy of the overall water balance of the simulation results and range from 100 to 100 a value close to 0 means more accurate predictions 2 6 model benchmarks and methods we used several benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the pso lstm model these benchmarks include m eies physical model ann pso ann and traditional lstm the lead time was set to 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h which is the premise of comparing the performance of different benchmarks we simultaneously calculate and compare the performance evaluation indicators of all benchmarks m eies is a physical improved xinanjiang model hu et al 2003 compared with the xinanjiang model the excess infiltration runoff mode of m eies is based on the infiltration curve and infiltration capacity distribution curve of the watershed the storage runoff mode is based on the water storage capacity distribution curve of the watershed there are two types of runoff modes are organically combined recent studies have applied the runoff simulated by m eies within the range of acceptable accuracy which is reflected by the goodness of fit measure wen et al 2020 m eies was used as a benchmark in this study ann is a simplied black box model used to solvseveral water resources problems minns and hall 1996 and can be trained with datasets to identify complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs the representative feedforward neural network is composed of an input layer hidden containing neurons and output layers recent studies have shown that using ann is one of the most significant methods to simulate hydrological processes ahmad and hussain 2019 ann was used as a benchmark in this study in addition in order to illustrate the auxiliary role of the pso algorithm in machine learning tasks especially its more suitable function for optimizing hyperparameters the algorithm is additionally applied to ann model and the weights and biases of ann were optimized by the pso algorithms therefore pso ann was also used as another benchmark in this study 3 case study the yellow river the fifth largest in the world often suffers from flood disasters in recent years a large number of water and soil conservation measures have been applied in the middle reaches of the yellow river this study selected the representative jingle and guxian watersheds the first pso lstm model was developed for the jingle watershed of the fenhe river in shanxi province a relatively small watershed that covers 2799 km2 jingle hydrological station is the primary stream control station on the upper fenhe river and is located at 111 55 east longitude and 38 20 north latitude the annual mean precipitation in the jingle watershed is approximately 538 38 mm devastating frequent flooding in the last few decades has been widely researched an additional assessment was conducted in the guxian watershed of luohe river to discover if the proposed model architecture operates in different watersheds after training the watershed covers 5309 km2 spans shaanxi and henan provinces and is narrow with a long concentration time the guxian station is located in luohe downstream from luoning county located at 111 17 east longitude and 34 14 north latitude annual precipitation in the two watersheds varies greatly and both are severely affected by flooding fig 4 shows the locations of the jingle and guxian watersheds the underlying data for our study of the jingle watershed include hourly discharge data from jingle station and hourly rainfall data from fourteen gauges in the area to evaluate the model s potential for application to both ordinary and extreme events we considered events of different magnitudes in the partitioning of the dataset complete records of 98 flood events from 1971 to 2013 were obtained of these 78 flood events 3986 datasets were used for calibration including 12 events with flood peaks over 500 m3 s and 4 extreme events over 1000 m3 s 20 events 1366 datasets were used for validation with 7 events over 500 m3 s and 2 extreme events over 1000 m3 s the type of data used in the guxian watershed is the same as that of jingle but the guxian watershed contains 21 rainfall stations and the data contains 80 events 1960 2016 3485 datasets of which 60 events are used as the calibration set 14 events over 500 m3 s and 3 extreme events over 1000 m3 s and 20 events as the validation set 6 events over 500 m3 s and 2 extreme events over 1000 m3 s it is worth noting that the hyperparameter batch size of lstm needs to be adapted to the length of the events in the dataset and an inappropriate batch size makes it difficult for lstm to grasp the characteristics of each event which is also the basis for setting the range of batch size in this paper a typical flood process with a large volume flow and duration is selected to verify the performance of the established model 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of hyperparameters on simulation results the three hyperparameters selected in the study are divided into three groups by two vehicles where the time steps change uniformly in the range of integer 4 8 batch size and cells are uniformly selected on 24 128 and 32 256 respectively the nse of the simulation result is used as the target value fig 5 shows the effect of hyperparameter changes on the results under different lead times at lead time 1 h nse changes within the range of 0 9 1 with the change of hyperparameters the cell has a greater impact on the result and more cell values cause the nse to increase and become stable after reaching a certain value on the contrary too few cells will cause a significant decrease in accuracy the influence of batch size and time step is more irregular but they make the result reach the local optimum within a certain range when the lead time is extended to 6 h nse value has a wider range cells still have a positive correlation with nse and the influence of batch size and time step becomes significant when the lead time reaches 12 h the range of nse is expanded to 0 5 0 75 all hyperparameters disturb the results more significantly and inappropriate hyperparameter combinations will seriously affect the simulation accuracy in general the influence of hyperparameters on the simulation results will change with the lead time for short term predictions selecting appropriate hyperparameters can ensure higher precision simulations for long term predictions longer input and output time intervals impose stricter requirements on the lstm network which depends more on the selection of appropriate hyperparameters 4 2 pso lstm model optimization in this study the batch size time steps and cells are used as optimization objects in the pso lstm model 30 particles are selected according to the value range of three hyperparameters and each particle is defined as a three dimensional variable the position and speed are initially randomized to 0 5 in the algorithm 78 and 20 flood events are the calibration and validation sets respectively the nse of the predicted flow process under the validation set is used as the fitness value to optimize the lstm network structure hyperparameters under each forecasting period after iteration of the pso algorithm the lstm hyperparameter combination with the best prediction effect is obtained the following experiment takes the prediction of the flow process at the jingle station 1 h into the future as an example in this experiment lstm contains a hidden layer and the number of trainings is set to 200 as the number of iterations increases the value of the lstm network hyperparameter tends to be optimal table 2 when the number of hidden layer neurons in the lstm network is 68 the batch size is 64 and the number of time steps is 6 thus the value of the first 6 moments is used to predict the traffic at the next moment and is the most accurate table 3 illustrates the hyperparameter optimization at different lead times 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h and compares the results with the 1 h lead time the pso lstm model has a perfect overall effect in flood process simulation the forecast accuracy decreases as the forecast period increase of the the forecast accuracy is the highest at 1 h with an nse reaches 0 9962 at 12 h the nse falls to 0 7658 by comparing the optimal hyperparameter combinations under different foreseeable periods we found that within the adjustable range of hyperparameters the optimal batch size is close to 64 the batch size required to process different tasks varies and indicates the scale of data processing during lstm simulation when the value is very small the number of samples that lstm refers to when learning data rules may be insufficient and places higher requirements on the gpu a batch size of 64 is suitable for tasks such as lstm processing of rainfall runoff for all lead times in the experiment the optimal prediction accuracy is obtained when the number of time steps is approximately six indicating that the lstm has the best performance for a data sequence length of six during the input process prediction the number of cells in the hidden layer of the most suitable lstm network increases with lead time from 64 cells to 12 h 128 cells the number of cells reflects the complexity of the lstm network and the ability of lstm to capture data features too few cells cannot learn deep rules but too many cells overfit the lstm in our study the extension of the lead time decreases the correlation between the input and output values of the jingle station flow therefore the model needs more cells to achieve better prediction results 4 3 understanding pso lstm in hydrology with model evaluations in the above study we discussed the hyperparameter characteristics of the optimized pso lstm model we used three other models m eies ann and unoptimized lstm for the same experiment and performed a simulation at lead time 1 12 h to deeply explore the hydrological process simulation performance of the pso lstm model fig 6 illustrates evaluation index of runoff forecasting at different lead times 1 12 h by the four models the results of all the models are closely related to lead time in the physical model m eies the results show that the nse of m eies is 0 9211 at a lead time of 1 h but falls to 0 6922 at a lead time of 12 h the results of ann show that nse varies from 0 9423 to 0 6532 for lead times from 1 to 12 h and the simulation effect showed a downward trend as lead time increased the performance of pso ann is slightly better than ann but there is no obvious difference in their simulation accuracy and their performance is lower than was lower than that of lstm in all cases ann is a relatively simple artificial neural network model that is composed of fully connected layers there is no special structure like that lstm to store past information such as the memory cell unit even if the pso algorithm is used to optimize the weight of ann machine learning algorithms such as ann do not perform well in processing rainfall runoff time series lstm and pso lstm are well simulated fig 6 pso lstm generally had better simulation results than the lstm model at different lead times in the validation stage the evaluation indexes of the pso lstm are better than that of lstm the performance of the two models declined as lead time increased for lead times of less than 6 h the nse of pso lstm is higher than that of lstm and rmse and bias are lower when the lead time exceeds 6 h the prediction accuracy of lstm sharply decreases whereas the nse of pso lstm remains above 0 7 rmse and bias remain below 60 and 20 respectively this study selected two typical floods in the validation set to discuss specific flood forecasting differences among the four models the peak flow of event 1 was less than 500 m3 s and the peak flow of event 2 was greater than 1200 m3 s fig 7 shows the observed and estimated hydrographic maps of the two flood events at lead times of 1 6 and 12 h in event 1 fig 7 at a lead time of 1 h the predicted value of the m eies model at the location of the flood peak and retreat is higher than the actual value ann fluctuates significantly which is specifically reflected in the period before the flood peak pso ann improves this phenomenon but still has some errors in the flood peak position however both lstm and pso lstm have strong predictive capabilities backwater stages in good agreement with the actual process the flood peak predicted by pso lstm is more realistic than that of lstm indicating that pso lstm is more sensitive to rainfall and runoff processes when the lead time exceeds 6 h the performance of all models has a certain degree of degradation fig 7 b c although the m eies expresses the correct flood process trend the accuracy is insufficient moreover the forecasting ability of ann deteriorates significantly the phenomenon of underestimating flood peaks increase and the simulated values fluctuate abnormally compared with observed values the pso ann model did not obviously overcome these problems and even more serious fluctuations appeared in the position after the flood peak lstm also has the same shortcomings in most cases the simulated value is underestimated pso lstm better predicts floods and simulates rainfall runoff well the total amount of discharge in the predicted period is less biased in pso lstm than in other models but insufficient when considering the sharpness of the flood peak in addition there is a lag in the prediction process of all models at this time especially in the neural network model since the time interval between the input variable and the output variable is so far that the result of the neural network produces a phase shift at the obvious change trend position this is a systematic error in the time series prediction of the neural network this error can be improved by proper hyperparameter setting which also results in better performance of the optimized neural network the second event fig 8 a b and c has a higher peak flow than event 1 which is an abnormal flood event both figures show that the overall performance of m eies is stable and insensitive to lead time factors conversely changes in lead time are likely to cause fluctuations in the neural network models pso lstm best predicted the hourly peak flow whereas the other models underpredicted the values and had lower forecast accuracy the difference between pso lstm and lstm is the addition of hyperparameter optimization algorithms long short term memory neural networks have strong data learning capabilities but inappropriate hyperparameter combinations always limit the learning ability for example the excessively simple network structures of overfitting of the training cause the forecasted floods to deviate from the actual process the neural network optimized by the algorithm is more able to adapt to changes in the complex hydrological process of the river watershed with fewer outliers the pso lstm model more intelligently predicts rainfall runoff than the other models 4 4 model application in a different watershed the model was applied at the lushi station in the guxian watershed and the data 1980 2014 was divided into calibration and validation sets with observation based calibrations to evaluate the versatility of the constructed model lushi station is located downstream from the observation area the guxian watershed is larger and narrower than the jingle watershed and has longer travel time and different topography soil type and land use table 4 shows the results based on different lead times for five models in the validation set nse of the m eies ann pso ann lstm and pso lstm models are 0 9211 0 9423 0 9461 0 9761 and 0 9912 at a lead time of 1 h respectively because of the short forecast period all models performed well at a lead time of 12 h the nse decreased to 0 6922 0 6534 0 6596 0 6842 and 0 7486 with extended lead times the simulation accuracy of all the models declined to varying degrees but pso lstm maintained high prediction levels the final pso lstm model consistently outperformed the other models these results are as good as those from the jingle watershed confirming that the lstm based pso lstm model established in this study can be used to make accurate predictions in multiple watersheds the rainfall runoff simulation process is the key to hydrological forecasting but contains many complicated steps the runoff mechanism in semi humid semi arid areas is more complicated than in humid areas le et al 2019 super osmotic and full runoffs may simultaneously occur the physical model does not reflect the complex hydrological process of the many semi humid and semi arid watersheds in china therefore more artificial intelligence methods have recently been applied to simulate the process of rainfall runoff in these watersheds in this study at different lead times we uniformly change the values of lstm hyperparameters to analyze their impact on the simulation results the experimental results section 4 point out that the sensitivity of the simulation results will change with the lead time in general changing any hyperparameter will have a visible impact on the prediction which includes more regular cells and irregular batch size and time steps a reasonable combination of these hyperparameters within a given range can effectively improve the accuracy of the simulation therefore the combination of optimization algorithms and lstm will be a better choice different models are used to predict hourly runoff in the jingle and guxian watersheds the experimental results section 4 show that the proposed pso lstm method better simulates the rainfall runoff process has better performance evaluation standards and loses less accuracy as the lead time is extended lstm meets the requirements for lead times of less than 6 h but significantly underestimates flood peaks and abnormal fluctuations when the lead time exceeds 6 h the simulation accuracy of m eies and ann is generally low for flood forecasting it is worth noting that although the same algorithm is used to optimize the weight and bias of ann pso ann still has no significant performance improvement conversely compared with lstm the pso lstm model with optimized hyperparameters is intelligent which means the optimization algorithm is more effective in improving the performance of deep learning the pso lstm model is more intelligent compared with previous studies on rainfall and runoff models hu et al 2018 used an lstm model for rainfall and runoff simulations and obtained validation stage nse values ranging from 0 88 1 h to 0 77 6 h the regular lstm model cannot obtain better benefits by applying constant hyperparameter combinations in this study rainfall and runoff data change form with the time series lstm and pso lstm learn the relationship between time series data and the pso lstm model uses the pso algorithm to optimize lstm network hyperparameters the evaluation of the nse value adjusts the hyperparameter size allowing the model to adapt to different conditions additionally three hyperparameters were selected to optimize the results of the pso algorithm the batch size remains at approximately 60 the time step is approximately 6 and the number of cells in the hidden layer gradually increases from 64 to 128 as the lead time increases the hyperparameter selection is closely related to the river basin data characteristics and the lead time the designed neural network must be able to sufficiently learn the input data and ensure that the training process is not overfitted this result can also provide a reference for building a model under the same conditions if attempted in an unfamiliar watershed pso lstm is a better choice to find the optimal parameter combination and to obtain the best forecasting effect 5 conclusions the validation stage of the pso lstm model had higher nse and rmse values and the prediction period was extended by 6 h to a maximum of 12 h the pso lstm model performs well in both the normal and extreme events we provide indicating its potential for application in extreme event prediction pso lstm can also be applied to weather soil moisture and water quality forecasting based on the model proposed in this paper some problems need to be solved determining the suitable inertia weight of the pso algorithm would speed up the convergence rate of the algorithm in addition to rainfall factors such as soil water content and temperature also affect runoff formation and should be added to the input data credit authorship contribution statement

3460,flood forecasting is an essential non engineering measure for flood prevention and disaster reduction many models have been developed to study the complex and highly random rainfall runoff process in recent years artificial intelligence methods such as the artificial neural network ann have attempted to construct rainfall runoff models the more advanced deep learning methods of long short term memory lstm network have been proved to better predict hydrological time series however the selection of lstm hyperparameters in the past mostly relied on the experience of the staff which often led to failure to achieve the best performance the aim of this study is to develop a method to improve flood forecast accuracy and lead time a deep learning neural network model based on lstm networks and particle swarm optimization pso is proposed in this paper the pso algorithm was used to optimize the lstm hyperparameter to improve the ability to learn data sequence features the model focuses on the jingle watershed in the fenhe river and the lushi watershed in the luohe river and was used to predict flood processes using rainfall and runoff observation data from stations in the watersheds we evaluated the performance of the model with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient root mean square error and bias the results show that the pso lstm model outperforms the m eies ann pso ann and lstm at all stations in the watersheds the pso lstm model improves the flood forecasting accuracy at different lead times especially for those exceeding 6 h and has higher prediction accuracy and stability the pso lstm model could be used to improve accuracy in short term flood forecast applications keywords long short term memory particle swarm optimization rainfall runoff flood forecasting 1 introduction floods seriously endanger human lives hinder sustainable socio economic development and cause inestimable damage to densely populated areas in floodplains or downstream from major rivers hu et al 2018 precise flood forecasting can better reduce the risk of flooding and provide timely and efficient environmental information for management decisions sudriani et al 2019 the flood process shows strong nonlinear non stationary and stochastic characteristics due to the comprehensive influence of precipitation events watershed characteristics and natural geographical conditions sahoo et al 2019 in the past decades multiple flood forecasting models have been proposed process and data driven models are the current flood prediction approaches le et al 2019 the setup of process driven models usually requires complex mathematical formulas a large amount of hydrological and meteorological data and an accurate understanding of runoff mechanisms qin et al 2018 each model has applicable conditions such as the swat model and xinanjiang model etc arnold et al 1998 zhao 1992 this concept is subject to many limiting factors that result in poor flood prediction with scientific and technological development tian et al 2018 data acquisition methods gradually diversified and now use remote sensing technology to acquire land use types busico et al 2020 vegetation types tekeli et al 2005 meteorological conditions lu et al 2020 and in depth catchment generation and convergence mechanisms yan et al 2019 traditional hydrological models do not meet the current development needs of hydrological forecasting the second concept is based on the statistical relationship between input and output data which does not consider the physical mechanism of the hydrological process yunpeng et al 2017 it establishes a mathematical analysis of the time series and uses the given sample to discover the statistical or causal relationship between the hydrological variables data driven method has unique advantages for solving numerical prediction problems reconstructing highly nonlinear functions and analyzing time series miao et al 2019 with the rapid development of computer technology data driven models have more applications in the field of hydrological forecasting bafitlhile and li 2019 one of the common data driven models for streamflow forecasting is the artificial neural network ann which is based on the artificial intelligence ai method minns and hall 1996 significant progress has been made in forecasting and simulating hydrological processes and capturing non stationarity dynamism and non linearity in the dataset kisi 2011 however the lack of memory limits ann models when dealing with sequential or time series data such as floods hu et al 2018 le et al 2019 recent breakthroughs in computational science have created a growing interest in ann based deep learning methods in academic and applied scientific circles computational models composed of multiple processing layers can learn representations of data with multiple abstraction levels in deep learning kratzert et al 2018 deep learning discovers intricate structures in extensive data by using stochastic gradient descent to search for a global minimum of the fitness function one of the most active research points in deep learning is modeling sequential data through a recurrent neural network rnn song et al 2012 yang et al 2020 the rnn is particularly suitable for hydrological prediction and gives a precise and timely prediction of time series in systems hopfield 1982 since the late 1990s more modern rnn architectures have been proposed the long short term memory lstm neural network an advanced development of deep learning neural networks which is designed to overcome the problem of gradient disappearance in long term dependent time series of simple rnn neural network input output and forget gates are added to the lstm network model based on a simple rnn neural network yang and yang 2020 lstm has been successfully applied to image recognition the internet of things iot text translation and stock prediction crivellari and beinat 2020 donahue et al 2015 wu et al 2020 domestic and foreign research on lstm in hydrology is gradually emerging liang et al 2018 existing research aims to determine if lstm can predict the runoff process but there are few researches on the influence of hyperparameter settings on model results and how to optimize model hyperparameters to achieve the best simulation results the manual selection of some lstm hyperparameters such as batch size time steps and the cells in the hidden layer has a significant impact on the results the prediction performance of the models trained with different parameters varies greatly thus choosing appropriate model parameters is very important xiang 2019 current lstm hyperparameter selection often relies on experience and a large number of experiments which waste time and computing resources additionally the simulation results often fail to reach optimal states based on multivariate correlations among flood information and time series characteristics a framework for flood simulation and forecast based on a pso lstm model is proposed in this paper first the rainfall and flow data are processed to a size between 0 1 through normalization to facilitate neural network analysis second artificially change the value of the hyperparameter and use the sensitivity analysis method to explore the influence of the hyperparameter on the simulation results subsequently pso lstm is used to predict the future 1 12 h flow process additionally we use the nash efficiency coefficient root mean square error and bias to evaluate the performance of the prediction model and to compare the results with those of m eies ann pso ann and lstm to experimentally verify the model effectiveness 2 methods 2 1 lstm neural network the short term memory neural network is an rnn which allows previously input information to be saved inside the network affecting the output the exponential explosion is called the gradient disappearance which prevents the traditional rnn from learning the long term dependencies in the data bowes et al 2019 compared with the traditional rnn the lstm adds a memory cell unit to the hidden layer replacing the original cell unit in the rnn feature extraction can be performed on sequence data with time periods alhirmizy and qader 2019 fig 1 shows the structure of the memory cell unit in the hidden layer of lstm chen et al 2020 the memory cell unit selectively remembers and forgets the input data and is composed of the input output and forget gates when the input x t passes through the memory cell unit it selectively forgets and stores information the first step of the lstm network process is to pass the forget gate f t which determines what information is discarded by the memory cell unit from the previous state the f t is expressed as equation 1 1 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f where f t represents the forget gate and takes values from 0 1 σ is the logistic sigmoid function w f u f and b f are adjustable weight matrices and a bias vector respectively the next step determines which information is added to the memory cell unit for the update the sigmoid function in input gate i t determines which values to update and a tanh layer generates a potential update vector c t i t and c t are calculated as equation 2 and 3 2 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 3 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c where i t is a vector takes values from 0 1 w i u i and b i are a series of learnable parameters defined for the input gate w c u c and b c are another series of learnable parameters after deciding the discarded and retained information the cell state c t is updated and calculated as equation 4 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where denotes element wise multiplication f t c t 1 defines which information stored in c t 1 will be forgotten and i t c t defines which new information will be added to the cell state c t the final step calculates the output gate o t which determines the hidden state h t the output o t is calculated by the sigmoid function the output h t is obtained by multiplying o t and the tanh output c t as equation 6 5 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where o t is a vector with values ranging from 0 1 w o u o and b 0 are three learnable parameters defined for the input gate 2 2 pso algorithm particle swarm optimization pso was proposed by eberhart and kennedy at the end of the twentieth century and originated from the study of bird migration and foraging behavior kennedy and eberhart 1995 each individual in the group has a specific perception ability perceives the optimal local and global individual positions and adjusts the next behavior according to its current state hauduc et al 2015 in the algorithm individuals are regarded as particles in a multi dimensional search space and each particle is a potential solution to the optimization problem three factors such as the position velocity and fitness value are used to describe the particle characteristics the fitness value is determined by the fitness function the particle independently changes moving direction and distance according to the optimal global fitness value and iteratively reaches the optimal solution suppose that m particles in an n dimensional space form a population x x 1 x 2 x m where x i x i 1 x i 2 x in huda and banka 2020 the current characteristics of the i th particle are expressed as follows 6 x i x i 1 t x i 2 t x in t t 7 v i v i 1 t v i 2 t v in t t 8 p i p i 1 t p i 2 t p in t t 9 p g p g 1 t p g 2 t p gn t t where x i t and x i t are the current location and current velocity respectively p i t and p g t are the best position in the histories of the particle and the entire particle swarm the velocity and position are updated as follows 10 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 t p i t x i t c 2 r 2 t p g t x i t 11 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where v i t 1 and x i t 1 are the speed and position at the next moment c 1 and c 2 are constants that control the maximum step size in the range of 0 2 respectively r 1 and r 2 are random numbers in the range of 0 1 respectively 2 3 pso lstm forecast model the data input to the lstm at each time is in the form of a three dimensional vector containing batch size time steps and cells the process of extracting rainfall and runoff data features within the lstm can be represented as fig 2 fig 2 a and fig 2 b reflect the data processing process in lstm and the simulation demonstration of rainfall and runoff at different times respectively the vector information at each moment passes through the input gate and the forget gate and features that have a causal relationship with the predicted value are selectively retained and passed to the cell at the next moment the function of the forget gate is to filter out the useless features in this process for a specific rainfall runoff process the time step can be artificially set to the number of moments that contain past information and kept constant after the neural network training starts the vector input at the start time t 1 contains the information of the initial rainfall and before the increase in flow at this time the selected time step does not include the signal that causes the future predicted value to change the lstm in the training process is not sensitive to the vector signal or it has extracted features that both rainfall and runoff data are gentle when time elapses to t n the rainstorm event occurs within the selected time step training makes lstm capture these changes in rainfall and flow information such as the location and value of the rainfall peak and whether the runoff starts to rise or not and lstm connects them with the output to form a complex regression relationship in this way the longer the time interval between input and output the harder it is to generate a suitable connection hyperparameters control the network structure of the lstm model yan et al 2019 which determines the simulation results these hyperparameters include batch size time step and cells of the hidden layer batch size represents the number of samples trained at one time by the lstm network time step represents the length of the past data used in the prediction if time step n it means that each future value is related to n values before the current moment as the prediction process progresses these values are slid across the time axis in a sliding window where n is the size of the sliding window eventually reaching the end of time for the dataset cells of hidden layer represents the complexity and learning ability of the lstm network in the flood prediction task they have different degrees of influence on the simulation results we visualize these influences through sensitivity analysis and use lead time to represent the time interval between the predicted moment and the current moment under different lead times the sensitivity to simulated flow is evaluated by changing the value of the hyperparameter each time each time a pair of hyperparameters is selected and their values change within a given range the evaluation index of lstm simulated flow value is used as the target to analyze the influence of hyperparameter changes on the simulation results in order to find the optimal lstm network structure in different foreseeable periods this study combines the pso algorithm with the lstm model to construct the pso lstm model for floods for simulation and forecasting batch size time steps and cells are the optimization objects of the pso algorithm the position of each particle is defined as a three dimensional variable representing the number of batch size time steps and cells in lstm network model the position information of each particle is randomly initialized according to the value range of the parameter the lstm model of each particle is established separately and the flood process is simulated the experimental data is divided into calibration and validation sets which are used to train the lstm model and test the simulation accuracy respectively the nash efficiency coefficient nse of the results of the validation set is used as the particle fitness value each iteration updates the particle position information until the maximum number of iterations is reached the purpose is to find the maximum fitness value fig 3 shows the structure of the pso lstm model 2 4 model setting and parameterization the programming language of choice is python 3 7 the libraries used for preprocessing and managing our data are numpy pandas and pyswarms we use the google tensorflow deep learning framework first we process the data required for the study into a form that can be recognized by lstm each time step of the input contains feature values including the form table 1 where q t is antecedent flow and q t n is current flow k j and n represent the rainfall stations number of feature values and lead time respectively p 1 t n p 2 t n p k t n represent rainfall from the 1st to the k th rainfall stations we used the rainfall station and antecedent flow data to forecast runoff we chose different n values of 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h indicating 6 lead times second the normalization operation is performed normalization is a method of rescaling the data in the original range so that all values range from 0 to 1 if the machine learning model uses the gradient descent method to find the optimal solution dimensions are not uniform and normalization is often necessary to allow convergence for efficient learning all input features meteorological and hydrological variables and output data the discharge are normalized by subtracting the mean value and dividing by the standard deviation the output of the network is retransformed to obtain the final discharge prediction which is an inverse data scaling process the expression is as equation 12 12 x x μ σ where x and x represent the normalized result and sample data respectively μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the sample data respectively the parameters in the pso algorithm and the search parameter range were set the number of particles and the maximum number of iterations were set to 30 and 200 respectively the inertial weight w was 0 8 the sum of learning factors c 1 and c 2 was 2 the lstm is composed of input output and hidden layers the batch size time steps and number of cells are selected as the hyperparameters to be optimized according to the rainfall runoff time series data characteristics the optimization range of the hyperparameters was set to batch size time steps and number of cells of 24 128 4 8 and 32 256 respectively 2 5 performance evaluation criteria in this study the performance of different models is evaluated by statistical error measures including the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and bias the mathematical expressions of these metrics can be described as follows 12 nse 1 i 1 n q 0 q c 2 i 1 n q 0 q c 2 where q 0 m3 s and q c m3 s represent the discharge of the observed and simulated hydrographs respectively q c is the mean value of the observed discharge and n is the data points number nse measures the ability of the model to predict variables different from the mean gives the proportion of the initial variance accounted for by the model and ranges from 1 perfect fit to values closer to 1 provide more accurate predictions 13 rmse i 1 n q 0 q c 2 n the rmse is very sensitive to the maximum and minimum errors enabling it to effectively reflect the accuracy of the prediction results rmse values closer to 0 provide more accurate predictions 13 bias i 1 n q 0 q c i 1 n q 0 the bias can evaluate the accuracy of the overall water balance of the simulation results and range from 100 to 100 a value close to 0 means more accurate predictions 2 6 model benchmarks and methods we used several benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the pso lstm model these benchmarks include m eies physical model ann pso ann and traditional lstm the lead time was set to 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h which is the premise of comparing the performance of different benchmarks we simultaneously calculate and compare the performance evaluation indicators of all benchmarks m eies is a physical improved xinanjiang model hu et al 2003 compared with the xinanjiang model the excess infiltration runoff mode of m eies is based on the infiltration curve and infiltration capacity distribution curve of the watershed the storage runoff mode is based on the water storage capacity distribution curve of the watershed there are two types of runoff modes are organically combined recent studies have applied the runoff simulated by m eies within the range of acceptable accuracy which is reflected by the goodness of fit measure wen et al 2020 m eies was used as a benchmark in this study ann is a simplied black box model used to solvseveral water resources problems minns and hall 1996 and can be trained with datasets to identify complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs the representative feedforward neural network is composed of an input layer hidden containing neurons and output layers recent studies have shown that using ann is one of the most significant methods to simulate hydrological processes ahmad and hussain 2019 ann was used as a benchmark in this study in addition in order to illustrate the auxiliary role of the pso algorithm in machine learning tasks especially its more suitable function for optimizing hyperparameters the algorithm is additionally applied to ann model and the weights and biases of ann were optimized by the pso algorithms therefore pso ann was also used as another benchmark in this study 3 case study the yellow river the fifth largest in the world often suffers from flood disasters in recent years a large number of water and soil conservation measures have been applied in the middle reaches of the yellow river this study selected the representative jingle and guxian watersheds the first pso lstm model was developed for the jingle watershed of the fenhe river in shanxi province a relatively small watershed that covers 2799 km2 jingle hydrological station is the primary stream control station on the upper fenhe river and is located at 111 55 east longitude and 38 20 north latitude the annual mean precipitation in the jingle watershed is approximately 538 38 mm devastating frequent flooding in the last few decades has been widely researched an additional assessment was conducted in the guxian watershed of luohe river to discover if the proposed model architecture operates in different watersheds after training the watershed covers 5309 km2 spans shaanxi and henan provinces and is narrow with a long concentration time the guxian station is located in luohe downstream from luoning county located at 111 17 east longitude and 34 14 north latitude annual precipitation in the two watersheds varies greatly and both are severely affected by flooding fig 4 shows the locations of the jingle and guxian watersheds the underlying data for our study of the jingle watershed include hourly discharge data from jingle station and hourly rainfall data from fourteen gauges in the area to evaluate the model s potential for application to both ordinary and extreme events we considered events of different magnitudes in the partitioning of the dataset complete records of 98 flood events from 1971 to 2013 were obtained of these 78 flood events 3986 datasets were used for calibration including 12 events with flood peaks over 500 m3 s and 4 extreme events over 1000 m3 s 20 events 1366 datasets were used for validation with 7 events over 500 m3 s and 2 extreme events over 1000 m3 s the type of data used in the guxian watershed is the same as that of jingle but the guxian watershed contains 21 rainfall stations and the data contains 80 events 1960 2016 3485 datasets of which 60 events are used as the calibration set 14 events over 500 m3 s and 3 extreme events over 1000 m3 s and 20 events as the validation set 6 events over 500 m3 s and 2 extreme events over 1000 m3 s it is worth noting that the hyperparameter batch size of lstm needs to be adapted to the length of the events in the dataset and an inappropriate batch size makes it difficult for lstm to grasp the characteristics of each event which is also the basis for setting the range of batch size in this paper a typical flood process with a large volume flow and duration is selected to verify the performance of the established model 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of hyperparameters on simulation results the three hyperparameters selected in the study are divided into three groups by two vehicles where the time steps change uniformly in the range of integer 4 8 batch size and cells are uniformly selected on 24 128 and 32 256 respectively the nse of the simulation result is used as the target value fig 5 shows the effect of hyperparameter changes on the results under different lead times at lead time 1 h nse changes within the range of 0 9 1 with the change of hyperparameters the cell has a greater impact on the result and more cell values cause the nse to increase and become stable after reaching a certain value on the contrary too few cells will cause a significant decrease in accuracy the influence of batch size and time step is more irregular but they make the result reach the local optimum within a certain range when the lead time is extended to 6 h nse value has a wider range cells still have a positive correlation with nse and the influence of batch size and time step becomes significant when the lead time reaches 12 h the range of nse is expanded to 0 5 0 75 all hyperparameters disturb the results more significantly and inappropriate hyperparameter combinations will seriously affect the simulation accuracy in general the influence of hyperparameters on the simulation results will change with the lead time for short term predictions selecting appropriate hyperparameters can ensure higher precision simulations for long term predictions longer input and output time intervals impose stricter requirements on the lstm network which depends more on the selection of appropriate hyperparameters 4 2 pso lstm model optimization in this study the batch size time steps and cells are used as optimization objects in the pso lstm model 30 particles are selected according to the value range of three hyperparameters and each particle is defined as a three dimensional variable the position and speed are initially randomized to 0 5 in the algorithm 78 and 20 flood events are the calibration and validation sets respectively the nse of the predicted flow process under the validation set is used as the fitness value to optimize the lstm network structure hyperparameters under each forecasting period after iteration of the pso algorithm the lstm hyperparameter combination with the best prediction effect is obtained the following experiment takes the prediction of the flow process at the jingle station 1 h into the future as an example in this experiment lstm contains a hidden layer and the number of trainings is set to 200 as the number of iterations increases the value of the lstm network hyperparameter tends to be optimal table 2 when the number of hidden layer neurons in the lstm network is 68 the batch size is 64 and the number of time steps is 6 thus the value of the first 6 moments is used to predict the traffic at the next moment and is the most accurate table 3 illustrates the hyperparameter optimization at different lead times 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h and compares the results with the 1 h lead time the pso lstm model has a perfect overall effect in flood process simulation the forecast accuracy decreases as the forecast period increase of the the forecast accuracy is the highest at 1 h with an nse reaches 0 9962 at 12 h the nse falls to 0 7658 by comparing the optimal hyperparameter combinations under different foreseeable periods we found that within the adjustable range of hyperparameters the optimal batch size is close to 64 the batch size required to process different tasks varies and indicates the scale of data processing during lstm simulation when the value is very small the number of samples that lstm refers to when learning data rules may be insufficient and places higher requirements on the gpu a batch size of 64 is suitable for tasks such as lstm processing of rainfall runoff for all lead times in the experiment the optimal prediction accuracy is obtained when the number of time steps is approximately six indicating that the lstm has the best performance for a data sequence length of six during the input process prediction the number of cells in the hidden layer of the most suitable lstm network increases with lead time from 64 cells to 12 h 128 cells the number of cells reflects the complexity of the lstm network and the ability of lstm to capture data features too few cells cannot learn deep rules but too many cells overfit the lstm in our study the extension of the lead time decreases the correlation between the input and output values of the jingle station flow therefore the model needs more cells to achieve better prediction results 4 3 understanding pso lstm in hydrology with model evaluations in the above study we discussed the hyperparameter characteristics of the optimized pso lstm model we used three other models m eies ann and unoptimized lstm for the same experiment and performed a simulation at lead time 1 12 h to deeply explore the hydrological process simulation performance of the pso lstm model fig 6 illustrates evaluation index of runoff forecasting at different lead times 1 12 h by the four models the results of all the models are closely related to lead time in the physical model m eies the results show that the nse of m eies is 0 9211 at a lead time of 1 h but falls to 0 6922 at a lead time of 12 h the results of ann show that nse varies from 0 9423 to 0 6532 for lead times from 1 to 12 h and the simulation effect showed a downward trend as lead time increased the performance of pso ann is slightly better than ann but there is no obvious difference in their simulation accuracy and their performance is lower than was lower than that of lstm in all cases ann is a relatively simple artificial neural network model that is composed of fully connected layers there is no special structure like that lstm to store past information such as the memory cell unit even if the pso algorithm is used to optimize the weight of ann machine learning algorithms such as ann do not perform well in processing rainfall runoff time series lstm and pso lstm are well simulated fig 6 pso lstm generally had better simulation results than the lstm model at different lead times in the validation stage the evaluation indexes of the pso lstm are better than that of lstm the performance of the two models declined as lead time increased for lead times of less than 6 h the nse of pso lstm is higher than that of lstm and rmse and bias are lower when the lead time exceeds 6 h the prediction accuracy of lstm sharply decreases whereas the nse of pso lstm remains above 0 7 rmse and bias remain below 60 and 20 respectively this study selected two typical floods in the validation set to discuss specific flood forecasting differences among the four models the peak flow of event 1 was less than 500 m3 s and the peak flow of event 2 was greater than 1200 m3 s fig 7 shows the observed and estimated hydrographic maps of the two flood events at lead times of 1 6 and 12 h in event 1 fig 7 at a lead time of 1 h the predicted value of the m eies model at the location of the flood peak and retreat is higher than the actual value ann fluctuates significantly which is specifically reflected in the period before the flood peak pso ann improves this phenomenon but still has some errors in the flood peak position however both lstm and pso lstm have strong predictive capabilities backwater stages in good agreement with the actual process the flood peak predicted by pso lstm is more realistic than that of lstm indicating that pso lstm is more sensitive to rainfall and runoff processes when the lead time exceeds 6 h the performance of all models has a certain degree of degradation fig 7 b c although the m eies expresses the correct flood process trend the accuracy is insufficient moreover the forecasting ability of ann deteriorates significantly the phenomenon of underestimating flood peaks increase and the simulated values fluctuate abnormally compared with observed values the pso ann model did not obviously overcome these problems and even more serious fluctuations appeared in the position after the flood peak lstm also has the same shortcomings in most cases the simulated value is underestimated pso lstm better predicts floods and simulates rainfall runoff well the total amount of discharge in the predicted period is less biased in pso lstm than in other models but insufficient when considering the sharpness of the flood peak in addition there is a lag in the prediction process of all models at this time especially in the neural network model since the time interval between the input variable and the output variable is so far that the result of the neural network produces a phase shift at the obvious change trend position this is a systematic error in the time series prediction of the neural network this error can be improved by proper hyperparameter setting which also results in better performance of the optimized neural network the second event fig 8 a b and c has a higher peak flow than event 1 which is an abnormal flood event both figures show that the overall performance of m eies is stable and insensitive to lead time factors conversely changes in lead time are likely to cause fluctuations in the neural network models pso lstm best predicted the hourly peak flow whereas the other models underpredicted the values and had lower forecast accuracy the difference between pso lstm and lstm is the addition of hyperparameter optimization algorithms long short term memory neural networks have strong data learning capabilities but inappropriate hyperparameter combinations always limit the learning ability for example the excessively simple network structures of overfitting of the training cause the forecasted floods to deviate from the actual process the neural network optimized by the algorithm is more able to adapt to changes in the complex hydrological process of the river watershed with fewer outliers the pso lstm model more intelligently predicts rainfall runoff than the other models 4 4 model application in a different watershed the model was applied at the lushi station in the guxian watershed and the data 1980 2014 was divided into calibration and validation sets with observation based calibrations to evaluate the versatility of the constructed model lushi station is located downstream from the observation area the guxian watershed is larger and narrower than the jingle watershed and has longer travel time and different topography soil type and land use table 4 shows the results based on different lead times for five models in the validation set nse of the m eies ann pso ann lstm and pso lstm models are 0 9211 0 9423 0 9461 0 9761 and 0 9912 at a lead time of 1 h respectively because of the short forecast period all models performed well at a lead time of 12 h the nse decreased to 0 6922 0 6534 0 6596 0 6842 and 0 7486 with extended lead times the simulation accuracy of all the models declined to varying degrees but pso lstm maintained high prediction levels the final pso lstm model consistently outperformed the other models these results are as good as those from the jingle watershed confirming that the lstm based pso lstm model established in this study can be used to make accurate predictions in multiple watersheds the rainfall runoff simulation process is the key to hydrological forecasting but contains many complicated steps the runoff mechanism in semi humid semi arid areas is more complicated than in humid areas le et al 2019 super osmotic and full runoffs may simultaneously occur the physical model does not reflect the complex hydrological process of the many semi humid and semi arid watersheds in china therefore more artificial intelligence methods have recently been applied to simulate the process of rainfall runoff in these watersheds in this study at different lead times we uniformly change the values of lstm hyperparameters to analyze their impact on the simulation results the experimental results section 4 point out that the sensitivity of the simulation results will change with the lead time in general changing any hyperparameter will have a visible impact on the prediction which includes more regular cells and irregular batch size and time steps a reasonable combination of these hyperparameters within a given range can effectively improve the accuracy of the simulation therefore the combination of optimization algorithms and lstm will be a better choice different models are used to predict hourly runoff in the jingle and guxian watersheds the experimental results section 4 show that the proposed pso lstm method better simulates the rainfall runoff process has better performance evaluation standards and loses less accuracy as the lead time is extended lstm meets the requirements for lead times of less than 6 h but significantly underestimates flood peaks and abnormal fluctuations when the lead time exceeds 6 h the simulation accuracy of m eies and ann is generally low for flood forecasting it is worth noting that although the same algorithm is used to optimize the weight and bias of ann pso ann still has no significant performance improvement conversely compared with lstm the pso lstm model with optimized hyperparameters is intelligent which means the optimization algorithm is more effective in improving the performance of deep learning the pso lstm model is more intelligent compared with previous studies on rainfall and runoff models hu et al 2018 used an lstm model for rainfall and runoff simulations and obtained validation stage nse values ranging from 0 88 1 h to 0 77 6 h the regular lstm model cannot obtain better benefits by applying constant hyperparameter combinations in this study rainfall and runoff data change form with the time series lstm and pso lstm learn the relationship between time series data and the pso lstm model uses the pso algorithm to optimize lstm network hyperparameters the evaluation of the nse value adjusts the hyperparameter size allowing the model to adapt to different conditions additionally three hyperparameters were selected to optimize the results of the pso algorithm the batch size remains at approximately 60 the time step is approximately 6 and the number of cells in the hidden layer gradually increases from 64 to 128 as the lead time increases the hyperparameter selection is closely related to the river basin data characteristics and the lead time the designed neural network must be able to sufficiently learn the input data and ensure that the training process is not overfitted this result can also provide a reference for building a model under the same conditions if attempted in an unfamiliar watershed pso lstm is a better choice to find the optimal parameter combination and to obtain the best forecasting effect 5 conclusions the validation stage of the pso lstm model had higher nse and rmse values and the prediction period was extended by 6 h to a maximum of 12 h the pso lstm model performs well in both the normal and extreme events we provide indicating its potential for application in extreme event prediction pso lstm can also be applied to weather soil moisture and water quality forecasting based on the model proposed in this paper some problems need to be solved determining the suitable inertia weight of the pso algorithm would speed up the convergence rate of the algorithm in addition to rainfall factors such as soil water content and temperature also affect runoff formation and should be added to the input data credit authorship contribution statement

3461,to explore the impact of climate change on snow cover and spring soil moisture sm in areas with seasonally frozen soil snow cover parameters and spring sm for different land use types in northeast china are extracted based on remote sensing snow cover and sm products snow cover parameters include snow days sd first day of snow cover fsd last day of snow cover lsd maximum snow depth msd and average snow depth asd the spatiotemporal variations and correlations between snow cover parameters and spring sm for different land use types are analyzed the results showed that the average spring sm for different land use types was ordered woodland farmland grassland with obvious woodland and farmland increases woodlands had many sd and large snow depths msd and asd that eventually decreased farmland sm increased significantly in spring which aided crop development the decrease in grassland spring sm was not obvious but the snow cover parameters of certain areas decreased notably snow cover significantly impacted farmland sm and correlation coefficients were highest between all snow cover parameters and sm in spring the correlations between grassland snow cover parameters and sm in april were higher than those in may but woodland snow cover parameters and spring sm were not correlated among the five snow parameters fsd had the lowest correlation with spring sm and sd had the greatest impact on sm these results show the significant relationship between snow cover and sm and reveal relevant patterns as future climate warming may introduce drought risk to woodland and grassland areas advance preparations should be made farmland areas will continue to maintain appropriate sm which is beneficial for agricultural development keywords climate change snow cover soil moisture correlation land use type 1 introduction in recent decades global warming and climate change have had many impacts on ecology agriculture water resources and humans dorrepaal et al 2009 jin et al 2020 yao et al 2019 northeast china is located in the highest latitude region in china and is strongly sensitive to climate change research shows that snow in winter as a unique meteorological factor has changed significantly feng and chen 2016 qin et al 2020 snow has the properties of high reflectivity high phase change latent heat and low heat conduction snow affects climate system changes by influencing the surface energy balance climate and atmospheric circulation anomalies also affect the amount of snow by changing the amounts of cold and warm air and precipitation zhang et al 2010 zhong et al 2021 further snow is a valuable freshwater resource in some areas with seasonally frozen soil drought minimal rain and high evaporation in spring snowmelt water is the main water resource supply qi et al 2020 tian et al 2018 it is important to understand the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and changing patterns of snow under climate change conditions on the other hand against the background of global temperature increase in recent years spring drought has occurred frequently in northeast china which has seriously affected the timing of sowing growth and development of crops yu et al 2014 as an intuitive indicator of soil drought and flooding soil moisture sm is important for crop growth and sowing requires land with suitable sm li et al 2016 which greatly impacts seed germination seedling emergence subsequent development and final yield spring sm is important not only for plant growth but also for black soil erosion wei et al 2014 and nutrient loss sm content can significantly affect the aggregate structure of black soil and the soil critical shear stress will change accordingly liu et al 2017 which will change the probability of soil erosion at the same time the change of sm will change the chemical environment of soil especially the content of phosphorus in black soil which is one of the important determinants of nutrient loss in black soil ouyang et al 2013 moreover sm also plays an important role in the surface hydrological process and is one of the key variables in the climate system changing the energy balance through transmission via vegetation and atmosphere long et al 2019 wang et al 2018 affecting the distribution of the climate and ecosystem and exploring the spatiotemporal variations in sm are key issues in areas with seasonally frozen soil snow as the main source of sm in spring can significantly affect the change trend of sm therefore comprehensively analyzing the spatiotemporal variations in snow and sm and their responses to climate change discussing the correlation between snow and sm and understanding the variation patterns of snow and sm are particularly important for rationally utilizing water resources in areas with seasonally frozen soil and for coping with climate change many achievements in research on the spatiotemporal variation laws of snow and sm have been accomplished using the microwave radiation characteristics of forest snow che et al 2016 inversed the snow depth in the forested area of northeast china by using the optimal iterative method the inversion effect was reasonable compared with the measured data wang et al 2014 employed cloud removal products to monitor the regional spatiotemporal changes in the lesser khingan mountains in northeast china the results showed that the snow area of the lesser khingan mountains has increased in the last ten years and that the snow period is longer than that of farmland at low elevations but that the interannual change is relatively small li et al 2017 analyzed the correlation between snow cover in eurasia and winter temperature in northeast china the results showed that the deeper the snow cover was in eurasia and the longer the snow cover period the lower the temperature in northeast china based on ten days of soil relative humidity data from a china agrometeorological station zhu et al 2019 carried out a spatiotemporal analysis of sm in farmland areas the results showed that the sm in farmland areas in china has increased and that sm increases as the soil depth increases but that the rate of increase decreases as the depth increases based on the random forest model and data fusion method long et al 2019 generated a complete continuous and high resolution sm background layer that overcomes the low resolution disadvantages of traditional microwave remote sensing data based on sm values simulated by a variable infiltration capacity vic model zhu et al 2020 proposed a sensitivity method and analyzed the variation in sm in china the results showed that sm in northeast china has increased in the last 50 years but that drying may occur in the future in the context of climate warming the frequency and intensity of global droughts continue to increase as an important water resource in cold regions snow cover and how it affects sm have become a research focus for many scholars through experiments zhang et al 2019b found that climate warming causes the temperature to increase and the growing season of northern forests to lengthen snowmelt water supplements the water needed for vegetation growth in advance snowmelt water enables forest vegetation to cope with climate change potopová et al 2016 pointed out that the advancement of snow cover days and the decrease in snow depth aggravate the degree of sm drought at the end of summer based on experiments li et al 2021 discovered that when the snow depth in winter is larger or the snow cover period is longer snow promotes the extended growth and development of trees but that in arid areas this promotion is weakened based on the annual ring characteristics of trees shamir et al 2020 found a correlation between snow cover and sm via a snow cover hydrological model the abovementioned research results suggest a close relationship between snow cover and sm however there are few studies on the impact of winter snow melting on spring sm in areas with seasonal frozen soil and most studies focus on only single vegetation types such as woodland or farmland the difference in the response of spring sm to different snow cover indicators for different land use types has not been determined at the same time previous studies lack practical significance to guide the development of modern agriculture animal husbandry and forestry because of the continuity of data and the research scale based on the current research status this paper selects a typical area with seasonally frozen soil in northeast china as the research area and extracts three types of land use woodland grassland and farmland based on remote sensing snow products and sm products the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow indicators and sm for different land use types from 1980 to 2020 are discussed and the changing trends and correlations of different snow indicators and sm are analyzed the research results can provide a theoretical basis for preventing extreme drought events and rationally using snow resources in agricultural grassland forest ecosystems under global warming conditions in addition these results provide theoretical guidance for ensuring the safe production of crops and coping with the risks created by climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area northeast china is located from 115 3 135 02 e and 38 43 53 36 n and has an area of 124 104 km2 sun et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 this region is located in the core zone of northeast asia and has a temperate continental monsoon climate fig 1 a the four seasons are distinct the winter is cold and long and the spring is dry and less rainy the region mainly includes the three provinces of heilongjiang jilin and liaoning and parts of eastern inner mongolia the terrain of this area is complex and diverse surrounded by mountains on three sides and high in elevation with the changbai mountains in the east and the lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains in the north and west respectively the central part is a vast plain with an average elevation of less than 300 m from north to south this central area consists of the sanjiang plain songnen plain and liaohe plain the black soil in this area is fertile the terrain is flat and the land is rich in nutrients the soil is an important commodity grain base in china there are various types of land cover with grassland woodland and arable land accounting for the highest proportions northeast china is the main seasonally snow covered area and has the longest snow period and deepest snow 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 satellite snow depth data products snow data are selected from the china snow depth long term series dataset provided by the western china environmental and ecological science data center which is inverted from the daily passive microwave remote sensing data provided by the us ice and snow data center this paper focuses on the time interval from 1980 to 2020 the quality of this dataset is reliable dai et al 2015 and the data are very suitable for use in china dai et al 2017 2 2 2 esa microwave remote sensing soil moisture cci sm product the sm dataset is a satellite based long term global daily sm product developed by the european space agency esa the soil depth is 0 10 cm and the spatial resolution of the dataset is 0 25 this paper uses the time interval from 1980 to 2020 the dataset includes three types of products active passive and active passive fusion gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 there have been relevant studies conducted domestically and abroad on the accuracy of this group of datasets the evaluation results show that the accuracy of the fusion product is better than those of the active and passive microwave products before fusion an et al 2016 dorigo et al 2015 to date the reliability of this dataset has been verified from many aspects wagner et al 2012 and it is widely utilized in soil climate hydrology and other fields dorigo et al 2017 based on the measured sm site data in china jia et al 2018 evaluated esa climate change initiative cci and two other long series sm products based on model simulation the results show that the esa cci is highly consistent with the measured site data in northeast china especially in expressing the drought trend liang et al 2020a discussed the spatiotemporal variation trend of farmland sm in northeast china by using esa cci data based on the measured sm data from the china meteorological data network jiang et al 2020 judged the applicability of esa cci data in northern china and analyzed the interannual variation trends of sm in five parts of the region the results showed a high correlation between esa cci data and measured sm data which met the needs of application in northeast china thus this paper uses active and passive fusion products for sm research for more details on the algorithm and theory generated by this product please refer to the literature liu et al 2011 2 2 3 land use type data land use data are provided by the resource and environment science and data center which is based on the landsat thematic mapper tm of the united states and is generated by manual visual interpretation the resolution is 1 km the types include farmland woodland grassland water area and residential land there are 6 primary types and 25 secondary types of unused land to eliminate the influence of land use types on the results two raster datasets from 1980 and 2020 are selected in this paper 3 research methods fig 1 a shows the different types of land use in northeast china for the specific classification types the reader can refer to the data provided by the western china environmental and ecological science data center northeast china has three main types of land use farmland woodland and grassland the sm in paddy fields is greatly affected by human factors farmland counts only as dry land and the other two types include all secondary classifications aeronautical reconnaissance coverage geographic information system arcgis software is employed to convert the original 1 km resolution land use type to 0 25 the specific process is described as follows first a grid covering the study area is established at a resolution of 0 25 and the coordinate system is then converted to the universal transverse mercator utm projection coordinate system each new grid contains several grids with the original 1 km resolution a land use type that accounts for more than 50 of a 0 25 degree new grid area is regarded as the new land use type for the grid and grids with an area of less than 50 are not considered in this article the results are shown in fig 1 b to eliminate the influence of the natural evolution of land use types two raster datasets from 1980 and 2020 were processed according to the abovementioned steps in the same way after comparison grids with unchanged land use types were selected for the final study the sm and snow data in this paper are widely utilized and have yielded satisfactory results therefore this paper does not evaluate the accuracy of the data in this paper the data processing mainly uses python programming software first the original sm netcdf file is extracted and the arcgis inverse distance weighting method is applied to interpolate some missing values in the original data according to the actual situation in northeast china october 1st to april 1st of the following year is regarded as the snow season liang et al 2020a a gridded snow depth in the snow season that is greater than 1 cm is considered an effective snow cover day and the snow cover is extracted from the snow cover dataset five parameters are selected snow days sd first day of snow cover fsd last day of snow cover lsd maximum snow depth msd and average snow depth asd the fsd is defined as the date when a snow depth greater than 1 cm in the snow season first appears the lsd is defined as the date when a snow depth greater than 1 cm in the snow season last appears the msd is defined as the msd that occurs during the snow season the asd is defined as the ratio of the accumulated snow depth to the number of sd in the snow season given the difference in the number of sd in different regions the number of sd is set to 181 referring to a large number of articles increases in sd lsd asd and msd and a decrease in fsd are defined as increases in snow parameters and vice versa the trend coefficient is used to study the long term changes in sm and snow cover parameters this coefficient is the correlation coefficient between the natural sequence and the element sequence and can be used to quantitatively study the rate of increase and rate of decrease in meteorological elements with climate change catastropholgy et al 2020 the mann kendall mk method which is a nonparametric statistical test is selected for the mutation test the advantages of this method are that it does not require samples to follow a certain distribution and is not affected by a few outliers this method is widely applied in meteorology and hydrology li et al 2014 sun et al 2019b the correlation analysis method is employed to quantitatively analyze the correlation between snow cover parameters and sm a one variable linear regression method is utilized to fit the snow parameter and soil water dispersion plot 1 r xt i 1 n x i x i t i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n i t 2 where r xt is the trend coefficient the variation range is 1 to 1 n is the number of years x i is the

of sm 4 1 average sm characteristics fig 2 shows the multiyear average grid by grid sm distribution in northeast china from 1980 to 2020 fig 2 reveals that the woodland sm in april is high and that the sm is mostly concentrated within 0 25 0 3 m3 m3 which is suitable for plant growth liang et al 2020a farmland sm is concentrated within 0 2 0 3 m3 m3 which is more suitable for the germination and growth of crop seeds during spring sowing grassland sm is the lowest and is concentrated within 0 15 0 2 m3 m3 indicating mild drought compared with april may exhibits woodland sm with minimal difference the grid from 0 2 0 25 m3 m3 decreases in heilongjiang province and increases in jilin province compared with that in april the farmland sm decreases which is mainly reflected in the increase in the grid from 0 2 0 25 m3 m3 in the songnen plain compared with that in april the grassland water content is lower the grassland is located in northwestern inner mongolia and the number of grids from 0 15 0 2 m3 m3 increases generally the sm of various land types in northeast china shows a certain trend with woodland farmland grassland the sm values of woodland and farmland are greater than 0 2 m3 m3 which is suitable for the growth of plants and crops while most of the grassland sm is less than 0 2 m3 m3 which is lower than the normal sm standard 4 2 spatial variation in sm fig 3 shows the trend distribution of the spatial change in sm in each grid grids that pass the 0 05 significance test are shaded in april the change in sm varies by region in woodland areas most grids in the lesser khingan mountains and changbai mountains show significant increasing trends while some grids in the lesser khingan mountains and changbai mountains show significant decreasing trends in terms of farmland most grids show increasing trends especially in the northeastern songnen plain the grassland in northern inner mongolia shows a significant increasing trend and the trend in the south decreases significantly there is a minimal difference between the increase in the trend coefficient and the decrease in the trend coefficient in may and april but the value changes the decreasing trend in woodlands of the lesser khingan mountains slows and the trend of the regional grid in the changbai mountains changes from decreasing to significantly increasing the increasing farmland trend is enhanced and the grid of the liaohe plain changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend the trend coefficients of grassland increase and decrease the abovementioned analysis shows that the farmland sm in northeast china increases in spring which is beneficial to the sowing and development of crops the woodland areas show stable increasing trends that differ in local areas the increase in the grassland trend coefficient is concentrated in northern inner mongolia while most grid trend coefficients in southern mongolia show decreasing trends 4 3 long term change in sm the annual average change in sm in april is shown in fig 4 generally the three land use types from high to low are woodland farmland grassland from the perspective of interannual variation the three types show stable stable and low stable linear relationships over time which can be divided into three stages 1980 1991 1991 2005 and 2006 2020 the variation range of woodland sm is 0 22 0 29 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 26 m3 m3 the lowest value occurs in 1997 and the highest value appears in 2018 the variation range of farmland sm is 0 19 0 30 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 24 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 1998 and the highest value appears in 2013 the variation range of grassland sm is 0 14 0 23 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 19 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 1997 and the highest value appears in 2013 generally only the grassland sm content is lower than the appropriate sm and the other two types meet the needs of normal crop and plant growth and development the annual average change in sm in may is basically the same as that in april this change also experiences three periods namely stability low stability and high stability but the boundary between the first two woodland periods is not obvious the variation range of sm in woodlands is 0 22 0 30 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 26 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 2001 and the highest value appears in 2010 the variation range of farmland sm is 0 18 0 29 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 22 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 2002 and the highest value appears in 2010 the variation range of grassland sm is 0 15 0 22 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 18 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 2002 and the highest value appears in 2014 generally in the past 15 years the sm values of the three types have remained stable woodland and farmland sm contents are appropriate and that of grassland is near the critical point of nonarid sm 4 4 abrupt sm characteristics the mk mutation analysis method was selected to detect the three types of sm in the last 40 years the results are shown in fig 5 there was no obvious mutation point in farmland in april but it decreased from 1991 to 2013 exceeding the 0 05 critical line from 1995 to 2008 the woodland sm decreased significantly from 1994 to 2005 and the mutation point was 2014 indicating that the sm changed from decreasing to increasing in 2014 the sm of grassland decreased significantly from 1996 to 2005 and changed suddenly in 2008 from decreasing to increasing in may there were no obvious mutation points for the three kinds of sm farmland and woodland experienced three stages namely increase decrease and increase grassland exhibited two stages increase and decrease the farmland sm decreased significantly from 1997 to 2010 the woodland sm content decreased significantly from 2001 to 2004 and the grassland sm content decreased significantly from 1999 to 2013 5 spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow cover 5 1 average characteristics of snow parameters fig 6 shows the distribution of grid by grid snow parameters in northeast china from 1980 to 2020 considering that snow sometimes does not fall in the southernmost part of northeast china parameters with grid data less than 20 years are regarded as no snow which is represented by 0 in the figure as shown in fig 6 for snow depth the msd in northeast china ranges from 0 to 40 cm and the maximum value is 37 89 cm the depth decreases from high latitudes to low latitudes the msd values in the woodlands of the lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains are high generally more than 19 cm and that in the changbai mountains area ranges from 12 to 26 cm farmland and grassland areas fall within 0 19 cm and there is no obvious distribution pattern the asd is 0 20 cm and the maximum value is 19 58 cm the asd in the woodland lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains areas ranges from 8 to 16 cm and that in the changbai mountains area ranges from 4 to 8 cm farmland and grassland areas fall within 1 8 cm and show no obvious distribution pattern in general compared with the other two types woodland has earlier fsd later lsd more sd and higher msd and asd for snow days 1 the fsd is the 287th day at the earliest and the 348th day at the latest with a difference of 61 days and the fsd becomes later from high latitudes to low latitudes the fsd in woodland areas is earlier the fsd in the great khingan mountains is 280 310 days the fsd in the lesser khingan mountains is 310 325 days and the fsd in the changbai mountains is 325 340 days most of the farmland grid is within 325 340 days but no values appear near the liaohe plain indicating that there is no effective snow cover in this area for many years grassland generally has a delay in the fsd as the latitude decreases 2 the overall performance of the lsd is woodland grassland farmland the earliest is the 47th day and the latest is the 115th day with a difference of 68 days the lsd in woodlands exceeds 80 days including more than 100 days in some areas of the great khingan mountains the lsd of farmland generally exceeds 60 days a small number of grids fall between 40 and 60 days and grassland falls between 60 and 100 days there is no snow cover in some grids of the liaohe plain 3 the overall number of sd is woodland grassland farmland the smallest number of sd is 25 days and the largest number of sd is 178 days the number of sd in the woodland lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains areas generally exceeds 150 and that in the changbai mountains exceeds 90 farmland and grassland mainly fall within 30 90 days and there is no obvious distribution pattern 5 2 spatial variation in snow parameters the trend coefficients of snow parameters are shown in fig 7 considering that no snow falls in some grids in individual years the snow parameter value is 0 which has a great impact on the average value thus the value of 0 is not considered in the calculation process the following results are obtained for snow depth the msd of woodland decreases overall and most grids fall within 0 3 0 the msd in some areas of the lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains decreases significantly from 0 6 0 3 the msd in some areas of southeastern jilin increases from 0 to 0 3 farmland shows an increasing trend overall ranging from 0 to 0 3 especially in the northeastern songnen plain where the trend ranges from 0 3 to 0 6 two trends occur in grassland and there is no obvious pattern the asd of woodland shows a decreasing trend overall ranging from 0 6 to 0 3 the asd passes the significance test and some grid trend coefficients are less than 0 6 the farmland grid range is 0 0 3 and the northeastern songnen plain increases significantly ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 both positive grids and negative grids are present in grassland for snow days 1 the fsd of most woodland areas occurs in advance the fsd in some areas of the lesser khingan mountains is delayed significantly and some grids at the junction of jilin and liaoning also show increasing trends the fsd in farmland areas is generally delayed and the trend coefficient falls within 0 0 3 the trend coefficient of the grassland grid in northern inner mongolia is mainly reduced and the trend coefficient in the south is mainly increased 2 the lsd in northeast china advances overall the grid trend coefficient for part of the woodland great khingan mountains falls within 0 3 0 6 and that of most other areas falls within 0 3 0 only part of the grid trend coefficient at the junction of jilin and liaoning falls within 0 0 3 grids with positive trend coefficients are concentrated in farmland ranging from 0 to 0 3 the lsd in the grassland in northern inner mongolia advances throughout the day and the grid in the south is delayed 3 the trend coefficient of sd in northeast china shows obvious differences in the types the number of sd in woodlands decreases and most of the trend coefficients fall within 0 3 0 in some areas of the great khingan mountains the trend coefficients decrease significantly from 0 6 0 3 in contrast to farmland and woodland grassland has an overall sd that shows an increasing trend and the trend coefficient falls within 0 0 3 the number of grid sd in southern inner mongolia increases and the trend coefficient falls within 0 0 3 generally the fsd in woodland is delayed the lsd is advanced the number of sd is smaller and the msd and asd show decreasing trends in contrast to woodland the snow cover period in farmland is longer the depth in farmland increases annually and grassland does not show any obvious trend 5 3 long term variation in snow parameters the annual average snow parameter values are shown in fig 8 overall the three land use types range from high to low according to the snow parameters woodland grassland farmland for snow depth the msd curve changes sharply among the three types the minimum value of msd in the woodland was 10 73 cm which appeared in 2018 the maximum value was 27 02 cm which appeared in 1981 with a difference of 16 29 cm the minimum value of grassland was 2 73 cm which appeared in 2019 the maximum value was 20 74 cm which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 18 01 cm the minimum value of farmland was 2 07 cm which appeared in 2019 and the maximum value was 26 70 cm which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 24 63 cm the asd in woodland showed a downward trend from 1980 to 1990 and from 2013 to 2020 the minimum value was 4 37 cm which appeared in 2008 and the maximum value was 13 16 cm which appeared in 1984 with a difference of 8 79 cm the grassland value fluctuated sharply year by year and the minimum value was 1 09 cm which appeared in 2019 the maximum value was 10 69 cm which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 9 60 cm the curve for farmland fluctuated greatly after 2005 the minimum value was 0 44 cm and the maximum value was 12 85 cm in 1998 with a difference of 12 41 cm for snow days 1 the fsd in woodland has been relatively flat in the last 40 years and the earliest was 305 days which occurred in 2003 the lower forestland values are attributed to the fact that the changbai mountains are not the main snow area which lowers the overall average value the latest was 325 days which occurred in 2016 with a difference of 20 days before 1990 the fsd in grassland was relatively late and after 1990 the fsd was slightly earlier the earliest was 302 days which appeared in 1988 and the latest was 338 days which appeared in 2006 with a difference of 36 days farmland fsd fluctuated intensely from 1990 to 2001 and the change in snow cover at the beginning of the day was more obvious the earliest was 314 days which appeared in 1988 and the latest was 357 days which appeared in 1991 with a difference of 43 days 2 the change in the woodland lsd was relatively slight for many years the earliest was the 83rd day which occurred in 2008 and the latest was 107 days which occurred in 2013 the lsd in grassland showed a small trend before 1998 and an increasing trend after 1998 the minimum value was 63 days which appeared in 2019 and the maximum value was 98 days which appeared in 1984 with a difference of 35 days the lsd in farmland changed significantly after 1996 with a minimum of 52 days a maximum of 90 days occurred in 2008 and a difference of 48 days occurred in 2010 3 the sd in woodland fluctuated slightly over the years and the minimum was 105 days which occurred in 2008 the maximum was 150 days which occurred in 2013 with a difference of 45 days the sd in grassland changed sharply in 2008 and the minimum was 49 days which occurred in 2019 the maximum was 136 days which occurred in 2013 with a difference of 87 days the curve for the sd in farmland fluctuated abruptly and the minimum value was 31 days which appeared in 1998 the calculated value was too small because some grids had few sd and the maximum value was 126 days which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 95 days 6 correlations between sm and snow cover parameters 6 1 temporal correlations between sm and snow cover parameters table 1 shows the correlation coefficients between sm and various snow cover parameters of the three soil types in spring in april there was no obvious correlation between woodland and various snow cover parameters except for the fsd the grassland type showed positive correlations with the other four snow cover parameters and the correlation coefficients mostly exceeded 0 3 the fsd and asd passed the significance test of 0 05 farmland had a negative correlation with the fsd and significant positive correlations with the other four snow cover parameters in particular the correlation coefficient of the lsd reached 0 63 the other three correlation coefficients exceeded 0 4 and all correlation coefficients passed the significance test of 0 01 in may there were positive correlations between woodland and snow parameters but the correlation coefficients were very small mostly approximately 0 1 and they did not pass the significance test there was no significant correlation between the grassland grid and the fsd the correlation coefficient between the lsd and the sd exceeded 0 2 and the correlation coefficient between the msd and the asd was approximately 0 1 which did not pass the significance test the correlation coefficient between the farmland grid and the fsd was still negative although farmland showed significant positive correlations with other snow cover parameters and the highest correlation coefficient was 0 51 which passed the significance test the above analysis reveals no obvious correlation between forest sm and snow cover parameters in april the correlation between grassland and the snow cover period is the strongest followed by snow cover depth and the correlations between farmland and snow cover parameters are the strongest there is a correlation between woodland and the snow cover period in may but the correlation is not strong grassland is still positively correlated with snow cover parameters but the correlation is weakened compared with april and the correlations between farmland and snow cover parameters are the strongest 6 2 spatial correlations between sm and snow cover parameters the previous spatial analysis shows that the changing spatial trends of the fsd and sm are not consistent and that the temporal correlation coefficient does not reflect the correlation therefore only the other four snow cover parameters are considered in this section from the spatial distribution map of sm and snow cover parameters fig 9 the correlation between the lsd and sm is significantly regionalized in april the overall woodland area shows a negative correlation and most of the correlation coefficients fall within 0 4 0 most grids in the great khingan mountains pass the significance test and some areas in the lesser khingan mountains show positive correlations of 0 0 2 grassland types show positive correlations and the correlation coefficients fall within 0 0 6 most grids pass the significance test the correlation between farmland and sm is the strongest and the correlation coefficients in most areas fall within 0 2 0 6 which passes the significance test the overall distribution of sd is similar to that of the lsd but the correlation is slightly lower than that of the lsd the correlation coefficients of woodland in the great khingan mountains range mostly from 0 2 0 those in the lesser khingan mountains range from 0 to 0 2 and those of farmland range from 0 to 0 4 in terms of the msd and sm the significance grid is concentrated on the type of farmland and the correlation coefficients fall within 0 2 0 8 there are many positive correlation grids in woodland in the lesser khingan mountains in terms of the asd and sm some of the woodland grids in the great khingan mountains are negatively correlated from 0 4 0 the areas in the lesser khingan mountains are significantly positively correlated the correlation coefficients range from 0 2 to 0 6 and grassland overall is positively correlated from 0 2 to 0 6 in northern inner mongolia the correlation coefficients pass the significance test the regional correlation of farmland is still the highest and most of the values pass the significance test in may the correlation coefficients between the lsd and sm in the great khingan mountains and changbai mountains change from negative correlations to positive correlations in the range from 0 to 0 4 the overall distributions of grassland and farmland types are not different from those in april but the correlation coefficient values decrease in terms of sd and sm this pattern also applies to woodland the regional coefficients of the great khingan mountains and changbai mountains change from negative to positive and there are no significant changes in grassland and farmland in terms of the msd and sm the overall positive correlation coefficient of woodland increases and the correlation between grassland and woodland decreases in terms of the asd and sm the positive correlation between the woodlands in the great khingan mountains and that in the changbai mountains increases and the correlation between grassland and northern inner mongolia decreases 6 3 linear fitting of sm and snow cover parameters in the previous analysis the correlation coefficients between sm and snow cover parameters were calculated in both time and space to further quantitatively explore the relationship between sm and snow cover parameters grids with significance less than 0 05 in the abovementioned spatial analysis are selected to construct point density maps of snow parameters and sm considering that the number of significant pixels for the fsd and sm is very small in this section the fsd is not included in the calculation the number of significant pixels for other snow parameters exceeds 200 and the number of scattered points exceeds 10000 fig 10 shows that in april the fitting coefficients are 0 19 0 23 0 40 and 0 20 and that the fitting degree between sm and sd is the best the slopes of the linear fitting equations are 4 75 10 3 5 8 10 3 2 89 10 3 and 4 54 10 3 which shows that the later the fsd is the longer the sd the greater the msd and asd and the higher the sm value the order of influence on sm from high to low is sd fsd msd asd in addition the constructed point density maps vary with different snow parameters and the significantly related grid sd and the fsd are evenly distributed the fsd is concentrated within 70 140 days the sm is concentrated within 0 17 0 28 m3 m3 the sd is concentrated within 80 130 days and the sm ranges from 0 18 0 26 m3 m3 the msd and asd are closely distributed the asd mainly falls below 10 cm the sm falls within 0 15 0 27 m3 m3 the msd falls below 30 cm and the sm falls within 0 18 0 28 m3 m3 in may the fitting coefficients are 0 16 0 18 0 14 and 0 12 the fitting effect between sm and sd in may is the best the slopes of the linear fitting equations are 6 58 10 3 4 45 10 3 1 99 10 3 and 3 39 10 3 the line shape of the point density map of the lsd and sm is relatively compact because few points have a value of 0 in grid scatter points and the lsd is concentrated within 55 120 days sm is concentrated within 0 13 0 3 m3 m3 sd is concentrated within 60 150 days and sm falls within 0 15 0 28 m3 m3 the asd and msd are closely distributed the asd mainly falls below 10 cm the sm falls within 0 16 0 27 m3 m3 the msd falls below 30 cm and the sm falls within 0 15 0 28 m3 m3 7 discussion 7 1 differences in snow cover parameters in woodland according to the previous analysis large differences in snow cover parameters are obtained for different land use types whether in april or may the snow cover parameters of woodlands are higher than those of grasslands and farmlands because the forest structure is more conducive to snow storage mcguire and likens 2011 generally the characteristics and spatial distribution of vegetation cover significantly affect the distribution of snow vegetation groups with high densities can capture more snow and form a shelter layer to reduce the evaporation rate of snow wilcox 2010 wind is also a key factor in regulating snow redistribution christiansen et al 2018 huang and wang 2016 schön et al 2018 wind has a more significant impact on snow redistribution than the original snow distribution the area with seasonally frozen soil is dry windy and less rainy in spring and the forest vegetation can ensure the effective deposition of retained snow by reducing the wind speed the snow on the stems and leaves of trees is further protected from strong wind because of its high density moreover strong winds also transport snow in low lying and open plain areas to areas with high vegetation accumulation vajda et al 2006 which further strengthens the snow capacities of woodlands therefore woodlands are higher than the other two types in terms of sd and depth 7 2 response of sm to snow cover under different land use types all snow parameters are consistent in spatial distributions and trend changes because the snow depth indicates the richness of snow resources in an area and the number of sd indicates the stability of snow generally the greater the snow depth is the larger the number of regional sd in this paper the spatial distribution of sd is basically equivalent to those of the msd and asd which also supports this point the snow period of the woodland type continues to shorten and the snow depth decreases but the sm tends to increase because of the complex terrain and the spatial distribution of different vegetation covers the snow melting process in forest ecosystems is often complex and changeable generally snow melting in spring causes snowmelt water to penetrate the soil thus changing the sm lopez caceres et al 2015 pointed out that the relationship between snowmelt water and sm is not a simple linear relationship affected by the initial sm and temperature of the soil the snowmelt water in woodland flows into the surrounding low lying areas and the flow into the forest soil is relatively small that is the effect of snowmelt water in forests on sm is variable in addition note that with the weakening of snow duration and enrichment soil water is likely to reach its peak earlier which increases the probability of soil water stress in the later stage harpold et al 2015 how to maintain the normal state of soil water in spring is more important there is a close relationship between farmland sm and snow the sm and snow cover parameters of farmland have obvious increasing trends which is consistent with the research results for snow and sm in northeast china shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a compared with april may shows decreases in the farmland sm because the grid snow parameters of farmland area are moderate as an example most sd range from 60 to 80 days and the impact on sm is mainly apparent in april the correlation analysis and point density maps also show that each snow parameter has a more significant impact on sm in april than in may the latitude of the grassland grid in northeast china is quite variable and the snow cover parameters in different regions are distinct the grassland grid in the northern region of inner mongolia is located in the high latitude region and the snow parameters are not different from those in the great khingan mountains therefore the sm values display almost no change in april and may there is less snow in the southern region which has no impact on sm so there is no obvious fluctuation however note that according to the research results from continuous climate warming in the future may shorten the grassland growth period and drought affects the normal growth of grassland vegetation 7 3 prediction of spring sm by snow cover parameters in this paper the correlation coefficient is mainly used to demonstrate the correlation between different snow cover parameters and sm among all snow cover parameters the lsd and sm do not show correlation so the lsd is not suitable to be used as a snow cover parameter for predicting sm other snow cover parameters also have different applicability to sm in different periods the correlation between cultivated land sm and snow cover parameters is the closest and snow cover can be used as a decisive factor to predict sm the lsd is more suitable for predicting sm in april sd and msd are more suitable for predicting sm in may and asd has no difference in predicting sm in different periods due to various snow parameters and latitudes the correlations between the northern region and snow parameters are higher than those in the south the lsd msd and asd are suitable for the prediction in april sd is the best which is suitable for the prediction of sm in all grassland grids in may the previous analysis emphasizes that the trends of the forestland type and sm are not consistent so the correlations are mostly negative sd is the best of all parameters and can be used as the basis for judging forestland sm in may the infiltration of snowmelt water into soil is a complex process the physical and chemical properties of soil such as soil type soil density and water saturation are key factors areas with seasonally frozen soil are also accompanied by continuous freezing and thawing which increases the difficulty of investigating this problem at the mechanism level this study finds that the sm of farmland is most closely related to the snow cover parameters and that the correlation coefficient reaches the highest value in the songnen plain with a long snow cover period which is consistent with the correlation between snow cover and sm in farmland areas liang et al 2020a however the correlation coefficient in the liaohe plain at low latitudes is very small and is even negatively correlated because the snow cover period in this area is short the depth of snow is shallow and snow is not the main source of sm zhao et al 2020 pointed out that the spring drought in northeast china is concentrated in southwest liaoning due to sparse snow in this area using artificial irrigation or sowing varieties with strong drought resistance in this area are suggested in addition an obvious relationship occurs between grassland sm and snow affected by the melting time snow has a more significant impact on sm in april in addition there is a small number of negative correlation grids in grassland at low latitudes due to the short snow period the point density maps also show the significant positive impact of snow on sm in general the number of sd and sm are the best which is consistent with the view that the extension of sd is conducive to vegetation growth qiao et al 2019 8 conclusions 1 different land use types in northeast china lead to certain relationships between sm and snow cover parameters in each region the multiyear average sm and snow cover parameters are ordered as forestland grassland farmland 2 the increasing trend of sm in spring over the years is obvious compared with april may has a larger number of grids with positive trends the trends of farmland snow parameters are roughly the same as that of moisture some grassland grid snow parameters show a decreasing trend and sm may decline in the future because of the unique ecological structure of woodland snow cover parameters are not consistent with sm changes but we should still pay attention to the potential risk of woodland spring drought in the future 3 snow parameters have the most significant effect on farmland sm which can last until may the influence of snow parameters on grassland sm is weaker than that on farmland the correlation decreases gradually over time and april is better than may among the five snow cover parameters the fsd does not show a correlation with sm and sd is the best snow cover parameter to judge the sm status of the next year this paper discusses the impact of snow cover parameters on sm for different land use types in the next step other relevant factors such as precipitation temperature evaporation and elevation should be introduced to explain the driving factors of sm in spring more comprehensively and deeply credit

3461,to explore the impact of climate change on snow cover and spring soil moisture sm in areas with seasonally frozen soil snow cover parameters and spring sm for different land use types in northeast china are extracted based on remote sensing snow cover and sm products snow cover parameters include snow days sd first day of snow cover fsd last day of snow cover lsd maximum snow depth msd and average snow depth asd the spatiotemporal variations and correlations between snow cover parameters and spring sm for different land use types are analyzed the results showed that the average spring sm for different land use types was ordered woodland farmland grassland with obvious woodland and farmland increases woodlands had many sd and large snow depths msd and asd that eventually decreased farmland sm increased significantly in spring which aided crop development the decrease in grassland spring sm was not obvious but the snow cover parameters of certain areas decreased notably snow cover significantly impacted farmland sm and correlation coefficients were highest between all snow cover parameters and sm in spring the correlations between grassland snow cover parameters and sm in april were higher than those in may but woodland snow cover parameters and spring sm were not correlated among the five snow parameters fsd had the lowest correlation with spring sm and sd had the greatest impact on sm these results show the significant relationship between snow cover and sm and reveal relevant patterns as future climate warming may introduce drought risk to woodland and grassland areas advance preparations should be made farmland areas will continue to maintain appropriate sm which is beneficial for agricultural development keywords climate change snow cover soil moisture correlation land use type 1 introduction in recent decades global warming and climate change have had many impacts on ecology agriculture water resources and humans dorrepaal et al 2009 jin et al 2020 yao et al 2019 northeast china is located in the highest latitude region in china and is strongly sensitive to climate change research shows that snow in winter as a unique meteorological factor has changed significantly feng and chen 2016 qin et al 2020 snow has the properties of high reflectivity high phase change latent heat and low heat conduction snow affects climate system changes by influencing the surface energy balance climate and atmospheric circulation anomalies also affect the amount of snow by changing the amounts of cold and warm air and precipitation zhang et al 2010 zhong et al 2021 further snow is a valuable freshwater resource in some areas with seasonally frozen soil drought minimal rain and high evaporation in spring snowmelt water is the main water resource supply qi et al 2020 tian et al 2018 it is important to understand the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and changing patterns of snow under climate change conditions on the other hand against the background of global temperature increase in recent years spring drought has occurred frequently in northeast china which has seriously affected the timing of sowing growth and development of crops yu et al 2014 as an intuitive indicator of soil drought and flooding soil moisture sm is important for crop growth and sowing requires land with suitable sm li et al 2016 which greatly impacts seed germination seedling emergence subsequent development and final yield spring sm is important not only for plant growth but also for black soil erosion wei et al 2014 and nutrient loss sm content can significantly affect the aggregate structure of black soil and the soil critical shear stress will change accordingly liu et al 2017 which will change the probability of soil erosion at the same time the change of sm will change the chemical environment of soil especially the content of phosphorus in black soil which is one of the important determinants of nutrient loss in black soil ouyang et al 2013 moreover sm also plays an important role in the surface hydrological process and is one of the key variables in the climate system changing the energy balance through transmission via vegetation and atmosphere long et al 2019 wang et al 2018 affecting the distribution of the climate and ecosystem and exploring the spatiotemporal variations in sm are key issues in areas with seasonally frozen soil snow as the main source of sm in spring can significantly affect the change trend of sm therefore comprehensively analyzing the spatiotemporal variations in snow and sm and their responses to climate change discussing the correlation between snow and sm and understanding the variation patterns of snow and sm are particularly important for rationally utilizing water resources in areas with seasonally frozen soil and for coping with climate change many achievements in research on the spatiotemporal variation laws of snow and sm have been accomplished using the microwave radiation characteristics of forest snow che et al 2016 inversed the snow depth in the forested area of northeast china by using the optimal iterative method the inversion effect was reasonable compared with the measured data wang et al 2014 employed cloud removal products to monitor the regional spatiotemporal changes in the lesser khingan mountains in northeast china the results showed that the snow area of the lesser khingan mountains has increased in the last ten years and that the snow period is longer than that of farmland at low elevations but that the interannual change is relatively small li et al 2017 analyzed the correlation between snow cover in eurasia and winter temperature in northeast china the results showed that the deeper the snow cover was in eurasia and the longer the snow cover period the lower the temperature in northeast china based on ten days of soil relative humidity data from a china agrometeorological station zhu et al 2019 carried out a spatiotemporal analysis of sm in farmland areas the results showed that the sm in farmland areas in china has increased and that sm increases as the soil depth increases but that the rate of increase decreases as the depth increases based on the random forest model and data fusion method long et al 2019 generated a complete continuous and high resolution sm background layer that overcomes the low resolution disadvantages of traditional microwave remote sensing data based on sm values simulated by a variable infiltration capacity vic model zhu et al 2020 proposed a sensitivity method and analyzed the variation in sm in china the results showed that sm in northeast china has increased in the last 50 years but that drying may occur in the future in the context of climate warming the frequency and intensity of global droughts continue to increase as an important water resource in cold regions snow cover and how it affects sm have become a research focus for many scholars through experiments zhang et al 2019b found that climate warming causes the temperature to increase and the growing season of northern forests to lengthen snowmelt water supplements the water needed for vegetation growth in advance snowmelt water enables forest vegetation to cope with climate change potopová et al 2016 pointed out that the advancement of snow cover days and the decrease in snow depth aggravate the degree of sm drought at the end of summer based on experiments li et al 2021 discovered that when the snow depth in winter is larger or the snow cover period is longer snow promotes the extended growth and development of trees but that in arid areas this promotion is weakened based on the annual ring characteristics of trees shamir et al 2020 found a correlation between snow cover and sm via a snow cover hydrological model the abovementioned research results suggest a close relationship between snow cover and sm however there are few studies on the impact of winter snow melting on spring sm in areas with seasonal frozen soil and most studies focus on only single vegetation types such as woodland or farmland the difference in the response of spring sm to different snow cover indicators for different land use types has not been determined at the same time previous studies lack practical significance to guide the development of modern agriculture animal husbandry and forestry because of the continuity of data and the research scale based on the current research status this paper selects a typical area with seasonally frozen soil in northeast china as the research area and extracts three types of land use woodland grassland and farmland based on remote sensing snow products and sm products the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow indicators and sm for different land use types from 1980 to 2020 are discussed and the changing trends and correlations of different snow indicators and sm are analyzed the research results can provide a theoretical basis for preventing extreme drought events and rationally using snow resources in agricultural grassland forest ecosystems under global warming conditions in addition these results provide theoretical guidance for ensuring the safe production of crops and coping with the risks created by climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area northeast china is located from 115 3 135 02 e and 38 43 53 36 n and has an area of 124 104 km2 sun et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 this region is located in the core zone of northeast asia and has a temperate continental monsoon climate fig 1 a the four seasons are distinct the winter is cold and long and the spring is dry and less rainy the region mainly includes the three provinces of heilongjiang jilin and liaoning and parts of eastern inner mongolia the terrain of this area is complex and diverse surrounded by mountains on three sides and high in elevation with the changbai mountains in the east and the lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains in the north and west respectively the central part is a vast plain with an average elevation of less than 300 m from north to south this central area consists of the sanjiang plain songnen plain and liaohe plain the black soil in this area is fertile the terrain is flat and the land is rich in nutrients the soil is an important commodity grain base in china there are various types of land cover with grassland woodland and arable land accounting for the highest proportions northeast china is the main seasonally snow covered area and has the longest snow period and deepest snow 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 satellite snow depth data products snow data are selected from the china snow depth long term series dataset provided by the western china environmental and ecological science data center which is inverted from the daily passive microwave remote sensing data provided by the us ice and snow data center this paper focuses on the time interval from 1980 to 2020 the quality of this dataset is reliable dai et al 2015 and the data are very suitable for use in china dai et al 2017 2 2 2 esa microwave remote sensing soil moisture cci sm product the sm dataset is a satellite based long term global daily sm product developed by the european space agency esa the soil depth is 0 10 cm and the spatial resolution of the dataset is 0 25 this paper uses the time interval from 1980 to 2020 the dataset includes three types of products active passive and active passive fusion gruber et al 2017 liu et al 2012 there have been relevant studies conducted domestically and abroad on the accuracy of this group of datasets the evaluation results show that the accuracy of the fusion product is better than those of the active and passive microwave products before fusion an et al 2016 dorigo et al 2015 to date the reliability of this dataset has been verified from many aspects wagner et al 2012 and it is widely utilized in soil climate hydrology and other fields dorigo et al 2017 based on the measured sm site data in china jia et al 2018 evaluated esa climate change initiative cci and two other long series sm products based on model simulation the results show that the esa cci is highly consistent with the measured site data in northeast china especially in expressing the drought trend liang et al 2020a discussed the spatiotemporal variation trend of farmland sm in northeast china by using esa cci data based on the measured sm data from the china meteorological data network jiang et al 2020 judged the applicability of esa cci data in northern china and analyzed the interannual variation trends of sm in five parts of the region the results showed a high correlation between esa cci data and measured sm data which met the needs of application in northeast china thus this paper uses active and passive fusion products for sm research for more details on the algorithm and theory generated by this product please refer to the literature liu et al 2011 2 2 3 land use type data land use data are provided by the resource and environment science and data center which is based on the landsat thematic mapper tm of the united states and is generated by manual visual interpretation the resolution is 1 km the types include farmland woodland grassland water area and residential land there are 6 primary types and 25 secondary types of unused land to eliminate the influence of land use types on the results two raster datasets from 1980 and 2020 are selected in this paper 3 research methods fig 1 a shows the different types of land use in northeast china for the specific classification types the reader can refer to the data provided by the western china environmental and ecological science data center northeast china has three main types of land use farmland woodland and grassland the sm in paddy fields is greatly affected by human factors farmland counts only as dry land and the other two types include all secondary classifications aeronautical reconnaissance coverage geographic information system arcgis software is employed to convert the original 1 km resolution land use type to 0 25 the specific process is described as follows first a grid covering the study area is established at a resolution of 0 25 and the coordinate system is then converted to the universal transverse mercator utm projection coordinate system each new grid contains several grids with the original 1 km resolution a land use type that accounts for more than 50 of a 0 25 degree new grid area is regarded as the new land use type for the grid and grids with an area of less than 50 are not considered in this article the results are shown in fig 1 b to eliminate the influence of the natural evolution of land use types two raster datasets from 1980 and 2020 were processed according to the abovementioned steps in the same way after comparison grids with unchanged land use types were selected for the final study the sm and snow data in this paper are widely utilized and have yielded satisfactory results therefore this paper does not evaluate the accuracy of the data in this paper the data processing mainly uses python programming software first the original sm netcdf file is extracted and the arcgis inverse distance weighting method is applied to interpolate some missing values in the original data according to the actual situation in northeast china october 1st to april 1st of the following year is regarded as the snow season liang et al 2020a a gridded snow depth in the snow season that is greater than 1 cm is considered an effective snow cover day and the snow cover is extracted from the snow cover dataset five parameters are selected snow days sd first day of snow cover fsd last day of snow cover lsd maximum snow depth msd and average snow depth asd the fsd is defined as the date when a snow depth greater than 1 cm in the snow season first appears the lsd is defined as the date when a snow depth greater than 1 cm in the snow season last appears the msd is defined as the msd that occurs during the snow season the asd is defined as the ratio of the accumulated snow depth to the number of sd in the snow season given the difference in the number of sd in different regions the number of sd is set to 181 referring to a large number of articles increases in sd lsd asd and msd and a decrease in fsd are defined as increases in snow parameters and vice versa the trend coefficient is used to study the long term changes in sm and snow cover parameters this coefficient is the correlation coefficient between the natural sequence and the element sequence and can be used to quantitatively study the rate of increase and rate of decrease in meteorological elements with climate change catastropholgy et al 2020 the mann kendall mk method which is a nonparametric statistical test is selected for the mutation test the advantages of this method are that it does not require samples to follow a certain distribution and is not affected by a few outliers this method is widely applied in meteorology and hydrology li et al 2014 sun et al 2019b the correlation analysis method is employed to quantitatively analyze the correlation between snow cover parameters and sm a one variable linear regression method is utilized to fit the snow

the sm is mostly concentrated within 0 25 0 3 m3 m3 which is suitable for plant growth liang et al 2020a farmland sm is concentrated within 0 2 0 3 m3 m3 which is more suitable for the germination and growth of crop seeds during spring sowing grassland sm is the lowest and is concentrated within 0 15 0 2 m3 m3 indicating mild drought compared with april may exhibits woodland sm with minimal difference the grid from 0 2 0 25 m3 m3 decreases in heilongjiang province and increases in jilin province compared with that in april the farmland sm decreases which is mainly reflected in the increase in the grid from 0 2 0 25 m3 m3 in the songnen plain compared with that in april the grassland water content is lower the grassland is located in northwestern inner mongolia and the number of grids from 0 15 0 2 m3 m3 increases generally the sm of various land types in northeast china shows a certain trend with woodland farmland grassland the sm values of woodland and farmland are greater than 0 2 m3 m3 which is suitable for the growth of plants and crops while most of the grassland sm is less than 0 2 m3 m3 which is lower than the normal sm standard 4 2 spatial variation in sm fig 3 shows the trend distribution of the spatial change in sm in each grid grids that pass the 0 05 significance test are shaded in april the change in sm varies by region in woodland areas most grids in the lesser khingan mountains and changbai mountains show significant increasing trends while some grids in the lesser khingan mountains and changbai mountains show significant decreasing trends in terms of farmland most grids show increasing trends especially in the northeastern songnen plain the grassland in northern inner mongolia shows a significant increasing trend and the trend in the south decreases significantly there is a minimal difference between the increase in the trend coefficient and the decrease in the trend coefficient in may and april but the value changes the decreasing trend in woodlands of the lesser khingan mountains slows and the trend of the regional grid in the changbai mountains changes from decreasing to significantly increasing the increasing farmland trend is enhanced and the grid of the liaohe plain changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend the trend coefficients of grassland increase and decrease the abovementioned analysis shows that the farmland sm in northeast china increases in spring which is beneficial to the sowing and development of crops the woodland areas show stable increasing trends that differ in local areas the increase in the grassland trend coefficient is concentrated in northern inner mongolia while most grid trend coefficients in southern mongolia show decreasing trends 4 3 long term change in sm the annual average change in sm in april is shown in fig 4 generally the three land use types from high to low are woodland farmland grassland from the perspective of interannual variation the three types show stable stable and low stable linear relationships over time which can be divided into three stages 1980 1991 1991 2005 and 2006 2020 the variation range of woodland sm is 0 22 0 29 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 26 m3 m3 the lowest value occurs in 1997 and the highest value appears in 2018 the variation range of farmland sm is 0 19 0 30 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 24 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 1998 and the highest value appears in 2013 the variation range of grassland sm is 0 14 0 23 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 19 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 1997 and the highest value appears in 2013 generally only the grassland sm content is lower than the appropriate sm and the other two types meet the needs of normal crop and plant growth and development the annual average change in sm in may is basically the same as that in april this change also experiences three periods namely stability low stability and high stability but the boundary between the first two woodland periods is not obvious the variation range of sm in woodlands is 0 22 0 30 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 26 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 2001 and the highest value appears in 2010 the variation range of farmland sm is 0 18 0 29 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 22 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 2002 and the highest value appears in 2010 the variation range of grassland sm is 0 15 0 22 m3 m3 and the average sm is 0 18 m3 m3 the lowest value appears in 2002 and the highest value appears in 2014 generally in the past 15 years the sm values of the three types have remained stable woodland and farmland sm contents are appropriate and that of grassland is near the critical point of nonarid sm 4 4 abrupt sm characteristics the mk mutation analysis method was selected to detect the three types of sm in the last 40 years the results are shown in fig 5 there was no obvious mutation point in farmland in april but it decreased from 1991 to 2013 exceeding the 0 05 critical line from 1995 to 2008 the woodland sm decreased significantly from 1994 to 2005 and the mutation point was 2014 indicating that the sm changed from decreasing to increasing in 2014 the sm of grassland decreased significantly from 1996 to 2005 and changed suddenly in 2008 from decreasing to increasing in may there were no obvious mutation points for the three kinds of sm farmland and woodland experienced three stages namely increase decrease and increase grassland exhibited two stages increase and decrease the farmland sm decreased significantly from 1997 to 2010 the woodland sm content decreased significantly from 2001 to 2004 and the grassland sm content decreased significantly from 1999 to 2013 5 spatiotemporal variation characteristics of snow cover 5 1 average characteristics of snow parameters fig 6 shows the distribution of grid by grid snow parameters in northeast china from 1980 to 2020 considering that snow sometimes does not fall in the southernmost part of northeast china parameters with grid data less than 20 years are regarded as no snow which is represented by 0 in the figure as shown in fig 6 for snow depth the msd in northeast china ranges from 0 to 40 cm and the maximum value is 37 89 cm the depth decreases from high latitudes to low latitudes the msd values in the woodlands of the lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains are high generally more than 19 cm and that in the changbai mountains area ranges from 12 to 26 cm farmland and grassland areas fall within 0 19 cm and there is no obvious distribution pattern the asd is 0 20 cm and the maximum value is 19 58 cm the asd in the woodland lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains areas ranges from 8 to 16 cm and that in the changbai mountains area ranges from 4 to 8 cm farmland and grassland areas fall within 1 8 cm and show no obvious distribution pattern in general compared with the other two types woodland has earlier fsd later lsd more sd and higher msd and asd for snow days 1 the fsd is the 287th day at the earliest and the 348th day at the latest with a difference of 61 days and the fsd becomes later from high latitudes to low latitudes the fsd in woodland areas is earlier the fsd in the great khingan mountains is 280 310 days the fsd in the lesser khingan mountains is 310 325 days and the fsd in the changbai mountains is 325 340 days most of the farmland grid is within 325 340 days but no values appear near the liaohe plain indicating that there is no effective snow cover in this area for many years grassland generally has a delay in the fsd as the latitude decreases 2 the overall performance of the lsd is woodland grassland farmland the earliest is the 47th day and the latest is the 115th day with a difference of 68 days the lsd in woodlands exceeds 80 days including more than 100 days in some areas of the great khingan mountains the lsd of farmland generally exceeds 60 days a small number of grids fall between 40 and 60 days and grassland falls between 60 and 100 days there is no snow cover in some grids of the liaohe plain 3 the overall number of sd is woodland grassland farmland the smallest number of sd is 25 days and the largest number of sd is 178 days the number of sd in the woodland lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains areas generally exceeds 150 and that in the changbai mountains exceeds 90 farmland and grassland mainly fall within 30 90 days and there is no obvious distribution pattern 5 2 spatial variation in snow parameters the trend coefficients of snow parameters are shown in fig 7 considering that no snow falls in some grids in individual years the snow parameter value is 0 which has a great impact on the average value thus the value of 0 is not considered in the calculation process the following results are obtained for snow depth the msd of woodland decreases overall and most grids fall within 0 3 0 the msd in some areas of the lesser khingan mountains and great khingan mountains decreases significantly from 0 6 0 3 the msd in some areas of southeastern jilin increases from 0 to 0 3 farmland shows an increasing trend overall ranging from 0 to 0 3 especially in the northeastern songnen plain where the trend ranges from 0 3 to 0 6 two trends occur in grassland and there is no obvious pattern the asd of woodland shows a decreasing trend overall ranging from 0 6 to 0 3 the asd passes the significance test and some grid trend coefficients are less than 0 6 the farmland grid range is 0 0 3 and the northeastern songnen plain increases significantly ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 both positive grids and negative grids are present in grassland for snow days 1 the fsd of most woodland areas occurs in advance the fsd in some areas of the lesser khingan mountains is delayed significantly and some grids at the junction of jilin and liaoning also show increasing trends the fsd in farmland areas is generally delayed and the trend coefficient falls within 0 0 3 the trend coefficient of the grassland grid in northern inner mongolia is mainly reduced and the trend coefficient in the south is mainly increased 2 the lsd in northeast china advances overall the grid trend coefficient for part of the woodland great khingan mountains falls within 0 3 0 6 and that of most other areas falls within 0 3 0 only part of the grid trend coefficient at the junction of jilin and liaoning falls within 0 0 3 grids with positive trend coefficients are concentrated in farmland ranging from 0 to 0 3 the lsd in the grassland in northern inner mongolia advances throughout the day and the grid in the south is delayed 3 the trend coefficient of sd in northeast china shows obvious differences in the types the number of sd in woodlands decreases and most of the trend coefficients fall within 0 3 0 in some areas of the great khingan mountains the trend coefficients decrease significantly from 0 6 0 3 in contrast to farmland and woodland grassland has an overall sd that shows an increasing trend and the trend coefficient falls within 0 0 3 the number of grid sd in southern inner mongolia increases and the trend coefficient falls within 0 0 3 generally the fsd in woodland is delayed the lsd is advanced the number of sd is smaller and the msd and asd show decreasing trends in contrast to woodland the snow cover period in farmland is longer the depth in farmland increases annually and grassland does not show any obvious trend 5 3 long term variation in snow parameters the annual average snow parameter values are shown in fig 8 overall the three land use types range from high to low according to the snow parameters woodland grassland farmland for snow depth the msd curve changes sharply among the three types the minimum value of msd in the woodland was 10 73 cm which appeared in 2018 the maximum value was 27 02 cm which appeared in 1981 with a difference of 16 29 cm the minimum value of grassland was 2 73 cm which appeared in 2019 the maximum value was 20 74 cm which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 18 01 cm the minimum value of farmland was 2 07 cm which appeared in 2019 and the maximum value was 26 70 cm which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 24 63 cm the asd in woodland showed a downward trend from 1980 to 1990 and from 2013 to 2020 the minimum value was 4 37 cm which appeared in 2008 and the maximum value was 13 16 cm which appeared in 1984 with a difference of 8 79 cm the grassland value fluctuated sharply year by year and the minimum value was 1 09 cm which appeared in 2019 the maximum value was 10 69 cm which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 9 60 cm the curve for farmland fluctuated greatly after 2005 the minimum value was 0 44 cm and the maximum value was 12 85 cm in 1998 with a difference of 12 41 cm for snow days 1 the fsd in woodland has been relatively flat in the last 40 years and the earliest was 305 days which occurred in 2003 the lower forestland values are attributed to the fact that the changbai mountains are not the main snow area which lowers the overall average value the latest was 325 days which occurred in 2016 with a difference of 20 days before 1990 the fsd in grassland was relatively late and after 1990 the fsd was slightly earlier the earliest was 302 days which appeared in 1988 and the latest was 338 days which appeared in 2006 with a difference of 36 days farmland fsd fluctuated intensely from 1990 to 2001 and the change in snow cover at the beginning of the day was more obvious the earliest was 314 days which appeared in 1988 and the latest was 357 days which appeared in 1991 with a difference of 43 days 2 the change in the woodland lsd was relatively slight for many years the earliest was the 83rd day which occurred in 2008 and the latest was 107 days which occurred in 2013 the lsd in grassland showed a small trend before 1998 and an increasing trend after 1998 the minimum value was 63 days which appeared in 2019 and the maximum value was 98 days which appeared in 1984 with a difference of 35 days the lsd in farmland changed significantly after 1996 with a minimum of 52 days a maximum of 90 days occurred in 2008 and a difference of 48 days occurred in 2010 3 the sd in woodland fluctuated slightly over the years and the minimum was 105 days which occurred in 2008 the maximum was 150 days which occurred in 2013 with a difference of 45 days the sd in grassland changed sharply in 2008 and the minimum was 49 days which occurred in 2019 the maximum was 136 days which occurred in 2013 with a difference of 87 days the curve for the sd in farmland fluctuated abruptly and the minimum value was 31 days which appeared in 1998 the calculated value was too small because some grids had few sd and the maximum value was 126 days which appeared in 2013 with a difference of 95 days 6 correlations between sm and snow cover parameters 6 1 temporal correlations between sm and snow cover parameters table 1 shows the correlation coefficients between sm and various snow cover parameters of the three soil types in spring in april there was no obvious correlation between woodland and various snow cover parameters except for the fsd the grassland type showed positive correlations with the other four snow cover parameters and the correlation coefficients mostly exceeded 0 3 the fsd and asd passed the significance test of 0 05 farmland had a negative correlation with the fsd and significant positive correlations with the other four snow cover parameters in particular the correlation coefficient of the lsd reached 0 63 the other three correlation coefficients exceeded 0 4 and all correlation coefficients passed the significance test of 0 01 in may there were positive correlations between woodland and snow parameters but the correlation coefficients were very small mostly approximately 0 1 and they did not pass the significance test there was no significant correlation between the grassland grid and the fsd the correlation coefficient between the lsd and the sd exceeded 0 2 and the correlation coefficient between the msd and the asd was approximately 0 1 which did not pass the significance test the correlation coefficient between the farmland grid and the fsd was still negative although farmland showed significant positive correlations with other snow cover parameters and the highest correlation coefficient was 0 51 which passed the significance test the above analysis reveals no obvious correlation between forest sm and snow cover parameters in april the correlation between grassland and the snow cover period is the strongest followed by snow cover depth and the correlations between farmland and snow cover parameters are the strongest there is a correlation between woodland and the snow cover period in may but the correlation is not strong grassland is still positively correlated with snow cover parameters but the correlation is weakened compared with april and the correlations between farmland and snow cover parameters are the strongest 6 2 spatial correlations between sm and snow cover parameters the previous spatial analysis shows that the changing spatial trends of the fsd and sm are not consistent and that the temporal correlation coefficient does not reflect the correlation therefore only the other four snow cover parameters are considered in this section from the spatial distribution map of sm and snow cover parameters fig 9 the correlation between the lsd and sm is significantly regionalized in april the overall woodland area shows a negative correlation and most of the correlation coefficients fall within 0 4 0 most grids in the great khingan mountains pass the significance test and some areas in the lesser khingan mountains show positive correlations of 0 0 2 grassland types show positive correlations and the correlation coefficients fall within 0 0 6 most grids pass the significance test the correlation between farmland and sm is the strongest and the correlation coefficients in most areas fall within 0 2 0 6 which passes the significance test the overall distribution of sd is similar to that of the lsd but the correlation is slightly lower than that of the lsd the correlation coefficients of woodland in the great khingan mountains range mostly from 0 2 0 those in the lesser khingan mountains range from 0 to 0 2 and those of farmland range from 0 to 0 4 in terms of the msd and sm the significance grid is concentrated on the type of farmland and the correlation coefficients fall within 0 2 0 8 there are many positive correlation grids in woodland in the lesser khingan mountains in terms of the asd and sm some of the woodland grids in the great khingan mountains are negatively correlated from 0 4 0 the areas in the lesser khingan mountains are significantly positively correlated the correlation coefficients range from 0 2 to 0 6 and grassland overall is positively correlated from 0 2 to 0 6 in northern inner mongolia the correlation coefficients pass the significance test the regional correlation of farmland is still the highest and most of the values pass the significance test in may the correlation coefficients between the lsd and sm in the great khingan mountains and changbai mountains change from negative correlations to positive correlations in the range from 0 to 0 4 the overall distributions of grassland and farmland types are not different from those in april but the correlation coefficient values decrease in terms of sd and sm this pattern also applies to woodland the regional coefficients of the great khingan mountains and changbai mountains change from negative to positive and there are no significant changes in grassland and farmland in terms of the msd and sm the overall positive correlation coefficient of woodland increases and the correlation between grassland and woodland decreases in terms of the asd and sm the positive correlation between the woodlands in the great khingan mountains and that in the changbai mountains increases and the correlation between grassland and northern inner mongolia decreases 6 3 linear fitting of sm and snow cover parameters in the previous analysis the correlation coefficients between sm and snow cover parameters were calculated in both time and space to further quantitatively explore the relationship between sm and snow cover parameters grids with significance less than 0 05 in the abovementioned spatial analysis are selected to construct point density maps of snow parameters and sm considering that the number of significant pixels for the fsd and sm is very small in this section the fsd is not included in the calculation the number of significant pixels for other snow parameters exceeds 200 and the number of scattered points exceeds 10000 fig 10 shows that in april the fitting coefficients are 0 19 0 23 0 40 and 0 20 and that the fitting degree between sm and sd is the best the slopes of the linear fitting equations are 4 75 10 3 5 8 10 3 2 89 10 3 and 4 54 10 3 which shows that the later the fsd is the longer the sd the greater the msd and asd and the higher the sm value the order of influence on sm from high to low is sd fsd msd asd in addition the constructed point density maps vary with different snow parameters and the significantly related grid sd and the fsd are evenly distributed the fsd is concentrated within 70 140 days the sm is concentrated within 0 17 0 28 m3 m3 the sd is concentrated within 80 130 days and the sm ranges from 0 18 0 26 m3 m3 the msd and asd are closely distributed the asd mainly falls below 10 cm the sm falls within 0 15 0 27 m3 m3 the msd falls below 30 cm and the sm falls within 0 18 0 28 m3 m3 in may the fitting coefficients are 0 16 0 18 0 14 and 0 12 the fitting effect between sm and sd in may is the best the slopes of the linear fitting equations are 6 58 10 3 4 45 10 3 1 99 10 3 and 3 39 10 3 the line shape of the point density map of the lsd and sm is relatively compact because few points have a value of 0 in grid scatter points and the lsd is concentrated within 55 120 days sm is concentrated within 0 13 0 3 m3 m3 sd is concentrated within 60 150 days and sm falls within 0 15 0 28 m3 m3 the asd and msd are closely distributed the asd mainly falls below 10 cm the sm falls within 0 16 0 27 m3 m3 the msd falls below 30 cm and the sm falls within 0 15 0 28 m3 m3 7 discussion 7 1 differences in snow cover parameters in woodland according to the previous analysis large differences in snow cover parameters are obtained for different land use types whether in april or may the snow cover parameters of woodlands are higher than those of grasslands and farmlands because the forest structure is more conducive to snow storage mcguire and likens 2011 generally the characteristics and spatial distribution of vegetation cover significantly affect the distribution of snow vegetation groups with high densities can capture more snow and form a shelter layer to reduce the evaporation rate of snow wilcox 2010 wind is also a key factor in regulating snow redistribution christiansen et al 2018 huang and wang 2016 schön et al 2018 wind has a more significant impact on snow redistribution than the original snow distribution the area with seasonally frozen soil is dry windy and less rainy in spring and the forest vegetation can ensure the effective deposition of retained snow by reducing the wind speed the snow on the stems and leaves of trees is further protected from strong wind because of its high density moreover strong winds also transport snow in low lying and open plain areas to areas with high vegetation accumulation vajda et al 2006 which further strengthens the snow capacities of woodlands therefore woodlands are higher than the other two types in terms of sd and depth 7 2 response of sm to snow cover under different land use types all snow parameters are consistent in spatial distributions and trend changes because the snow depth indicates the richness of snow resources in an area and the number of sd indicates the stability of snow generally the greater the snow depth is the larger the number of regional sd in this paper the spatial distribution of sd is basically equivalent to those of the msd and asd which also supports this point the snow period of the woodland type continues to shorten and the snow depth decreases but the sm tends to increase because of the complex terrain and the spatial distribution of different vegetation covers the snow melting process in forest ecosystems is often complex and changeable generally snow melting in spring causes snowmelt water to penetrate the soil thus changing the sm lopez caceres et al 2015 pointed out that the relationship between snowmelt water and sm is not a simple linear relationship affected by the initial sm and temperature of the soil the snowmelt water in woodland flows into the surrounding low lying areas and the flow into the forest soil is relatively small that is the effect of snowmelt water in forests on sm is variable in addition note that with the weakening of snow duration and enrichment soil water is likely to reach its peak earlier which increases the probability of soil water stress in the later stage harpold et al 2015 how to maintain the normal state of soil water in spring is more important there is a close relationship between farmland sm and snow the sm and snow cover parameters of farmland have obvious increasing trends which is consistent with the research results for snow and sm in northeast china shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a compared with april may shows decreases in the farmland sm because the grid snow parameters of farmland area are moderate as an example most sd range from 60 to 80 days and the impact on sm is mainly apparent in april the correlation analysis and point density maps also show that each snow parameter has a more significant impact on sm in april than in may the latitude of the grassland grid in northeast china is quite variable and the snow cover parameters in different regions are distinct the grassland grid in the northern region of inner mongolia is located in the high latitude region and the snow parameters are not different from those in the great khingan mountains therefore the sm values display almost no change in april and may there is less snow in the southern region which has no impact on sm so there is no obvious fluctuation however note that according to the research results from continuous climate warming in the future may shorten the grassland growth period and drought affects the normal growth of grassland vegetation 7 3 prediction of spring sm by snow cover parameters in this paper the correlation coefficient is mainly used to demonstrate the correlation between different snow cover parameters and sm among all snow cover parameters the lsd and sm do not show correlation so the lsd is not suitable to be used as a snow cover parameter for predicting sm other snow cover parameters also have different applicability to sm in different periods the correlation between cultivated land sm and snow cover parameters is the closest and snow cover can be used as a decisive factor to predict sm the lsd is more suitable for predicting sm in april sd and msd are more suitable for predicting sm in may and asd has no difference in predicting sm in different periods due to various snow parameters and latitudes the correlations between the northern region and snow parameters are higher than those in the south the lsd msd and asd are suitable for the prediction in april sd is the best which is suitable for the prediction of sm in all grassland grids in may the previous analysis emphasizes that the trends of the forestland type and sm are not consistent so the correlations are mostly negative sd is the best of all parameters and can be used as the basis for judging forestland sm in may the infiltration of snowmelt water into soil is a complex process the physical and chemical properties of soil such as soil type soil density and water saturation are key factors areas with seasonally frozen soil are also accompanied by continuous freezing and thawing which increases the difficulty of investigating this problem at the mechanism level this study finds that the sm of farmland is most closely related to the snow cover parameters and that the correlation coefficient reaches the highest value in the songnen plain with a long snow cover period which is consistent with the correlation between snow cover and sm in farmland areas liang et al 2020a however the correlation coefficient in the liaohe plain at low latitudes is very small and is even negatively correlated because the snow cover period in this area is short the depth of snow is shallow and snow is not the main source of sm zhao et al 2020 pointed out that the spring drought in northeast china is concentrated in southwest liaoning due to sparse snow in this area using artificial irrigation or sowing varieties with strong drought resistance in this area are suggested in addition an obvious relationship occurs between grassland sm and snow affected by the melting time snow has a more significant impact on sm in april in addition there is a small number of negative correlation grids in grassland at low latitudes due to the short snow period the point density maps also show the significant positive impact of snow on sm in general the number of sd and sm are the best which is consistent with the view that the extension of sd is conducive to vegetation growth qiao et al 2019 8 conclusions 1 different land use types in northeast china lead to certain relationships between sm and snow cover parameters in each region the multiyear average sm and snow cover parameters are ordered as forestland grassland farmland 2 the increasing trend of sm in spring over the years is obvious compared with april may has a larger number of grids with positive trends the trends of farmland snow parameters are roughly the same as that of moisture some grassland grid snow parameters show a decreasing trend and sm may decline in the future because of the unique ecological structure of woodland snow cover parameters are not consistent with sm changes but we should still pay attention to the potential risk of woodland spring drought in the future 3 snow parameters have the most significant effect on farmland sm which can last until may the influence of snow parameters on grassland sm is weaker than that on farmland the correlation decreases gradually over time and april is better than may among the five snow cover parameters the fsd does not show a correlation with sm and sd is the best snow cover parameter to judge the sm status of the next year this paper discusses the impact of snow cover parameters on sm for different land use types in the next step other relevant factors such as precipitation temperature evaporation and elevation should be introduced to explain the driving factors of sm in spring more comprehensively and deeply credit

3462,instream plants which act as biological processors have emerged as potentially advantageous eco morphologic tools to be used in river management and restoration most of the study on the geomorphic role of vegetation as it interacts with flow and sediment has focused on local patch scale dynamics in this study we present flume experiments aimed at improving our understanding of how vegetation patches link together to impact reach scale hydraulics and suspended sediment transport and disposition on the hydraulics side we investigate a the relationship between the imposed instream vegetation configuration and water surface slopes b the secondary flow patterns which arise because of the imposed vegetative obstructions and c the role of vegetative resistance on residence time within reach we also examine how different vegetation arrangements determine the patterns quantity and caliber of suspended sediment deposited in the flume a key result of vegetation within the channel is the overall non uniformity in flow conditions it imposes upstream within and downstream of the vegetated reach at steady state vegetated patches locally increase the resistance leading to a backwater condition upstream of the patch and high water surface slopes within the patch in general this leads to enhanced deposition of suspended sediment upstream of the patch and reduced deposition

gurnell et al 2012 nevertheless a general rule is that the area occupied by vegetation in a river cross section decreases downstream as the channel becomes wider brierley and fryirs 2005 the interaction between streamflow fluctuations and the groundwater is one of the significant factors which controls the distribution of vegetation and spatial habitat heterogeneity along the river corridor lytle and poff 2004 poff et al 1997 schneider et al 2011 tockner et al 2000 this heterogeneity is influential for the coexistence of the species cornacchia et al 2018 which is vital in the ecology community amarasekare 2003 kemp et al 2000 in regimes where streamflow variability in the river is low the spatial pattern of vegetation along the river is mainly controlled by groundwater variability this generates spatially narrow vegetation mosaic with homogeneous patterns doulatyari et al 2014 in erratic regimes conversely wider aquatic terrestrial zones are observed doulatyari et al 2014 according to schnauder and moggridge 2009 the experience in the tagliemento river showed that floodline patches developed due to deposition of seeds fragments along the floodline when waters retreat after the flood discharge leaving a moist and bare environment which is suitable for growth if these seeds and fragments are deposited at a higher level within the river corridor it is less likely to be exposed to consecutive floods as they sprout and establish gurnell 2014 hence in a sense the distribution pattern of vegetation along the river corridor can be considered the flow history

et al 2021 graf and song 1995 understanding the reciprocal interaction between flow and vegetation can be regarded as a good starting point to understand better the role of instream vegetation in capturing suspended sediment in natural rivers at the first stage the problem can be considered at an individual plant scale when an isolated vegetation element is exposed to flow depending on the vegetation characteristics plant morphometry flexural rigidity and seasonality certain unstable and periodic coherent structures are generated around the obstruction as a consequence of this the presence of vegetative obstruction dramatically alters the turbulence distribution nezu and onitsuka 2001 velocity profiles kitsikoudis et al 2020 2016 bottom shear stress heidari et al 2021 vertical mixing along with the depth carollo et al 2002 and horizontal momentum exchange between the main channel floodplain wilson et al 2006b wilson et al 2006a and transportation of sediment yamasaki et al 2021 the superposed impact of all these aforementioned local factors inevitably alters the hydraulic resistance against the flow at the reach scale in natural rivers freeman et al 2000 however due to the local key impacts of vegetation on flow and sedimentary processes the vast majority of previous research focused on the problem at the patch scale rather than reach scale in the past therefore in the pertinent literature there is a gap of knowledge about the influence of instream vegetation on flow and fluvial sediment processes at the reach scale with this motivation we conducted flume experiments to investigate the impact of instream vegetation on sedimentary processes at the reach scale the aims of the problem were multifold therefore two types of experiments were conducted the first was experiments that focused on reach scale hydraulics associated with the vegetation without sediment and the second was a set of experiments that focused on how suspended sediment interacted with the vegetation the framework of the study the basic facts which underpin the design of the applied experimental setup and the primary research questions of this study were briefly described in the next chapter 2 study objective and research questions the primary objective of this study was to understand better the influence of multiple consecutive instream vegetation elements on channel hydraulics and sedimentation for these instream vegetation elements we considered both the interactions of isolated vegetation patches within the channel what we refer to as the individual scale analysis and uniformly distributed vegetation throughout the reach what we refer to as the reach scale analysis the specific questions that motivated the study from the hydraulics perspective were 1 how do consecutive multiple instream vegetative patches affect the secondary flow patterns in the wake regions 2 how does instream vegetation affect the water surface profile along the river reach and 3 how does the presence of the instream vegetation change the quantity location and grain size of the sediment deposited within reach to address these questions we conducted a series of experimental runs in a laboratory flume where we varied the vegetation pattern using both clear water and suspensions of clay 3 methods two different types of experiments were conducted experiments without any suspended sediment hydraulics focused and experiments with suspended sediment sediment transport and deposition focused the goals of the experiments that did not have suspended sediment were to investigate the secondary flow patterns behind instream vegetation by flow visualization techniques by laser sheet and dye injections examine the role of instream vegetation on specific energy budget by water surface slope measurements in vegetated reach observe the influence of instream vegetation on the residence time of particles for a given reach length the experiments with suspended sediment were conducted to analyze the deposition patterns around vegetation which arises depending on the imposed instream vegetation configuration in the channel by photogrammetric methods investigate the spatial distribution of character of the deposited sediment at reach scale by spatial distribution of grain size and weight measurements understand the suspended sediment capturing ability of different arrangements of instream vegetation by sediment concentration measurements at the reach scale the conditions tested for the vegetated runs are summarized in table 1 the details associated with these experiments are presented in the next section it should be noted that unless otherwise stated in the text hereafter the term vegetation denotes emergent vegetation 3 1 experimental setup and instrumentation 3 1 1 flume all the tests were conducted at baker environmental hydraulics laboratory at virginia tech the experiments were performed in a 12 m long 18 cm wide 12 cm deep tilting flow through flume designed to allow for a constant concentration at the inlet while allowing deposition to occur within the test section throughout the experiments the channel bottom slope was zero water is supplied from a constant head tank to a sediment mixing tank which then flows to the flume headbox honeycomb is used to straighten the flow entering the flume and tail water depth is controlled using a series of removable vertical bars water and sediment that exit the flume are not recirculated discharge is controlled with a valve and measured volumetrically depth and velocity in the flume without any vegetation present are set through a combination of discharge slope and the number of bars at the flume exit sediment is supplied to the mixing tank via a variable speed accu rate dry sediment feeder further information about the flume specifications can be obtained from culp et al culp et al 2021 3 1 2 model vegetation five different vegetated zone configurations were used throughout the study these configurations can be grouped into two major types a instream patchy vegetation and b a fully vegetated cross section the instream patchy vegetation configurations could further be classified as a dense mid stream vegetation b sparse mid stream vegetation c dense side vegetation in line arrangement d dense side vegetation in staggered arrangement vegetation was modeled using 5 mm diameter cylindrical wooden rods the rods were mounted on three 1 2 m long foam top boards creating an overall length of 3 6 m for the vegetated zone we use the term vegetated zone throughout regardless of whether the cross section is fully vegetated or equipped with mid stream vegetation the foam top boards rested on the flume sidewalls with the vegetation rods resting on the flume bed fig 1 placing the vegetation in this way made it easy to remove the vegetation zone after completing the experiments so that sediment deposited patterns could be photographed the individual stem diameters were each d 5 mm and the circumambient diameters of the in stream patches were set to d 7 cm the mid stream porous obstructions were designed with two different solid volume fractions fig 2 i e svf nd2 d2 where n is the number of cylinders within the array this yields solid volume fraction value of 0 189 for the dense patch and svf 0 097 for the sparse patch these values fall in a reasonable range of solids fractions of vegetated patches table 1 in yagci et al 2021 the distances between consecutive isolated patches were kept constant as 6d i e 42 cm allowing for nine successive isolated patches within the vegetated zone fig 1 during the experiments while discharge conditions were varied within the range of 1 13 l s 0 27 l s the stem reynolds numbers red i e the diameter of the patch is the characteristic length in reynolds number were changed within the range of 960 4000 to quantify the contraction effect the ratios of obstacle diameter to flume width were calculated for the solid cylinders which are volumetrically identical to examined midchannel patches based on the svf of midchannel islands i e 0 189 and 0 097 and flume width ratios of obstacle diameter to flume width were determined as 1 6 and 1 9 respectively these ratios are reasonably close to the values suggested by tafarojnoruz et al 2012 for typical scour deposition experiments 3 1 3 sediment characteristics the tests were conducted with only one type of sediment i e the kaolinite clay mineral the d16 d50 and d84 of the feed material was 3 9 6 8 and 11 5 µm respectively with a geometric standard deviation of σg 1 8 σ in ϕ units of 0 83 these size values were obtained by measuring the kaolinite in a suspension of dispersant with the horiba laser diffraction particle size analyzer as mentioned earlier this sediment while being a clay mineral and possessing a level of cohesion exists primarily as aggregates within the very fine silt size range it does not readily flocculate in the flume without the addition of biological binders the silt sized clay mineral ensured that we could model suspended sediment in the small scale flume coarse silica silt or fine sand would travel through the system as bed load the study aimed to examine how the presence of vegetation would impact material largely traveling as suspended load with the kaolinite and range of flow conditions in the experiments the rouse number for the experiments ranged from 0 013 to 0 026 for d50 10 µm and from 0 08 to 0 16 for d84 25 µm without the presence of vegetation values in this range should result in a suspended load dominated transport condition 3 2 experimental procedure and measurement methods the ultimate goal of the experiments was to examine the impact of the different vegetation configurations on the deposition of fine suspended sediment however before introducing suspended sediment to the flume time was spent to characterize the general hydraulics of the system specifically experiments were conducted to visualize the coherent motion surrounding the vegetation in its different configurations measure the overall resistance of the different configurations and measure the particle transit time through the fully vegetated reach following these measurements the second set of tests were run wherein suspended sediment was introduced at the flume inlet for two hours and the resulting deposit was measured suspended sediment concentration was also measured throughout the two hr duration of each run at the flume entrance and exit using a calibrated optical backscatter sensor obs 3 2 1 flow visualization two different flow visualization techniques i e laser sheet illumination and dye injection were used to visualize the flow patterns associated with the five different vegetation configurations visualization via dye injection was used to examine how flow paths interact between vegetation elements at the scale of multiple elements whereas the laser sheet images provide a more detailed picture of flow around individual vegetation elements or patches the advantages of these flow visualization techniques are that they are non intrusive and provide feedback about the coherent motions associated with vegetation arrangements dye tracing was conducted on all five arrangements by introducing dye of varying colors upstream of the elements while recording video and images with an overhead camera table 1 lists the discharge conditions associated with the dye injections visualization via laser sheet measurements was made in a dark room by orienting a green sheet laser parallel to the flume bed at about mid depth ambient particles present in the source water were used as light scatterers for flow tracing an overhead camera was again used to provide video and images of the flow patterns images and video were collected for four of the model vegetation configurations a midstream solid cylinder a dense isolated midstream patch a sparse isolated midstream patch and four consecutive dense midstream patches at a single discharge of 0 864 l s 3 2 2 water surface slope vegetative elements can produce considerable resistance to the incoming flow at the patch individual scale these elements change the flow structure around the obstacle and amplify the shear stress in their vicinity at the reach scale they magnify the hydraulic resistance in these experiments we measured the water surface slope as a means of measuring the change in overall hydraulic resistance due to the presence of the vegetation water surface slope was measured using micro digital gage with 0 05 mm accuracy cmt dhg 001 digital height gauge six different discharges i e 0 269 0 515 0 696 0 864 0 958 and 1 127 l s were applied for each vegetation configuration during these water surface profile measurements for this purpose depth measurements were conducted at four characteristic locations i e 193 cm upstream of the vegetated zone 1 cm upstream and downstream of the vegetated zone and 95 cm downstream of vegetated zone the vegetated cases were a fully vegetated cross section b mid stream vegetation dense case c mid stream vegetation sparse case d side vegetation staggered configuration dense case e empty flume reference 3 2 3 particle transit time through the vegetated zone the presence of the vegetation leads to an increased later exchange of moment and mass relative to a straight channel with no vegetation which can lead to a more circuitous path for particles moving through vegetated patches we quantified the difference in travel time for particles moving through the fully vegetated configuration and compared averaged transit times to the unvegetated case particles used in these experiments were buoyant made of plastic and approximately 2 mm in diameter particles were released one at a time from the same location upstream of the vegetated zone and the time that it took to make its way to the exit point of the vegetated zone was visually tracked and recorded the simple test was repeated 11 times for each of the five different discharges to obtain an average transit time tfv for fully vegetated case the transit times of the particles in nonvegetated case were also visually tracked the average of 7 measurements were obtained for each of the five different discharges were considered as the reference transit times tnv in the nonvegetated channel particles traversed the section along the narrow corridor between the vegetated zone and the side of the flume were not counted to avoid bias due to the boundary 3 2 4 the introduction of suspended sediment the core objective of this study was to examine the impact of the different vegetation configurations on sedimentation within the flume all experiments where suspended sediment was introduced were run for a duration of two hours table 1 summarizes the vegetation conditions discharge and measurements made of each of the 11 experiments experiments 1 2 and 3 5 represent different sets of runs with identical conditions the purpose of the repeat experiments was to test a measure of experimental variability as mentioned earlier the flow through flume is capable of delivering a constant concentration of suspended sediment to the inlet of the flume suspended concentration throughout the experiment was monitored both at the flume entrance and exit using calibrated campbell scientific obs 3 probes paired with a pc200w data logger separate calibration experiments were performed using the same bentonite over a large range of concentrations 3 2 5 measurement of the resulting deposits following the completion of each two hour run flow in the flume was gently turned down to zero and the bed was left to drain and dry for 24 h before images and physical deposit samples were collected images were collected using an overhead camera to capture the spatial pattern of sediment deposited in the flume at the end of each two hour experiment the camera was mounted on an overhead traverse system and moved along the length of the flume for imaging reference points and scales were included in the images to allow for a photomosaic consisting of 19 26 images to be created for each run sediment was collected from the bottom of the flume at the end of each run to quantify the mass and spatial distribution of deposited sediment and to obtain the grain size distribution of the deposit at each sampling location for this purpose the flume bed was divided into eleven different zones each 40 cm in length and equal to the flume width nine of the eleven patches were located within the vegetated zone one was located upstream of the vegetated zone and the last was located downstream of the vegetated zone each sample was first dried and then weighed the dry sample was then mixed and subsampled and the grain size distribution of the subsample was obtained using a malvern mastersizer 4 results the results from the flow visualization water surface slope and particle residence time are presented first to provide a general overview of the hydraulics associated with each vegetation configuration results with respect to the impact of the vegetation on the capture of suspended sediment are then presented 4 1 the secondary flow patterns behind instream vegetation based on flow visualization 4 1 1 laser sheet results based on the flow visualization experiments a comparative analysis of major coherent flow structures behind the different forms of mid stream vegetation was interpreted in fig 3 flow records obtained behind the characteristic obstacles using a laser sheet were given isolated permeable mid stream vegetation elements cause distinct acceleration zone at both sides of the structure fig 3b and c and bleed flow which is the flow that passes through between the isolated elements constituting a patch while these permeable two cases with different solid volume fractions generate a considerably weaker vortex behind the obstacle due to the presence of bleed flow an in stream isolated solid cylinder case generates a quite stark vortex behind the body this finding is in line with the ones pointed out by chang et al 2017 kitsikoudis et al 2016 according to chen et al 2012a zong and nepf 2012 and euler et al 2014 bleed flow is a significant factor that produces the steady wake region indeed it was seen from fig 3 that the presence of the bleed flow mitigates the lateral momentum exchange due to decreased shear layer between wake and contraction zones behind such an obstruction and causes to delay the onset of the von karman vortex street the severe vortex which emerges with a certain frequency in a solid cylinder case periodically block the flow at the acceleration zones in the contraction region i e both side of the obstacle in this way it provides an intermittent character to the acceleration zone at the sides of the solid cylinder as can be concluded from fig 3 the magnitude of the acceleration observed at both sides of the permeable obstacles is proportional to the density of the permeable obstruction when the flow patterns behind dense mid stream vegetation svf 0 189 and sparse mid stream vegetation svf 0 097 were compared it was seen that for the sparser case due to the weaker blockage against the incoming flow the velocities in the acceleration zone at the side of the vegetation is less it was also seen from the video in which fig 3 was extracted from that while in sparse case stem scale vortices are observed stem scale vortices were not distinguished in the dense case this observation is in line with the findings by takemura and tanaka 2007 who showed that with the increasing solid volume fraction of the permeable obstacle stem scale vortices were replaced with large scale von karman vortex 4 1 2 dye injection results dye injection technique was applied to visualize the flow pattern in a larger area different colors of dye red versus green were released from the left and right sides of the obstacle to observe the interaction of patch scale vortices more clearly in fig 4 instantaneous views of vortex structures around the different configurations of the vegetal elements are given for comparative analysis when the different forms of the isolated elements i e solid cylinder fig 4 a dense and sparse isolated midstream patch fig 4b and d respectively were compared it was seen that with the increasing solid volume fraction the shedding frequency increases while the length of steady wake region diminishes this finding was in agreement with the finding of chen et al 2012b according to zhou and alam 2016 in the tandem arrangement of two cylinders the downstream cylinder wake is significantly affected due to the presence of the upstream cylinder but not vice versa similarly zdravkovich 1977 reported that the upstream cylinder induced pairs vortices trigger the formation of vortex shedding for the downstream body in this study similar situations were observed for the permeable finite array of tandem cylinders located within the wake interference of each other when the isolated and tandem arrangements of the mid stream vegetation elements in fig 3 were compared it was seen that the presence of multiple elements located upstream caused the production of the distinct vortex downstream it can be hypothesized that the turbulence and vortex generated due to the presence of the obstacles at upstream enhance the instability of the pressure field around the body located downstream this enhanced instability developed upstream enhances the vortex s strength for the mid stream vegetation located downstream 4 2 resistance and water surface slope the variation of the water surface along the reach was obtained under three discharge conditions fig 5 a dramatic increase in water depth was observed upstream of the vegetated zone for all cases of vegetation configurations fig 5 and this increase became more pronounced with increasing discharge this behavior is reasonable because resistance increases with the square of the velocity it is evident from fig 5 that the water surface slope is extremely steep within the vegetated zone compared to that of upstream downstream sections this situation is even more pronounced for the fully vegetated cases for fully vegetated cases when the discharge range is between 0 0269 l s 1 127 l s the water surface slope values remain in the range of 0 0032 0 0082 fig 6 downstream of the vegetated zone the water depth increases in the downstream direction due to the effect of the weir fig 5 fig 6 shows the variation of water surface slopes under six different discharge conditions for the different configurations of vegetative obstructions steeper water surface slopes imply that the difference between the upstream and downstream water depths is greater in our runs the fully vegetated case produces a higher water surface slope 4 3 the influence of instream vegetation on the residence time of particles within a vegetated reach the role of instream vegetation on the residence time of particles moving through the fully vegetated reach was compared with the non vegetated case the variations of the ratios of tnv tfv with respect to the discharges were given in fig 7 in which tnv and tfv are the residence times in non vegetated reach and fully vegetated reach respectively while the ratio of tnv tfv approaching to 1 indicates that vegetation has no influence on the residence time of the particles this ratio approaches to 0 implies that the vegetation significantly extend the residence time viewed in this perspective fig 7 demonstrates the retention ability of instream plants on particles this retention is even more pronounced for the higher discharge values the increase in residence time came from the more circuitous path the particles took moving through the vegetated zone during the experiments it was also visually observed that the particles may remain in recirculation zone rear the stems this situation was true despite the overall increase in the depth averaged velocity through the vegetated zone due to the contraction effects created by stems 4 4 the influence of instream vegetation on bed morphology 4 4 1 reach scale assessment fig 8 shows the characteristic planform view of the deposition patterns observed within the flume under the influence of the different vegetation forms the first observation from these combined images is that the introduction of vegetation leads to sediment deposition upstream of the vegetated zone due to the increased depth i e backwater effect and therefore decreased velocities examining the amount of deposited mass in the different zones shows that the mass of sediment deposited in zone 1 the zone immediately upstream of the vegetated zone is more significant for the cases with vegetation than for the case without vegetation fig 9 a this is not to say that the unvegetated case did not experience deposition zone 1 in fact all runs regardless of vegetation status deposited a larger amount of mass in zone 1 than any other zone possibly as a result of the total mass flux to the bed scaling with the local concentration and settling velocity and both concentration and settling velocity decreasing in the downstream direction due to sedimentation however the presence of the vegetation did amplify the effect of preferential deposition upstream examining the spatial patterns in deposited mass also show as expected that deposition amounts within any particular vegetation configuration here the full vegetated case reduce with an increase in discharge fig 9b within the vegetated zone we found that sedimentation was always reduced relative to the case of no vegetation the largest difference between the baseline and vegetated runs was for the fully vegetated case figs 8 and 9a one reason for this might be due to more sediment being deposited upstream in the vegetated cases thereby leaving less sediment in suspension passing through the vegetated zone a second reason might be the overall increase in resistance within the vegetated zone zones of higher water surface slope correspond to zones of overall higher total stress between the fluid and boundary furthermore the increased blockage area led to contracted flow regions and increased velocity in zones of fr 1 the combination of these factors likely explains the reduction in sedimentation within the vegetated zone relative to the unvegetated experiment besides an increase in deposited sediment at the downstream end of the flume was monitored fig 8 this circumstance can be explained by increase in water depth which can be seen from fig 5 due to the backwater effect of the weir 4 4 2 isolated scale assessment understanding the deposition patterns around individual vegetation elements requires knowledge with regard to the flow porous body interaction yagci et al 2017 yagci et al 2016 conducted a series of flow experiments pass through around actual vegetation elements and a finite array of emergent cylinders for erodible bed conditions and quantified the morphometric characters of the scour deposition patterns their experiments conducted under clear water conditions showed that a well established scour hole develops around the finite array of the patch as a clear manifestation of enhanced amplification factor they observed that the entrained sediment from the scour hole deposited in the wake region at the position 2 3d distance to the downstream edge of the permeable obstruction in the present study in line with their findings no deposition was detected just around the finite array of cylinders due to the combined impact of separation contraction at the front half of the cylinder and pairs of vortices and negative pressure field emerge at the rear side of the obstacle i e briefly enhanced amplification factor around the body consequently as observed in yagci et al 2017 and yagci et al 2016 remarkable localized deposition zones were recorded within the wake region at approximately 2 3 d distance to the downstream edge of the patch however it should be noted that while the origin of the deposited sediment in yagci et al 2017 yagci et al 2016 the sediment eroded from the scour hole in this study the origin of the deposited sediment in the wake region was suspended sediment the findings by kitsikoudis et al 2016 clearly showed that the contraction effect still exists at a certain degree where flow passes around a permeable obstacle therefore no deposition was seen at both sides of the body either on the other hand the observed sediment deposited inside the patch exhibited a monotonic increase in streamwise direction due to the drop in the strength of the necklace vortices with small scales chang and constantinescu 2015 observed no well defined necklace vortex for the case of svf 0 092 which is a value very close to the one in the present study i e svf 0 097 despite this situation they reported that the necklace vortices with a smaller scale also take place around the base of the individual solid cylinders for this porosity however as can be confirmed from fig 8b in chang et al 2017 and fig 5a and b svf 0 1 in chang and constantinescu 2015 since each upstream stem acts like a turbulence generator for the next one the adverse pressure gradient around the stem located at downstream weakens and the separation around downstream cylinder decreases consequently in the streamwise direction the amplification factor drops around the isolated stems which form the patch due to this basic fact when flow passes through a finite array of cylinders the deposition around the individual stems decreases downstream fig 10 as can be further verified from the experimentally obtained scour patterns fig 9 in yagci et al 2017 less scour was monitored around the stems downstream because the amplification factor around the stems decreased in the streamwise direction this reduction in scour depth in the downstream direction in fig 9 given in yagci et al 2017 and the increase in deposited sediment in our study is the consequence of the parallel physical process i e weakening of the necklace vortices around the stems in the flow direction due to dissipation 4 5 suspended sediment capturing ability of different arrangements of instream vegetation from the theoretical consideration it can be stated that the deposited sediment in the flume is the consequence of the combined impact of the flume and vegetative resistance in order to decompose the contribution of vegetation factor in the deposition process experiments with and without vegetation were conducted in the same flume the overall differences in measured sediment concentration between unvegetated and vegetated experiments cases were regarded as the additional deposition owing to the presence of vegetation in the flume this means higher the difference the more the deposition in the flume due to vegetative resistance the values of the concentrations difference observed at the inlet and outlet of the flume obtained for the various cases of fully vegetated cross section were listed in table 2 it is worth mentioning that when the results belonging to experiments 1 2 and 3 5 are directly compared it can be stated that the flume is capable of producing reasonably close outputs under imposed identical hydraulic conditions it is evident from the values in table 2 that the additive hydraulic resistance due to vegetation brings about additional deposition along the reach however it should be remembered that as stated above the vegetated section acts as a natural weir it brings about great stagnation upstream of the vegetated section the deposition was observed overwhelmingly upstream of the vegetation rather than inside the vegetated zone for the applied test conditions if the length of the non vegetated section was longer upstream of the vegetation presumably higher deposition was monitored in the flume the obtained results should be considered within this perspective also the stagnation increases upstream of the vegetated zone fig 6 due to the increased discharge i e velocity the deposition decreases overall presumably due to enhanced turbulence velocity and water surface slope along the flume 4 6 grain size distributions of deposited sediment along the flume in fig 11 grain size distributions of deposited sediment along different flume sections due to the vegetation were presented together with the unvegetated case also in table 3 the values of geometric standard deviation d84 d16 0 5 nominal diameters d50 and uniformity belonging to deposited sediment along the flume for different experiments are given in all cases sediment was collected from the same location within the flume regardless of vegetation type furthermore to simplify the presentation we focus only on cases where the size sorting is most pronounced the trend in all cases was the same but we only graphically present the more pronounced ones in fig 11 three major results can be drawn from fig 11 first the deposit grain size within the vegetated zones was greater on average than the deposit grain size either up or downstream of the vegetated zone this outcome points to enhanced turbulence and average stress within the vegetated zone keeping finer material in suspension second the overall finest deposit lowest d50 came from the section upstream of the vegetated zone third a comparison between fig 11b and c which have identical hydraulic conditions confirms that the flume sampling methodology and measurement procedures can produce consistent outcomes under identical boundary conditions 5 discussion and synthesis in this study we utilized a simplified physical experimental model to understand the various effects of the different forms of the instream vegetation on hydraulic and fluvial characteristics along a test reach in the relevant literature the influence of vegetation on the flow domain and the sedimentary process was studied at an individual scale rather than a reach scale thus the impact of vegetation on reach scale received significantly less attention while designing the experimental setup it was particularly aimed to gain knowledge regarding the influence of instream plants on the hydraulic gradient of flow deposition characteristics secondary flows and residence duration one of the study s primary findings was that the vegetated zone acted as a natural weir along the reach consequently a significant augmentation in suspended sediment capturing capability upstream of the vegetated zone due to the backwater effect was recorded the suspended sediment retention ability of the upstream part of the vegetated section dramatically increased rather than the inside the vegetative zone in practice in addition to enhanced sediment capturing ability observed upstream of the vegetation this backwater effect has a tremendous ecological function in creating well functioning aquatic river corridors more explicitly as previously explained in the introduction section the propagules vegetative fragments drifted under the effect of high flows are deposited buried into the settled sediments downstream of the vegetated zone this process which provides vegetative regeneration from living driftwood danvind and nilsson 1997 ward et al 1999 may aid in the generation of pioneer islands that provides transition of planform of the river from multi to single thread gurnell and petts 2002 however it is recommended to investigate further the effect of sediment deposition upstream of vegetated reach on eco geomorphological consequences secondly because of the enhanced backwater effect and sediment capturing ability upstream the concentration time is expected to increase in the river increased concentration time reduces peak discharge i e decreased flood risk downstream with a lower bottom gradient also enhanced water level owing to stagnation at the upstream reinforces the connection between surface groundwater interaction due to the promotion in surface area between soil and water tabacchi et al 2000 as a consequence of this intensified connection the storage under the river bank increases the stored groundwater keeps the stream wet during dry periods increased dry flow periods keep the aquatic vegetation alive generate a better aquatic life and improve water quality fig 12 summarizes these probable reflections of instream vegetation on eco geomorphological processes in a river corridor it was seen that the quantity of the observed deposition inside the vegetated zone was quite limited despite this it is a well known fact from the literature that this deposition observed behind the vegetal elements plays an indispensable role in the patch expansion process according to nilsson and svedmark 2002 for riparian plants the development and distribution of plants are mainly governed by flow and sediment regimes and biological and chemical factors play a secondary role in this complex process the experimental findings denoted that even a sparse configuration of mid channel vegetation has a great capability of depositing the suspended sediment in the wake of their region in nature with the development of the patch expansion i e less permeability gurnell et al 2012 the instream plants generate a higher resistance against the incoming flow kitsikoudis et al 2020 thus the bottom shear stress on both sides of the plants increases heidari et al 2021 hopkinson and wynn 2009 due to contraction this process is a key mechanism in improving the capability of vegetation to recover degraded river channels bertoldi et al 2014 dhital and tang 2015 and producing deeper and narrower river cross sections practitioners should also consider that the development of the instream vegetation enhances the backwater effect which triggers further deposition upstream and a better ecosystem the findings point out that the instream riparian vegetation can be used as a strategical cost effective eco friendly tool at reach scale in developing sustainable river management strategies rigid emergent stems were utilized as representative vegetation models during the experiments although this rigid stem analogy was frequently used in the existing literature in reality instream vegetation in river corridors like willows e g salix fragilis and salix alba is extremely flexible due to their high moisture retention ability the role of bending streamlining of the plants and the complex distribution of the volume belonging to isolated vegetation in a vertical direction adds further complexity to the flow pattern observed in the wake region wilson et al 2006b moreover in this study the deposition process owing to the presence of instream vegetation was investigated under the solid flat bottom condition the impact of bed erodibility riverbed irregularities on the deposition process was ignored however it is known from the literature that the flexibility of vegetation significantly alters the hydrodynamic fathi maghadam and kouwen 1997 majd et al 2016 and sedimentary chen et al 2012a b kitsikoudis et al 2017 processes in natural rivers similarly the complex volume distribution of the plants along with the depth boothroyd et al 2017 yagci et al 2010 as well as the riverbed forms follett and nepf 2012 bring about additional complications also different deposition patterns could be obtained if graded or sediment with bimodal distribution was used in the experiments since it is not practically reasonable to tackle all hydraulic and fluvial processes in natural rivers within a single experimental study certain factors i e the role of plant flexibility vertical distribution of plant volume riverbed mobility induced bottom irregularity the spatial distribution of plants on river bed sediment characteristics were excluded in the present study therefore for future studies it is recommended to investigate the contribution of each of these factors on hydraulic and fluvial characteristics at the reach scale the high determination coefficient i e r2 0 95 between tnv tfv and discharge in fig 7 can be regarded as the manifestation of high dependency of residence time to discharge in the vegetated flume also the slope of the linear trendline is mild in fig 7 this mild trend can be interpreted as an increase in discharge bringing about a slight increase in residence time for the given experimental setup however it is worth mentioning that in the present experiments the tracer diameter to stem diameter was 2 mm 5mm since the stem diameters were only 5 mm in experiments for fully vegetated cases their wake region was small for a tracer with a diameter of 2 mm for the larger scale cases compared to the condition in this study the size of the stems and extent of the wake region would be larger hence the water particles may remain in the recirculation zone rear the stems longer in field scale than this study it is recommended to investigate further the role of scale effect on the particle transit time through the vegetated zone for future studies in this study the interaction between suspended sediment and instream plants was investigated rather than trying to scale a particular stream or vegetation type we instead sought to examine this interaction through a similarity of process to obtain this we ensured that the flow was turbulent and subcritical and that the rouse numbers were less than 0 1 for the d50 of the sediment to ensure that suspended load dominated transport conditions were present the dimensions of the stems were not defined according to any particular similarity rules since ettema et al 1998 has pointed out that strict dynamic similarity cannot be maintained at the experimental scale with both obstructions to the flow and sediment because of our lack of dynamic similarity it was not aimed to generate any empirical equations for the flow or sediment deposition with respect to the vegetation instead we focused on observing trends in hydraulics and deposition amounts and locations in the experimental domain for predictive relationships future studies should be conducted with better attention given to dynamics similarity 6 remarks on practical implications flood protection in urban areas is often accomplished by enlarging the river s cross section to fully accommodate high intensity low frequency flood waters within its banks and then lining the channel with an impermeable surface fig 13 when the cross section is sized for flood flows in this way the resulting width of the channel is often oversized for flows below that of the design flood the expanded width leads to a drop in velocity relative to reaches upstream and therefore sediment deposition within the channelized reaches fig 13a in a similar way this mimics the low flow conditions in our flume runs without vegetation in the passages of high discharges which have elevated sediment concentrations the sediment transportation capacity of flow is considerably less at the falling stage of the hydrograph compared to the same discharge seen on the rising stage graf and song 1995 kuhnle 1992 nezu et al 1997 song and graf 1996 hence during the recession stage depending on the existing secondary flow pattern in the channel which emerges as a response to the planform view and geometry of the channel sediment begins to accumulate particularly on the margins or in the middle of the channel fig 13 a c this process constitutes a basis for the recruitment and establishment of vegetation vegetative fragments propagules buried in these deposited sediments sprout grow and produce favorable flow conditions in their wake regions for the other plants as vegetation develops the channel becomes more competent at moving the sediment supplied to it due to the contraction and increased turbulence around the established vegetation in this way the bilateral interaction between the flow sediment and vegetations works to bring geomorphic balance and sediment continuity in systems that have been pushed out of equilibrium to accommodate flood waters analogs for the various vegetation arrangements used in our flume study can be seen at different places along the modified reaches of the buyuk menderes fig 13 one unintended consequence of this action could be the enhancement of flood depths and sediment deposition upstream of the altered section relative to that during the initial implementation of the channelization project due to the added resistance provided by the vegetation 7 conclusions this study was undertaken to understand the influence of instream vegetation on sedimentary and morphological processes in natural rivers to do this both the hydraulic and sediment transport characteristics of vegetated reaches and patches were examined flow visualization water surface slope and residence time for different vegetated patterns were all measured without the addition of sediment sediment was then added to the runs to observe the deposition patterns around the vegetation and to quantify the amount deposited in different reaches of the experimental channel the experimental data indicated that the vegetated section dramatically increased the water depth upstream of the vegetated zone due to stagnation and resistance consequently velocity decreased and sediment accumulation on the bed increased in this section therefore the vegetated reach acted like a natural weir increasing residence time and triggering upstream deposition the measurement also showed that the stagnation was proportional to the square of the approach velocity the increased resistance in the vegetated zone results in a localized steep water surface slope throughout the vegetated component of the reach it was seen that the steepness of the hydraulic grade line here increased with increasing discharge for this zone under identical flow conditions the amount of deposited sediment was markedly less relative to the case of no vegetation in addition significantly less sediment was deposited in the vegetated reach relative to the upstream and downstream sections in the same experiments we attribute the relatively small amount of deposited sediment to the high stress associated with the steep hydraulic grade line in the vegetated zone and the enhanced stress amplification factor around isolated permeable vegetative elements in the vegetated zone the deposition that occurred did so primarily in the wake region of the individual vegetation elements the amount of sediment deposited in the wake of individual vegetation elements decreased with distance from the leading edge of the vegetation zone we attribute this decrease in wake deposition to be the outcome of a decrease in suspended sediment concentration and the overall depth and hence an increased velocity progressing through the vegetation zone the deposited sediment behind vegetative elements is overwhelmingly located at approximately 2 3 d distance to the downstream edge of each patch inside vegetation patches composed of multiple individual stems the amount of sediment that deposited locally behind the individual stems increased in the streamwise direction this occurrence was probably due to a drop in the strength of necklace vortices inside the patch in the flow direction the deposited sediment within the vegetation zone was coarser overall than the sediment deposits both up and downstream of the vegetated zone this result can likely be explained by the enhanced hydraulic gradient and elevated turbulence and bed shear stress keeping the finer particles in suspension the size analysis also showed that the finest deposit occurred in the reach upstream of the vegetated zone corresponding with the region of lowest average flow velocity in the flume flow visualization indicated that consecutive midstream patches produce a stronger coherent vortex pattern with stronger lateral mixing progression downstream relative to the vortex pattern generated by isolated vegetation patch this enhanced instability developed around the upstream obstacle

3462,instream plants which act as biological processors have emerged as potentially advantageous eco morphologic tools to be used in river management and restoration most of the study on the geomorphic role of vegetation as it interacts with flow and sediment has focused on local patch scale dynamics in this study we present flume experiments aimed at improving our understanding of how vegetation patches link together to impact reach scale hydraulics and suspended sediment transport and disposition on the hydraulics side we investigate a the relationship between the imposed instream vegetation configuration and water surface slopes b the secondary flow patterns which arise because of the imposed vegetative obstructions and c the role of vegetative resistance on residence time within reach we also examine how different vegetation arrangements determine the patterns quantity and caliber of suspended sediment deposited in the flume a key result of vegetation within the channel is the overall non uniformity in flow conditions it imposes upstream within and downstream of the vegetated reach at steady state vegetated patches locally increase the resistance leading to a backwater condition upstream of the patch and high water surface slopes within the patch in general this leads to enhanced deposition of suspended sediment upstream of the patch and reduced deposition within the patch relative to a case with no vegetation at all keywords sediment deposition instream vegetation morphology secondary flow backwater effect river 1 introduction rivers have vital

distribution of vegetation along the river corridors the spatial distribution of vegetation along the river corridors and the consequences of this distribution on flow characteristics and sediment deposition patterns are complicated reciprocal processes the distribution of vegetation usually emerges as a passive response to flow history camporeale and ridolfi 2006 gurnell and petts 2002 nilsson and svedmark 2002 sediment regime trimble 2009 climate and topography osterkamp and hupp 2010 riparian and aquatic vegetation usually dominate the whole planform and cross section of perennial rivers characterized by relatively regular flow regime and low gradient gradziński et al 2003 nanson et al 2010 in ephemeral rivers vegetation is usually located on multiple ridged islands consecutively gurnell et al 2012 nevertheless a general rule is that the area occupied by vegetation in a river cross section decreases downstream as the channel becomes wider brierley and fryirs 2005 the interaction between streamflow fluctuations and the groundwater is one of the significant factors which controls the distribution of vegetation and spatial habitat heterogeneity along the river corridor lytle and poff 2004 poff et al 1997 schneider et al 2011 tockner et al 2000 this heterogeneity is influential for the coexistence of the species cornacchia et al 2018 which is vital in the ecology community amarasekare 2003 kemp et al 2000 in regimes where streamflow variability in the river is low the spatial pattern of vegetation along the river is mainly controlled by groundwater variability this generates spatially narrow vegetation mosaic with homogeneous patterns doulatyari et al 2014 in erratic regimes conversely wider aquatic terrestrial zones are observed doulatyari et al 2014 according to schnauder and moggridge 2009 the experience in the tagliemento river showed that floodline patches developed due to deposition of seeds fragments along the floodline when waters retreat after the flood discharge leaving a moist and bare environment which is suitable for growth if these seeds and fragments are deposited at a higher level within the river corridor it is less likely to be exposed to consecutive floods as they sprout and establish gurnell 2014 hence in a sense the distribution pattern of vegetation along the river corridor can be considered the flow history

et al 2021 graf and song 1995 understanding the reciprocal interaction between flow and vegetation can be regarded as a good starting point to understand better the role of instream vegetation in capturing suspended sediment in natural rivers at the first stage the problem can be considered at an individual plant scale when an isolated vegetation element is exposed to flow depending on the vegetation characteristics plant morphometry flexural rigidity and seasonality certain unstable and periodic coherent structures are generated around the obstruction as a consequence of this the presence of vegetative obstruction dramatically alters the turbulence distribution nezu and onitsuka 2001 velocity profiles kitsikoudis et al 2020 2016 bottom shear stress heidari et al 2021 vertical mixing along with the depth carollo et al 2002 and horizontal momentum exchange between the main channel floodplain wilson et al 2006b wilson et al 2006a and transportation of sediment yamasaki et al 2021 the superposed impact of all these aforementioned local factors inevitably alters the hydraulic resistance against the flow at the reach scale in natural rivers freeman et al 2000 however due to the local key impacts of vegetation on flow and sedimentary processes the vast majority of previous research focused on the problem at the patch scale rather than reach scale in the past therefore in the pertinent literature there is a gap of knowledge about the influence of instream vegetation on flow and fluvial sediment processes at the reach scale with this motivation we conducted flume experiments to investigate the impact of instream vegetation on sedimentary processes at the reach scale the aims of the problem were multifold therefore two types of experiments were conducted the first was experiments that focused on reach scale hydraulics associated with the vegetation without sediment and the second was a set of experiments that focused on how suspended sediment interacted with the vegetation the framework of the study the basic facts which underpin the design of the applied experimental setup and the primary research questions of this study were briefly described in the next chapter 2 study objective and research questions the primary objective of this study was to understand better the influence of multiple consecutive instream vegetation elements on channel hydraulics and sedimentation for these instream vegetation elements we considered both the interactions of isolated vegetation patches within the channel what we refer to as the individual scale analysis and uniformly distributed vegetation throughout the reach what we refer to as the reach scale analysis the specific questions that motivated the study from the hydraulics perspective were 1 how do consecutive multiple instream vegetative patches affect the secondary flow patterns in the wake regions 2 how does instream vegetation affect the water surface profile along the river reach and 3 how does the presence of the instream vegetation change the quantity location and grain size of the sediment deposited within reach to address these questions we conducted a series of experimental runs in a laboratory flume where we varied the vegetation pattern using both clear water and suspensions of clay 3 methods two different types of experiments were conducted experiments without any suspended sediment hydraulics focused and experiments with suspended sediment sediment transport and deposition focused the goals of the experiments that did not have suspended sediment were to investigate the secondary flow patterns behind instream vegetation by flow visualization techniques by laser sheet and dye injections examine the role of instream vegetation on specific energy budget by water surface slope measurements in vegetated reach observe the influence of instream vegetation on the residence time of particles for a given reach length the experiments with suspended sediment were conducted to analyze the deposition patterns around vegetation which arises depending on the imposed instream vegetation configuration in the channel by photogrammetric methods investigate the spatial distribution of character of the deposited sediment at reach scale by spatial distribution of grain size and weight measurements understand the suspended sediment capturing ability of different arrangements of instream vegetation by sediment concentration measurements at the reach scale the conditions tested for the vegetated runs are summarized in table 1 the details associated with these experiments are presented in the next section it should be noted that unless otherwise stated in the text hereafter the term vegetation denotes emergent vegetation 3 1 experimental setup and instrumentation 3 1 1 flume all the tests were conducted at baker environmental hydraulics laboratory at virginia tech the experiments were performed in a 12 m long 18 cm wide 12 cm deep tilting flow through flume designed to allow for a constant concentration at the inlet while allowing deposition to occur within the test section throughout the experiments the channel bottom slope was zero water is supplied from a constant head tank to a sediment mixing tank which then flows to the flume headbox honeycomb is used to straighten the flow entering the flume and tail water depth is controlled using a series of removable vertical bars water and sediment that exit the flume are not recirculated discharge is controlled with a valve and measured volumetrically depth and velocity in the flume without any vegetation present are set through a combination of discharge slope and the number of bars at the flume exit sediment is supplied to the mixing tank via a variable speed accu rate dry sediment feeder further information about the flume specifications can be obtained from culp et al culp et al 2021 3 1 2 model vegetation five different vegetated zone configurations were used throughout the study these configurations can be grouped into two major types a instream patchy vegetation and b a fully vegetated cross section the instream patchy vegetation configurations could further be classified as a dense mid stream vegetation b sparse mid stream vegetation c dense side vegetation in line arrangement d dense side vegetation in staggered arrangement vegetation was modeled using 5 mm diameter cylindrical wooden rods the rods were mounted on three 1 2 m long foam top boards creating an overall length of 3 6 m for the vegetated zone we use the term vegetated zone throughout regardless of whether the cross section is fully vegetated or equipped with mid stream vegetation the foam top boards rested on the flume sidewalls with the vegetation rods resting on the flume bed fig 1 placing the vegetation in this way made it easy to remove the vegetation zone after completing the experiments so that sediment deposited patterns could be photographed the individual stem diameters were each d 5 mm and the circumambient diameters of the in stream patches were set to d 7 cm the mid stream porous obstructions were designed with two different solid volume fractions fig 2 i e svf nd2 d2 where n is the number of cylinders within the array this yields solid volume fraction value of 0 189 for the dense patch and svf 0 097 for the sparse patch these values fall in a reasonable range of solids fractions of vegetated patches table 1 in yagci et al 2021 the distances between consecutive isolated patches were kept constant as 6d i e 42 cm allowing for nine successive isolated patches within the vegetated zone fig 1 during the experiments while discharge conditions were varied within the range of 1 13 l s 0 27 l s the stem reynolds numbers red i e the diameter of the patch is the characteristic length in reynolds number were changed within the range of 960 4000 to quantify the contraction effect the ratios of obstacle diameter to flume width were calculated for the solid cylinders which are volumetrically identical to examined midchannel patches based on the svf of midchannel islands i e 0 189 and 0 097 and flume width ratios of obstacle diameter to flume width were determined as 1 6 and 1 9 respectively these ratios are reasonably close to the values suggested by tafarojnoruz et al 2012 for typical scour deposition experiments 3 1 3 sediment characteristics the tests were conducted with only one type of sediment i e the kaolinite clay mineral the d16 d50 and d84 of the feed material was 3 9 6 8 and 11 5 µm respectively with a geometric standard deviation of σg 1 8 σ in ϕ units of 0 83 these size values were obtained by measuring the kaolinite in a suspension of dispersant with the horiba laser diffraction particle size analyzer as mentioned earlier this sediment while being a clay mineral and possessing a level of cohesion exists primarily as aggregates within the very fine silt size range it does not readily flocculate in the flume without the addition of biological binders the silt sized clay mineral ensured that we could model suspended sediment in the small scale flume coarse silica silt or fine sand would travel through the system as bed load the study aimed to examine how the presence of vegetation would impact material largely traveling as suspended load with the kaolinite and range of flow conditions in the experiments the rouse number for the experiments ranged from 0 013 to 0 026 for d50 10 µm and from 0 08 to 0 16 for d84 25 µm without the presence of vegetation values in this range should result in a suspended load dominated transport condition 3 2 experimental procedure and measurement methods the ultimate goal of the experiments was to examine the impact of the different vegetation configurations on the deposition of fine suspended sediment however before introducing suspended sediment to the flume time was spent to characterize the general hydraulics of the system specifically experiments were conducted to visualize the coherent motion surrounding the vegetation in its different configurations measure the overall resistance of the different configurations and measure the particle transit time through the fully vegetated reach following these measurements the second set of tests were run wherein suspended sediment was introduced at the flume inlet for two hours and the resulting deposit was measured suspended sediment concentration was also measured throughout the two hr duration of each run at the flume entrance and exit using a calibrated optical backscatter sensor obs 3 2 1 flow visualization two different flow visualization techniques i e laser sheet illumination and dye injection were used to visualize the flow patterns associated with the five different vegetation configurations visualization via dye injection was used to examine how flow paths interact between vegetation elements at the scale of multiple elements whereas the laser sheet images provide a more detailed picture of flow around individual vegetation elements or patches the advantages of these flow visualization techniques are that they are non intrusive and provide feedback about the coherent motions associated with vegetation arrangements dye tracing was conducted on all five arrangements by introducing dye of varying colors upstream of the elements while recording video and images with an overhead camera table 1 lists the discharge conditions associated with the dye injections visualization via laser sheet measurements was made in a dark room by orienting a green sheet laser parallel to the flume bed at about mid depth ambient particles present in the source water were used as light scatterers for flow tracing an overhead camera was again used to provide video and images of the flow patterns images and video were collected for four of the model vegetation configurations a midstream solid cylinder a dense isolated midstream patch a sparse isolated midstream patch and four consecutive dense midstream patches at a single discharge of 0 864 l s 3 2 2 water surface slope vegetative elements can produce considerable resistance to the incoming flow at the patch individual scale these elements change the flow structure around the obstacle and amplify the shear stress in their vicinity at the reach scale they magnify the hydraulic resistance in these experiments we measured the water surface slope as a means of measuring the change in overall hydraulic resistance due to the presence of the vegetation water surface slope was measured using micro digital gage with 0 05 mm accuracy cmt dhg 001 digital height gauge six different discharges i e 0 269 0 515 0 696 0 864 0 958 and 1 127 l s were applied for each vegetation configuration during these water surface profile measurements for this purpose depth measurements were conducted at four characteristic locations i e 193 cm upstream of the vegetated zone 1 cm upstream and downstream of the vegetated zone and 95 cm downstream of vegetated zone the vegetated cases were a fully vegetated cross section b mid stream vegetation dense case c mid stream vegetation sparse case d side vegetation staggered configuration dense case e empty flume reference 3 2 3 particle transit time through the vegetated zone the presence of the vegetation leads to an increased later exchange of moment and mass relative to a straight channel with no vegetation which can lead to a more circuitous path for particles moving through vegetated patches we quantified the difference in travel time for particles moving through the fully vegetated configuration and compared averaged transit times to the unvegetated case particles used in these experiments were buoyant made of plastic and approximately 2 mm in diameter particles were released one at a time from the same location upstream of the vegetated zone and the time that it took to make its way to the exit point of the vegetated zone was visually tracked and recorded the simple test was repeated 11 times for each of the five different discharges to obtain an average transit time tfv for fully vegetated case the transit times of the particles in nonvegetated case were also visually tracked the average of 7 measurements were obtained for each of the five different discharges were considered as the reference transit times tnv in the nonvegetated channel particles traversed the section along the narrow corridor between the vegetated zone and the side of the flume were not counted to avoid bias due to the boundary 3 2 4 the introduction of suspended sediment the core objective of this study was to examine the impact of the different vegetation configurations on sedimentation within the flume all experiments where suspended sediment was introduced were run for a duration of two hours table 1 summarizes the vegetation conditions discharge and measurements made of each of the 11 experiments experiments 1 2 and 3 5 represent different sets of runs with identical conditions the purpose of the repeat experiments was to test a measure of experimental variability as mentioned earlier the flow through flume is capable of delivering a constant concentration of suspended sediment to the inlet of the flume suspended concentration throughout the experiment was monitored both at the flume entrance and exit using calibrated campbell scientific obs 3 probes paired with a pc200w data logger separate calibration experiments were performed using the same bentonite over a large range of concentrations 3 2 5 measurement of the resulting deposits following the completion of each two hour run flow in the flume was gently turned down to zero and the bed was left to drain and dry for 24 h before images and physical deposit samples were collected images were collected using an overhead camera to capture the spatial pattern of sediment deposited in the flume at the end of each two hour experiment the camera was mounted on an overhead traverse system and moved along the length of the flume for imaging reference points and scales were included in the images to allow for a photomosaic consisting of 19 26 images to be created for each run sediment was collected from the bottom of the flume at the end of each run to quantify the mass and spatial distribution of deposited sediment and to obtain the grain size distribution of the deposit at each sampling location for this purpose the flume bed was divided into eleven different zones each 40 cm in length and equal to the flume width nine of the eleven patches were located within the vegetated zone one was located upstream of the vegetated zone and the last was located downstream of the vegetated zone each sample was first dried and then weighed the dry sample was then mixed and subsampled and the grain size distribution of the subsample was obtained using a malvern mastersizer 4 results the results from the flow visualization water surface slope and particle residence time are presented first to provide a general overview of the hydraulics associated with each vegetation configuration results with respect to the impact of the vegetation on the capture of suspended sediment are then presented 4 1 the secondary flow patterns behind instream vegetation based on flow visualization 4 1 1 laser sheet results based on the flow visualization experiments a comparative analysis of major coherent flow structures behind the different forms of mid stream vegetation was interpreted in fig 3 flow records obtained behind the characteristic obstacles using a laser sheet were given isolated permeable mid stream vegetation elements cause distinct acceleration zone at both sides of the structure fig 3b and c and bleed flow which is the flow that passes through between the isolated elements constituting a patch while these permeable two cases with different solid volume fractions generate a considerably weaker vortex behind the obstacle due to the presence of bleed flow an in stream isolated solid cylinder case generates a quite stark vortex behind the body this finding is in line with the ones pointed out by chang et al 2017 kitsikoudis et al 2016 according to chen et al 2012a zong and nepf 2012 and euler et al 2014 bleed flow is a significant factor that produces the steady wake region indeed it was seen from fig 3 that the presence of the bleed flow mitigates the lateral momentum exchange due to decreased shear layer between wake and contraction zones behind such an obstruction and causes to delay the onset of the von karman vortex street the severe vortex which emerges with a certain frequency in a solid cylinder case periodically block the flow at the acceleration zones in the contraction region i e both side of the obstacle in this way it provides an intermittent character to the acceleration zone at the sides of the solid cylinder as can be concluded from fig 3 the magnitude of the acceleration observed at both sides of the permeable obstacles is proportional to the density of the permeable obstruction when the flow patterns behind dense mid stream vegetation svf 0 189 and sparse mid stream vegetation svf 0 097 were compared it was seen that for the sparser case due to the weaker blockage against the incoming flow the velocities in the acceleration zone at the side of the vegetation is less it was also seen from the video in which fig 3 was extracted from that while in sparse case stem scale vortices are observed stem scale vortices were not distinguished in the dense case this observation is in line with the findings by takemura and tanaka 2007 who showed that with the increasing solid volume fraction of the permeable obstacle stem scale vortices were replaced with large scale von karman vortex 4 1 2 dye injection results dye injection technique was applied to visualize the flow pattern in a larger area different colors of dye red versus green were released from the left and right sides of the obstacle to observe the interaction of patch scale vortices more clearly in fig 4 instantaneous views of vortex structures around the different configurations of the vegetal elements are given for comparative analysis when the different forms of the isolated elements i e solid cylinder fig 4 a dense and sparse isolated midstream patch fig 4b and d respectively were compared it was seen that with the increasing solid volume fraction the shedding frequency increases while the length of steady wake region diminishes this finding was in agreement with the finding of chen et al 2012b according to zhou and alam 2016 in the tandem arrangement of two cylinders the downstream cylinder wake is significantly affected due to the presence of the upstream cylinder but not vice versa similarly zdravkovich 1977 reported that the upstream cylinder induced pairs vortices trigger the formation of vortex shedding for the downstream body in this study similar situations were observed for the permeable finite array of tandem cylinders located within the wake interference of each other when the isolated and tandem arrangements of the mid stream vegetation elements in fig 3 were compared it was seen that the presence of multiple elements located upstream caused the production of the distinct vortex downstream it can be hypothesized that the turbulence and vortex generated due to the presence of the obstacles at upstream enhance the instability of the pressure field around the body located downstream this enhanced instability developed upstream enhances the vortex s strength for the mid stream vegetation located downstream 4 2 resistance and water surface slope the variation of the water surface along the reach was obtained under three discharge conditions fig 5 a dramatic increase in water depth was observed upstream of the vegetated zone for all cases of vegetation configurations fig 5 and this increase became more pronounced with increasing discharge this behavior is reasonable because resistance increases with the square of the velocity it is evident from fig 5 that the water surface slope is extremely steep within the vegetated zone compared to that of upstream downstream sections this situation is even more pronounced for the fully vegetated cases for fully vegetated cases when the discharge range is between 0 0269 l s 1 127 l s the water surface slope values remain in the range of 0 0032 0 0082 fig 6 downstream of the vegetated zone the water depth increases in the downstream direction due to the effect of the weir fig 5 fig 6 shows the variation of water surface slopes under six different discharge conditions for the different configurations of vegetative obstructions steeper water surface slopes imply that the difference between the upstream and downstream water depths is greater in our runs the fully vegetated case produces a higher water surface slope 4 3 the influence of instream vegetation on the residence time of particles within a vegetated reach the role of instream vegetation on the residence time of particles moving through the fully vegetated reach was compared with the non vegetated case the variations of the ratios of tnv tfv with respect to the discharges were given in fig 7 in which tnv and tfv are the residence times in non vegetated reach and fully vegetated reach respectively while the ratio of tnv tfv approaching to 1 indicates that vegetation has no influence on the residence time of the particles this ratio approaches to 0 implies that the vegetation significantly extend the residence time viewed in this perspective fig 7 demonstrates the retention ability of instream plants on particles this retention is even more pronounced for the higher discharge values the increase in residence time came from the more circuitous path the particles took moving through the vegetated zone during the experiments it was also visually observed that the particles may remain in recirculation zone rear the stems this situation was true despite the overall increase in the depth averaged velocity through the vegetated zone due to the contraction effects created by stems 4 4 the influence of instream vegetation on bed morphology 4 4 1 reach scale assessment fig 8 shows the characteristic planform view of the deposition patterns observed within the flume under the influence of the different vegetation forms the first observation from these combined images is that the introduction of vegetation leads to sediment deposition upstream of the vegetated zone due to the increased depth i e backwater effect and therefore decreased velocities examining the amount of deposited mass in the different zones shows that the mass of sediment deposited in zone 1 the zone immediately upstream of the vegetated zone is more significant for the cases with vegetation than for the case without vegetation fig 9 a this is not to say that the unvegetated case did not experience deposition zone 1 in fact all runs regardless of vegetation status deposited a larger amount of mass in zone 1 than any other zone possibly as a result of the total mass flux to the bed scaling with the local concentration and settling velocity and both concentration and settling velocity decreasing in the downstream direction due to sedimentation however the presence of the vegetation did amplify the effect of preferential deposition upstream examining the spatial patterns in deposited mass also show as expected that deposition amounts within any particular vegetation configuration here the full vegetated case reduce with an increase in discharge fig 9b within the vegetated zone we found that sedimentation was always reduced relative to the case of no vegetation the largest difference between the baseline and vegetated runs was for the fully vegetated case figs 8 and 9a one reason for this might be due to more sediment being deposited upstream in the vegetated cases thereby leaving less sediment in suspension passing through the vegetated zone a second reason might be the overall increase in resistance within the vegetated zone zones of higher water surface slope correspond to zones of overall higher total stress between the fluid and boundary furthermore the increased blockage area led to contracted flow regions and increased velocity in zones of fr 1 the combination of these factors likely explains the reduction in sedimentation within the vegetated zone relative to the unvegetated experiment besides an increase in deposited sediment at the downstream end of the flume was monitored fig 8 this circumstance can be explained by increase in water depth which can be seen from fig 5 due to the backwater effect of the weir 4 4 2 isolated scale assessment understanding the deposition patterns around individual vegetation elements requires knowledge with regard to the flow porous body interaction yagci et al 2017 yagci et al 2016 conducted a series of flow experiments pass through around actual vegetation elements and a finite array of emergent cylinders for erodible bed conditions and quantified the morphometric characters of the scour deposition patterns their experiments conducted under clear water conditions showed that a well established scour hole develops around the finite array of the patch as a clear manifestation of enhanced amplification factor they observed that the entrained sediment from the scour hole deposited in the wake region at the position 2 3d distance to the downstream edge of the permeable obstruction in the present study in line with their findings no deposition was detected just around the finite array of cylinders due to the combined impact of separation contraction at the front half of the cylinder and pairs of vortices and negative pressure field emerge at the rear side of the obstacle i e briefly enhanced amplification factor around the body consequently as observed in yagci et al 2017 and yagci et al 2016 remarkable localized deposition zones were recorded within the wake region at approximately 2 3 d distance to the downstream edge of the patch however it should be noted that while the origin of the deposited sediment in yagci et al 2017 yagci et al 2016 the sediment eroded from the scour hole in this study the origin of the deposited sediment in the wake region was suspended sediment the findings by kitsikoudis et al 2016 clearly showed that the contraction effect still exists at a certain degree where flow passes around a permeable obstacle therefore no deposition was seen at both sides of the body either on the other hand the observed sediment deposited inside the patch exhibited a monotonic increase in streamwise direction due to the drop in the strength of the necklace vortices with small scales chang and constantinescu 2015 observed no well defined necklace vortex for the case of svf 0 092 which is a value very close to the one in the present study i e svf 0 097 despite this situation they reported that the necklace vortices with a smaller scale also take place around the base of the individual solid cylinders for this porosity however as can be confirmed from fig 8b in chang et al 2017 and fig 5a and b svf 0 1 in chang and constantinescu 2015 since each upstream stem acts like a turbulence generator for the next one the adverse pressure gradient around the stem located at downstream weakens and the separation around downstream cylinder decreases consequently in the streamwise direction the amplification factor drops around the isolated stems which form the patch due to this basic fact when flow passes through a finite array of cylinders the deposition around the individual stems decreases downstream fig 10 as can be further verified from the experimentally obtained scour patterns fig 9 in yagci et al 2017 less scour was monitored around the stems downstream because the amplification factor around the stems decreased in the streamwise direction this reduction in scour depth in the downstream direction in fig 9 given in yagci et al 2017 and the increase in deposited sediment in our study is the consequence of the parallel physical process i e weakening of the necklace vortices around the stems in the flow direction due to dissipation 4 5 suspended sediment capturing ability of different arrangements of instream vegetation from the theoretical consideration it can be stated that the deposited sediment in the flume is the consequence of the combined impact of the flume and vegetative resistance in order to decompose the contribution of vegetation factor in the deposition process experiments with and without vegetation were conducted in the same flume the overall differences in measured sediment concentration between unvegetated and vegetated experiments cases were regarded as the additional deposition owing to the presence of vegetation in the flume this means higher the difference the more the deposition in the flume due to vegetative resistance the values of the concentrations difference observed at the inlet and outlet of the flume obtained for the various cases of fully vegetated cross section were listed in table 2 it is worth mentioning that when the results belonging to experiments 1 2 and 3 5 are directly compared it can be stated that the flume is capable of producing reasonably close outputs under imposed identical hydraulic conditions it is evident from the values in table 2 that the additive hydraulic resistance due to vegetation brings about additional deposition along the reach however it should be remembered that as stated above the vegetated section acts as a natural weir it brings about great stagnation upstream of the vegetated section the deposition was observed overwhelmingly upstream of the vegetation rather than inside the vegetated zone for the applied test conditions if the length of the non vegetated section was longer upstream of the vegetation presumably higher deposition was monitored in the flume the obtained results should be considered within this perspective also the stagnation increases upstream of the vegetated zone fig 6 due to the increased discharge i e velocity the deposition decreases overall presumably due to enhanced turbulence velocity and water surface slope along the flume 4 6 grain size distributions of deposited sediment along the flume in fig 11 grain size distributions of deposited sediment along different flume sections due to the vegetation were presented together with the unvegetated case also in table 3 the values of geometric standard deviation d84 d16 0 5 nominal diameters d50 and uniformity belonging to deposited sediment along the flume for different experiments are given in all cases sediment was collected from the same location within the flume regardless of vegetation type furthermore to simplify the presentation we focus only on cases where the size sorting is most pronounced the trend in all cases was the same but we only graphically present the more pronounced ones in fig 11 three major results can be drawn from fig 11 first the deposit grain size within the vegetated zones was greater on average than the deposit grain size either up or downstream of the vegetated zone this outcome points to enhanced turbulence and average stress within the vegetated zone keeping finer material in suspension second the overall finest deposit lowest d50 came from the section upstream of the vegetated zone third a comparison between fig 11b and c which have identical hydraulic conditions confirms that the flume sampling methodology and measurement procedures can produce consistent outcomes under identical boundary conditions 5 discussion and synthesis in this study we utilized a simplified physical experimental model to understand the various effects of the different forms of the instream vegetation on hydraulic and fluvial characteristics along a test reach in the relevant literature the influence of vegetation on the flow domain and the sedimentary process was studied at an individual scale rather than a reach scale thus the impact of vegetation on reach scale received significantly less attention while designing the experimental setup it was particularly aimed to gain knowledge regarding the influence of instream plants on the hydraulic gradient of flow deposition characteristics secondary flows and residence duration one of the study s primary findings was that the vegetated zone acted as a natural weir along the reach consequently a significant augmentation in suspended sediment capturing capability upstream of the vegetated zone due to the backwater effect was recorded the suspended sediment retention ability of the upstream part of the vegetated section dramatically increased rather than the inside the vegetative zone in practice in addition to enhanced sediment capturing ability observed upstream of the vegetation this backwater effect has a tremendous ecological function in creating well functioning aquatic river corridors more explicitly as previously explained in the introduction section the propagules vegetative fragments drifted under the effect of high flows are deposited buried into the settled sediments downstream of the vegetated zone this process which provides vegetative regeneration from living driftwood danvind and nilsson 1997 ward et al 1999 may aid in the generation of pioneer islands that provides transition of planform of the river from multi to single thread gurnell and petts 2002 however it is recommended to investigate further the effect of sediment deposition upstream of vegetated reach on eco geomorphological consequences secondly because of the enhanced backwater effect and sediment capturing ability upstream the concentration time is expected to increase in the river increased concentration time reduces peak discharge i e decreased flood risk downstream with a lower bottom gradient also enhanced water level owing to stagnation at the upstream reinforces the connection between surface groundwater interaction due to the promotion in surface area between soil and water tabacchi et al 2000 as a consequence of this intensified connection the storage under the river bank increases the stored groundwater keeps the stream wet during dry periods increased dry flow periods keep the aquatic vegetation alive generate a better aquatic life and improve water quality fig 12 summarizes these probable reflections of instream vegetation on eco geomorphological processes in a river corridor it was seen that the quantity of the observed deposition inside the vegetated zone was quite limited despite this it is a well known fact from the literature that this deposition observed behind the vegetal elements plays an indispensable role in the patch expansion process according to nilsson and svedmark 2002 for riparian plants the development and distribution of plants are mainly governed by flow and sediment regimes and biological and chemical factors play a secondary role in this complex process the experimental findings denoted that even a sparse configuration of mid channel vegetation has a great capability of depositing the suspended sediment in the wake of their region in nature with the development of the patch expansion i e less permeability gurnell et al 2012 the instream plants generate a higher resistance against the incoming flow kitsikoudis et al 2020 thus the bottom shear stress on both sides of the plants increases heidari et al 2021 hopkinson and wynn 2009 due to contraction this process is a key mechanism in improving the capability of vegetation to recover degraded river channels bertoldi et al 2014 dhital and tang 2015 and producing deeper and narrower river cross sections practitioners should also consider that the development of the instream vegetation enhances the backwater effect which triggers further deposition upstream and a better ecosystem the findings point out that the instream riparian vegetation can be used as a strategical cost effective eco friendly tool at reach scale in developing sustainable river management strategies rigid emergent stems were utilized as representative vegetation models during the experiments although this rigid stem analogy was frequently used in the existing literature in reality instream vegetation in river corridors like willows e g salix fragilis and salix alba is extremely flexible due to their high moisture retention ability the role of bending streamlining of the plants and the complex distribution of the volume belonging to isolated vegetation in a vertical direction adds further complexity to the flow pattern observed in the wake region wilson et al 2006b moreover in this study the deposition process owing to the presence of instream vegetation was investigated under the solid flat bottom condition the impact of bed erodibility riverbed irregularities on the deposition process was ignored however it is known from the literature that the flexibility of vegetation significantly alters the hydrodynamic fathi maghadam and kouwen 1997 majd et al 2016 and sedimentary chen et al 2012a b kitsikoudis et al 2017 processes in natural rivers similarly the complex volume distribution of the plants along with the depth boothroyd et al 2017 yagci et al 2010 as well as the riverbed forms follett and nepf 2012 bring about additional complications also different deposition patterns could be obtained if graded or sediment with bimodal distribution was used in the experiments since it is not practically reasonable to tackle all hydraulic and fluvial processes in natural rivers within a single experimental study certain factors i e the role of plant flexibility vertical distribution of plant volume riverbed mobility induced bottom irregularity the spatial distribution of plants on river bed sediment characteristics were excluded in the present study therefore for future studies it is recommended to investigate the contribution of each of these factors on hydraulic and fluvial characteristics at the reach scale the high determination coefficient i e r2 0 95 between tnv tfv and discharge in fig 7 can be regarded as the manifestation of high dependency of residence time to discharge in the vegetated flume also the slope of the linear trendline is mild in fig 7 this mild trend can be interpreted as an increase in discharge bringing about a slight increase in residence time for the given experimental setup however it is worth mentioning that in the present experiments the tracer diameter to stem diameter was 2 mm 5mm since the stem diameters were only 5 mm in experiments for fully vegetated cases their wake region was small for a tracer with a diameter of 2 mm for the larger scale cases compared to the condition in this study the size of the stems and extent of the wake region would be larger hence the water particles may remain in the recirculation zone rear the stems longer in field scale than this study it is recommended to investigate further the role of scale effect on the particle transit time through the vegetated zone for future studies in this study the interaction between suspended sediment and instream plants was investigated rather than trying to scale a particular stream or vegetation type we instead sought to examine this interaction through a similarity of process to obtain this we ensured that the flow was turbulent and subcritical and that the rouse numbers were less than 0 1 for the d50 of the sediment to ensure that suspended load dominated transport conditions were present the dimensions of the stems were not defined according to any particular similarity rules since ettema et al 1998 has pointed out that strict dynamic similarity cannot be maintained at the experimental scale with both obstructions to the flow and sediment because of our lack of dynamic similarity it was not aimed to generate any empirical equations for the flow or sediment deposition with respect to the vegetation instead we focused on observing trends in hydraulics and deposition amounts and locations in the experimental domain for predictive relationships future studies should be conducted with better attention given to dynamics similarity 6 remarks on practical implications flood protection in urban areas is often accomplished by enlarging the river s cross section to fully accommodate high intensity low frequency flood waters within its banks and then lining the channel with an impermeable surface fig 13 when the cross section is sized for flood flows in this way the resulting width of the channel is often oversized for flows below that of the design flood the expanded width leads to a drop in velocity relative to reaches upstream and therefore sediment deposition within the channelized reaches fig 13a in a similar way this mimics the low flow conditions in our flume runs without vegetation in the passages of high discharges which have elevated sediment concentrations the sediment transportation capacity of flow is considerably less at the falling stage of the hydrograph compared to the same discharge seen on the rising stage graf and song 1995 kuhnle 1992 nezu et al 1997 song and graf 1996 hence during the recession stage depending on the existing secondary flow pattern in the channel which emerges as a response to the planform view and geometry of the channel sediment begins to accumulate particularly on the margins or in the middle of the channel fig 13 a c this process constitutes a basis for the recruitment and establishment of vegetation vegetative fragments propagules buried in these deposited sediments sprout grow and produce favorable flow conditions in their wake regions for the other plants as vegetation develops the channel becomes more competent at moving the sediment supplied to it due to the contraction and increased turbulence around the established vegetation in this way the bilateral interaction between the flow sediment and vegetations works to bring geomorphic balance and sediment continuity in systems that have been pushed out of equilibrium to accommodate flood waters analogs for the various vegetation arrangements used in our flume study can be seen at different places along the modified reaches of the buyuk menderes fig 13 one unintended consequence of this action could be the enhancement of flood depths and sediment deposition upstream of the altered section relative to that during the initial implementation of the channelization project due to the added resistance provided by the vegetation 7 conclusions this study was undertaken to understand the influence of instream vegetation on sedimentary and morphological processes in natural rivers to do this both the hydraulic and sediment transport characteristics of vegetated reaches and patches were examined flow visualization water surface slope and residence time for different vegetated patterns were all measured without the addition of sediment sediment was then added to the runs to observe the deposition patterns around the vegetation and to quantify the amount deposited in different reaches of the experimental channel the experimental data indicated that the vegetated section dramatically increased the water depth upstream of the vegetated zone due to stagnation and resistance consequently velocity decreased and sediment accumulation on the bed increased in this section therefore the vegetated reach acted like a natural weir increasing residence time and triggering upstream deposition the measurement also showed that the stagnation was proportional to the square of the approach velocity the increased resistance in the vegetated zone results in a localized steep water surface slope throughout the vegetated component of the reach it was seen that the steepness of the hydraulic grade line here increased with increasing discharge for this zone under identical flow conditions the amount of deposited sediment was markedly less relative to the case of no vegetation in addition significantly less sediment was deposited in the vegetated reach relative to the upstream and downstream sections in the same experiments we attribute the relatively small amount of deposited sediment to the high stress associated with the steep hydraulic grade line in the vegetated zone and the enhanced stress amplification factor around isolated permeable vegetative elements in the vegetated zone the deposition that occurred did so primarily in the wake region of the individual vegetation elements the amount of sediment deposited in the wake of individual vegetation elements decreased with distance from the leading edge of the vegetation zone we attribute this decrease in wake deposition to be the outcome of a decrease in suspended sediment concentration and the overall depth and hence an increased velocity progressing through the vegetation zone the deposited sediment behind vegetative elements is overwhelmingly located at approximately 2 3 d distance to the downstream edge of each patch inside vegetation patches composed of multiple individual stems the amount of sediment that deposited locally behind the individual stems increased in the streamwise direction this occurrence was probably due to a drop in the strength of necklace vortices inside the patch in the flow direction the deposited sediment within the vegetation zone was coarser overall than the sediment deposits both up and downstream of the vegetated zone this result can likely be explained by the enhanced hydraulic gradient and elevated turbulence and bed shear stress keeping the finer particles in suspension the size analysis also showed that the finest deposit occurred in the reach upstream of the vegetated zone corresponding with the region of lowest average flow velocity in the flume flow visualization indicated that consecutive midstream patches produce a stronger coherent vortex pattern with stronger lateral mixing progression downstream relative to the vortex pattern generated by isolated vegetation patch this enhanced instability developed around the upstream obstacle

3463,river networks of deltas are complex systems responsible for the transport of water sediment and nutrients between land and sea topological complexity dynamic complexity and flux vulnerability are three characteristics to describe the material transport within a deltaic river network and they reflect the channel number and connectivity flux distribution and sensitivity of flux to external disturbances respectively here graph theory was applied to estimate the three characteristics of the pearl river delta prd in 1977 and 2008 when the human induced uneven riverbed downcutting occurred on a large scale by identifying the channels through which water flows from the apex to each outlet the eight subnetworks corresponding to the eight outlets were distinguished although the topological complexity changes little during this period the dynamic complexity and vulnerability have great adjustments the dynamic complexity greatly decreases in the subnetworks that have larger riverbed downcutting comparing to their adjacent subnetworks we further reveal the positive relation between the decrease in dynamic complexity and human induced riverbed downcutting under the same topological complexity moreover the local vulnerabilities of channels with relatively high riverbed downcutting increase leading to the emergence of high vulnerability channels these findings suggest that the human induced uneven riverbed downcutting is the main reason for the adjustments of dynamic complexity and vulnerability the results obtained from this study may provide scientific guidance for the further development and utilization in the prd and other deltaic river systems worldwide subject to intensive human intervention keywords topological complexity dynamic complexity vulnerability human intervention pearl river delta 1 introduction river deltas are interactive zones that are responsible for the transport of water sediment and nutrients from the deltaic apex to the ocean through complex channel networks bianchi and allison 2009 in river delta systems the number and connection of channels contribute to a distinct topological complexity and the flux partitioning and distribution within channels give them diverse dynamic complexity topological and dynamic complexity further determine the sensitivity of flux distribution to externally imposed perturbations namely vulnerability tejedor et al 2015a these characteristics reflect the material transport of river deltas and change with the evolution of river deltas any perturbation by nature or human can provoke changes in the deltaic evolution as well as changes in the topological and dynamic complexity wright et al 1973 orton and reading 1993 edmonds et al 2010 hoitink et al 2017 liu et al 2019 with the intensification of anthropogenic activities and climate change in recent years the evolution of deltaic channel networks under the combined influence of anthropogenic and natural perturbations is drawing increasing attention syvitski 2008 blum and roberts 2009 dai and liu 2013 best 2019 several previous studies have reported on the growth and evolution of deltas by modelling such as simple radially averaged models parker et al 1998 kim et al 2009a 2009b detailed hydrodynamic models edmonds and slingerland 2007 and reduced complexity models liang et al 2015a 2015b laboratory experiments are also adopted to study the growth and evolution of deltas paola et al 2009 model and experimental studies have revealed that the interaction between tides and runoff often plays a dominant role in the morphological and dynamic evolution of river deltas river discharge at the apex of the delta controls the number of distributary channels edmonds et al 2010 while tides can attenuate the asymmetry of flow distribution within distributary channels sassi et al 2011 at the same time sediment input i e discharge and particle size also has a profound effect on the composite patterns and hydraulic properties of deltaic channels surface area and shoreline length growth and island shapes and sizes jerolmack and swenson 2007 martin et al 2009 wolinsky et al 2010 geleynse et al 2012 in addition to the models and laboratory experiments in situ measurements and remote sensing have gradually become conventional means of studying deltaic evolution storms et al 2005 chu et al 2006 wu et al 2010 petropoulos et al 2015 munasinghe et al 2021 the evolution process of river deltas under the comprehensive influence of natural conditions and other external effects can be clearly reflected by in situ measurements and remote sensing it is demonstrated that the morphological and dynamic evolution of deltaic river networks is not only controlled by natural conditions i e water tides and sediment input but also strongly influenced by human intervention goode and wohl 2007 ghosh et al 2016 wang et al 2018 for example sand excavation and land reclamation can directly change the channel morphology of the river network while dam construction affects the morphological evolution by changing the water sediment process moreover the adjustments of the morphological structure of the river network will in turn lead to the changes of its dynamic structure during the long term studies some metrics used to differentiate between deltas have been proposed edmonds et al 2011 but research on topology and dynamic structures that represent the development characteristics of the deltaic river network is still insufficient smart and moruzzi 1971 first proposed to conceptualize the channel network as a directed graph and apply graph theory for quantifying its topology they also introduced the concept of connection matrix but this concept is limited to identifying different paths from the inlet delta apex to the outlet coast on this graph theory basis tejedor et al 2015a 2015b designed a quantitative framework based on the connection and relative width of channels within the river network this framework can quantify the topological and dynamic structure of the deltaic river network by simple matrix operation moreover the good performance of this framework has been proved in deltaic river networks worldwide i g the niger delta the parana delta etc the pearl river delta prd is an alluvial delta formed by the pearl river adjacent to the south china sea which is one of the most complicated river deltas in the world with an intricate river network of 324 tributaries luo et al 2007 liu et al 2019 unlike natural deltas worldwide the prd is a highly urbanized delta containing many economically developed and densely populated cities e g guangzhou shenzhen and hong kong see fig 1 b to meet the needs of urbanization many human development activities have been carried out in the pearl river basin which strongly disturbed the natural river evolution in the prd wu et al 2018 cai et al 2018 for example deltaic channels have been subject to stepwise uneven incision due to sand excavation and reservoir construction luo et al 2007 liu et al 2019 and the outlet form of the river network has been changed by land reclamation zhang et al 2015a the evolution of the deltaic channels leads to corresponding adjustments in the hydrological characteristics arising new challenges to the deltaic river management zhang et al 2010 2015b however few studies focus on the changes in the overall topological and dynamic structures that represent the development characteristics of the deltaic river network of the prd based on spectral graph theory our paper quantifies the influence of recent intensive human interventions on the topological and dynamic complexity of the prd which provides guidance for the further development and utilization of deltaic river systems 2 study area the pearl river rises in the yunnan plateau and flows eastwards into the south china sea scs forming a 2400 km long mainstream and a basin of 450 000 km2 fig 1a the pearl

selected for study in this paper fig 1b since the 1980 s the prd began a rapid urbanization process with population explosion and real estate industry boom it is counted that the population of guangzhou city increased about 1 6 times from 4 83 million to 7 84 million with its floor space growing nearly 25 times from 2 47 million m2 a to 61 57 million m2 a during the 1978 2008 guangdong statistical bureau 2009 the resulting surge in demand for building materials led to the large scale sand excavation in the prd at least 8 7 108 m3 of sand were excavated in the prd after 1986 causing a 0 59 1 73 m and 0 34 4 43 m average downcutting depths of the riverbed in the wrd and nrd respectively luo et al 2007 in addition more than 9000 reservoirs had been built by the late 2000 s with a total storage capacity of 894 108 m3 fig 1a intercepting a great deal of the sediment load liu et al 2014 the decrease of sediment input further aggravates the riverbed downcutting in the river network of the prd under the human interventions the downcutting in the central part of the river network is greater than that in the two sides of the river network fig 1c as a result the stage discharge relationships and water sediment diversion ratios of the river network have been altered from their natural evolution zhang et al 2015b 3 datasets and methods 3 1 datasets we used the satellite images of the prd of 1984 and 2004 downloaded from the geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn for the topological analysis these satellite images were obtained by landsat tm with a spatial resolution of 28 5 m and landsat etm with a spatial resolution of 14 25 m respectively moreover we used the channel elevation data of the prd measured in 2008 to develop a one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river network the model was verified with the hydrological data of the prd river network from june 15 to june 21 2008 we also collected the annual water discharge of the gaoyao and shijiao stations fig 1b from 1960 to 2016 to determine the upstream flow boundary conditions of the model these data were derived from the hydrological yearbooks and liu et al 2019 in addition we collected the riverbed downcutting data of the prd from luo et al 2007 and liu et al 2019 and water diversion ratio at the channel junctions of the prd from ji and zhang 2019 3 2 one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river network of the prd in this paper a one dimensional hydrodynamic model is used to calculate the flux distribution within the river network of the prd the governing equations are de saint venant system of equations discretely solved by the preissmann method zhu et al 2011 specifically we use model runs from chen et al 2020a and partial validation results are shown in fig 2 the root mean square errors rmse are all less than 900 m3 s and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse are all over 0 7 these results demonstrate the good performance of the model to simulate the hydrodynamic process in the prd the topography data used in the model are the sectional measured data in 2008 and the topography data in 1977 are derived from the 2008 topography data based on the topographic downcutting fig 1c there are some small river channels without statistical topographic data whose changes are ignored in this study the upstream water discharge boundary conditions are the annual average flow of 6885 m3 s at gaoyao station and 1337 m3 s at shijiao station average from 1960 to 2016 the downstream water surface boundary conditions are fixed at sea level ignoring the influence of tides and waves based on the sensitivity analysis presented in section 5 2 3 3 graph theory here we need to transform the deltaic channel network into a directed graph consisting of vertices and edges so that we can use graph theory for subsequent calculation fig 3 in this case edges denote channels and vertices represent bifurcations that one channel splits into new channels or junctions that two or more channels merge into a single channel the adjacency matrix a of the deltaic network can be derived from the physical connection of the edges the element avu in the matrix a is 1 if there exists edge from u to v between the vertices u and v and 0 otherwise fig 3b the adjacency matrix a summarizes the information about the inflow channels edges and outflow channels of each vertex in the deltaic channel network then we can identify the subnetworks based on the adjacency matrix a the subnetwork corresponding to each outlet includes all the channels that water flows from the apex to the outlet fig 3c to obtain the in degree or out degree matrix da in or da out we sum the row or column elements of each row or column in a and replace the diagonal elements 1 of the identity matrix i with the sum of corresponding row or column we can now derive the laplacian matrix l by la in da in a and la out da out a fig 3b moreover the flux of each vertex and edge is calculated by the mathematical model according to the flux proportion of edges to the corresponding upstream vertex the weights of the edges are determined fig 4 b and then the weight matrix w is obtained in the same way we can obtain the the in degree and out degree matrixes dw in and dw out and derive the laplacian matrixes lw in and lw out fig 4c these matrices will be used for algebraic computation to get some valuable metrics we ignore the local sources e g rainfall runoff within the delta when calculating the edge weights because these values are negligible compared to upstream inflows and have little influence on the results 3 4 graph analysis of deltas in this paper we focus on the human impacts e g sand excavation on the evolution of the topological connectivity and dynamic transport characteristics of the prd a highly urbanized river delta system to quantify the impacts the topological structure of the prd river network should be identified first here two metrics proposed by tejedor et al 2015b are used to analyze the topological complexity i e the number of alternative paths and link sharing index which can respectively quantify the loopiness characteristic and structural overlap of the river network human impacts have caused the adjustments of the distribution of water and sediment discharges in the prd river network leading to changes in dynamical complexity this evolution can be well reflected by the variation of two metrics i e the leakage index and flux sharing index tejedor et al 2015 we further use the vulnerability characteristic proposed by tejedor et al 2015a to quantify the changes in the sensitivity of the prd river network to externally imposed perturbations the detailed calculation methods of relevant metrics are as follow 3 4 1 number of alternative paths nap the number of alternative paths nap can depict the loopiness characteristic of subnetworks this is a measurement of optional paths that flux travels from the apex to a specified outlet as shown in fig 3c when the flux meets a fork bifurcation in the propagation path the nap increases the higher the nap the more bifurcations and junctions in the subnetworks presenting the more loop structures to compute it we firstly transpose the adjacency matrix a to at then replace the element 1 at the position uu with zero for each outlet u in the identity matrix i to obtain the matrix i now we can calculate the eigenvector p of the matrix i at and its kth component is exactly the number of paths from vertex k to the outlet i within the subnetwork 3 4 2 link sharing index lsi the flux of the channel within a river network may eventually flow to multiple outlets so the channel is regarded as the overlapping part of the corresponding subnetworks of these outlets fig 3c the link sharing index lsi can be used to quantify this structural overlap which is calculated by 1 ls i i 1 1 n i v u s i b uv 1 where ni is the number of links in the subnetwork si and buv is the number of subnetworks that the link vu belongs to the higher the lsi the higher overlap of the subnetwork with others indicating that the links are shared by many subnetworks 3 4 3 leakage index li this metric is defined as the proportion of flux leaking to other subnetworks to the total flux of the subnetwork si in this view leakage flux is equal to the difference between the sum of vertex flux and sum of link flux within the subnetwork si and calculation of the leakage index li is given by 2 l i i v s i f v v u s i f uv v s i f v here fv represents the steady flux at vertex v fuv is the steady flux at link vu the solution of lw outf 0 is the steady flux f1 fn t at vertex 1 to n and the steady flux at the link vu can easily be computed as fuv fvwuv the higher the li the higher degree of flux leakage to other subnetworks 3 4 4 flux sharing index fsi the flux sharing index fsi is used to quantify the degree that the flux of the subnetwork si shares with other subnetworks the calculation of this metric is shown as 3 fs i i 1 1 n i γ i v where ni is the number of vertices in the subnetwork si and γi v is the proportion of the flux in vertex v that arrives at outlet i the γi v is actually the vth component of the eigenvector of the transposed matrix lw out t see tejedor et al 2015a for the details the higher the fsi the higher degree of flux sharing with other subnetworks 3 4 5 mapping vulnerability to local flux perturbations local flux perturbations of different channels will lead to the different changes in flux of the outlet although the channels in the river networks may silt up due to externally imposed perturbations e g dam construction and building sluices which leads to adjustments in the dynamic transport with the topological connectivity changes this situation rarely happens hence we assume a fixed topological structure and only focus on the flux changes caused by externally imposed perturbations to quantify how the outlet flux is disturbed by local flux perturbations of upstream channels within the subnetwork we build the vulnerability maps by following steps firstly assume that the steady flux of a specified link is f where the fraction p 0 p 1 of flux flows into a given outlet and the steady flux at the outlet is o here o f b 0 then the steady flux at the outlet can be represented as 4 o f p f b p when the α reduction of flux occurs in a specified link the new flux onew at the outlet is given by 5 o new f b α p now the corresponding outlet flux reduction is obtained by 6 r 1 o new o α p b finally we can use the local vulnerability vi uv pi uv bi uv to quantify the flux reduction at outlet i caused by local flux perturbation in a specified link of subnetwork si in this paper the local vulnerability indices are divided into four levels very high vi uv 0 75 high 0 5 vi uv 0 75 low 0 25 vi uv 0 5 and very low vi uv 0 25 4 results 4 1 topological complexity of the river network of the prd a detailed examination of the satellite images of the prd in 1984 and 2004 shows that the topological structure of the river network changed little before and after the large scale sand excavation fig 5 a and 5b in both the 1984 and 2004 satellite images 98 vertices 142 links and 8 outlets are identified by visual analysis the average number of paths from the apex of the river network to each outlet n ap is 34 fig 5c shows the number of outlets receiving fluxes from a given link which reflects the relative importance of a link in the prd deltaic network when imposing an external perturbation on the hot spot red links the perturbation will affect most outlets in other words the red links can be interpreted as highways of perturbation tejedor et al 2015a moreover this property is independent of the flux in the link even if the flux in the red link is low its perturbation will affect many outlets while the flux in the gray link however high will affect only a single outlet as shown in fig 6 the contributing subnetworks corresponding to each outlet of the prd were identified the number of links contained in each contributing subnetwork varies greatly for example the subnetwork s5 with the fewest links contains 14 links while the subnetwork s8 with the most links contains 62 links we further analyze the topological complexity of the subnetworks using the two metrics proposed by tejedor et al 2015b i e the number of alternative paths nap and the link sharing index lsi the metrics vary greatly among the subnetworks indicating that the loopiness and structural overlapping characteristics of subnetworks are different s7 and s8 with relatively higher nap which have a lot of loop structures can be regarded as loop dominant subnetworks while s2 and s5 have fewer loop structures with low nap which can be regarded as bifurcation dominated subnetworks in addition s2 and s3 have markedly high lsi implying the existence of the core links that are overlapping part of several subnetworks tejedor et al 2015b however the lsi of s1 and s8 is lower than that of other subnetworks since s1 and s8 are located on either side of the deltaic network with fewer opportunities to link to other subnetworks now we can examine the riverbed downcutting from the perspective of the subnetworks the data show that the riverbed downcutting caused by sand excavation in the central subnetworks of the prd i e s6 and s7 is greater than in the subnetworks on two sides table 1 and fig 1c among the western four subnetworks the s4 had the relatively severe riverbed downcutting while the riverbed downcutting of the s6 and s7 is greater than others in the eastern four subnetworks 4 2 dynamic complexity of the river network of the prd the analysis of the topological structure of the prd shows the differences of topological complexity between the subnetworks under large scale human interventions these differences of the subnetworks with uneven riverbed downcutting can lead to more profound consequences on the dynamic characteristic fig 7 shows the change of dynamic structure flow distribution in the prd river network between 1977 and 2008 more flux flows to outlets 4 and 6 and the flux obtained by their upstream channels also increases becoming more dominant than the adjacent channels two metrics proposed by tejedor et al 2015b were used to quantify the flux leakage and overlapping of subnetworks i e the leakage index li and flux sharing index fsi as shown in fig 8 a the two subnetworks s4 and s6 with great decrease of the li are easily distinguished which are precisely the two subnetworks with the most severe riverbed downcutting in the west and east respectively however the li of s1 and s8 showed a great increase indicating that the s1 and s8 leaked more flux into other subnetworks in 2008 than in 1977 fig 8b shows the changes in the fsi of the subnetworks in the prd from 1977 to 2008 among all subnetworks the s1 s5 and s8 show an increasing trend especially s1 and s8 correspondingly the s2 s4 s6 and s7 show a decreasing trend with the greatest decrease in s4 suggesting that these subnetworks share less flux with other subnetworks and are more independent in 2008 compared with 1977 the regression analysis is used to further quantify the relationship between dynamic complexity variation topological complexity and riverbed downcutting to remove scale effects the li and fsi use the change rate change magnitude initial value and the nap lsi and downcutting depth d use relative values individual average noticed that the positive downcutting depth means the decrease in riverbed elevation and the larger the value is the greater downcutting degree is as shown in fig 8c and 8d there are good correlations between the dynamic complexity variation the relative topological complexity and downcutting depth under the fixed topological structure the increase of d will make the li and fsi decrease for the same d the higher nap and lower lsi will reduce the li and fsi variation of subnetworks this is because the flux in the river network will concentrate from the channel with relatively low downcutting depth to the channel with relatively high downcutting depth after sand excavation during the 1977 2008 the riverbed of s4 s6 and s7 suffer a higher downcutting resulting in the flux concentration although s8 also has a high downcutting it is still lower than its adjacent subnetworks s6 and s7 so its flux also flows to s6 and s7 in general the channels in the middle of the river network become more dominant after downcutting and their subnetworks become more independent from other subnetworks this can illustrate why the li and fsi of s1 and s8 on both sides of the river network increases while that of s4 s6 and s7 in the middle of the river network decreases 4 3 vulnerability maps of the prd the local vulnerability distribution of subnetworks is related to both topological and dynamic structures as mentioned above although the topological structures of subnetworks did not change the dynamic structures of subnetworks had significant adjustments due to human interventions during the study period these adjustments would cause the vulnerabilities of subnetworks to change accordingly to explore the response of the vulnerabilities of subnetworks to human interventions the local vulnerability maps of each subnetwork in 1977 and 2008 were mapped for analysis fig 9 the f tests were performed for the local vulnerability of each subnetwork between 1977 and 2008 table 2 the results show that local vulnerability changes of s7 and s8 are significant p value 0 05 and a high vulnerability channel that was obviously more vulnerable than the surrounding channel appeared in both subnetworks fig 9 compared with fig 1c it can be found that the high vulnerability pathway is exactly the channels subject to intense sand excavation in the north river network with a downcutting depth of 0 82 4 22 m sand excavation causes uneven deepening of channels in the subnetworks making certain pathways become more dominant which leads to more concentration of flux into these pathways while also increasing their vulnerabilities 5 discussions 5 1 human impacts on the evolution trend of the prd in natural delta systems changes in river evolution are often closely associated with human intervention goode and wohl 2007 ghosh et al 2016 chen et al 2020b the above results show that significant changes of dynamic characteristics tend to occur in the subnetworks with abnormal riverbed downcutting in this section we link the riverbed downcutting to human intervention analyze its impacts on the topological dynamic complexity of the prd and discuss the significance to the utilization of the river delta 5 1 1 riverbed downcutting caused by human intervention the human activities that can strongly affect riverbed mainly include sand excavation waterway dredging and upstream reservoir construction etc before the 1980s the relatively slight human activities had little influence on the riverbed and the riverbed characteristics i e area water depth and thalweg elevation remained relatively stable under the natural driving force fig 10 however human intervention has intensified greatly after the 1980s gradually becoming the dominant factor of river evolution in the prd liu et al 2019 chen et al 2020b at the same time the sectional area and water depth of the makou and sanshui stations began to increase and the thalweg elevation along the channel also decreased significantly indicating that strong human activities after the 1980s resulted in a downcutting trend of the riverbed hence we use riverbed downcutting as the primary proxy for human intervention moreover fig 10b and 10c show that the greatest changes of riverbed characteristics occurred in the period of intense sand excavation and the downcutting trend of riverbed gradually slowed down with the ban on sand excavation these results suggest that sand excavation is mainly responsible for the severe riverbed downcutting in the prd which is also the reason for taking the sand excavation period 1977 2008 as the focus period in this paper 5 1 2 the impacts of riverbed downcutting on topological dynamic complexity the adjustment of water diversion ratios wdr defined as the ratio of the water discharge of a bifurcating channel to the water discharge at the upstream junction caused by the riverbed downcutting will lead to the change in topology dynamic complexity to analyze the impact of riverbed downcutting on wdr considering the simplest double branched channel the relationship between water discharge in each channel is given as 7 q q 1 q 2 8 η 1 q 1 q 1 q 2 where subscripts 1 and 2 represent the channel 1 and 2 η represents wdr according to the manning s formula 9 q a r 2 3 j 1 2 n 1 where a is sectional area equal to channel width b times water depth h r is hydraulic radius equal to h when b h j is water surface slope and n is roughness substitute equation 10 into 9 to obtain 10 η 1 1 1 n 1 n 2 b 2 b 1 h 2 h 1 5 3 j 2 j 1 1 2 1 1 m linearize the m that determines the change in η 1 11 ln m 5 3 ln h 2 h 1 ln b 2 b 1 1 2 ln j 2 j 1 ln n 2 n 1 now we can find that the change of water depth has the greatest impact on m recall that the riverbed downcutting greatly increased the water depth fig 10b which will result in a decrease in the m of the downcutting channel and eventually an increase in the wdr of the channel we use a simple river network with given flow distribution to further study the impacts of increasing wdr in one channel on dynamic complexity and local vulnerability distribution fig 11 when sand excavation occurs in a channel its water depth increases and its wdr increases correspondingly which actually increases the fuv equation 2 and the proportion of the flux in vertex v that arrives at outlet i γi v in equation 3 resulting in the decrease in the lii and fsii accordingly moreover the increase of wdr in the channel makes its local vulnerability increase with emergence of high vulnerability pathway 5 1 3 implications for the prd and other river deltas the results of this study provide a new understanding for the sustainable utilization of river deltas it is well known that riverbed downcutting in the prd caused by sand excavation and other anthropogenic interventions is beneficial to the navigation condition and flood level control liu et al 2019 chen et al 2020b the above results show that the uneven riverbed downcutting will cause a great adjustment in the redistribution of water flux according to liu et al 2019 and chen et al 2020b due to sand excavation in the prd the average depth of the thalweg along the west river channel increased from 16 m to 14 m while the that of the north river channel increased from 10 m to 6 m assuming that other conditions are the same taking 0 m as the water surface and using equation 11 for rough estimation the wdr of the north river channel is nearly 20 before sand excavation while it substantially increases to more than 30 after sand excavation this increase in the wdr will lead to the corresponding increase in the sensitivity of the channel to externally imposed perturbations resulting in the emergence of high vulnerability channels the river management department should focus on the protection of these highly vulnerable channels moreover the human development activities should be selectively carried out in the low vulnerability areas refer to the local vulnerability maps of the prd in addition to the prd many deltas worldwide are subject to intensive human intervention under the urbanization process john et al 2008 bianchi and allison 2009 for example river regulation and damming signicantly disturb the morphological evolution of the guadalfeo river delta leading to severe riverbed erosion and coastline retreat bergillos and ortega sánchez 2017 similar situations exist in other deltas such as the yangtze and simeto river deltas longhitano and colella 2007 dai and liu 2013 like the prd the human induced changes in the evolution of riverbed geomorphology in these deltas will also lead to the adjustment of flux distribution within their deltaic networks as well as the local vulnerability distribution hence the same guidances apply to these river deltas including protection of potential high vulnerability channels and mapping vulnerability distribution to guide deltaic development activities etc 5 2 the sensitivity to river discharge variations and tidal influences flow distribution at the deltaic bifurcating channels is influenced by the upstream inflow and tide in this section the sensitivity of the dynamic complexity of river network to upstream inflow variations and tidal influences is illustrated by comparing the variation of wdr at main channel junctions in flood and dry seasons with and without tide as shown in fig 12 the differences of wdr at most junctions are smaller in the flood season than in dry season and smaller in tidal action than non tidal action however in the flood season with tide the differences of wdr do not further decrease since the higher river discharge attenuates the tidal motion the research of sassi et al 2011 also shows that tides have the effect of reducing the asymmetry of flow distribution at bifurcating channels as a result of the asymmetry reduction the major channels share more of their flux with the tributaries which might increase the li and fsi in the subnetworks with more major channels e g s4 and s7 and decrease them in the subnetworks with fewer major channels e g s1 and s8 although river discharge variations and tides can influence the wdr at the channel junctions the influence is relatively small for example the wdr at makou varies between 0 79 and 0 75 under the action of river discharge variations and tides however due to the uneven downcutting of the riverbed in recent years the wdr at makou decreased from 0 85 to 0 75 fig 13 d which was significantly greater than the changes caused by river discharge variations and tides this paper mainly focuses on the changes of topo dynamic complexity caused by riverbed downcutting so the influences of river discharge variations and tides are ignored in the study 5 3 the improvements to original framework and the implications for further study this study is heavily indebted to the framework developed by tejedor et al 2015a 2015b and improves it to apply in the analysis of an urbanized delta i e prd one of the most significant improvements is to use the water discharge calculated by the mathematical model to determine the edge weights the original framework assumes that the flow into bifurcating channel is proportional to the channel width which may be suitable for many deltas under natural evolution however the relationship between flow and channel width will change abnormally under anthropogenic driving force take the makou and sanshui stations near the apex of the prd fig 1b as an example during the 1977 1998 and 1998 2008 the channel widths of makou and sanshui changed little but the wdr changed greatly fig 13 this is due to the uneven riverbed downcutting caused by human activities during the 1977 1998 the downcutting at sanshui was greater than that at makou increasing its wdr then the downcutting at makou was intensified between 1998 and 2008 which resulted in the increase of wdr at makou these human induced changes of wdr at the delta apex will inevitably lead to the dynamic complexity variation of the prd however if the assumption of the original framework is used the impacts of human activities on the dynamic complexity cannot be identified in this study an one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the prd is used to calculate the edge weights which overcomes this problem and reflects the anthropogenic impacts not limited to the water flux the mathematical model can also be used to calculate the other flux e g sediment and nutrients and thus to analyze the complexity of the transport dynamics of the corresponding flux 6 conclusions the river network of the prd was considered as a rooted directed acyclic graph to calculate several topological and dynamic metrics of interest specifically the regions with great changes were identified by analyzing the changes in the topological and dynamic metrics of the prd between 1977 and 2008 moreover comparing the regions occurring great changs with the regions subject to strong human interventions i e riverbed downcutting we reveal the impacts of human intervention on the evolution of topological dynamic complexity in the prd during this period furthermore based on the analysis of the changes in vulnerability distribution of the prd pre and post human intervention some valuable insights were obtained the main conclusions are as follows 1 the contributing subnetworks corresponding to eight outlets of the prd are identified each containing a different number of channels from 14 to 62 the survey data show that the central part of the west river network s4 and the north river network s6 s7 and s8 are the regions with the higher degree of riverbed downcutting caused by human activities 2 although the topological structure changes little the dynamic complexity of the subnetworks in the prd varies greatly from 1977 to 2008 due to the human induced riverbed downcutting the decreasing dynamic complexity represented by decreasing li and fsi is positively correlated with the relative downcutting depth under the fixed topological structure hence the subnetworks with high downcutting such as s4 s6 and s7 their li and fsi greatly decrease during this period 3 between 1977 and 2008 the human induced riverbed downcutting causes the adjustments of local vulnerability distribution the changes of local vulnerability distribution in s7 and s8 with the greatest degree of downcutting are significant leading to the emergence of several high vulnerability channels this study is a new attempt to identify the impacts of human intervention on the evolution of the prd by graph theory the results obtained from this study could lead to a better understanding of human impacts on the evolution of the prd and be beneficial for

3463,river networks of deltas are complex systems responsible for the transport of water sediment and nutrients between land and sea topological complexity dynamic complexity and flux vulnerability are three characteristics to describe the material transport within a deltaic river network and they reflect the channel number and connectivity flux distribution and sensitivity of flux to external disturbances respectively here graph theory was applied to estimate the three characteristics of the pearl river delta prd in 1977 and 2008 when the human induced uneven riverbed downcutting occurred on a large scale by identifying the channels through which water flows from the apex to each outlet the eight subnetworks corresponding to the eight outlets were distinguished although the topological complexity changes little during this period the dynamic complexity and vulnerability have great adjustments the dynamic complexity greatly decreases in the subnetworks that have larger riverbed downcutting comparing to their adjacent subnetworks we further reveal the positive relation between the decrease in dynamic complexity and human induced riverbed downcutting under the same topological complexity moreover the local vulnerabilities of channels with relatively high riverbed downcutting increase leading to the emergence of high vulnerability channels these findings suggest that the human induced uneven riverbed downcutting is the main reason for the adjustments of dynamic complexity and vulnerability the results obtained from this study may provide scientific guidance for the further development and utilization in the prd and other deltaic river systems worldwide subject to intensive human intervention keywords topological complexity dynamic complexity vulnerability human intervention pearl river delta 1 introduction river deltas are interactive zones that are responsible for the transport of water sediment and nutrients from the deltaic apex to the ocean through complex channel networks bianchi and allison 2009 in river delta systems the number and connection of channels contribute to a distinct topological complexity and the flux partitioning and distribution within channels give them diverse dynamic complexity topological and dynamic complexity further determine the sensitivity of flux distribution to externally imposed perturbations namely vulnerability tejedor et al 2015a these characteristics reflect the material transport of river deltas and change with the evolution of river deltas any perturbation by nature or human can provoke changes in the deltaic evolution as well as changes in the topological and dynamic complexity wright et al 1973 orton and reading 1993 edmonds et al 2010 hoitink et al 2017 liu et al 2019 with the intensification of anthropogenic activities and climate change in recent years the evolution of deltaic channel networks under the combined influence of anthropogenic and natural perturbations is drawing increasing attention syvitski 2008 blum and roberts 2009 dai and liu 2013 best 2019 several previous studies have reported on the growth and evolution of deltas by modelling such as simple radially averaged models parker et al 1998 kim et al 2009a 2009b detailed hydrodynamic models edmonds and slingerland 2007 and reduced complexity models liang et al 2015a 2015b laboratory experiments are also adopted to study the growth and evolution of deltas paola et al 2009 model and experimental studies have revealed that the interaction between tides and runoff often plays a dominant role in the morphological and dynamic evolution of river deltas river discharge at the apex of the delta controls the number of distributary channels edmonds et al 2010 while tides can attenuate the asymmetry of flow distribution within distributary channels sassi et al 2011 at the same time sediment input i e discharge and particle size also has a profound effect on the composite patterns and hydraulic properties of deltaic channels surface area and shoreline length growth and island shapes and sizes jerolmack and swenson 2007 martin et al 2009 wolinsky et al 2010 geleynse et al 2012 in addition to the models and laboratory experiments in situ measurements and remote sensing have gradually become conventional means of studying deltaic evolution storms et al 2005 chu et al 2006 wu et al 2010 petropoulos et al 2015 munasinghe et al 2021 the evolution process of river deltas under the comprehensive influence of natural conditions and other external effects can be clearly reflected by in situ measurements and remote sensing it is demonstrated that the morphological and dynamic evolution of deltaic river networks is not only controlled by natural conditions i e water tides and sediment input but also strongly influenced by human intervention goode and wohl 2007 ghosh et al 2016 wang et al 2018 for example sand excavation and land reclamation can directly change the channel morphology of the river network while dam construction affects the morphological evolution by changing the water sediment process moreover the adjustments of the morphological structure of the river network will in turn lead to the changes of its dynamic structure during the long term studies some metrics used to differentiate between deltas have been proposed edmonds et al 2011 but research on topology and dynamic structures that represent the development characteristics of the deltaic river network is still insufficient smart and moruzzi 1971 first proposed to conceptualize the channel network as a directed graph and apply graph theory for quantifying its topology they also introduced the concept of connection matrix but this concept is limited to identifying different paths from the inlet delta apex to the outlet coast on this graph theory basis tejedor et al 2015a 2015b designed a quantitative framework based on the connection and relative width of channels within the river network this framework can quantify the topological and dynamic structure of the deltaic river network by simple matrix operation moreover the good performance of this framework has been proved in deltaic river networks worldwide i g the niger delta the parana delta etc the pearl river delta prd is an alluvial delta formed by the pearl river adjacent to the south china sea which is one of the most complicated river deltas in the world with an intricate river network of 324 tributaries luo et al 2007 liu et al 2019 unlike natural deltas worldwide the prd is a highly urbanized delta containing many economically developed and densely populated cities e g guangzhou shenzhen and hong kong see fig 1 b to meet the needs of urbanization many human development activities have been carried out in the pearl river basin which strongly disturbed the natural river evolution in the prd wu et al 2018 cai et al 2018 for example deltaic channels have been subject to stepwise uneven incision due to sand excavation and reservoir construction luo et al 2007 liu et al 2019 and the outlet form of the river network has been changed by land reclamation zhang et al 2015a the evolution of the deltaic channels leads to corresponding adjustments in the hydrological characteristics arising new challenges to the deltaic river management zhang et al 2010 2015b however few studies focus on the changes in the overall topological and dynamic structures that represent the development characteristics of the deltaic river network of the prd based on spectral graph theory our paper quantifies the influence of recent intensive human interventions on the topological and dynamic complexity of the prd which provides guidance for the further development and utilization of deltaic river systems 2 study area the pearl river rises in the yunnan plateau and flows eastwards into the south china sea scs forming a 2400 km long mainstream and a basin of 450 000 km2 fig 1a the pearl river delta located on the southeast coast of china fig 1b consists of three main rivers and their corresponding deltaic plains i e the west river delta wrd the north river delta nrd and the east river delta erd with a total area of 9750 km2 liu et al 2014 about 2823 108 m3 a of water and 72 4 106 t a of sediment load flow through the complex river network of the prd liu et al 2014 eventually entering the scs through eight outlets i e humen jiaomen hongqimen hengmen modaomen jitimen hutiaomen and yamen the wrd and nrd considered the primary parts of the prd are responsible for more than 90 of the water sediment output into the scs zhang et al 2015b liu et al 2019 and the sediment mostly consists of gravel sand and fine sand tan et al 2016 the river network of the wrd and nrd was selected for study in this paper fig 1b since the 1980 s the prd began a rapid urbanization process with population explosion and real estate industry boom it is counted that the population of guangzhou city increased about 1 6 times from 4 83 million to 7 84 million with its floor space growing nearly 25 times from 2 47 million m2 a to 61 57 million m2 a during the 1978 2008 guangdong statistical bureau 2009 the resulting surge in demand for building materials led to the large scale sand excavation in the prd at least 8 7 108 m3 of sand were excavated in the prd after 1986 causing a 0 59 1 73 m and 0 34 4 43 m average downcutting depths of the riverbed in the wrd and nrd respectively luo et al 2007 in addition more than 9000 reservoirs had been built by the late 2000 s with a total storage capacity of 894 108 m3 fig 1a intercepting a great deal of the sediment load liu et al 2014 the decrease of sediment input further aggravates the riverbed downcutting in the river network of the prd under the human interventions the downcutting in the central part of the river network is greater than that in the two sides of the river network fig 1c as a result the stage discharge relationships and water sediment diversion ratios of the river network have been altered from their natural evolution zhang et al 2015b 3 datasets and methods 3 1 datasets we used the satellite images of the prd of 1984 and 2004 downloaded from the geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn for the topological analysis these satellite images were obtained by landsat tm with a spatial resolution of 28 5 m and landsat etm with a spatial resolution of 14 25 m respectively moreover we used the channel elevation data of the prd measured in 2008 to develop a one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river network the model was verified with the hydrological data of the prd river network from june 15 to june 21 2008 we also collected the annual water discharge of the gaoyao and shijiao stations fig 1b from 1960 to 2016 to determine the upstream flow boundary conditions of the model these data were derived from the hydrological yearbooks and liu et al 2019 in addition we collected the riverbed downcutting data of the prd from luo et al 2007 and liu et al 2019 and water diversion ratio at the channel junctions of the prd from ji and zhang 2019 3 2 one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river network of the prd in this paper a one dimensional hydrodynamic model is used to calculate the flux distribution within the river network of the prd the governing equations are de saint venant system of equations discretely solved by the preissmann method zhu et al 2011 specifically we use model runs from chen et al 2020a and partial validation results are shown in fig 2 the root mean square errors rmse are all less than 900 m3 s and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse are all over 0 7 these results demonstrate the good performance of the model to simulate the hydrodynamic process in the prd the topography data used in the model are the sectional measured data in 2008 and the topography data in 1977 are derived from the 2008 topography data based on the topographic downcutting fig 1c there are some small river channels without statistical topographic data whose changes are ignored in this study the upstream water discharge boundary conditions are the annual average flow of 6885 m3 s at gaoyao station and 1337 m3 s at shijiao station average from 1960 to 2016 the downstream water surface boundary conditions are fixed at sea level ignoring the influence of tides and waves based on the sensitivity analysis presented in section 5 2 3 3 graph theory here we need to transform the deltaic channel network into a directed graph consisting of vertices and edges so that we can use graph theory for subsequent calculation fig 3 in this case edges denote channels and vertices represent bifurcations that one channel splits into new channels or junctions that two or more channels merge into a single channel the adjacency matrix a of the deltaic network can be derived from the physical connection of the edges the element avu in the matrix a is 1 if there exists edge from u to v between the vertices u and v and 0 otherwise fig 3b the adjacency matrix a summarizes the information about the inflow channels edges and outflow channels of each vertex in the deltaic channel network then we can identify the subnetworks based on the adjacency matrix a the subnetwork corresponding to each outlet includes all the channels that water flows from the apex to the outlet fig 3c to obtain the in degree or out degree matrix da in or da out we sum the row or column elements of each row or column in a and replace the diagonal elements 1 of the identity matrix i with the sum of corresponding row or column we can now derive the laplacian matrix l by la in da in a and la out da out a fig 3b moreover the flux of each vertex and edge is calculated by the mathematical model according to the flux proportion of edges to the corresponding upstream vertex the weights of the edges are determined fig 4 b and then the weight matrix w is obtained in the same way we can obtain the the in degree and out degree matrixes dw in and dw out and derive the laplacian matrixes lw in and lw out fig 4c these matrices will be used for algebraic computation to get some valuable metrics we ignore the local sources e g rainfall runoff within the delta when calculating the edge weights because these values are negligible compared to upstream inflows and have little influence on the results 3 4 graph analysis of deltas in this paper we focus on the human impacts e g sand excavation on the evolution of the topological connectivity and dynamic transport characteristics of the prd a highly urbanized river delta system to quantify the impacts the topological structure of the prd river network should be identified first here two metrics proposed by tejedor et al 2015b are used to analyze the topological complexity i e the number of alternative paths and link sharing index which can respectively quantify the loopiness characteristic and structural overlap of the river network human impacts have caused the adjustments of the distribution of water and sediment discharges in the prd river network leading to changes in dynamical complexity this evolution can be well reflected by the variation of two metrics i e the leakage index and flux sharing index tejedor et al 2015 we further use the vulnerability characteristic proposed by tejedor et al 2015a to quantify the changes in the sensitivity of the prd river network to externally imposed perturbations the detailed calculation methods of relevant metrics are as follow 3 4 1 number of alternative paths nap the number of alternative paths nap can depict the loopiness characteristic of subnetworks this is a measurement of optional paths that flux travels from the apex to a specified outlet as shown in fig 3c when the flux meets a fork bifurcation in the propagation path the nap increases the higher the nap the more bifurcations and junctions in the subnetworks presenting the more loop structures to compute it we firstly transpose the adjacency matrix a to at then replace the element 1 at the position uu with zero for each outlet u in the identity matrix i to obtain the matrix i now we can calculate the eigenvector p of the matrix i at and its kth component is exactly the number of paths from vertex k to the outlet i within the subnetwork 3 4 2 link sharing index lsi the flux of the channel within a river network may eventually flow to multiple outlets so the channel is regarded as the overlapping part of the corresponding subnetworks of these outlets fig 3c the link sharing index lsi can be used to quantify this structural overlap which is calculated by 1 ls i i 1 1 n i v u s i b uv 1 where ni is the number of links in the subnetwork si and buv is the number of subnetworks that the link vu belongs to the higher the lsi the higher overlap of the subnetwork with others indicating that the links are shared by many subnetworks 3 4 3 leakage index li this metric is defined as the proportion of flux leaking to other subnetworks to the total flux of the subnetwork si in this view leakage flux is equal to the difference between the sum of vertex flux and sum of link flux within the subnetwork si and calculation of the leakage index li is given by 2 l i i v s i f v v u s i f uv v s i f v here fv represents the steady flux at vertex v fuv is the steady flux at link vu the solution of lw outf 0 is the steady flux f1 fn t at vertex 1 to n and the steady flux at the link vu can easily be computed as fuv fvwuv the higher the li the higher degree of flux leakage to other subnetworks 3 4 4 flux sharing index fsi the flux sharing index fsi is used to quantify the degree that the flux of the subnetwork si shares with other subnetworks the calculation of this metric is shown as 3 fs i i 1 1 n i γ i v where ni is the number of vertices in the subnetwork si and γi v is the proportion of the flux in vertex v that arrives at outlet i the γi v is actually the vth component of the eigenvector of the transposed matrix lw out t see tejedor et al 2015a for the details the higher the fsi the higher degree of flux sharing with other subnetworks 3 4 5 mapping vulnerability to local flux perturbations local flux perturbations of different channels will lead to the different changes in flux of the outlet although the channels in the river networks may silt up due to externally imposed perturbations e g dam construction and building sluices which leads to adjustments in the dynamic transport with the topological connectivity changes this situation rarely happens hence we assume a fixed topological structure and only focus on the flux changes caused by externally imposed perturbations to quantify how the outlet flux is disturbed by local flux perturbations of upstream channels within the subnetwork we build the vulnerability maps by following steps firstly assume that the steady flux of a specified link is f where the fraction p 0 p 1 of flux flows into a given outlet and the steady flux at the outlet is o here o f b 0 then the steady flux at the outlet can be represented as 4 o f p f b p when the α reduction of flux occurs in a specified link the new flux onew at the outlet is given by 5 o new f b α p now the corresponding outlet flux reduction is obtained by 6 r 1 o new o α p b finally we can use the local vulnerability vi uv pi uv bi uv to quantify the flux reduction at outlet i caused by local flux perturbation in a specified link of subnetwork si in this paper the local vulnerability indices are divided into four levels very high vi uv 0 75 high 0 5 vi uv 0 75 low 0 25 vi uv 0 5 and very low vi uv 0 25 4 results 4 1 topological complexity of the river network of the prd a detailed examination of the satellite images of the prd in 1984 and 2004 shows that the topological structure of the river network changed little before and after the large scale sand excavation fig 5 a and 5b in both the 1984 and 2004 satellite images 98 vertices 142 links and 8 outlets are identified by visual analysis the average number of paths from the apex of the river network to each outlet n ap is 34 fig 5c shows the number of outlets receiving fluxes from a given link which reflects the relative importance of a link in the prd deltaic network when imposing an external perturbation on the hot spot red links the perturbation will affect most outlets in other words the red links can be interpreted as highways of perturbation tejedor et al 2015a moreover this property is independent of the flux in the link even if the flux in the red link is low its perturbation will affect many outlets while the flux in the gray link however high will affect only a single outlet as shown in fig 6 the contributing subnetworks corresponding to each outlet of the prd were identified the number of links contained in each contributing subnetwork varies greatly for example the subnetwork s5 with the fewest links contains 14 links while the subnetwork s8 with the most links contains 62 links we further analyze the topological complexity of the subnetworks using the two metrics proposed by tejedor et al 2015b i e the number of alternative paths nap and the link sharing index lsi the metrics vary greatly among the subnetworks indicating that the loopiness and structural overlapping characteristics of subnetworks are different s7 and s8 with relatively higher nap which have a lot of loop structures can be regarded as loop dominant subnetworks while s2 and s5 have fewer loop structures with low nap which can be regarded as bifurcation dominated subnetworks in addition s2 and s3 have markedly high lsi implying the existence of the core links that are overlapping part of several subnetworks tejedor et al 2015b however the lsi of s1 and s8 is lower than that of other subnetworks since s1 and s8 are located on either side of the deltaic network with fewer opportunities to link to other subnetworks now we can examine the riverbed downcutting from the perspective of the subnetworks the data show that the riverbed downcutting caused by sand excavation in the central subnetworks of the prd i e s6 and s7 is greater than in the subnetworks on two sides table 1 and fig 1c among the western four subnetworks the s4 had the relatively severe riverbed downcutting while the riverbed downcutting of the s6 and s7 is greater than others in the eastern four subnetworks 4 2 dynamic complexity of the river network of the prd the analysis of the topological structure of the prd shows the differences of topological complexity between the subnetworks under large scale human interventions these differences of the subnetworks with uneven riverbed downcutting can lead to more profound consequences on the dynamic characteristic fig 7 shows the change of dynamic structure flow distribution in the prd river network between 1977 and 2008 more flux flows to outlets 4 and 6 and the flux obtained by their upstream channels also increases becoming more dominant than the adjacent channels two metrics proposed by tejedor et al 2015b were used to quantify the flux leakage and overlapping of subnetworks i e the leakage index li and flux sharing index fsi as shown in fig 8 a the two subnetworks s4 and s6 with great decrease of the li are easily distinguished which are precisely the two subnetworks with the most severe riverbed downcutting in the west and east respectively however the li of s1 and s8 showed a great increase indicating that the s1 and s8 leaked more flux into other subnetworks in 2008 than in 1977 fig 8b shows the changes in the fsi of the subnetworks in the prd from 1977 to 2008 among all subnetworks the s1 s5 and s8 show an increasing trend especially s1 and s8 correspondingly the s2 s4 s6 and s7 show a decreasing trend with the greatest decrease in s4 suggesting that these subnetworks share less flux with other subnetworks and are more independent in 2008 compared with 1977 the regression analysis is used to further quantify the relationship between dynamic complexity variation topological complexity and riverbed downcutting to remove scale effects the li and fsi use the change rate change magnitude initial value and the nap lsi and downcutting depth d use relative values individual average noticed that the positive downcutting depth means the decrease in riverbed elevation and the larger the value is the greater downcutting degree is as shown in fig 8c and 8d there are good correlations between the dynamic complexity variation the relative topological complexity and downcutting depth under the fixed topological structure the increase of d will make the li and fsi decrease for the same d the higher nap and lower lsi will reduce the li and fsi variation of subnetworks this is because the flux in the river network will concentrate from the channel with relatively low downcutting depth to the channel with relatively high downcutting depth after sand excavation during the 1977 2008 the riverbed of s4 s6 and s7 suffer a higher downcutting resulting in the flux concentration although s8 also has a high downcutting it is still lower than its adjacent subnetworks s6 and s7 so its flux also flows to s6 and s7 in general the channels in the middle of the river network become more dominant after downcutting and their subnetworks become more independent from other subnetworks this can illustrate why the li and fsi of s1 and s8 on both sides of the river network increases while that of s4 s6 and s7 in the middle of the river network decreases 4 3 vulnerability maps of the prd the local vulnerability distribution of subnetworks is related to both topological and dynamic structures as mentioned above although the topological structures of subnetworks did not change the dynamic structures of subnetworks had significant adjustments due to human interventions during the study period these adjustments would cause the vulnerabilities of subnetworks to change accordingly to explore the response of the vulnerabilities of subnetworks to human interventions the local vulnerability maps of each subnetwork in 1977 and 2008 were mapped for analysis fig 9 the f tests were performed for the local vulnerability of each subnetwork between 1977 and 2008 table 2 the results show that local vulnerability changes of s7 and s8 are significant p value 0 05 and a high vulnerability channel that was obviously more vulnerable than the surrounding channel appeared in both subnetworks fig 9 compared with fig 1c it can be found that the high vulnerability pathway is exactly the channels subject to intense sand excavation in the north river network with a downcutting depth of 0 82 4 22 m sand excavation causes uneven deepening of channels in the subnetworks making certain pathways become more dominant which leads to more concentration of flux into these pathways while also increasing their vulnerabilities 5 discussions 5 1 human impacts on the evolution trend of the prd in natural delta systems changes in river evolution are often closely associated with human intervention goode and wohl 2007 ghosh et al 2016 chen et al 2020b the above results show that significant changes of dynamic characteristics tend to occur in the subnetworks with abnormal riverbed downcutting in this section we link the riverbed downcutting to human intervention analyze its impacts on the topological dynamic complexity of the prd and discuss the significance to the utilization of the river delta 5 1 1 riverbed downcutting caused by human intervention the human activities that can strongly affect riverbed mainly include sand excavation waterway dredging and upstream reservoir construction etc before the 1980s the relatively slight human activities had little influence on the riverbed and the riverbed characteristics i e area water depth and thalweg elevation remained relatively stable under the natural driving force fig 10 however human intervention has intensified greatly after the 1980s gradually becoming the dominant factor of river evolution in the prd liu et al 2019 chen et al 2020b at the same time the sectional area and water depth of the makou and sanshui stations began to increase and the thalweg elevation along the channel also decreased significantly indicating that strong human activities after the 1980s resulted in a downcutting trend of the riverbed hence we use riverbed downcutting as the primary proxy for human intervention moreover fig 10b and 10c show that the greatest changes of riverbed characteristics occurred in the period of intense sand excavation and the downcutting trend of riverbed gradually slowed down with the ban on sand excavation these results suggest that sand excavation is mainly responsible for the severe riverbed downcutting in the prd which is also the reason for taking the sand excavation period 1977 2008 as the focus period in this paper 5 1 2 the impacts of riverbed downcutting on topological dynamic complexity the adjustment of water diversion ratios wdr defined as the ratio of the water discharge of a bifurcating channel to the water discharge at the upstream junction caused by the riverbed downcutting will lead to the change in topology dynamic complexity to analyze the impact of riverbed downcutting on wdr considering the simplest double branched channel the relationship between water discharge in each channel is given as 7 q q 1 q 2 8 η 1 q 1 q 1 q 2 where subscripts 1 and 2 represent the channel 1 and 2 η represents wdr according to the manning s formula 9 q a r 2 3 j 1 2 n 1 where a is sectional area equal to channel width b times water depth h r is hydraulic radius equal to h when b h j is water surface slope and n is roughness substitute equation 10 into 9 to obtain 10 η 1 1 1 n 1 n 2 b 2 b 1 h 2 h 1 5 3 j 2 j 1 1 2 1 1 m linearize the m that determines the change in η 1 11 ln m 5 3 ln h 2 h 1 ln b 2 b 1 1 2 ln j 2 j 1 ln n 2 n 1 now we can find that the change of water depth has the greatest impact on m recall that the riverbed downcutting greatly increased the water depth fig 10b which will result in a decrease in the m of the downcutting channel and eventually an increase in the wdr of the channel we use a simple river network with given flow distribution to further study the impacts of increasing wdr in one channel on dynamic complexity and local vulnerability distribution fig 11 when sand excavation occurs in a channel its water depth increases and its wdr increases correspondingly which actually increases the fuv equation 2 and the proportion of the flux in vertex v that arrives at outlet i γi v in equation 3 resulting in the decrease in the lii and fsii accordingly moreover the increase of wdr in the channel makes its local vulnerability increase with emergence of high vulnerability pathway 5 1 3 implications for the prd and other river deltas the results of this study provide a new understanding for the sustainable utilization of river deltas it is well known that riverbed downcutting in the prd caused by sand excavation and other anthropogenic interventions is beneficial to the navigation condition and flood level control liu et al 2019 chen et al 2020b the above results show that the uneven riverbed downcutting will cause a great adjustment in the redistribution of water flux according to liu et al 2019 and chen et al 2020b due to sand excavation in the prd the average depth of the thalweg along the west river channel increased from 16 m to 14 m while the that of the north river channel increased from 10 m to 6 m assuming that other conditions are the same taking 0 m as the water surface and using equation 11 for rough estimation the wdr of the north river channel is nearly 20 before sand excavation while it substantially increases to more than 30 after sand excavation this increase in the wdr will lead to the corresponding increase in the sensitivity of the channel to externally imposed perturbations resulting in the emergence of high vulnerability channels the river management department should focus on the protection of these highly vulnerable channels moreover the human development activities should be selectively carried out in the low vulnerability areas refer to the local vulnerability maps of the prd in addition to the prd many deltas worldwide are subject to intensive human intervention under the urbanization process john et al 2008 bianchi and allison 2009 for example river regulation and damming signicantly disturb the morphological evolution of the guadalfeo river delta leading to severe riverbed erosion and coastline retreat bergillos and ortega sánchez 2017 similar situations exist in other deltas such as the yangtze and simeto river deltas longhitano and colella 2007 dai and liu 2013 like the prd the human induced changes in the evolution of riverbed geomorphology in these deltas will also lead to the adjustment of flux distribution within their deltaic networks as well as the local vulnerability distribution hence the same guidances apply to these river deltas including protection of potential high vulnerability channels and mapping vulnerability distribution to guide deltaic development activities etc 5 2 the sensitivity to river discharge variations and tidal influences flow distribution at the deltaic bifurcating channels is influenced by the upstream inflow and tide in this section the sensitivity of the dynamic complexity of river network to upstream inflow variations and tidal influences is illustrated by comparing the variation of wdr at main channel junctions in flood and dry seasons with and without tide as shown in fig 12 the differences of wdr at most junctions are smaller in the flood season than in dry season and smaller in tidal action than non tidal action however in the flood season with tide the differences of wdr do not further decrease since the higher river discharge attenuates the tidal motion the research of sassi et al 2011 also shows that tides have the effect of reducing the asymmetry of flow distribution at bifurcating channels as a result of the asymmetry reduction the major channels share more of their flux with the tributaries which might increase the li and fsi in the subnetworks with more major channels e g s4 and s7 and decrease them in the subnetworks with fewer major channels e g s1 and s8 although river discharge variations and tides can influence the wdr at the channel junctions the influence is relatively small for example the wdr at makou varies between 0 79 and 0 75 under the action of river discharge variations and tides however due to the uneven downcutting of the riverbed in recent years the wdr at makou decreased from 0 85 to 0 75 fig 13 d which was significantly greater than the changes caused by river discharge variations and tides this paper mainly focuses on the changes of topo dynamic complexity caused by riverbed downcutting so the influences of river discharge variations and tides are ignored in the study 5 3 the improvements to original framework and the implications for further study this study is heavily indebted to the framework developed by tejedor et al 2015a 2015b and improves it to apply in the analysis of an urbanized delta i e prd one of the most significant improvements is to use the water discharge calculated by the mathematical model to determine the edge weights the original framework assumes that the flow into bifurcating channel is proportional to the channel width which may be suitable for many deltas under natural evolution however the relationship between flow and channel width will change abnormally under anthropogenic driving force take the makou and sanshui stations near the apex of the prd fig 1b as an example during the 1977 1998 and 1998 2008 the channel widths of makou and sanshui changed little but the wdr changed greatly fig 13 this is due to the uneven riverbed downcutting caused by human activities during the 1977 1998 the downcutting at sanshui was greater than that at makou increasing its wdr then the downcutting at makou was intensified between 1998 and 2008 which resulted in the increase of wdr at makou these human induced changes of wdr at the delta apex will inevitably lead to the dynamic complexity variation of the prd however if the assumption of the original framework is used the impacts of human activities on the dynamic complexity cannot be identified in this study an one dimensional hydrodynamic model of the prd is used to calculate the edge weights which overcomes this problem and reflects the anthropogenic impacts not limited to the water flux the mathematical model can also be used to calculate the other flux e g sediment and nutrients and thus to analyze the complexity of the transport dynamics of the corresponding flux 6 conclusions the river network of the prd was considered as a rooted directed acyclic graph to calculate several topological and dynamic metrics of interest specifically the regions with great changes were identified by analyzing the changes in the topological and dynamic metrics of the prd between 1977 and 2008 moreover comparing the regions occurring great changs with the regions subject to strong human interventions i e riverbed downcutting we reveal the impacts of human intervention on the evolution of topological dynamic complexity in the prd during this period furthermore based on the analysis of the changes in vulnerability distribution of the prd pre and post human intervention some valuable insights were obtained the main conclusions are as follows 1 the contributing subnetworks corresponding to eight outlets of the prd are identified each containing a different number of channels from 14 to 62 the survey data show that the central part of the west river network s4 and the north river network s6 s7 and s8 are the regions with the higher degree of riverbed downcutting caused by human activities 2 although the topological structure changes little the dynamic complexity of the subnetworks in the prd varies greatly from 1977 to 2008 due to the human induced riverbed downcutting the decreasing dynamic complexity represented by decreasing li and fsi is positively correlated with the relative downcutting depth under the fixed topological structure hence the subnetworks with high downcutting such as s4 s6 and s7 their li and fsi greatly decrease during this period 3 between 1977 and 2008 the human induced riverbed downcutting causes the adjustments of local vulnerability distribution the changes of local vulnerability distribution in s7 and s8 with the greatest degree of downcutting are significant leading to the emergence of several high vulnerability channels this study is a new attempt to identify the impacts of human intervention on the evolution of the prd by graph theory the results obtained from this study could lead to a better understanding of human impacts on the evolution of the prd and be beneficial for

3464,water rock interaction wri and prior calcite precipitation pcp are often employed to interpret the variation in the trace elements present in speleothems and are assumed to be strengthened under drier climates however this interpretation is sometimes not consistent with speleothem records in monsoonal china zhou et al 2011 ban et al 2018 in this study a three year monitoring program was carried out from 2012 to 2014 at kaiyuan cave on shandong peninsula coastal north china to investigate how the element geochemistry of drip water responds to changes in hydroclimate it was found that trace elements and their ratios to ca x ca ratio responded differently to hydroclimatic change at kaiyuan cave during the period from 2012 to 2014 sr and ba which are controlled by incongruent dissolution of the host rock and are sensitive to residence time show a long term increasing trend from 2012 to 2014 while mg and u illustrate a long term decreasing trend possibly due to reduced dissolution of the host rock and less input from the soil layer all the x ca ratios are affected by wri but the soil layer may have played a role to some extent on the sr ca ba ca and u ca ratios these findings indicate that trace elements and x ca ratios of karstic drip water and speleothems do not respond in the same direction to hydroclimate change as is often suggested in previous

2005 fairchild and baker 2012 although some studies have suggested that atmospheric deposition contributes to the trace elements in speleothems zhou et al 2008 2012 fairchild and treble 2009 it is generally thought that the main sources of the trace elements in stalagmites are the overlying soil layer and carbonate host rock huang et al 2001 kuang et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 2009 2012 fairchild and treble 2009 the hydroclimate at the surface generally influences the trace elements in drip water and stalagmites by regulating the wri and pcp it is commonly accepted that a relatively dry climate will cause a relative strengthening in both the pcp and wri because of prolonged residence time of percolating water in the host rock and more co2 degassing both mechanisms will increase the ratio of trace element relative to ca in the cave drip water and stalagmites hereafter denoted as x ca thus the x ca ratio in stalagmites is often used as an indicator for surface hydroclimate change verheyden et al 2000 mcdonald et al 2004 johnson et al 2006 cruz jr et al 2007 wassenburg et al 2013 owen et al 2016 however although stalagmite trace elements have been found to play an increasing role in the paleoclimatic reconstructions in monsoonal china ku and li 1998 li et al 2005 johnson et al 2006 tan et al 2014 li et al 2015 cheng et al 2016 owen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 the commonly accepted mechanisms were sometimes not consistent with speleothem records and modern observations zhou et al 2011 ren et al 2014 ban et al 2018 for example zhou et al 2011 found that the long term trends of sr ca and mg ca ratios were opposite to each other in a speleothem from central china covering the period from mis marine isotope stage 5d to 5c contrary to the commonly accepted mechanisms that dry climates lead to higher x ca ratios higher mg ca ratios occurred in relatively warm humid mis 5c zhou et al 2011 mg ca was suggested to be dominated by temperature while sr ca by input from dust derived soil layer and pcp zhou et al 2011 this suggests that there are factors other than the commonly accepted mechanisms affecting trace elements in drip water and speleothems response of trace elements in cave drip water and speleothems to changes in the hydroclimate at the surface warrants further investigation especially in cave monitoring in order to investigate the controlling mechanisms of trace element variation in karst cave drip water a three year monitoring campaign was conducted in kaiyuan cave in the southwestern part of shandong peninsula during 2012 2014 in particular now that the soil layer was suggested to be one of the main sources of the trace elements in speleothems and drip water in many previous publications huang et al 2001 kuang et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 2009 2012 fairchild and treble 2009 whether its contribution has significantly affected the trace elements in drip water need to be evaluated before the speleothem trace elements are used as proxies for paleo climate and paleo environment 2 geographical background kaiyuan cave 36 24 32 n 118 02 05 e is located in the southwestern mountainous area of shandong peninsula fig 1 a where it was formed at the northern foot of mount lu 1108 m a s l with the entrance at an elevation of 342 m a s l the geological and geographic background of the cave can be found in wang et al 2016 the cave develops in the early ordovician carbonate rock which has a maximum thickness of greater than 800 m and consists of a series of formations of limestone dolomitic limestone and dolomite bureau of geology and mineral resources of shandong province 1991 fig 1c supported by the mineralogy of the host rock fig s1 in the on line introduction of the cave a chinese web site there are two different statements about the host rock the dolomite of the ordovician zhifangzhuang formation and limestone of the ordovician majiagou formation which may be related to the heterogenicity of the host rock the capping rock is 110 m thick and is overlain with a soil layer according to the soil and fertilizer work station of shandong province 1994 the soil is derived from a mixture of wind blown dust and weathered carbonate rock and is generally 40 80 cm thick however up to 100 cm thick in some places fieldwork indicates that aeolian sediments are the main source of the soil which is rich in plant roots and residues and has poorly developed horizons fig s2 the vegetation is dominated by secondary shrubs and grasses and a few artificially planted trees the cave is approximately 1300 m long in a general north south direction fig 1b it is a corridor hall cave with a height of up to 30 m in the widest areas and the narrow areas are wide enough for one person to pass the cave is divided into six halls based on our monitoring from 2012 to 2014 the average of the annual mean temperature in the cave is 15 7 c and the average of the relative humidity in the cave is 91 cheng et al 2017 the cave region currently experiences a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate with more precipitation in summer under the influence of the east asian summer monsoon and a cold dry climate during the winter according to observational data from the nearby yiyuan meteorological station 305 m a s l and approximately 27 km southeast of kaiyuan cave fig 1a from 1958 to 2018 the multi year average of the annual precipitation in the area 715 mm mainly falls in july and august 70 80 of the annual precipitation with distinct wet june to september and dry october to next may seasons the multi year averages of the annual mean temperature 12 4 c for the period 1958 2018 and 13 2 c during the three years 2012 2014 fig s3 are lower than the multi year average of the annual mean temperature in the cave during 2012 2014 the temperature difference between contemporaneous cave air and surface air may be mainly caused by the tourist activities in kaiyuan cave there are nearly one hundred of thousands of tourists visiting the cave every year the tourists are an important heat source for the cave another important heat source related to tourist activities is the lighting system of the cave which is switched on during daytime 3 monitoring and analytical methods the monitoring campaign consists of measuring in site temperature relative humidity and co2 concentration of cave air the ph value of drip water and drip rate as well as collecting drip water samples twice a month this was conducted at the middle and end of each month from 12 31 2011 to 3 16 2013 and then adjusted to once a month at the middle of the month until the end of 2014 due to financial reasons three monitoring sites ky3 ky4 and ky5 were set up inside the cave fig 1b the ky3 drip site is located below a stalactite with a falling height of about 6 4 m at ky4 the drip water falls from a stalactite approximately 7 6 m above the floor at ky5 there are nearly ten soda straws on the ceiling which are about 4 5 m above the floor the floor was paved with cement for tourist convenience but no carbonate precipitation is observable on it fig s4 the drip water was collected from one soda straw which has a relatively fast drip rate the ph value of the drip water was measured in situ at each monitoring site about 200 ml of drip water was transferred into a 500 ml wide mouth polypropylene bottle for ph determination the bottle was pre cleaned with double distilled hno3 after calibration with buffer solutions ph4 01 6 86 9 18 nist standard the ph value was measured using a bante 220 portable ph meter with a precision of 0 01 which was produced by shanghai bante instrument co ltd drip water for trace element analysis was collected with pre cleaned 30 ml polypropylene bottles these water samples were acidified with double distilled hno3 to ph 2 and stored in the refrigerator at low temperatures 4 c until analysis after they were transferred to laboratory trace element analysis was conducted at the geochemistry lab in southwest university in chongqing china mg and ca were analyzed by icp oes optima 2100dv perkinelmer with a detection limit of 1 10 9 and an analytical precision rsd better than 1 sr ba and u were analyzed by icp ms finnigan element xr type with a detection limit of n 10 12 and a rsd of 5 a synthetic multi element standard high purity standards cb4618773 was used for external calibration the host rock and the overlying soil layer of the cave were also sampled four soil samples were obtained from a soil profile approximately 40 cm in thickness fig s2 with each representing a 10 cm interval three host rock samples were collected at the surface using a hammer the soil samples were gently crushed and ground to disaggregate assemblages after gravels and visible plant residues were picked out the samples were then dried in an oven overnight at a temperature of 60 c about 2 g of the dried soil powder was placed into a pre cleaned 15 ml centrifuge tube and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was added to remove the organic matter the soil samples were leached at room temperature with 10 ml milli q water and the leachates were analyzed for trace elements to analyze the carbonate rocks y ky1 y ky2 and y ky3 approximately 2 mg of powder was drilled from fresh sections and placed in pre cleaned 15 ml centrifuge tubes the powder was dissolved in double distilled hno3 until no insoluble matter could be observed by the naked eye and diluted with milli q water with a dilution factor of 6000 the trace elements of the soil leachates and host rock samples were analyzed at beijing createch testing technology co ltd with icp ms finnigan element xr the detection limits and analytical precision of the instruments were similar to those at the geochemical laboratory in southwest university the standard used for external calibration is the same as used at the geochemical laboratory in southwest university in order to check whether the soil layer at kaiyuan cave is an important source of trace elements in the drip water the three host rock samples the upper three soil samples 0 30 cm and four drip water samples depending on the water amount left after trace element determination were analyzed for radiogenic sr isotope 87sr 86sr the lowest soil sample was not analyzed due to its likely contamination by the underlying host rock 87sr 86sr determination was conducted at guizhou tongwei analytical technology co ltd in guiyang china using a mc icp ms nu plasma 3 after sr was separated following standard cation exchange column procedures standard srm 987 was used for calibration and long term repeated measurement of the standard on this machine yields a mean 87sr 86sr value of 0 710249 0 000010 2σ generally surface atmospheric precipitation is only partially recharged in karst caves hartmann et al 2015 based on the karst landscape of kaiyuan cave semi humid hills and observed data from the nearby yiyuan meteorological station the recharge model from hartmann et al 2015 was adopted to calculate the amount of surface atmospheric precipitation that is recharged into the karst percolating water 4 results the drip rate at the three monitoring sites in kaiyuan cave changed remarkably with higher rates occurring during rainy seasons and lower rates during dry seasons at ky3 the drip rate ranged from 8 to 190 drops min the drip rate at ky4 ranged from 0 06 drops min in dry season to 111 drops min in rainy season and the dripping ceased at the end of the monitoring period the drip rate at ky5 was as low as 0 125 drops min in dry season and reached 109 drops min in rainy season fig 3f 4 1 ph the ph values of the drip water at ky3 ky4 and ky5 ranged from 7 97 to 8 66 7 55 8 38 and 7 66 8 64 with mean values of 8 40 8 05 and 8 24 respectively the ph of the drip water in kaiyuan cave showed some seasonal variations and was generally lower in the rainy seasons and higher in the dry seasons of 2012 and 2013 fig 2 b in 2014 the ph remained at higher values in the dry season but showed significantly higher values in the rainy season than in the preceding rainy season s in particular the ph remained at higher values all year around at ky3 in 2014 despite that it showed notable seasonal cycle at ky4 and ky5 fig 2b in addition the ph value showed overall increasing trends from 2012 to 2014 despite that the increase is relatively less significant for the short record at ky4 2013 2014 p 0 092 fig 2b 4 2 recharge the annual precipitation in 2012 767 mm and 2013 707 mm was around the same as the multi year average of annual precipitation 715 mm while the annual precipitation in 2014 451 mm was significantly reduced table 1 the recharge of atmospheric precipitation into kaiyuan cave calculated by the model from hartmann et al 2015 was 241 mm 238 mm and 31 mm for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively this result indicates that the atmospheric precipitation in 2014 produced almost no recharge in kaiyuan cave table 1 which has essentially received no recharge from atmospheric precipitation since december 2013 fig 3g it should be noted that the model produced by hartmann et al 2015 includes a relatively large proportion of fracture water and pipe water and therefore the calculated recharge discharge rates are higher and the volumes are larger relative to the actual rate and volume for example the recharge discharge times calculated using this model typically do not exceed 50 days hartmann et al 2013 hartmann et al 2015 however some of the study sites in kaiyuan cave were still dripping after receiving no significant recharge in 2014 suggesting that the discharge process did not end as quickly as the model predicted some other studies also reveal that the residence time of percolating water in the host rock above karst caves are much longer than estimated by the model of hartmann et al 2015 worthington 2007 yamada et al 2008 orland et al 2014 the rate and volume of recharge discharge calculated by the model of hartmann et al 2015 are overestimated for karst caves the actual recharge of atmospheric precipitation to kaiyuan cave in 2014 may be lower than that calculated by the model nevertheless the relative variations of the recharge to kaiyuan cave from atmospheric precipitation estimated by the model of hartmann et al 2015 still have some referential significance due to that modeled recharge is sensitive to precipitation for example it increased sharply after heavy precipitation in summer seasons the maximum monthly precipitation was higher in 2013 than in 2012 so was the annual peak recharge fig 3g the precipitation decreased by nearly 40 in 2014 relative to the multi year average see table 1 and the modeled recharge became insignificant in this year fig 3g the recharge estimation indicates that 1 a significant portion 2 3 or more of the atmospheric precipitation does not infiltrate the karst caves 2 when precipitation decreased significantly in 2014 almost no atmospheric precipitation infiltrated to the karst percolating water in kaiyuan cave these results indicate that there is a threshold baker et al 2020 at which the stalagmite in kaiyuan cave records precipitation and summer monsoon intensity on seasonal time scale the highest recharge rate calculated with the model from hartmann et al 2015 as well as the sharp increase in drip rates cheng et al 2017 is not at the same time when the maximum atmospheric precipitation occurs which reflects the time lag 22 days on average that occurs in the movement of water from the atmosphere into the karst percolating water fig 3f g 4 3 the ca mg sr ba and u in the drip water and the 87sr 86sr ratio the ranges and mean values of ca mg sr ba and u in the drip water host rock sample and soil leachate are shown in table 2 in the host rock ca are remarkably higher than mg consistent with the mineralogy of the host rock fig s1 as to the elements in the drip water firstly it can be seen that the content of the different elements varies considerably at each drip site secondly the content of the same element varied greatly among the different drip sites for example the ca content was significantly higher overall at ky5 than at ky3 and ky4 while the ba content at ky3 was almost seven times higher than at the other two monitoring sites table 2 thirdly the five elements show significant long term increasing or decreasing trend except that at ky3 which cover only the latter two years and has a relatively short record only ca and sr illustrate significant decreasing trends for example the elements ca mg and u at ky4 and ky5 show a clear overall decreasing trend during the period from 2012 to 2014 fig 3c d e while sr and ba clearly increase at the two sites fig 3a b plots of the x ca molar ratio vs ca in the drip water the host rock and the soil leachate are shown in fig 4 on average the x ca ratios of the drip water were usually higher than those of the soil leachate and the host rock in general except the u ca ratio the x ca ratios of the soil leachate and host rocks are relatively focused on the plot while the x ca ratio of the drip water distributes with a wider range fig 4a b c the u ca ratios of the soil leachate are relatively scattered fig 4d the mean values of the soil leachates are higher than those of the host rock for all four elemental ratios table 3 the variation in the x ca molar ratios at each drip site is shown in fig 5 the mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios show an overall increasing trend at all three drip sites fig 5a b c as to the u ca ratio except ky3 an overall decreasing trend is displayed at ky4 and ky5 ky3 shows an overall increasing trend fig 5d however the confidence level of the increasing trend although reaching 95 was lower than that of the decreasing trend and the data at ky3 cover only 2013 and 2014 fig 5a d the increasing trend of the sr ca and ba ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 is related to the overall increasing trend of sr and ba and decreasing trend of ca in the drip water while the increasing trend of the sr ca ratio at ky3 suggests that the decrease of ca is more substantial than that of sr fig 3a b d fig 5c the increasing ba ca ratio at the site is simply due to the decrease of ca despite that ba does not show a trend fig 3a fig 5c the contents of u and mg are decreasing at ky4 and ky5 while at ky3 the two elements do not show significant decreasing or increasing trend fig 3c e like the ba ca ratio the increasing mg ca and u ca ratios at ky3 are caused by the ca decrease the overall decreasing u ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 reflect a less decrease in ca relative to u the 87sr 86sr ratio of the host rock ranges from 0 709183 to 0 711081 with an average of 0 710157 table 4 unfortunately the three soil samples were seriously polluted by the host rock during sample preparation and no 87sr 86sr ratio was obtained the 87sr 86sr ratio of the drip water which ranges from 0 712332 to 0 713548 with an average of 0 712789 is remarkably higher than those of the host rock table 4 5 discussions 5 1 5 1the factors influencing ph during the warm and rainy summers plants above the cave undergo higher respiration and produce more co2 resulting in a higher pco2 in the karst percolating water the warm and rainy climate is also beneficial to the decomposition of organic matter and the formation of more organic acids in the soil layer these cause a decrease in the ph of the karst percolating water and promote the dissolution of the carbonate host rock baldini et al 2006 frisia et al 2011 breecker et al 2012 gulley et al 2014 therefore ca increases in the warm humid summers due to more co2 and organic acids dissolved in the percolating water and resulted decrease in the ph of the percolating water fig 2b which is in accordance with a significant negative correlation between ca and the ph value of drip water at ky5 r 0 36 p 0 05 organic acids may be important factors affecting the ph value of the karst percolating water at kaiyuan cave it can be observed that the cave air co2 concentration at ky4 and ky5 is slightly lower in the summer of 2014 than in the summer of 2013 but notably higher than in the summer of 2012 cheng et al 2017 however the ph value of the drip water at the two sites is apparently higher in the summer of 2014 than in the preceding summer s fig 2a b although the influence from the visitors is currently not clear the relatively higher ph values in the summer of 2014 are probably caused by reduced input of soil organic acids due to nearly ceased recharge by precipitation table 1 5 2 mechanisms controlling the trace elements and x ca ratios 5 2 1 effects of pcp and wri as previously reported pcp and wri are two frequently mentioned factors affecting stalagmite trace elements johnson et al 2006 zhou et al 2009 cheng et al 2016 owen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 li et al 2021b it is generally accepted that pcp would increase the x ca ratios of drip water and speleothems because the distribution coefficient of trace element x is usually 1 mcdonald et al 2004 cruz jr et al 2007 griffiths et al 2016 warken et al 2018 however ca and trace element x would be removed from drip water with pcp with a preference of ca leading to decrease of their concentration in drip water and an anti correlation between trace element x and x ca ratio wri is usually assumed to be controlled by the residence time of karst percolating water in host rock with long residence time leading to enhanced wri and more trace elements released from host rock increasing both the trace element x and x ca ratio in drip water and speleothems banner et al 1996 musgrove and banner 2004 wong et al 2011 it is often inferred that drier climates tend to enhance both pcp and wri resulting in higher x ca ratios in speleothems while a wetter climate would lead to the opposite therefore the speleothem x ca ratios are often used as indicators of hydroclimate and the related summer monsoon climate and enso activities fairchild et al 2000 mcdonald et al 2004 cruz jr et al 2007 chen and li 2018 li et al 2021a as shown in fig 6 significant positive correlations exist between ln mg ca and ln sr ca and between ln sr ca and ln ba ca suggesting that the sinclair test as indicated by sinclair 2011 sinclair et al 2012 and wassenburg et al 2020 is satisfied in addition the slopes of the ln mg ca ln sr ca and ln sr ca ln ba ca correlations fig 6 are consistent with predicted and observed values considering that on average about a quarter of the host rock is dolomite fig s1 wassenburg et al 2020 fig 6 suggests significant effects of pcp and or icd incongruent calcite dissolution another phrase for wri used by sinclair et al 2012 on the x ca ratios of drip water in kaiyuan cave if the influence of the soil layer is not considered this is also consistent with changes in precipitation and recharge to kaiyuan cave from 2012 to 2014 the precipitation and recharge to kaiyuan cave decreased remarkably in 2014 although the precipitation and recharge differ by 10 between 2012 and 2013 table 1 the precipitation in 2011 amounts to 1102 mm fig s3 producing substantial excess recharge in 2011 and affecting the drip water in 2012 inter annual or even decadal variations of precipitation e g the overall precipitation decrease from 2003 to 2014 at the study site see fig s3 and resulted infiltration may have affected the recharge to kaiyuan cave a decreasing recharge could be expected at kaiyuan cave from 2012 to 2014 in accordance with the significant increasing trends of mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios of the drip water during the same period fig 5a c these effects are supported by the observation that the x ca ratios of the drip water are usually higher than those of the host rock fig 4 table 3 they are also consistent with the work of tan et al 2020 at nearby huangchao cave and the monitoring of jiguan cave in central china by li et al 2021b both of which suggested that pcp and wri were the important mechanisms affecting mg and sr in drip water and speleothems however mg and u in the drip water illustrate long term trends opposite to sr and ba fig 3a b c e at ky4 and ky5 at ky3 as mentioned above only ca and sr show overall decreasing trends fig 3a e these suggest that mg and u in the drip water are dominated by mechanisms different from sr and ba the overall increasing trends of sr and ba at ky4 and ky5 fig 3a b cannot be explained with enhanced pcp resulted from reduced recharge from 2012 to 2014 they are inferred to be mainly controlled by wri plausibly through strengthened icd of the dolomitic limestone of the host rock due to prolonged residence time and selective leaching of the host rock fairchild et al 2000 this suggests that sr and ba at ky4 and ky5 are more sensitive to residence time than to other factors such as pcp and input from soil layer which may be due to that more sr and ba are outcompeted by mg with relatively longer residence time therefore residence time affects sr ca and ba ca ratios in the same direction as pcp if pcp exists this is in accordance with the observation that higher sr ca and ba ca ratios or sr and ba usually correspond to drier climate cruz jr et al 2007 zhou et al 2009 2011 carolin et al 2019 feng et al 2020 unlike sr and ba the long term decreasing trends of mg and u at ky4 and ky5 are apparently consistent with a pcp effect seemingly supported by ca which is parallel to mg and u fig 3c d e however this is not in line with the observation that no apparent carbonate precipitation is present on the floor where the drip water was collected fig s4 an alternative interpretation of the long term decreasing trends of ca mg and u at ky4 and ky5 is related to the corrosivity of percolating water the overall increasing trends of the ph value of the drip water fig 2b which may be partly caused by reduced recharge and input of soil organic acids suggest that the percolating water became less corrosive from 2012 to 2014 this results in lowered dissolution of the host rock and the long term decreasing trends of ca mg and u in the drip water fig 3c d e the dripping rate is notably higher at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 fig 3f possibly due to more water supply through fracture flow at ky3 if so a less icd could be expected at ky3 relative to ky4 and ky5 which is in line with the observation that the sr at ky3 is lower than at ky4 and ky5 fig 3b the much higher ba at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 fig 3a may reflect that the host rock composition along the flow path of ky3 is different from those of ky4 and ky5 this is possible due to the heterogenicity of the host rock fig s1 it may also be caused by faster transport of water from the soil layer at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 it s currently not clear whether the higher water supply at ky3 possible through more fracture flow has resulted in the different long term trends of the trace elements mg sr ba and u at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 5 2 2 input from the overlying soil layer it is often mentioned that the trace elements in speleothems derive mainly from two sources the overlying soil layer and host rock fairchild and treble 2009 huang et al 2001 kuang et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 2009 2012 tremaine and froelich 2013 at kaiyuan cave although the elemental concentration in the soil leachate is much lower than in the host rock table 2 this does not mean that the soil exerts negligible effects on the elements in the drip water at kaiyuan cave the leachate by milli q water represents only the water soluble portion of the soil while the host rock stands for bulk limestone the radiogenic strontium isotope ratio 87sr 86sr of the drip water is much higher than that of the host rock indicating that in addition to the host rock there are other important sr sources probably the overlying soil layer table 4 similar differences of mg sr and ba concentrations existed between soil leachate and host rock in central china zhou 2011 table s1 and it was found that the sr in a stalagmite was provided more by soil layer than by host rock fig 10 in zhou et al 2009 the soil layer at kaiyuan cave is thicker than what reported by zhou et al 2009 usually 30 cm and the mg sr and ba leached from the soil are also higher at kaiyuan cave table 2 and s1 in addition the limestone at songjia cave is more homogeneous and more easily dissolved by percolating water than the composite carbonate rock at kaiyuan cave consisting of a series of limestone dolomitic limestone and dolomite bureau of geology and mineral resources of shandong province 1991 these lines of evidence suggest that the soil layer is an important source for the trace elements in the drip water at kaiyuan cave the long term decreasing trends of ca mg and u fig 3c d e are in accordance with a decreasing precipitation recharge and input of elements from the soil layer from 2012 to 2014 this implies that the soil layer may be partly responsible for the overall reduction of ca mg and u in the drip water fig 3c d e the source effect may also contribute to some extent to the overall decrease of the u ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 fig 4d because on average the u ca ratio of the soil leachate is higher than that of the host rock table 3 fig 4d reduced input from soil layer was also suggested by other investigators to be responsible for decrease of u content and u ca ratio in speleothems and drip water treble et al 2003 bourdin et al 2011 mischel et al 2016 ban et al 2018 heidke et al 2019 ban et al 2018 even suggested that input from soil layer dominated the u ca variations in the drip water of shihua cave in north china at kaiyuan cave however the u ca ratio of the drip water is on average notably higher than those of the soil leachate and host rock table 3 fig 4d input from the soil layer cannot explain the total u ca ratio variations the effects of source changes on sr and ba are outcompeted by the effects of wri and the two elements show overall increasing trends fig 3a b both the decrease of ca and the increases of sr and ba contribute to the very clear increasing sr ca and ba ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 fig 5b c therefore the soil layer may have exerted effects on the two ratios through decreasing ca as to the increasing mg ca ratio because both ca and mg are affected by reduced input from the soil layer whether the ratio is influenced by the soil layer is currently not clear like the u ca ratio however the mg ca ratio of the drip water is on average notably higher than that of the soil layer table 3 fig 4d suggesting that it is significantly affected by factors other than the soil layer probably by wri through dissolution of the host rock the effects of the soil layer on the mg ca ratio if existed at all may be weaker relative to the effects of wri such as selective leaching fairchild et al 2000 this explanation does not contradict the sinclair test shown in fig 6 which was proposed by sinclair et al 2012 to check the effects of pcp and or wri on drip water mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios the sinclair test takes into account only the effects of pcp and or wri happened in the hosts rock and along the upper flow path of drip water sinclair et al 2012 did not check the effect of trace element input from the soil layer even though they made some speculations pcp and or wri would lead to positive ln mg ca ln sr ca and ln sr ca ln ba ca correlations but positive ln mg ca ln sr ca and ln sr ca ln ba ca correlations do not necessarily mean that the x ca ratios are affected only by pcp and or wri the significant linear positive correlations at kaiyuan cave fig 6 may be simply due to that wri had exerted more influences on the sr ca mg ca and ba ca ratios relative to the trace element input from soil layer they may also reveal that the sinclair test could be sometimes satisfied even if the effects of the soil layer are considered however this does not mean that the test will always be satisfied when the effects of the soil layer are considered in monsoonal china warmer climates are usually associated with more precipitation on seasonal to orbital time scales intensifying soil weathering and leading to more elements released from the soil layer counteracting or even overwhelming the effects of pcp and wri this may be particularly important for mg because sr and ba seem to be more sensitive to residence time regulated wri if the effects of soil layer outcompete the effects of pcp and wri mg ca would show higher values under warm humid climates and an opposite trend to sr ca and ba ca ratios as was observed by zhou et al 2011 ban et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 5 2 3 the distribution coefficient of u ca the long term decreasing trend of the u ca ratio fig 5d may also be affected by the distribution coefficient of u ca ku ca ratio it is usually 1 weremeichik et al 2017 but was found to increase with calcite precipitation rate however these ku ca values were obtained under equilibrium precipitation of calcite whether ku ca increases significantly under kinetic precipitation of calcite warrants further investigation in addition veizer 1983 indicted that the ku ca of aragonite was sometimes greater than 1 and this is supported by some recent studies jamieson et al 2016 lechleitner et al 2016 wassenburg et al 2016 if ku ca is greater than 1 at kaiyuan cave pcp would affect the u ca ratio in the same direction as source changes however up to date only calcite speleothems were found in kaiyuan cave wang et al 2016 and in addition pcp seems not to be intense in this cave fig s4 thus the ku ca effect might be limited and wri and input from the soil layer played larger roles on the long term decreasing trend of the u ca ratio 6 conclusions drip water was collected from kaiyuan cave on shandong peninsula coastal north china during the period 2012 to 2014 to investigate how the elemental geochemistry of karstic drip water responds to changes in the hydroclimate the following results are obtained 1 with decreases of precipitation and resulted recharge reduction to kaiyuan cave from 2012 to 2014 the element concentrations and x ca ratios of the drip water respond differently to hydroclimate change in accordance with the observations by zhou et al 2011 2 the long term increasing trends of sr and ba are dominated by wri and are more sensitive to residence time while the long term decreasing trend of ca mg and u are due to reduced input from both the host rock and soil layer on one hand reduction of recharge due to decreasing precipitation leads to less corrosive percolating water and resulted less dissolution of the host rock on the other hand it reduces also element input from the soil layer 3 the mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios are affected by wri the increasing trends of the sr ca and ba ca ratios are caused by reduced precipitation and recharge and prolonged residence time from 2012 to 2014 they may also be affected to some extent by the soil layer due to its reduced output of ca to percolating water similarly both wri and input from the soil layer may have affected the u ca ratio credit authorship contribution statement ke cheng data curation investigation visualization writing original draft writing review editing qing wang

3464,water rock interaction wri and prior calcite precipitation pcp are often employed to interpret the variation in the trace elements present in speleothems and are assumed to be strengthened under drier climates however this interpretation is sometimes not consistent with speleothem records in monsoonal china zhou et al 2011 ban et al 2018 in this study a three year monitoring program was carried out from 2012 to 2014 at kaiyuan cave on shandong peninsula coastal north china to investigate how the element geochemistry of drip water responds to changes in hydroclimate it was found that trace elements and their ratios to ca x ca ratio responded differently to hydroclimatic change at kaiyuan cave during the period from 2012 to 2014 sr and ba which are controlled by incongruent dissolution of the host rock and are sensitive to residence time show a long term increasing trend from 2012 to 2014 while mg and u illustrate a long term decreasing trend possibly due to reduced dissolution of the host rock and less input from the soil layer all the x ca ratios are affected by wri but the soil layer may have played a role to some extent on the sr ca ba ca and u ca ratios these findings indicate that trace elements and x ca ratios of karstic drip water and speleothems do not respond in the same direction to hydroclimate change as is often suggested in previous

sr ca ratios of the drip water increased during the dry period zhang and li 2019 found that changes in the surface precipitation and water rock interaction wri were likely to be the main reasons for changes in the mg ca ratio of drip water in furong cave in central china the wri effect is stronger during the dry season than during the rainy season wri and prior calcite precipitation pcp are the two main mechanisms that are often assumed to affect the trace elements in stalagmites fairchild et al 2000 tooth and fairchild 2003 mcdonald et al 2004 musgrove and banner 2004 baldini et al 2006

2005 fairchild and baker 2012 although some studies have suggested that atmospheric deposition contributes to the trace elements in speleothems zhou et al 2008 2012 fairchild and treble 2009 it is generally thought that the main sources of the trace elements in stalagmites are the overlying soil layer and carbonate host rock huang et al 2001 kuang et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 2009 2012 fairchild and treble 2009 the hydroclimate at the surface generally influences the trace elements in drip water and stalagmites by regulating the wri and pcp it is commonly accepted that a relatively dry climate will cause a relative strengthening in both the pcp and wri because of prolonged residence time of percolating water in the host rock and more co2 degassing both mechanisms will increase the ratio of trace element relative to ca in the cave drip water and stalagmites hereafter denoted as x ca thus the x ca ratio in stalagmites is often used as an indicator for surface hydroclimate change verheyden et al 2000 mcdonald et al 2004 johnson et al 2006 cruz jr et al 2007 wassenburg et al 2013 owen et al 2016 however although stalagmite trace elements have been found to play an increasing role in the paleoclimatic reconstructions in monsoonal china ku and li 1998 li et al 2005 johnson et al 2006 tan et al 2014 li et al 2015 cheng et al 2016 owen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 the commonly accepted mechanisms were sometimes not consistent with speleothem records and modern observations zhou et al 2011 ren et al 2014 ban et al 2018 for example zhou et al 2011 found that the long term trends of sr ca and mg ca ratios were opposite to each other in a speleothem from central china covering the period from mis marine isotope stage 5d to 5c contrary to the commonly accepted mechanisms that dry climates lead to higher x ca ratios higher mg ca ratios occurred in relatively warm humid mis 5c zhou et al 2011 mg ca was suggested to be dominated by temperature while sr ca by input from dust derived soil layer and pcp zhou et al 2011 this suggests that there are factors other than the commonly accepted mechanisms affecting trace elements in drip water and speleothems response of trace elements in cave drip water and speleothems to changes in the hydroclimate at the surface warrants further investigation especially in cave monitoring in order to investigate the controlling mechanisms of trace element variation in karst cave drip water a three year monitoring campaign was conducted in kaiyuan cave in the southwestern part of shandong peninsula during 2012 2014 in particular now that the soil layer was suggested to be one of the main sources of the trace elements in speleothems and drip water in many previous publications huang et al 2001 kuang et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 2009 2012 fairchild and treble 2009 whether its contribution has significantly affected the trace elements in drip water need to be evaluated before the speleothem trace elements are used as proxies for paleo climate and paleo environment 2 geographical background kaiyuan cave 36 24 32 n 118 02 05 e is located in the southwestern mountainous area of shandong peninsula fig 1 a where it was formed at the northern foot of mount lu 1108 m a s l with the entrance at an elevation of 342 m a s l the geological and geographic background of the cave can be found in wang et al 2016 the cave develops in the early ordovician carbonate rock which has a maximum thickness of greater than 800 m and consists of a series of formations of limestone dolomitic limestone and dolomite bureau of geology and mineral resources of shandong province 1991 fig 1c supported by the mineralogy of the host rock fig s1 in the on line introduction of the cave a chinese web site there are two different statements about the host rock the dolomite of the ordovician zhifangzhuang formation and limestone of the ordovician majiagou formation which may be related to the heterogenicity of the host rock the capping rock is 110 m thick and is overlain with a soil layer according to the soil and fertilizer work station of shandong province 1994 the soil is derived from a mixture of wind blown dust and weathered carbonate rock and is generally 40 80 cm thick however up to 100 cm thick in some places fieldwork indicates that aeolian sediments are the main source of the soil which is rich in plant roots and residues and has poorly developed horizons fig s2 the vegetation is dominated by secondary shrubs and grasses and a few artificially planted trees the cave is approximately 1300 m long in a general north south direction fig 1b it is a corridor hall cave with a height of up to 30 m in the widest areas and the narrow areas are wide enough for one person to pass the cave is divided into six halls based on our monitoring from 2012 to 2014 the average of the annual mean temperature in the cave is 15 7 c and the average of the relative humidity in the cave is 91 cheng et al 2017 the cave region currently experiences a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate with more precipitation in summer under the influence of the east asian summer monsoon and a cold dry climate during the winter according to observational data from the nearby yiyuan meteorological station 305 m a s l and approximately 27 km southeast of kaiyuan cave fig 1a from 1958 to 2018 the multi year average of the annual precipitation in the area 715 mm mainly falls in july and august 70 80 of the annual precipitation with distinct wet june to september and dry october to next may seasons the multi year averages of the annual mean temperature 12 4 c for the period 1958 2018 and 13 2 c during the three years 2012 2014 fig s3 are lower than the multi year average of the annual mean temperature in the cave during 2012 2014 the temperature difference between contemporaneous cave air and surface air may be mainly caused by the tourist activities in kaiyuan cave there are nearly one hundred of thousands of tourists visiting the cave every year the tourists are an important heat source for the cave another important heat source related to tourist activities is the lighting system of the cave which is switched on during daytime 3 monitoring and analytical methods the monitoring campaign consists of measuring in site temperature relative humidity and co2 concentration of cave air the ph value of drip water and drip rate as well as collecting drip water samples twice a month this was conducted at the middle and end of each month from 12 31 2011 to 3 16 2013 and then adjusted to once a month at the middle of the month until the end of 2014 due to financial reasons three monitoring sites ky3 ky4 and ky5 were set up inside the cave fig 1b the ky3 drip site is located below a stalactite with a falling height of about 6 4 m at ky4 the drip water falls from a stalactite approximately 7 6 m above the floor at ky5 there are nearly ten soda straws on the ceiling which are about 4 5 m above the floor the floor was paved with cement for tourist convenience but no carbonate precipitation is observable on it fig s4 the drip water was collected from one soda straw which has a relatively fast drip rate the ph value of the drip water was measured in situ at each monitoring site about 200 ml of drip water was transferred into a 500 ml wide mouth polypropylene bottle for ph determination the bottle was pre cleaned with double distilled hno3 after calibration with buffer solutions ph4 01 6 86 9 18 nist standard the ph value was measured using a bante 220 portable ph meter with a precision of 0 01 which was produced by shanghai bante instrument co ltd drip water for trace element analysis was collected with pre cleaned 30 ml polypropylene bottles these water samples were acidified with double distilled hno3 to ph 2 and stored in the refrigerator at low temperatures 4 c until analysis after they were transferred to laboratory trace element analysis was conducted at the geochemistry lab in southwest university in chongqing china mg and ca were analyzed by icp oes optima 2100dv perkinelmer with a detection limit of 1 10 9 and an analytical precision rsd better than 1 sr ba and u were analyzed by icp ms finnigan element xr type with a detection limit of n 10 12 and a rsd of 5 a synthetic multi element standard high purity standards cb4618773 was used for external calibration the host rock and the overlying soil layer of the cave were also sampled four soil samples were obtained from a soil profile approximately 40 cm in thickness fig s2 with each representing a 10 cm interval three host rock samples were collected at the surface using a hammer the soil samples were gently crushed and ground to disaggregate assemblages after gravels and visible plant residues were picked out the samples were then dried in an oven overnight at a temperature of 60 c about 2 g of the dried soil powder was placed into a pre cleaned 15 ml centrifuge tube and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was added to remove the organic matter the soil samples were leached at room temperature with 10 ml milli q water and the leachates were analyzed for trace elements to analyze the carbonate rocks y ky1 y ky2 and y ky3 approximately 2 mg of powder was drilled from fresh sections and placed in pre cleaned 15 ml centrifuge tubes the powder was dissolved in double distilled hno3 until no insoluble matter could be observed by the naked eye and diluted with milli q water with a dilution factor of 6000 the trace elements of the soil leachates and host rock samples were analyzed at beijing createch testing technology co ltd with icp ms finnigan element xr the detection limits and analytical precision of the instruments were similar to those at the geochemical laboratory in southwest university the standard used for external calibration is the same as used at the geochemical laboratory in southwest university in order to check whether the soil layer at kaiyuan cave is an important source of trace elements in the drip water the three host rock samples the upper three soil samples 0 30 cm and four drip water samples depending on the water amount left after trace element determination were analyzed for radiogenic sr isotope 87sr 86sr the lowest soil sample was not analyzed due to its likely contamination by the underlying host rock 87sr 86sr determination was conducted at guizhou tongwei analytical technology co ltd in guiyang china using a mc icp ms nu plasma 3 after sr was separated following standard cation exchange column procedures standard srm 987 was used for calibration and long term repeated measurement of the standard on this machine yields a mean 87sr 86sr value of 0 710249 0 000010 2σ generally surface atmospheric precipitation is only partially recharged in karst caves hartmann et al 2015 based on the karst landscape of kaiyuan cave semi humid hills and observed data from the nearby yiyuan meteorological station the recharge model from hartmann et al 2015 was adopted to calculate the amount of surface atmospheric precipitation that is recharged into the karst percolating water 4 results the drip rate at the three monitoring sites in kaiyuan cave changed remarkably with higher rates occurring during rainy seasons and lower rates during dry seasons at ky3 the drip rate ranged from 8 to 190 drops min the drip rate at ky4 ranged from 0 06 drops min in dry season to 111 drops min in rainy season and the dripping ceased at the end of the monitoring period the drip rate at ky5 was as low as 0 125 drops min in dry season and reached 109 drops min in rainy season fig 3f 4 1 ph the ph values of the drip water at ky3 ky4 and ky5 ranged from 7 97 to 8 66 7 55 8 38 and 7 66 8 64 with mean values of 8 40 8 05 and 8 24 respectively the ph of the drip water in kaiyuan cave showed some seasonal variations and was generally lower in the rainy seasons and higher in the dry seasons of 2012 and 2013 fig 2 b in 2014 the ph remained at higher values in the dry season but showed significantly higher values in the rainy season than in the preceding rainy season s in particular the ph remained at higher values all year around at ky3 in 2014 despite that it showed notable seasonal cycle at ky4 and ky5 fig 2b in addition the ph value showed overall increasing trends from 2012 to 2014 despite that the increase is relatively less significant for the short record at ky4 2013 2014 p 0 092 fig 2b 4 2 recharge the annual precipitation in 2012 767 mm and 2013 707 mm was around the same as the multi year average of annual precipitation 715 mm while the annual precipitation in 2014 451 mm was significantly reduced table 1 the recharge of atmospheric precipitation into kaiyuan cave calculated by the model from hartmann et al 2015 was 241 mm 238 mm and 31 mm for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively this result indicates that the atmospheric precipitation in 2014 produced almost no recharge in kaiyuan cave table 1 which has essentially received no recharge from atmospheric precipitation since december 2013 fig 3g it should be noted that the model produced by hartmann et al 2015 includes a relatively large proportion of fracture water and pipe water and therefore the calculated recharge discharge rates are higher and the volumes are larger relative to the actual rate and volume for example the recharge discharge times calculated using this model typically do not exceed 50 days hartmann et al 2013 hartmann et al 2015 however some of the study sites in kaiyuan cave were still dripping after receiving no significant recharge in 2014 suggesting that the discharge process did not end as quickly as the model predicted some other studies also reveal that the residence time of percolating water in the host rock above karst caves are much longer than estimated by the model of hartmann et al 2015 worthington 2007 yamada et al 2008 orland et al 2014 the rate and volume of recharge discharge calculated by the model of hartmann et al 2015 are overestimated for karst caves the actual recharge of atmospheric precipitation to kaiyuan cave in 2014 may be lower than that calculated by the model nevertheless the relative variations of the recharge to kaiyuan cave from atmospheric precipitation estimated by the model of hartmann et al 2015 still have some referential significance due to that modeled recharge is sensitive to precipitation for example it increased sharply after heavy precipitation in summer seasons the maximum monthly precipitation was higher in 2013 than in 2012 so was the annual peak recharge fig 3g the precipitation decreased by nearly 40 in 2014 relative to the multi year average see table 1 and the modeled recharge became insignificant in this year fig 3g the recharge estimation indicates that 1 a significant portion 2 3 or more of the atmospheric precipitation does not infiltrate the karst caves 2 when precipitation decreased significantly in 2014 almost no atmospheric precipitation infiltrated to the karst percolating water in kaiyuan cave these results indicate that there is a threshold baker et al 2020 at which the stalagmite in kaiyuan cave records precipitation and summer monsoon intensity on seasonal time scale the highest recharge rate calculated with the model from hartmann et al 2015 as well as the sharp increase in drip rates cheng et al 2017 is not at the same time when the maximum atmospheric precipitation occurs which reflects the time lag 22 days on average that occurs in the movement of water from the atmosphere into the karst percolating water fig 3f g 4 3 the ca mg sr ba and u in the drip water and the 87sr 86sr ratio the ranges and mean values of ca mg sr ba and u in the drip water host rock sample and soil leachate are shown in table 2 in the host rock ca are remarkably higher than mg consistent with the mineralogy of the host rock fig s1 as to the elements in the drip water firstly it can be seen that the content of the different elements varies considerably at each drip site secondly the content of the same element varied greatly among the different drip sites for example the ca content was significantly higher overall at ky5 than at ky3 and ky4 while the ba content at ky3 was almost seven times higher than at the other two monitoring sites table 2 thirdly the five elements show significant long term increasing or decreasing trend except that at ky3 which cover only the latter two years and has a relatively short record only ca and sr illustrate significant decreasing trends for example the elements ca mg and u at ky4 and ky5 show a clear overall decreasing trend during the period from 2012 to 2014 fig 3c d e while sr and ba clearly increase at the two sites fig 3a b plots of the x ca molar ratio vs ca in the drip water the host rock and the soil leachate are shown in fig 4 on average the x ca ratios of the drip water were usually higher than those of the soil leachate and the host rock in general except the u ca ratio the x ca ratios of the soil leachate and host rocks are relatively focused on the plot while the x ca ratio of the drip water distributes with a wider range fig 4a b c the u ca ratios of the soil leachate are relatively scattered fig 4d the mean values of the soil leachates are higher than those of the host rock for all four elemental ratios table 3 the variation in the x ca molar ratios at each drip site is shown in fig 5 the mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios show an overall increasing trend at all three drip sites fig 5a b c as to the u ca ratio except ky3 an overall decreasing trend is displayed at ky4 and ky5 ky3 shows an overall increasing trend fig 5d however the confidence level of the increasing trend although reaching 95 was lower than that of the decreasing trend and the data at ky3 cover only 2013 and 2014 fig 5a d the increasing trend of the sr ca and ba ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 is related to the overall increasing trend of sr and ba and decreasing trend of ca in the drip water while the increasing trend of the sr ca ratio at ky3 suggests that the decrease of ca is more substantial than that of sr fig 3a b d fig 5c the increasing ba ca ratio at the site is simply due to the decrease of ca despite that ba does not show a trend fig 3a fig 5c the contents of u and mg are decreasing at ky4 and ky5 while at ky3 the two elements do not show significant decreasing or increasing trend fig 3c e like the ba ca ratio the increasing mg ca and u ca ratios at ky3 are caused by the ca decrease the overall decreasing u ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 reflect a less decrease in ca relative to u the 87sr 86sr ratio of the host rock ranges from 0 709183 to 0 711081 with an average of 0 710157 table 4 unfortunately the three soil samples were seriously polluted by the host rock during sample preparation and no 87sr 86sr ratio was obtained the 87sr 86sr ratio of the drip water which ranges from 0 712332 to 0 713548 with an average of 0 712789 is remarkably higher than those of the host rock table 4 5 discussions 5 1 5 1the factors influencing ph during the warm and rainy summers plants above the cave undergo higher respiration and produce more co2 resulting in a higher pco2 in the karst percolating water the warm and rainy climate is also beneficial to the decomposition of organic matter and the formation of more organic acids in the soil layer these cause a decrease in the ph of the karst percolating water and promote the dissolution of the carbonate host rock baldini et al 2006 frisia et al 2011 breecker et al 2012 gulley et al 2014 therefore ca increases in the warm humid summers due to more co2 and organic acids dissolved in the percolating water and resulted decrease in the ph of the percolating water fig 2b which is in accordance with a significant negative correlation between ca and the ph value of drip water at ky5 r 0 36 p 0 05 organic acids may be important factors affecting the ph value of the karst percolating water at kaiyuan cave it can be observed that the cave air co2 concentration at ky4 and ky5 is slightly lower in the summer of 2014 than in the summer of 2013 but notably higher than in the summer of 2012 cheng et al 2017 however the ph value of the drip water at the two sites is apparently higher in the summer of 2014 than in the preceding summer s fig 2a b although the influence from the visitors is currently not clear the relatively higher ph values in the summer of 2014 are probably caused by reduced input of soil organic acids due to nearly ceased recharge by precipitation table 1 5 2 mechanisms controlling the trace elements and x ca ratios 5 2 1 effects of pcp and wri as previously reported pcp and wri are two frequently mentioned factors affecting stalagmite trace elements johnson et al 2006 zhou et al 2009 cheng et al 2016 owen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 li et al 2021b it is generally accepted that pcp would increase the x ca ratios of drip water and speleothems because the distribution coefficient of trace element x is usually 1 mcdonald et al 2004 cruz jr et al 2007 griffiths et al 2016 warken et al 2018 however ca and trace element x would be removed from drip water with pcp with a preference of ca leading to decrease of their concentration in drip water and an anti correlation between trace element x and x ca ratio wri is usually assumed to be controlled by the residence time of karst percolating water in host rock with long residence time leading to enhanced wri and more trace elements released from host rock increasing both the trace element x and x ca ratio in drip water and speleothems banner et al 1996 musgrove and banner 2004 wong et al 2011 it is often inferred that drier climates tend to enhance both pcp and wri resulting in higher x ca ratios in speleothems while a wetter climate would lead to the opposite therefore the speleothem x ca ratios are often used as indicators of hydroclimate and the related summer monsoon climate and enso activities fairchild et al 2000 mcdonald et al 2004 cruz jr et al 2007 chen and li 2018 li et al 2021a as shown in fig 6 significant positive correlations exist between ln mg ca and ln sr ca and between ln sr ca and ln ba ca suggesting that the sinclair test as indicated by sinclair 2011 sinclair et al 2012 and wassenburg et al 2020 is satisfied in addition the slopes of the ln mg ca ln sr ca and ln sr ca ln ba ca correlations fig 6 are consistent with predicted and observed values considering that on average about a quarter of the host rock is dolomite fig s1 wassenburg et al 2020 fig 6 suggests significant effects of pcp and or icd incongruent calcite dissolution another phrase for wri used by sinclair et al 2012 on the x ca ratios of drip water in kaiyuan cave if the influence of the soil layer is not considered this is also consistent with changes in precipitation and recharge to kaiyuan cave from 2012 to 2014 the precipitation and recharge to kaiyuan cave decreased remarkably in 2014 although the precipitation and recharge differ by 10 between 2012 and 2013 table 1 the precipitation in 2011 amounts to 1102 mm fig s3 producing substantial excess recharge in 2011 and affecting the drip water in 2012 inter annual or even decadal variations of precipitation e g the overall precipitation decrease from 2003 to 2014 at the study site see fig s3 and resulted infiltration may have affected the recharge to kaiyuan cave a decreasing recharge could be expected at kaiyuan cave from 2012 to 2014 in accordance with the significant increasing trends of mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios of the drip water during the same period fig 5a c these effects are supported by the observation that the x ca ratios of the drip water are usually higher than those of the host rock fig 4 table 3 they are also consistent with the work of tan et al 2020 at nearby huangchao cave and the monitoring of jiguan cave in central china by li et al 2021b both of which suggested that pcp and wri were the important mechanisms affecting mg and sr in drip water and speleothems however mg and u in the drip water illustrate long term trends opposite to sr and ba fig 3a b c e at ky4 and ky5 at ky3 as mentioned above only ca and sr show overall decreasing trends fig 3a e these suggest that mg and u in the drip water are dominated by mechanisms different from sr and ba the overall increasing trends of sr and ba at ky4 and ky5 fig 3a b cannot be explained with enhanced pcp resulted from reduced recharge from 2012 to 2014 they are inferred to be mainly controlled by wri plausibly through strengthened icd of the dolomitic limestone of the host rock due to prolonged residence time and selective leaching of the host rock fairchild et al 2000 this suggests that sr and ba at ky4 and ky5 are more sensitive to residence time than to other factors such as pcp and input from soil layer which may be due to that more sr and ba are outcompeted by mg with relatively longer residence time therefore residence time affects sr ca and ba ca ratios in the same direction as pcp if pcp exists this is in accordance with the observation that higher sr ca and ba ca ratios or sr and ba usually correspond to drier climate cruz jr et al 2007 zhou et al 2009 2011 carolin et al 2019 feng et al 2020 unlike sr and ba the long term decreasing trends of mg and u at ky4 and ky5 are apparently consistent with a pcp effect seemingly supported by ca which is parallel to mg and u fig 3c d e however this is not in line with the observation that no apparent carbonate precipitation is present on the floor where the drip water was collected fig s4 an alternative interpretation of the long term decreasing trends of ca mg and u at ky4 and ky5 is related to the corrosivity of percolating water the overall increasing trends of the ph value of the drip water fig 2b which may be partly caused by reduced recharge and input of soil organic acids suggest that the percolating water became less corrosive from 2012 to 2014 this results in lowered dissolution of the host rock and the long term decreasing trends of ca mg and u in the drip water fig 3c d e the dripping rate is notably higher at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 fig 3f possibly due to more water supply through fracture flow at ky3 if so a less icd could be expected at ky3 relative to ky4 and ky5 which is in line with the observation that the sr at ky3 is lower than at ky4 and ky5 fig 3b the much higher ba at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 fig 3a may reflect that the host rock composition along the flow path of ky3 is different from those of ky4 and ky5 this is possible due to the heterogenicity of the host rock fig s1 it may also be caused by faster transport of water from the soil layer at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 it s currently not clear whether the higher water supply at ky3 possible through more fracture flow has resulted in the different long term trends of the trace elements mg sr ba and u at ky3 than at ky4 and ky5 5 2 2 input from the overlying soil layer it is often mentioned that the trace elements in speleothems derive mainly from two sources the overlying soil layer and host rock fairchild and treble 2009 huang et al 2001 kuang et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 2009 2012 tremaine and froelich 2013 at kaiyuan cave although the elemental concentration in the soil leachate is much lower than in the host rock table 2 this does not mean that the soil exerts negligible effects on the elements in the drip water at kaiyuan cave the leachate by milli q water represents only the water soluble portion of the soil while the host rock stands for bulk limestone the radiogenic strontium isotope ratio 87sr 86sr of the drip water is much higher than that of the host rock indicating that in addition to the host rock there are other important sr sources probably the overlying soil layer table 4 similar differences of mg sr and ba concentrations existed between soil leachate and host rock in central china zhou 2011 table s1 and it was found that the sr in a stalagmite was provided more by soil layer than by host rock fig 10 in zhou et al 2009 the soil layer at kaiyuan cave is thicker than what reported by zhou et al 2009 usually 30 cm and the mg sr and ba leached from the soil are also higher at kaiyuan cave table 2 and s1 in addition the limestone at songjia cave is more homogeneous and more easily dissolved by percolating water than the composite carbonate rock at kaiyuan cave consisting of a series of limestone dolomitic limestone and dolomite bureau of geology and mineral resources of shandong province 1991 these lines of evidence suggest that the soil layer is an important source for the trace elements in the drip water at kaiyuan cave the long term decreasing trends of ca mg and u fig 3c d e are in accordance with a decreasing precipitation recharge and input of elements from the soil layer from 2012 to 2014 this implies that the soil layer may be partly responsible for the overall reduction of ca mg and u in the drip water fig 3c d e the source effect may also contribute to some extent to the overall decrease of the u ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 fig 4d because on average the u ca ratio of the soil leachate is higher than that of the host rock table 3 fig 4d reduced input from soil layer was also suggested by other investigators to be responsible for decrease of u content and u ca ratio in speleothems and drip water treble et al 2003 bourdin et al 2011 mischel et al 2016 ban et al 2018 heidke et al 2019 ban et al 2018 even suggested that input from soil layer dominated the u ca variations in the drip water of shihua cave in north china at kaiyuan cave however the u ca ratio of the drip water is on average notably higher than those of the soil leachate and host rock table 3 fig 4d input from the soil layer cannot explain the total u ca ratio variations the effects of source changes on sr and ba are outcompeted by the effects of wri and the two elements show overall increasing trends fig 3a b both the decrease of ca and the increases of sr and ba contribute to the very clear increasing sr ca and ba ca ratios at ky4 and ky5 fig 5b c therefore the soil layer may have exerted effects on the two ratios through decreasing ca as to the increasing mg ca ratio because both ca and mg are affected by reduced input from the soil layer whether the ratio is influenced by the soil layer is currently not clear like the u ca ratio however the mg ca ratio of the drip water is on average notably higher than that of the soil layer table 3 fig 4d suggesting that it is significantly affected by factors other than the soil layer probably by wri through dissolution of the host rock the effects of the soil layer on the mg ca ratio if existed at all may be weaker relative to the effects of wri such as selective leaching fairchild et al 2000 this explanation does not contradict the sinclair test shown in fig 6 which was proposed by sinclair et al 2012 to check the effects of pcp and or wri on drip water mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios the sinclair test takes into account only the effects of pcp and or wri happened in the hosts rock and along the upper flow path of drip water sinclair et al 2012 did not check the effect of trace element input from the soil layer even though they made some speculations pcp and or wri would lead to positive ln mg ca ln sr ca and ln sr ca ln ba ca correlations but positive ln mg ca ln sr ca and ln sr ca ln ba ca correlations do not necessarily mean that the x ca ratios are affected only by pcp and or wri the significant linear positive correlations at kaiyuan cave fig 6 may be simply due to that wri had exerted more influences on the sr ca mg ca and ba ca ratios relative to the trace element input from soil layer they may also reveal that the sinclair test could be sometimes satisfied even if the effects of the soil layer are considered however this does not mean that the test will always be satisfied when the effects of the soil layer are considered in monsoonal china warmer climates are usually associated with more precipitation on seasonal to orbital time scales intensifying soil weathering and leading to more elements released from the soil layer counteracting or even overwhelming the effects of pcp and wri this may be particularly important for mg because sr and ba seem to be more sensitive to residence time regulated wri if the effects of soil layer outcompete the effects of pcp and wri mg ca would show higher values under warm humid climates and an opposite trend to sr ca and ba ca ratios as was observed by zhou et al 2011 ban et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 5 2 3 the distribution coefficient of u ca the long term decreasing trend of the u ca ratio fig 5d may also be affected by the distribution coefficient of u ca ku ca ratio it is usually 1 weremeichik et al 2017 but was found to increase with calcite precipitation rate however these ku ca values were obtained under equilibrium precipitation of calcite whether ku ca increases significantly under kinetic precipitation of calcite warrants further investigation in addition veizer 1983 indicted that the ku ca of aragonite was sometimes greater than 1 and this is supported by some recent studies jamieson et al 2016 lechleitner et al 2016 wassenburg et al 2016 if ku ca is greater than 1 at kaiyuan cave pcp would affect the u ca ratio in the same direction as source changes however up to date only calcite speleothems were found in kaiyuan cave wang et al 2016 and in addition pcp seems not to be intense in this cave fig s4 thus the ku ca effect might be limited and wri and input from the soil layer played larger roles on the long term decreasing trend of the u ca ratio 6 conclusions drip water was collected from kaiyuan cave on shandong peninsula coastal north china during the period 2012 to 2014 to investigate how the elemental geochemistry of karstic drip water responds to changes in the hydroclimate the following results are obtained 1 with decreases of precipitation and resulted recharge reduction to kaiyuan cave from 2012 to 2014 the element concentrations and x ca ratios of the drip water respond differently to hydroclimate change in accordance with the observations by zhou et al 2011 2 the long term increasing trends of sr and ba are dominated by wri and are more sensitive to residence time while the long term decreasing trend of ca mg and u are due to reduced input from both the host rock and soil layer on one hand reduction of recharge due to decreasing precipitation leads to less corrosive percolating water and resulted less dissolution of the host rock on the other hand it reduces also element input from the soil layer 3 the mg ca sr ca and ba ca ratios are affected by wri the increasing trends of the sr ca and ba ca ratios are caused by reduced precipitation and recharge and prolonged residence time from 2012 to 2014 they may also be affected to some extent by the soil layer due to its reduced output of ca to percolating water similarly both wri and input from the soil layer may have affected the u ca ratio credit authorship contribution statement ke cheng data curation investigation visualization writing original draft writing review editing qing wang
