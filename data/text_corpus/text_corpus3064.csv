15320,solar driven photocatalysis offers an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach for the degradation of organic pollutants in water without chemical additives but the low specific surface area and adsorption capacity of common photocatalysts restricts the surface reactions with the contaminants herein we hypercrosslinked polymer layers on tio2 graphene surface to enlarge the specific surface area from 136 to 988 m2 g leading to a high adsorption capacity of sulfadiazine as 54 3 mg g which is 15 5 times that of tio2 graphene 3 5 mg g the adsorption kinetics reveals the combination of physical and chemical adsorption by porous benzene based polymer for sulfadiazine enrichment besides the polymer layers with broad light absorption enable the composite to function efficiently as visible light driven photocatalysts thus the as designed composite exhibits excellent performance for sulfadiazine removal by integrating the adsorptive and photocatalytic processes especially for the diluted sulfadiazine solution more importantly the porous polymer layer can function as a filter for weakening the interference of tio2 surface with the natural matters from complex water matrices based on the identification of dominant reactive species the possible attacking pathway and the sulfadiazine subsequent degradation are presented further the enhanced adsorption and photodegradation efficiency can also be achieved for the removal of other typical pollutants such as 4 chlorophenol and methylene blue this study highlights an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism for water pollutants that can direct the design of high performance photocatalysts under visible light graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption photodegradation porous polymer layer organic pollutants water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid industrial developments and population growth have brought the increasing discharges of various organic pollutants to irreversibly destroy the aquatic ecosystem and thus threaten human health casal et al 2019 li et al 2021 allen et al 2010 the governments of many countries raised awareness about the adverse impacts of organic pollutants and agreed to take actions to reduce their production and use however they would persist for long periods in both surface and underground water due to their tolerance against direct biological decomposition lu and astruc 2020 ghosh et al 2015 kochergin et al 2021 typical organic pollutants such as antibiotics phenols dyes etc have been widely used and usually detected in the water environment with the existence of low concentrations 10 10 000 ng l wang et al 2019a ahmadijokani et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 therefore effective remediation techniques are in the urgent requirements for such organic pollutants degradation especially adaptable to the removal of low concentration organics from the polluted water the adsorption technique has been considered an effective approach for water treatment due to the merits of low cost convenient operation and environmental friendliness wei et al 2018 luo et al 2021 porous organic frameworks as a new kind of adsorbents appeared to be attractive for organic pollutants removal owing to their advantages of relatively large specific surface area flexible structural skeleton and high affinity for organic molecules li et al 2017a wang et al 2016 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2021 for example li et al combined sodium acrylate functionalized hypercrosslinked polymers with magnetic fe3o4 to form a hybrid adsorbent which reached a high adsorption capacity of 216 mg g for rhodamine b li et al 2017b however the remediation of the polluted aquatic ecosystem will be far from satisfactory if only depending on the adsorption technique since it can just separate the pollutants from water and these pollutants still exist in the environment therefore the combination of adsorption with other advanced technologies is worthy of research in terms of eliminating organic pollutants with considerable concentration in their effluents and or low concentration in the existing water environment ahmed et al 2021 solar driven photocatalysis has been proved to be an ideal approach for the decomposition of organic pollutants from diverse water and wastewater due to the characteristics of broad applicability low cost and environmental friendliness serra et al 2021 xia et al 2020 chen et al 2010 recently semiconductor photocatalysts such as tio2 zno fe2o3 etc have been extensively investigated in the field of pollutant degradation song et al 2021 kumar et al 2021 zu et al 2020 moztahida et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 it is noted that these popular photocatalysts usually possess low specific surface area which restricts the sufficient contact with reactants on the catalyst surface and therefore the catalytic efficiency is significantly restricted parvulescu et al 2022 to address this difficulty in reactants adsorption various strategies have been adopted to enlarge the surface area zhang et al 2021 rathi et al 2022 for example p25 tio2 was immobilized by a biopolymer system with the surface area being enlarged from 61 8 to 117 2 m2 g assessing the maximum sorption capacity of 5 93 mg g and complete removal of methylene blue 6 4 mg l after 120 min of uv irradiation lee et al 2018 the fluorinated cyclodextrin polymer coated tio2 microspheres with a surface area of 197 2 m2 g exhibited 1 7 times degradation rate higher than that of tio2 for bisphenol a due to its higher adsorption capacity 36 9 mg g than that of tio2 21 9 mg g garcia diaz et al 2020 the growth of tio2 crystals on a metal organic framework mil 101 substrate achieved a high surface area of 531 m2 g and thus increased the adsorption capacity of methylene blue from 8 9 to 21 6 mg g resulting in the enhanced photodegradation activity chang et al 2018 these practices demonstrate that the large surface area will be beneficial to the adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface favoring the subsequent catalytic reactions ma et al 2022 wang et al 2019b although many efforts have been made to construct the porous structure the improvement is still not sufficient for photocatalytic reactions especially because the adsorption of low concentration pollutants is quite limited tan and tan 2017 therefore the photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants from wastewater can be improved by the rational design of porous photocatalysts with a large surface area which will provide a bifunctional platform for surface adsorption and degradation of pollutants at low concentrations skorjanc et al 2021 herein we have knitted ultrathin hypercrosslinked polymer layers on tio2 functionalized graphene tg to construct a porous ptg composite photocatalyst graphene is introduced as a substrate for growing tio2 crystals because its fast electron mobility favors the photoinduced charge separation the skeleton can be functionalized with phenyl groups which act as building blocks for knitting with 1 3 5 triphenylbenzene to form ultrathin polymers layers on tio2 surface wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the porous structure of polymers significantly enlarged the specific surface area of tio2 g from 122 to 988 m2 g and thus achieved a high adsorption capacity for organic pollutants such as sulfadiazine sdz 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and methylene blue mb besides polymers with broad light adsorption can extend the light response of photocatalysts to the visible region and thus improve the utilization of solar energy as a result the as designed porous ptg composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic performance for sdz degradation i e nearly 100 of removal within 100 min under visible light moreover excellent photodegradation efficiency can also be achieved in the reaction systems containing 4 cp and mb interestingly ptg composite is further discovered as a bifunctional platform for the adsorptive and photocatalytic processes that is first acting as adsorbents for pollutant removal from its solution and then being self cleaned by the photocatalytic reactions this study presents an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism that demonstrates the superiority of the as designed ptg porous composite in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and catalysts synthesis the chemicals used in this study and the synthetic route are shown in text s1 text s2 and text s3 the chemical structure of ptg is presented in supplementary fig s1 2 2 adsorption experiments typically 20 mg of tio2 g or ptg was immersed in 100 ml of 16 mg l sdz solution and stirred in dark at regular time intervals 5 ml of the reaction solution were sampled centrifuged and filtered through a 0 22 µm membrane filter before further analysis the concentration of free sdz was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent technologies 1100 series equipped with a c18 column and uv detector dad the mobile phase was methanol water 70 30 v v with a flow rate of 1 ml min the detection wavelength was set as 280 nm for sdz and 4 cp subsequently the solution was stirred for 40 min in dark and then the final concentration was tested by hplc the standard curves of sdz and 4 cp were presented in supplementary fig s2 for calculating the removal efficiency of adsorption and degradation the adsorption amounts q can be calculated as follows q c 0 c e v w where c 0 and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of sdz respectively v ml is the sample volume and w g is the mass of the catalysts added 2 3 analytic methods the characterization and analytic methods used in this work are listed in text s4 2 4 photocatalytic degradation experiments the photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted in a glass vessel with a 50 ml capacity 5 mg of photocatalysts were added to 10 ml of the aqueous solution containing organic pollutants c 0 16 mg l of sdz 16 mg l of 4 cp 50 mg l of mb the suspensions were stirred in dark for 40 min to reach the adsorption equilibrium a 300 w xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the light source the light intensity with and without visible light filter were measured to be 370 376 mw cm2 and 605 658 mw cm2 supplementary fig s3 and arriving at the surface of reaction system during the reaction supplementary fig s3 the suspensions were sampled at fixed time intervals under continuous agitation and light irradiation after centrifugation and filtration the supernatants were collected with a syringe at timed intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter before analysis the concentration of sdz the concentration c t of sampled supernatant containing sdz or 4 cp was measured by hplc and that containing mb was detected by uv vis spectrophotometer the practical application experiments were performed by replacing deionized water with natural lake water east lake the largest lake in wuhan china the lake water was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before adding sdz the representative natural matters such as nacl nano3 and human acid ha were introduced to evaluate the removal efficiency of photocatalysts in different water matrices 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterizations x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the photocatalysts are shown in fig 1 a all signals can be attributed to the pure anatase phase of tio2 crystals which indicates the knitting of the polymer hardly altered the crystal phase of tio2 the stronger intensity signals of ptg composite indicated that the average size of tio2 increased during the process of functionalization and hypercrosslinking the morphology and nanostructure of the samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy tem as shown in fig 1b the small tio2 nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene and formed a unique tio2 g composite structure by strong interface interactions with an average particle size of 11 7 nm xu et al 2019 fig 1c d showed that there are ultrathin polymers layers with 4 6 nm covering the surface of tio2 nanoparticles in comparison to tio2 g the hypercrosslinking process brought about an obvious increase in the size of tio2 nanoparticles which was in agreement with the result of xrd as further evidence the element mapping images were collected to present that the surface of tio2 nanoparticles was wrapped by an ultrathin polymers layer fig 1e h the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of pg and ptg to study the chemical structure of the polymer supplementary fig s4 showed obvious absorption bands near 1454 and 2923 cm 1 which can be attributed to the aromatic ring skeleton vibration and c h stretching vibrations of methylene respectively the results indicated the knitting of 1 3 5 triphenylbenzene monomer with the open phenyl groups on graphene via methylene linkers wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 leading to the formation of ultrathin hypercrosslinked polymer layers on tio2 functionalized graphene the brunauer emmett teller surface areas s bet and porosity properties of tio2 tio2 g and ptg composite were compared in table 1 it is found that the formation of polymers layers on the tio2 g surface resulted in a dramatic increase in the specific surface area from 122 to 988 m2 g the ptg composite was exhibited a steep increase in n2 uptake at low pressure p p0 0 001 and an obvious hysteresis at medium pressure indicating the existence of abundant micropores and mesopores the corresponding pore diameter of ptg mainly located at 0 5 and 1 1 nm supplementary fig s5 which indicated that the large specific surface area of ptg composite originated from the plentiful hierarchical pores of polymers layers in general the diameter of o2 molecule is about 0 3 nm and that of natural matter such as ha is much bigger more than several hundreds of nanometers in aqueous solution chen et al 2021a long et al 2017 the enlarged surface area and abundant micropores of ultrathin polymer will favor the diffusion diffuse across the dissolved oxygen to arrive at the tio2 surface but block the natural matter to pass meanwhile polymers layers containing π conjugated structures possess a high affinity for organic molecules therefore the porous polymers layers with a large surface area may provide more adsorptive sites for organic pollutant molecules and also function as filter to protect the tio2 surface which are favorable for the photocatalytic reactions on the catalyst surface skorjanc et al 2021 3 2 adsorption performance after achieving the improvement of surface area and porous properties we then studied the effect of polymers layers on the adsorption behavior of organic pollutants sdz was selected as a typical reactant to reveal the adsorption kinetics over tio2 g and ptg catalysts fig 2 a showed that the sdz adsorption on the catalyst surface increased sharply at the initial stage and then reach the adsorption equilibrium at 30 min when the concentration of sdz is 16 mg l in the aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of ptg was measured to be 54 3 mg g about 15 5 times that of tio2 g 3 5 mg g the great improvement can be attributed to the porous surface providing more physical adsorption sites and the polymers layers with abundant benzene units enhancing the affinity for organic pollutants adsorption by π π stacking interaction according to the recently reported results in supplementary supplementary table s1 the adsorption capacity of as designed ptg is one of the best values for photocatalysts in the fields of pollutants degradation the adsorption kinetics of sdz on the ptg was fitted by the pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model the parameters in fig 2b are calculated following the eq 1 and eq 2 respectively wu et al 2018 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t mg g are the amounts of sdz adsorbed per unit mass of ptg at equilibrium and at a given time t min respectively k 1 and k 2 g mg min are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption rate constants respectively the pseudo first order kinetic equation generally describes the simple physical adsorption while the pseudo second order model kinetic equation means the coexistence of chemical adsorption with physical adsorption liu et al 2018 tian et al 2017 as shown in fig 2b the adsorption kinetic model of sdz on the ptg approximately conformed to the pseudo second order model more suitable for the adsorption process and the correlation coefficient r 2 0 999 from table 2 the fitting results suggest that the sdz adsorption on the ptg surface is a result of both chemical adsorption and physical adsorption liu et al 2018 supplementary fig s6 displayed the ftir spectrum of ptg in dark although the signals are relatively weak due to the low sdz content on ptg surface the signals of sdz can be observed in ftir spectrum such as the stretching vibration of n h and c n at 1242 and 1116 cm 1 liu et al 2018 zhu et al 2022 to further investigate the adsorption process the adsorption isotherms of tio2 g and ptg were measured and displayed in fig 2c at lower sdz concentration 20 mg l the equilibrium adsorption capacity of sdz on ptg increased significantly with the concentration while that on tio2 g changed slightly which indicated the important role of porous polymers outer layer in sdz enrichment moreover the adsorption isotherms were fitted using langmuir and freundlich adsorption models respectively the parameters in fig 2d are calculated by eq 3 and eq 4 nguyen et al 2015 esfandiar et al 2022 3 q e k l q max c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where q e mg g is the amount of organic adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent c e mg l is the concentration of the organic matter at the adsorption equilibrium q max mg g is the maximum adsorption amount and it depends on the properties of the adsorbent k l mg l is the langmuir adsorption affinity constant related to adsorption bond energy k f mg1 1 n l1 n g and 1 n are the freundlich adsorption constants representing the adsorption capacity and the adsorption intensity respectively fig 2d clearly illustrated that the adsorption of sdz on ptg well matched the langmuir model and the parameters of adsorption isotherms of sdz for two isotherms are given in table 3 the result indicated a characteristic of monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surface with weak interaction between the adsorbed sdz molecules 3 3 photodegradation efficiency the effect of polymers layers on the adsorption and photocatalytic performance of tio2 g was investigated by the removal of sdz in the dark and under light irradiation after the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption amounts of sdz over tio2 and tio2 g were extremely low mainly due to the limited specific surface area and weak interaction with organic molecules in contrast knitting the polymers with a porous surface and benzene containing skeleton dramatically increased the physical adsorption sites and strengthened the chemical interaction with sdz leading to the high adsorption capacity for sdz removal over polymer graphene pg and ptg in the dark the desorption of sdz on pg surface was performed to identify the behaviors of adsorption and catalytic degradation as shown in supplementary fig s7 the adsorption amounts of sdz on pg and ptg surface are 0 140 and 0 108 mg in dark respectively the desorbed sdz amounts from pg and ptg surface are calculated to be 0 137 and 0 106 mg very close to the adsorption amounts the results indicated a considerable mass balance between adsorption and desorption generally the strong surface adsorption can ensure sufficient contact of the photocatalyst with the reactants which enhances the photocatalytic efficiency due to the degradation reactions occurring at the surface catalytic sites as a result of high sdz absorption the adsorbed sdz on ptg surface was gradually degraded and nearly completely removed 98 4 at 40 min supplementary fig s8 while those over tio2 and tio2 g were 72 7 and 80 under full light irradiation for 40 min respectively fig 3 a supplementary fig s9 presented the average values of five times with an error bar the error bar ranged from 0 5 to 0 9 suggesting that both experiments and hplc measurements are repeatable in contrast the adsorbed sdz on pg surface remained constant indicating that pg can only act as efficient adsorbents but displays litter catalytic ability for sdz degradation under light irradiation the results indicated the roles of porous polymer layers and tio2 in providing the adsorptive and catalytic sites respectively more importantly the degradation of sdz also proceeded efficiently on the ptg surface in the case of visible light irradiation fig 3b the removal efficiency is among the best results of the popular photocatalysts and their composites supplementary supplementary table s1 under similar conditions sdz can hardly be degraded by tio2 and tio2 g photocatalysts because the intrinsic nature of the wide bandgap caused the tio2 to function only as uv light driven photocatalysts as revealed by a previous study ptg with an energy gap of about 2 34 ev exhibited strong visible light adsorption wang et al 2019b therefore the construction of tio2 based composites by polymers layers enables them to be efficient visible light driven photocatalysts structural stability is important for composite photocatalysts especially for those containing polymer frameworks the repetitive test in supplementary fig s10 and figs 3c confirmed the excellent recyclability for the repeated sdz adsorption and desorption on pg and ptg the repetitive test in supplementary fig s10 confirmed the excellent recyclability for the repeated sdz adsorption and desorption on pg the recyclability of ptg as photocatalysts are investigated by the cycling tests under identical conditions figs 3d showed that the photocatalytic performance of ptg were well maintained after multiple cycles suggesting its capability to self clean by the photocatalytic reactions as well as the excellent photostability figs 3d showed that the photocatalytic performance of ptg were well maintained after multiple cycles suggesting its capability to self clean by the photocatalytic reactions as well as the excellent photostability as further evidence the crystal phase and chemical structure of ptg after the reaction were compared to those of a fresh one no obvious changes in the xrd pattern and fourier transform infrared spectra ftir confirmed the stable structure of ptg during the adsorption and photocatalytic processes supplementary figs s11 and s12 since the organic pollutants usually existed in the water environment with low concentrations 10 10 000 ng l the applicability of such remediation techniques depends on the adsorption and degradation efficiency of low concentration organic pollutants to simulate the low concentration environment the control experiment was designed by diluting 100 ml of sdz solution 16 mg l to 1000 ml with water and then treating with ptg about 66 of sdz was enriched on ptg surface the ptg with pre adsorbed sdz was then added into water or another sdz solution 16 mg l to be self cleaned under visible light irradiation fig 3e for a self cleaning test in water the pre adsorbed sdz was desorbed from ptg surface to water and the adsorption amount decreased from 52 8 mg g to 16 2 mg g after the photocatalytic reaction for 100 min the total removal efficiency of sdz reached nearly 100 including those on the catalyst surface and in the liquid phase as for the self cleaning test in sdz solution the adsorption amount slightly increased to 58 5 mg g after the introduction of more sdz and then 92 of sdz was degraded under light irradiation it has been established that the pre adsorption processes on the catalyst surface have a synergistic effect on the photodegradation of organic pollutants luo et al 2019 the results verified that ptg was applied to the removal of low concentration organic pollutants by effectively combining the processes of adsorption separation and photocatalytic degradation 3 4 sdz degradation in complex water matrices in practical environment the existence of natural organic acid and inorganic anions will interfere with the photocatalytic degradation of sdz pollutants to explore the adaptability of the proposed ptg photocatalyst for practical application we investigated the photocatalytic efficiency of sdz removal in the case of complex water matrices fig 4 a presented the photocatalytic results of tio2 and ptg when replacing deionized water with natural lake water even at the same concentration of sdz the degradation rate in lake water over tio2 photocatalyst obviously slowed down and the removal efficiency was only 75 under 100 min of full light irradiation then we performed the kinetic study of sdz degradation over tio2 and ptg in supplementary fig s13 it is noted that the degradation of organic pollutants over tio2 generally follows a first order kinetic model using the following equation zhu et al 2022 i n c 0 c k t where c 0 mg l 1 represents the initial mass concentration of sdz c mg l 1 represents the mass concentration of sdz under t min k min 1 is the kinetic constant of degradation thus the linear fitting results of sdz degradation are presented in supplementary fig s13 and the kinetic constants over ptg and tio2 are summarized in supplementary table s2 the linear fitting provides a kinetic constant as 0 0763 min 1 much higher than that of tio2 0 0295 reflecting the increased photodegradation rate by remarkably improving sdz adsorption by the porous polymer layers on tio2 graphene surface in lake water the kinetic constants of tio2 and ptg are 0 014 and 0 0407 min 1 respectively the inhibition effect can be attributed to the natural matter being adsorbed on the surface of tio2 and thus suppressing the reaction with the adsorbed o2 molecules unfavorable for the generation of reactive oxygen species besides the inorganic anions also reacted with hydroxyl radicals oh and impeded the oxidative degradation of sdz by oh watts and linden 2009 in contrast the photocatalytic efficiency of ptg slightly decreased in the presence of lake water from 99 5 to 96 2 indicating weak interference with the existing natural matter the results proved that the presence of out layer porous polymer could function as a filter for adsorbing the natural matter and protect the surface active sites of tio2 from being shielded ma et al 2022 waheed et al 2021 meanwhile the gaseous o2 molecules can still diffuse across the ultrathin porous polymer layer to arrive at the tio2 surface to further investigate the effect of natural matter on sdz degradation we introduced representative dissolved organic matter ha and inorganic ions cl and no3 into the different water matrices fig 4b and c as expected the additional inorganic ions had little influence on the degradation of sdz in deionized water over ptg photocatalyst suggesting the role of the porous polymer as a protection layer in filtering these ions while in lake water a slight decrease could be observed and followed the order of no3 cl which might be caused by the weakened adsorption on polymer surface due to the complex contents in lake water generally cl ions could react with oh under light irradiation to form chlorine containing radicals which were less active than oh for sdz degradation sirtori et al 2010 as reported no3 could absorb light in the uv range as an inner light filter and decreased the formation process of active oxidation species hirayama and kamiya 2014 in this system the no3 ions hardly alter the photocatalytic activity of ptg due to the irradiation of visible light and broad light absorption of polymer it is noted that the inhibitory effect of ha was significant for sdz photodegradation in both deionized water and lake water the macromolecular structure of ha caused it to be strongly adsorbed on the surface s of ptg via π π interaction which could block the porous structure and thus hinder the gaseous o2 molecule to arrive at the surface of the tio2 crystal leading to the decreased photocatalytic activity tang et al 2018 zou et al 2022 the function of the polymer as an adsorbent or filter for such natural matters was investigated by ftir and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds eds in supplementary fig s14 displays that ptg surface mainly consists of c 80 09 o 18 90 and ti 0 96 together with trace cl 0 05 which originated from the introduction of ch2cl2 during the synthesis supplementary table s3 the relatively low content of ti further verified the surface coating of tio2 by polymer layers with existence of nacl the signal of na appeared in the eds of ptg surface meanwhile the content of cl increased from 0 05 to 0 12 supplementary fig s15 by comparison ptg surface with adsorbed ha has much higher content of o 26 80 in supplementary fig s16 which is ascribed to the adsorption of carboxyl groups of ha as shown in the supplementary fig s17 after adsorption for 40 min with ha in dark ptg displayed a shoulder peak at around 1710 cm 1 and a wide peak at 1384 cm 1 in supplementary fig s17 which belonged to the co stretching and asymmetric vibrations of carboxyl groups from carboxylate groups in ha long et al 2017 yang et al 2011 that is the ha molecule can be effectively adsorbed on the ptg surface the results clearly demonstrated the function of polymer layer as an effective adsorbent or filter for natural organic and inorganic matters of practical water it has been demonstrated that the ph value of the solution played a non negligible role in the sdz removal and neutral condition was more suitable for the photodegradation process yuan et al 2012 fig 4d presented the highest degradation rate of sdz in neutral environment the degradation rate of sdz gradually decreased with the increase of ph value implying the low efficiency of tio2 based photocatalysts under alkaline condition su et al 2016 xekoukoulotakis et al 2011 there is considerable difference in ph value between deionized water 6 92 and lake water 7 82 it should be mentioned that the addition of representative matters including no3 cl and ha obviously increased the ph value of lake water supplementary table s4 to avoid the effect of ph value we adjusted the deionized water to ph 7 82 after introducing cl no3 or ha and performed the degradation experiments the resulted time dependent degradation curves were located between those in deionized water and lake water with existence of corresponding matter as shown in supplementary fig s18 therefore the decreased sdz degradation rate in practical water relative to deionized water is ascribed to the combined effect of ph value and natural matters even though the difference is less significant over ptg than that over tio2 photocatalyst the excellent anti interference performance in complex water matrices further proved the superiority of the porous ptg composite for removing low concentration pollutants from contaminated practical water 3 5 mechanism of photodegradation and charge transfer the results from the adsorption behavior and photocatalytic reaction demonstrate the positive contribution of high adsorption capacity to the photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants on ptg in general high surface area excellent light adsorption capability and superior separation efficiency of electron hole pairs are beneficial for the performance of photocatalysts xu et al 2017 then further studies on the role of each component in the composite as well as photocatalytic mechanism were conducted the charge separation efficiency was investigated by the photoluminescence pl electrochemical impedance spectra eis and the transient amperometric i t curves in comparison to tio2 the significant quenching in pl signals of tio2 g and ptg suggested that the recombination of the photogenerated e h pairs was effectively suppressed by coupling with graphene owing to its high electron mobility fig 5 a as shown in fig 5b the smaller arc radius represented the lower electron transfer resistance r ct in tio2 g than tio2 and the presence of graphene can facilitate the charge transfer between their interfaces the covalent linkage with polymers effectively improved the electron conductivity and further promoted electron transfer the visible light driven electron transfer can be illustrated by the photocurrent measurement fig 5c the photocurrent signals of tio2 and tio2 g were detected to be relatively weak due to their low visible light response while ptg with visible light adsorption presented an obvious photocurrent response the stronger intensity of the photocurrent signal in ptg demonstrated the generation and efficient separation of the photo induced carriers in such a composite structure as a result the enhanced photodegradation efficiency of the porous ptg can be ascribed to the high adsorption capacity improved visible light adsorption and photo generated charge separation the oxygen activation and generation of reactive oxygen species ros were investigated by the scavenger quenching experiments and the epr technique the edta 2na tertiary butanol t buoh and benzoquinone bq was used as the scavengers of holes h oh radicals and o2 radicals respectively as shown in fig 5d the introduction of edta 2na hardly altered the photocatalytic performance indicating that holes might not participate in the photocatalytic reactions in contrast the sdz degradation was notably inhibited after adding t buoh or bq especially for the presence of bq which manifested that oh and o2 radicals were the predominant active species with an order of o2 oh in the photocatalytic process the negligible role of h implied that these ros are more likely generated by the reduction of oxygen by e rather than the oxidation by h the role of dissolved o2 molecules was studied by the adsorption and photocatalytic experiments under anoxic conditions although o2 cannot be completely isolated from the reaction system due to the exposed gas liquid interface the dissolved o2 amount can be greatly reduced by n2 bubbling as shown in supplementary fig s19 there is no obvious difference in sdz adsorption between n2 and air environment when being irradiated by visible light the sdz degradation over ptg photocatalyst was seriously inhibited by n2 replacement especially at the initial stage supplementary fig s20 combined with trapping experiments the o2 radicals can be identified as the predominant active species in the photocatalytic process long et al 2017 chen et al 2021b the uv vis absorption spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ups were employed to measure the band structure of ptg the energy gaps of pg and tio2 were calculated to be 2 32 ev and 3 22 ev by the tauc plot of uv vis absorption spectra supplementary fig s21 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo energy levels of pg located at 5 34 ev vs vacuum level supplementary fig s22 more negative than the conduction band cb level of tio2 thus the photogenerated electrons on ptg can migrate to the cb of tio2 the good affinity of oxygen molecules with tio2 surface is favorable to activate the dissolved o2 and generate oh and o2 radicals adamek et al 2012 which attack the sdz molecules to induce the degradation the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo 3 00 ev of ptg is less positive than that of oh 1 99 ev vs nhe oh h2o the holes can directly oxide h2o to produce oxygen gas instead of oh wang et al 2019b lyu et al 2018 chen et al 2020 the generation of oh and o2 radicals was verified by the epr technique no dmpo o2 or dmpo oh signals over ptg could be observed under dark conditions while the specific characteristic peaks with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 were found under visible light irradiation fig 5e f xiao et al 2017 wang et al 2019c as expected no peaks can be detected over tio2 g which explains the poor photocatalytic activity towards sdz under visible light combined with the drs data it can be deduced that the ptg also performed as a photosensitizer therefore the role of each component in the composite can be elucidated i e ultrathin pg layer is responsible for the enrichment of sdz and absorption of visible light graphene functions as a conductive carbon skeleton for knitting the polymer layer and improving the charge transfer tio2 provides the catalytic active sites to activate the oxygen molecules and generate oh and o2 radicals for sdz degradation that is the outer layer polymer will not impede the oxygen activation on the tio2 surface due to its ultrathin and porous structure based on the above results the adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism for sdz removal over porous ptg is presented in scheme 1 which highlighted the superiority of the designed composite structure as simultaneously realizing the enhanced pollutant adsorption visible light adsorption and charge separation to further illustrate the photocatalytic degradation pathway of sdz by ptg the mineralization degree and generated intermediates were identified by total organic carbon toc and liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms after 2 h of photocatalytic reaction the total organic carbon toc of sdz solution was only reduced by 13 supplementary fig s23 with time extending to 6 h 30 of the sdz molecules could be completely mineralized the results revealed that the mineralization of sdz was relatively difficult due to the arduous ring opening reactions to small molecules according to the lc ms results in supplementary fig s24 and supplementary table s6 three possible pathways for sdz degradation over ptg were illustrated in fig 6 the first pathway is the hydroxylation at the pyrimidine ring of sulfadiazine by oh attacking to form p1 in accordance with the previous study zhou et al 2020 it is assumed that the hydroxylated product p1 will subsequently decompose to products p2 and p3 through the cleavage of c n bonds in the heterocyclic ring and the breakage of the s n bond respectively meanwhile the amino groups of sdz could also be oxidized by o2 to the generation of product p4 the second pathway song et al 2017 and then decomposed to product p5 by the breakage of the s n bond the product p6 was obtained via the third pathway by the loss of so2 in sdz followed by c n bond cleavage to form an analogue of p3 chen et al 2021b guo et al 2020 the products p3 and p5 as important intermediates were easily attacked by oh to induce a ring opening process to the products p7 p8 and p9 which were obviously observed in supplementary table s6 and responsible for the next mineralization finally these fragments could be oxidized to co2 h2o and inorganic ions such as no3 so4 2 nh4 3 6 universal application the mechanism of adsorption enhanced degradation has been well established for sdz removal on ptg surfaces under visible light taking account of the existence of various pops in the existing water environment we are inclined to explore the universality of ptg besides antibiotics phenols and dyes have been widely used and also detected as typical organic pollutants which can trigger serious health and environmental issues interestingly ptg exhibited a high photocatalytic performance towards 4 cp degradation under full light and visible light irradiation in terms of its higher adsorption ability than that of tio2 or tio2 g supplementary fig s25 as compared in supplementary table s5 the results are superior to the reported values of the popular photocatalysts and their composites supplementary fig s26 showed the high stability of ptg composite for recycling the 4 cp degradation the scavenger quenching tests in supplementary fig s27 presented the little change in degradation efficiency in the presence of edta 2na but obvious inhibition after adding t buoh or bq similar to sdz degradation oh and o2 radicals were the predominant active species with an order of o2 oh for the photodegradation of 4 cp while the holes might not participate in the reactions the negligible role of h implied that the ros is more likely generated via the oxygen activation by electrons rather than the oxidation by holes toc measurements indicated that 60 of 4 cp could be completely mineralized after 4 h of reaction and the mineralization degree increased slowly with the extended time supplementary fig s28 at this time the concentration of cl in the solution increased from 0 001 to 0 0271 mmol l supplementary fig s29 the result indicated that the ring opening reactions occurred accompanied by the dichloride resulting in the easier mineralization of 4 cp than that of sdz yu et al 2019 as for mb molecules they were also hardly adsorbed on tio2 or tio2 g surface and less of them could be decomposed under visible light whereas due to the relatively low surface area and poor visible light absorption of tio2 supplementary fig s30 in comparison most mb molecules could be removed from the solution by ptg reaching a high adsorption capacity of 212 5 mg g in dark all adsorbed mb were almost degraded within 40 min during the subsequent visible light driven photocatalytic reactions by an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism the results demonstrated that ptg has a prospective application in the adsorption and photodegradation of various types of pollutants the excellent performance can be attributed to the following merits of the designed porous ptg composite the high surface area porous structure and aromatic skeleton of polymers provide considerable physical and chemical adsorption sites for organic pollutant adsorption besides the ptg layer with narrow gap energy is beneficial to visible light adsorption graphene with a conductive carbon skeleton can act as a substrate for knitting polymers and improve the charge transfer between ptg and tio2 the good affinity of oxygen molecules with tio2 surface is favorable to activating the dissolved oxygen and producing ros for organic pollutant degradation 4 conclusions for the application of solar driven photocatalysis in water treatment it is highly desired to develop an efficient photocatalyst with a large specific surface area and considerable adsorption capacity in this work the polymer layers were hypercrosslinked on tio2 graphene surface to the formation of porous composite photocatalyst with a high specific surface area of 988 m2 g the role of each component in the composite is elucidated i e ultrathin polymer layer is responsible for the enrichment of sdz and absorption of visible light graphene functions as a conductive carbon skeleton for knitting the polymer layer and improving the charge transfer tio2 provides the catalytic active sites to activate the oxygen molecules and generate oh and o2 radicals for sdz degradation thus the as obtained porous photocatalyst exhibits the enhanced absorption and photodegradation efficiency for the removal of several typical pollutants such as sulfadiazine 4 chlorophenol and methylene blue under visible light via an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism the excellent adsorption ability of porous photocatalyst also enables it to be effectively applied in the water purification with low concentration pollutants more importantly the porous polymer layer can function as a filter for weakening the interference of tio2 surface with the natural matters from complex water matrices the adsorption and photocatalytic performance of the as obtained porous photocatalyst could be considered as one of the best values among the recently reported results in the removal of organic pollutants lee et al 2018 garcia diaz et al 2020 chen et al 2021b wang et al 2023 xu et al 2020 tian et al 2020 therefore the above findings indicate that the rational design of photocatalyst with the ideal porous surface can be an effective solution for enhancing the adsorptive and photocatalytic performance toward water contaminants removal further developments such as modulating adsorption selectivity of the polymer by molecular design and improving the reactivity of tio2 surface by cocatalysts can make this

15320,solar driven photocatalysis offers an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach for the degradation of organic pollutants in water without chemical additives but the low specific surface area and adsorption capacity of common photocatalysts restricts the surface reactions with the contaminants herein we hypercrosslinked polymer layers on tio2 graphene surface to enlarge the specific surface area from 136 to 988 m2 g leading to a high adsorption capacity of sulfadiazine as 54 3 mg g which is 15 5 times that of tio2 graphene 3 5 mg g the adsorption kinetics reveals the combination of physical and chemical adsorption by porous benzene based polymer for sulfadiazine enrichment besides the polymer layers with broad light absorption enable the composite to function efficiently as visible light driven photocatalysts thus the as designed composite exhibits excellent performance for sulfadiazine removal by integrating the adsorptive and photocatalytic processes especially for the diluted sulfadiazine solution more importantly the porous polymer layer can function as a filter for weakening the interference of tio2 surface with the natural matters from complex water matrices based on the identification of dominant reactive species the possible attacking pathway and the sulfadiazine subsequent degradation are presented further the enhanced adsorption and photodegradation efficiency can also be achieved for the removal of other typical pollutants such as 4 chlorophenol and methylene blue this study highlights an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism for water pollutants that can direct the design of high performance photocatalysts under visible light graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption photodegradation porous polymer layer organic pollutants water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid industrial developments and population growth have brought the increasing discharges of various organic pollutants to irreversibly destroy the aquatic ecosystem and thus threaten human health casal et al 2019 li et al 2021 allen et al 2010 the governments of many countries raised awareness about the adverse impacts of organic pollutants and agreed to take actions to reduce their production and use however they would persist for long periods in both surface and underground water due to their tolerance against direct biological decomposition lu and astruc 2020 ghosh et al 2015 kochergin et al 2021 typical organic pollutants such as antibiotics phenols dyes etc have been widely used and usually detected in the water environment with the existence of low concentrations 10 10 000 ng l wang et al 2019a ahmadijokani et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 therefore effective remediation techniques are in the urgent requirements for such organic pollutants degradation especially adaptable to the removal of low concentration organics from the polluted water the adsorption technique has been considered an effective approach for water treatment due to the merits of low cost convenient operation and environmental friendliness wei et al 2018 luo et al 2021 porous organic frameworks as a new kind of adsorbents appeared to be attractive for organic pollutants removal owing to their advantages of relatively large specific surface area flexible structural skeleton and high affinity for organic molecules li et al 2017a wang et al 2016 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2021 for example li et al combined sodium acrylate functionalized hypercrosslinked polymers with magnetic fe3o4 to form a hybrid adsorbent which reached a high adsorption capacity of 216 mg g for rhodamine b li et al 2017b however the remediation of the polluted aquatic ecosystem will be far from satisfactory if only depending on the adsorption technique since it can just separate the pollutants from water and these pollutants still exist in the environment therefore the combination of adsorption with other advanced technologies is worthy of research in terms of eliminating organic pollutants with considerable concentration in their effluents and or low concentration in the existing water environment ahmed et al 2021 solar driven photocatalysis has been proved to be an ideal approach for the decomposition of organic pollutants from diverse water and wastewater due to the characteristics of broad applicability low cost and environmental friendliness serra et al 2021 xia et al 2020 chen et al 2010 recently semiconductor photocatalysts such as tio2 zno fe2o3 etc have been extensively investigated in the field of pollutant degradation song et al 2021 kumar et al 2021 zu et al 2020 moztahida et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 it is noted that these popular photocatalysts usually possess low specific surface area which restricts the sufficient contact with reactants on the catalyst surface and therefore the catalytic efficiency is significantly restricted parvulescu et al 2022 to address this difficulty in reactants adsorption various strategies have been adopted to enlarge the surface area zhang et al 2021 rathi et al 2022 for example p25 tio2 was immobilized by a biopolymer system with the surface area being enlarged from 61 8 to 117 2 m2 g assessing the maximum sorption capacity of 5 93 mg g and complete removal of methylene blue 6 4 mg l after 120 min of uv irradiation lee et al 2018 the fluorinated cyclodextrin polymer coated tio2 microspheres with a surface area of 197 2 m2 g exhibited 1 7 times degradation rate higher than that of tio2 for bisphenol a due to its higher adsorption capacity 36 9 mg g than that of tio2 21 9 mg g garcia diaz et al 2020 the growth of tio2 crystals on a metal organic framework mil 101 substrate achieved a high surface area of 531 m2 g and thus increased the adsorption capacity of methylene blue from 8 9 to 21 6 mg g resulting in the enhanced photodegradation activity chang et al 2018 these practices demonstrate that the large surface area will be beneficial to the adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface favoring the subsequent catalytic reactions ma et al 2022 wang et al 2019b although many efforts have been made to construct the porous structure the improvement is still not sufficient for photocatalytic reactions especially because the adsorption of low concentration pollutants is quite limited tan and tan 2017 therefore the photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants from wastewater can be improved by the rational design of porous photocatalysts with a large surface area which will provide a bifunctional platform for surface adsorption and degradation of pollutants at low concentrations skorjanc et al 2021 herein we have knitted ultrathin hypercrosslinked polymer layers on tio2 functionalized graphene tg to construct a porous ptg composite photocatalyst graphene is introduced as a substrate for growing tio2 crystals because its fast electron mobility favors the photoinduced charge separation the skeleton can be functionalized with phenyl groups which act as building blocks for knitting with 1 3 5 triphenylbenzene to form ultrathin polymers layers on tio2 surface wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the porous structure of polymers significantly enlarged the specific surface area of tio2 g from 122 to 988 m2 g and thus achieved a high adsorption capacity for organic pollutants such as sulfadiazine sdz 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and methylene blue mb besides polymers with broad light adsorption can extend the light response of photocatalysts to the visible region and thus improve the utilization of solar energy as a result the as designed porous ptg composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic performance for sdz degradation i e nearly 100 of removal within 100 min under visible light moreover excellent photodegradation efficiency can also be achieved in the reaction systems containing 4 cp and mb interestingly ptg composite is further discovered as a bifunctional platform for the adsorptive and photocatalytic processes that is first acting as adsorbents for pollutant removal from its solution and then being self cleaned by the photocatalytic reactions this study presents an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism that demonstrates the superiority of the as designed ptg porous composite in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and catalysts synthesis the chemicals used in this study and the synthetic route are shown in text s1 text s2 and text s3 the chemical structure of ptg is presented in supplementary fig s1 2 2 adsorption experiments typically 20 mg of tio2 g or ptg was immersed in 100 ml of 16 mg l sdz solution and stirred in dark at regular time intervals 5 ml of the reaction solution were sampled centrifuged and filtered through a 0 22 µm membrane filter before further analysis the concentration of free sdz was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent technologies 1100 series equipped with a c18 column and uv detector dad the mobile phase was methanol water 70 30 v v with a flow rate of 1 ml min the detection wavelength was set as 280 nm for sdz and 4 cp subsequently the solution was stirred for 40 min in dark and then the final concentration was tested by hplc the standard curves of sdz and 4 cp were presented in supplementary fig s2 for calculating the removal efficiency of adsorption and degradation the adsorption amounts q can be calculated as follows q c 0 c e v w where c 0 and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of sdz respectively v ml is the sample volume and w g is the mass of the catalysts added 2 3 analytic methods the characterization and analytic methods used in this work are listed in text s4 2 4 photocatalytic degradation experiments the photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted in a glass vessel with a 50 ml capacity 5 mg of photocatalysts were added to 10 ml of the aqueous solution containing organic pollutants c 0 16 mg l of sdz 16 mg l of 4 cp 50 mg l of mb the suspensions were stirred in dark for 40 min to reach the adsorption equilibrium a 300 w xenon lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter was used as the light source the light intensity with and without visible light filter were measured to be 370 376 mw cm2 and 605 658 mw cm2 supplementary fig s3 and arriving at the surface of reaction system during the reaction supplementary fig s3 the suspensions were sampled at fixed time intervals under continuous agitation and light irradiation after centrifugation and filtration the supernatants were collected with a syringe at timed intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane filter before analysis the concentration of sdz the concentration c t of sampled supernatant containing sdz or 4 cp was measured by hplc and that containing mb was detected by uv vis spectrophotometer the practical application experiments were performed by replacing deionized water with natural lake water east lake the largest lake in wuhan china the lake water was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane before adding sdz the representative natural matters such as nacl nano3 and human acid ha were introduced to evaluate the removal efficiency of photocatalysts in different water matrices 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterizations x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the photocatalysts are shown in fig 1 a all signals can be attributed to the pure anatase phase of tio2 crystals which indicates the knitting of the polymer hardly altered the crystal phase of tio2 the stronger intensity signals of ptg composite indicated that the average size of tio2 increased during the process of functionalization and hypercrosslinking the morphology and nanostructure of the samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy tem as shown in fig 1b the small tio2 nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on the surface of graphene and formed a unique tio2 g composite structure by strong interface interactions with an average particle size of 11 7 nm xu et al 2019 fig 1c d showed that there are ultrathin polymers layers with 4 6 nm covering the surface of tio2 nanoparticles in comparison to tio2 g the hypercrosslinking process brought about an obvious increase in the size of tio2 nanoparticles which was in agreement with the result of xrd as further evidence the element mapping images were collected to present that the surface of tio2 nanoparticles was wrapped by an ultrathin polymers layer fig 1e h the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra of pg and ptg to study the chemical structure of the polymer supplementary fig s4 showed obvious absorption bands near 1454 and 2923 cm 1 which can be attributed to the aromatic ring skeleton vibration and c h stretching vibrations of methylene respectively the results indicated the knitting of 1 3 5 triphenylbenzene monomer with the open phenyl groups on graphene via methylene linkers wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 leading to the formation of ultrathin hypercrosslinked polymer layers on tio2 functionalized graphene the brunauer emmett teller surface areas s bet and porosity properties of tio2 tio2 g and ptg composite were compared in table 1 it is found that the formation of polymers layers on the tio2 g surface resulted in a dramatic increase in the specific surface area from 122 to 988 m2 g the ptg composite was exhibited a steep increase in n2 uptake at low pressure p p0 0 001 and an obvious hysteresis at medium pressure indicating the existence of abundant micropores and mesopores the corresponding pore diameter of ptg mainly located at 0 5 and 1 1 nm supplementary fig s5 which indicated that the large specific surface area of ptg composite originated from the plentiful hierarchical pores of polymers layers in general the diameter of o2 molecule is about 0 3 nm and that of natural matter such as ha is much bigger more than several hundreds of nanometers in aqueous solution chen et al 2021a long et al 2017 the enlarged surface area and abundant micropores of ultrathin polymer will favor the diffusion diffuse across the dissolved oxygen to arrive at the tio2 surface but block the natural matter to pass meanwhile polymers layers containing π conjugated structures possess a high affinity for organic molecules therefore the porous polymers layers with a large surface area may provide more adsorptive sites for organic pollutant molecules and also function as filter to protect the tio2 surface which are favorable for the photocatalytic reactions on the catalyst surface skorjanc et al 2021 3 2 adsorption performance after achieving the improvement of surface area and porous properties we then studied the effect of polymers layers on the adsorption behavior of organic pollutants sdz was selected as a typical reactant to reveal the adsorption kinetics over tio2 g and ptg catalysts fig 2 a showed that the sdz adsorption on the catalyst surface increased sharply at the initial stage and then reach the adsorption equilibrium at 30 min when the concentration of sdz is 16 mg l in the aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of ptg was measured to be 54 3 mg g about 15 5 times that of tio2 g 3 5 mg g the great improvement can be attributed to the porous surface providing more physical adsorption sites and the polymers layers with abundant benzene units enhancing the affinity for organic pollutants adsorption by π π stacking interaction according to the recently reported results in supplementary supplementary table s1 the adsorption capacity of as designed ptg is one of the best values for photocatalysts in the fields of pollutants degradation the adsorption kinetics of sdz on the ptg was fitted by the pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model the parameters in fig 2b are calculated following the eq 1 and eq 2 respectively wu et al 2018 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 2 303 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e and q t mg g are the amounts of sdz adsorbed per unit mass of ptg at equilibrium and at a given time t min respectively k 1 and k 2 g mg min are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption rate constants respectively the pseudo first order kinetic equation generally describes the simple physical adsorption while the pseudo second order model kinetic equation means the coexistence of chemical adsorption with physical adsorption liu et al 2018 tian et al 2017 as shown in fig 2b the adsorption kinetic model of sdz on the ptg approximately conformed to the pseudo second order model more suitable for the adsorption process and the correlation coefficient r 2 0 999 from table 2 the fitting results suggest that the sdz adsorption on the ptg surface is a result of both chemical adsorption and physical adsorption liu et al 2018 supplementary fig s6 displayed the ftir spectrum of ptg in dark although the signals are relatively weak due to the low sdz content on ptg surface the signals of sdz can be observed in ftir spectrum such as the stretching vibration of n h and c n at 1242 and 1116 cm 1 liu et al 2018 zhu et al 2022 to further investigate the adsorption process the adsorption isotherms of tio2 g and ptg were measured and displayed in fig 2c at lower sdz concentration 20 mg l the equilibrium adsorption capacity of sdz on ptg increased significantly with the concentration while that on tio2 g changed slightly which indicated the important role of porous polymers outer layer in sdz enrichment moreover the adsorption isotherms were fitted using langmuir and freundlich adsorption models respectively the parameters in fig 2d are calculated by eq 3 and eq 4 nguyen et al 2015 esfandiar et al 2022 3 q e k l q max c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where q e mg g is the amount of organic adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent c e mg l is the concentration of the organic matter at the adsorption equilibrium q max mg g is the maximum adsorption amount and it depends on the properties of the adsorbent k l mg l is the langmuir adsorption affinity constant related to adsorption bond energy k f mg1 1 n l1 n g and 1 n are the freundlich adsorption constants representing the adsorption capacity and the adsorption intensity respectively fig 2d clearly illustrated that the adsorption of sdz on ptg well matched the langmuir model and the parameters of adsorption isotherms of sdz for two isotherms are given in table 3 the result indicated a characteristic of monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surface with weak interaction between the adsorbed sdz molecules 3 3 photodegradation efficiency the effect of polymers layers on the adsorption and photocatalytic performance of tio2 g was investigated by the removal of sdz in the dark and under light irradiation after the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption amounts of sdz over tio2 and tio2 g were extremely low mainly due to the limited specific surface area and weak interaction with organic molecules in contrast knitting the polymers with a porous surface and benzene containing skeleton dramatically increased the physical adsorption sites and strengthened the chemical interaction with sdz leading to the high adsorption capacity for sdz removal over polymer graphene pg and ptg in the dark the desorption of sdz on pg surface was performed to identify the behaviors of adsorption and catalytic degradation as shown in supplementary fig s7 the adsorption amounts of sdz on pg and ptg surface are 0 140 and 0 108 mg in dark respectively the desorbed sdz amounts from pg and ptg surface are calculated to be 0 137 and 0 106 mg very close to the adsorption amounts the results indicated a considerable mass balance between adsorption and desorption generally the strong surface adsorption can ensure sufficient contact of the photocatalyst with the reactants which enhances the photocatalytic efficiency due to the degradation reactions occurring at the surface catalytic sites as a result of high sdz absorption the adsorbed sdz on ptg surface was gradually degraded and nearly completely removed 98 4 at 40 min supplementary fig s8 while those over tio2 and tio2 g were 72 7 and 80 under full light irradiation for 40 min respectively fig 3 a supplementary fig s9 presented the average values of five times with an error bar the error bar ranged from 0 5 to 0 9 suggesting that both experiments and hplc measurements are repeatable in contrast the adsorbed sdz on pg surface remained constant indicating that pg can only act as efficient adsorbents but displays litter catalytic ability for sdz degradation under light irradiation the results indicated the roles of porous polymer layers and tio2 in providing the adsorptive and catalytic sites respectively more importantly the degradation of sdz also proceeded efficiently on the ptg surface in the case of visible light irradiation fig 3b the removal efficiency is among the best results of the popular photocatalysts and their composites supplementary supplementary table s1 under similar conditions sdz can hardly be degraded by tio2 and tio2 g photocatalysts because the intrinsic nature of the wide bandgap caused the tio2 to function only as uv light driven photocatalysts as revealed by a previous study ptg with an energy gap of about 2 34 ev exhibited strong visible light adsorption wang et al 2019b therefore the construction of tio2 based composites by polymers layers enables them to be efficient visible light driven photocatalysts structural stability is important for composite photocatalysts especially for those containing polymer frameworks the repetitive test in supplementary fig s10 and figs 3c confirmed the excellent recyclability for the repeated sdz adsorption and desorption on pg and ptg the repetitive test in supplementary fig s10 confirmed the excellent recyclability for the repeated sdz adsorption and desorption on pg the recyclability of ptg as photocatalysts are investigated by the cycling tests under identical conditions figs 3d showed that the photocatalytic performance of ptg were well maintained after multiple cycles suggesting its capability to self clean by the photocatalytic reactions as well as the excellent photostability figs 3d showed that the photocatalytic performance of ptg were well maintained after multiple cycles suggesting its capability to self clean by the photocatalytic reactions as well as the excellent photostability as further evidence the crystal phase and chemical structure of ptg after the reaction were compared to those of a fresh one no obvious changes in the xrd pattern and fourier transform infrared spectra ftir confirmed the stable structure of ptg during the adsorption and photocatalytic processes supplementary figs s11 and s12 since the organic pollutants usually existed in the water environment with low concentrations 10 10 000 ng l the applicability of such remediation techniques depends on the adsorption and degradation efficiency of low concentration organic pollutants to simulate the low concentration environment the control experiment was designed by diluting 100 ml of sdz solution 16 mg l to 1000 ml with water and then treating with ptg about 66 of sdz was enriched on ptg surface the ptg with pre adsorbed sdz was then added into water or another sdz solution 16 mg l to be self cleaned under visible light irradiation fig 3e for a self cleaning test in water the pre adsorbed sdz was desorbed from ptg surface to water and the adsorption amount decreased from 52 8 mg g to 16 2 mg g after the photocatalytic reaction for 100 min the total removal efficiency of sdz reached nearly 100 including those on the catalyst surface and in the liquid phase as for the self cleaning test in sdz solution the adsorption amount slightly increased to 58 5 mg g after the introduction of more sdz and then 92 of sdz was degraded under light irradiation it has been established that the pre adsorption processes on the catalyst surface have a synergistic effect on the photodegradation of organic pollutants luo et al 2019 the results verified that ptg was applied to the removal of low concentration organic pollutants by effectively combining the processes of adsorption separation and photocatalytic degradation 3 4 sdz degradation in complex water matrices in practical environment the existence of natural organic acid and inorganic anions will interfere with the photocatalytic degradation of sdz pollutants to explore the adaptability of the proposed ptg photocatalyst for practical application we investigated the photocatalytic efficiency of sdz removal in the case of complex water matrices fig 4 a presented the photocatalytic results of tio2 and ptg when replacing deionized water with natural lake water even at the same concentration of sdz the degradation rate in lake water over tio2 photocatalyst obviously slowed down and the removal efficiency was only 75 under 100 min of full light irradiation then we performed the kinetic study of sdz degradation over tio2 and ptg in supplementary fig s13 it is noted that the degradation of organic pollutants over tio2 generally follows a first order kinetic model using the following equation zhu et al 2022 i n c 0 c k t where c 0 mg l 1 represents the initial mass concentration of sdz c mg l 1 represents the mass concentration of sdz under t min k min 1 is the kinetic constant of degradation thus the linear fitting results of sdz degradation are presented in supplementary fig s13 and the kinetic constants over ptg and tio2 are summarized in supplementary table s2 the linear fitting provides a kinetic constant as 0 0763 min 1 much higher than that of tio2 0 0295 reflecting the increased photodegradation rate by remarkably improving sdz adsorption by the porous polymer layers on tio2 graphene surface in lake water the kinetic constants of tio2 and ptg are 0 014 and 0 0407 min 1 respectively the inhibition effect can be attributed to the natural matter being adsorbed on the surface of tio2 and thus suppressing the reaction with the adsorbed o2 molecules unfavorable for the generation of reactive oxygen species besides the inorganic anions also reacted with hydroxyl radicals oh and impeded the oxidative degradation of sdz by oh watts and linden 2009 in contrast the photocatalytic efficiency of ptg slightly decreased in the presence of lake water from 99 5 to 96 2 indicating weak interference with the existing natural matter the results proved that the presence of out layer porous polymer could function as a filter for adsorbing the natural matter and protect the surface active sites of tio2 from being shielded ma et al 2022 waheed et al 2021 meanwhile the gaseous o2 molecules can still diffuse across the ultrathin porous polymer layer to arrive at the tio2 surface to further investigate the effect of natural matter on sdz degradation we introduced representative dissolved organic matter ha and inorganic ions cl and no3 into the different water matrices fig 4b and c as expected the additional inorganic ions had little influence on the degradation of sdz in deionized water over ptg photocatalyst suggesting the role of the porous polymer as a protection layer in filtering these ions while in lake water a slight decrease could be observed and followed the order of no3 cl which might be caused by the weakened adsorption on polymer surface due to the complex contents in lake water generally cl ions could react with oh under light irradiation to form chlorine containing radicals which were less active than oh for sdz degradation sirtori et al 2010 as reported no3 could absorb light in the uv range as an inner light filter and decreased the formation process of active oxidation species hirayama and kamiya 2014 in this system the no3 ions hardly alter the photocatalytic activity of ptg due to the irradiation of visible light and broad light absorption of polymer it is noted that the inhibitory effect of ha was significant for sdz photodegradation in both deionized water and lake water the macromolecular structure of ha caused it to be strongly adsorbed on the surface s of ptg via π π interaction which could block the porous structure and thus hinder the gaseous o2 molecule to arrive at the surface of the tio2 crystal leading to the decreased photocatalytic activity tang et al 2018 zou et al 2022 the function of the polymer as an adsorbent or filter for such natural matters was investigated by ftir and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds eds in supplementary fig s14 displays that ptg surface mainly consists of c 80 09 o 18 90 and ti 0 96 together with trace cl 0 05 which originated from the introduction of ch2cl2 during the synthesis supplementary table s3 the relatively low content of ti further verified the surface coating of tio2 by polymer layers with existence of nacl the signal of na appeared in the eds of ptg surface meanwhile the content of cl increased from 0 05 to 0 12 supplementary fig s15 by comparison ptg surface with adsorbed ha has much higher content of o 26 80 in supplementary fig s16 which is ascribed to the adsorption of carboxyl groups of ha as shown in the supplementary fig s17 after adsorption for 40 min with ha in dark ptg displayed a shoulder peak at around 1710 cm 1 and a wide peak at 1384 cm 1 in supplementary fig s17 which belonged to the co stretching and asymmetric vibrations of carboxyl groups from carboxylate groups in ha long et al 2017 yang et al 2011 that is the ha molecule can be effectively adsorbed on the ptg surface the results clearly demonstrated the function of polymer layer as an effective adsorbent or filter for natural organic and inorganic matters of practical water it has been demonstrated that the ph value of the solution played a non negligible role in the sdz removal and neutral condition was more suitable for the photodegradation process yuan et al 2012 fig 4d presented the highest degradation rate of sdz in neutral environment the degradation rate of sdz gradually decreased with the increase of ph value implying the low efficiency of tio2 based photocatalysts under alkaline condition su et al 2016 xekoukoulotakis et al 2011 there is considerable difference in ph value between deionized water 6 92 and lake water 7 82 it should be mentioned that the addition of representative matters including no3 cl and ha obviously increased the ph value of lake water supplementary table s4 to avoid the effect of ph value we adjusted the deionized water to ph 7 82 after introducing cl no3 or ha and performed the degradation experiments the resulted time dependent degradation curves were located between those in deionized water and lake water with existence of corresponding matter as shown in supplementary fig s18 therefore the decreased sdz degradation rate in practical water relative to deionized water is ascribed to the combined effect of ph value and natural matters even though the difference is less significant over ptg than that over tio2 photocatalyst the excellent anti interference performance in complex water matrices further proved the superiority of the porous ptg composite for removing low concentration pollutants from contaminated practical water 3 5 mechanism of photodegradation and charge transfer the results from the adsorption behavior and photocatalytic reaction demonstrate the positive contribution of high adsorption capacity to the photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants on ptg in general high surface area excellent light adsorption capability and superior separation efficiency of electron hole pairs are beneficial for the performance of photocatalysts xu et al 2017 then further studies on the role of each component in the composite as well as photocatalytic mechanism were conducted the charge separation efficiency was investigated by the photoluminescence pl electrochemical impedance spectra eis and the transient amperometric i t curves in comparison to tio2 the significant quenching in pl signals of tio2 g and ptg suggested that the recombination of the photogenerated e h pairs was effectively suppressed by coupling with graphene owing to its high electron mobility fig 5 a as shown in fig 5b the smaller arc radius represented the lower electron transfer resistance r ct in tio2 g than tio2 and the presence of graphene can facilitate the charge transfer between their interfaces the covalent linkage with polymers effectively improved the electron conductivity and further promoted electron transfer the visible light driven electron transfer can be illustrated by the photocurrent measurement fig 5c the photocurrent signals of tio2 and tio2 g were detected to be relatively weak due to their low visible light response while ptg with visible light adsorption presented an obvious photocurrent response the stronger intensity of the photocurrent signal in ptg demonstrated the generation and efficient separation of the photo induced carriers in such a composite structure as a result the enhanced photodegradation efficiency of the porous ptg can be ascribed to the high adsorption capacity improved visible light adsorption and photo generated charge separation the oxygen activation and generation of reactive oxygen species ros were investigated by the scavenger quenching experiments and the epr technique the edta 2na tertiary butanol t buoh and benzoquinone bq was used as the scavengers of holes h oh radicals and o2 radicals respectively as shown in fig 5d the introduction of edta 2na hardly altered the photocatalytic performance indicating that holes might not participate in the photocatalytic reactions in contrast the sdz degradation was notably inhibited after adding t buoh or bq especially for the presence of bq which manifested that oh and o2 radicals were the predominant active species with an order of o2 oh in the photocatalytic process the negligible role of h implied that these ros are more likely generated by the reduction of oxygen by e rather than the oxidation by h the role of dissolved o2 molecules was studied by the adsorption and photocatalytic experiments under anoxic conditions although o2 cannot be completely isolated from the reaction system due to the exposed gas liquid interface the dissolved o2 amount can be greatly reduced by n2 bubbling as shown in supplementary fig s19 there is no obvious difference in sdz adsorption between n2 and air environment when being irradiated by visible light the sdz degradation over ptg photocatalyst was seriously inhibited by n2 replacement especially at the initial stage supplementary fig s20 combined with trapping experiments the o2 radicals can be identified as the predominant active species in the photocatalytic process long et al 2017 chen et al 2021b the uv vis absorption spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ups were employed to measure the band structure of ptg the energy gaps of pg and tio2 were calculated to be 2 32 ev and 3 22 ev by the tauc plot of uv vis absorption spectra supplementary fig s21 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo energy levels of pg located at 5 34 ev vs vacuum level supplementary fig s22 more negative than the conduction band cb level of tio2 thus the photogenerated electrons on ptg can migrate to the cb of tio2 the good affinity of oxygen molecules with tio2 surface is favorable to activate the dissolved o2 and generate oh and o2 radicals adamek et al 2012 which attack the sdz molecules to induce the degradation the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo 3 00 ev of ptg is less positive than that of oh 1 99 ev vs nhe oh h2o the holes can directly oxide h2o to produce oxygen gas instead of oh wang et al 2019b lyu et al 2018 chen et al 2020 the generation of oh and o2 radicals was verified by the epr technique no dmpo o2 or dmpo oh signals over ptg could be observed under dark conditions while the specific characteristic peaks with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 were found under visible light irradiation fig 5e f xiao et al 2017 wang et al 2019c as expected no peaks can be detected over tio2 g which explains the poor photocatalytic activity towards sdz under visible light combined with the drs data it can be deduced that the ptg also performed as a photosensitizer therefore the role of each component in the composite can be elucidated i e ultrathin pg layer is responsible for the enrichment of sdz and absorption of visible light graphene functions as a conductive carbon skeleton for knitting the polymer layer and improving the charge transfer tio2 provides the catalytic active sites to activate the oxygen molecules and generate oh and o2 radicals for sdz degradation that is the outer layer polymer will not impede the oxygen activation on the tio2 surface due to its ultrathin and porous structure based on the above results the adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism for sdz removal over porous ptg is presented in scheme 1 which highlighted the superiority of the designed composite structure as simultaneously realizing the enhanced pollutant adsorption visible light adsorption and charge separation to further illustrate the photocatalytic degradation pathway of sdz by ptg the mineralization degree and generated intermediates were identified by total organic carbon toc and liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms after 2 h of photocatalytic reaction the total organic carbon toc of sdz solution was only reduced by 13 supplementary fig s23 with time extending to 6 h 30 of the sdz molecules could be completely mineralized the results revealed that the mineralization of sdz was relatively difficult due to the arduous ring opening reactions to small molecules according to the lc ms results in supplementary fig s24 and supplementary table s6 three possible pathways for sdz degradation over ptg were illustrated in fig 6 the first pathway is the hydroxylation at the pyrimidine ring of sulfadiazine by oh attacking to form p1 in accordance with the previous study zhou et al 2020 it is assumed that the hydroxylated product p1 will subsequently decompose to products p2 and p3 through the cleavage of c n bonds in the heterocyclic ring and the breakage of the s n bond respectively meanwhile the amino groups of sdz could also be oxidized by o2 to the generation of product p4 the second pathway song et al 2017 and then decomposed to product p5 by the breakage of the s n bond the product p6 was obtained via the third pathway by the loss of so2 in sdz followed by c n bond cleavage to form an analogue of p3 chen et al 2021b guo et al 2020 the products p3 and p5 as important intermediates were easily attacked by oh to induce a ring opening process to the products p7 p8 and p9 which were obviously observed in supplementary table s6 and responsible for the next mineralization finally these fragments could be oxidized to co2 h2o and inorganic ions such as no3 so4 2 nh4 3 6 universal application the mechanism of adsorption enhanced degradation has been well established for sdz removal on ptg surfaces under visible light taking account of the existence of various pops in the existing water environment we are inclined to explore the universality of ptg besides antibiotics phenols and dyes have been widely used and also detected as typical organic pollutants which can trigger serious health and environmental issues interestingly ptg exhibited a high photocatalytic performance towards 4 cp degradation under full light and visible light irradiation in terms of its higher adsorption ability than that of tio2 or tio2 g supplementary fig s25 as compared in supplementary table s5 the results are superior to the reported values of the popular photocatalysts and their composites supplementary fig s26 showed the high stability of ptg composite for recycling the 4 cp degradation the scavenger quenching tests in supplementary fig s27 presented the little change in degradation efficiency in the presence of edta 2na but obvious inhibition after adding t buoh or bq similar to sdz degradation oh and o2 radicals were the predominant active species with an order of o2 oh for the photodegradation of 4 cp while the holes might not participate in the reactions the negligible role of h implied that the ros is more likely generated via the oxygen activation by electrons rather than the oxidation by holes toc measurements indicated that 60 of 4 cp could be completely mineralized after 4 h of reaction and the mineralization degree increased slowly with the extended time supplementary fig s28 at this time the concentration of cl in the solution increased from 0 001 to 0 0271 mmol l supplementary fig s29 the result indicated that the ring opening reactions occurred accompanied by the dichloride resulting in the easier mineralization of 4 cp than that of sdz yu et al 2019 as for mb molecules they were also hardly adsorbed on tio2 or tio2 g surface and less of them could be decomposed under visible light whereas due to the relatively low surface area and poor visible light absorption of tio2 supplementary fig s30 in comparison most mb molecules could be removed from the solution by ptg reaching a high adsorption capacity of 212 5 mg g in dark all adsorbed mb were almost degraded within 40 min during the subsequent visible light driven photocatalytic reactions by an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism the results demonstrated that ptg has a prospective application in the adsorption and photodegradation of various types of pollutants the excellent performance can be attributed to the following merits of the designed porous ptg composite the high surface area porous structure and aromatic skeleton of polymers provide considerable physical and chemical adsorption sites for organic pollutant adsorption besides the ptg layer with narrow gap energy is beneficial to visible light adsorption graphene with a conductive carbon skeleton can act as a substrate for knitting polymers and improve the charge transfer between ptg and tio2 the good affinity of oxygen molecules with tio2 surface is favorable to activating the dissolved oxygen and producing ros for organic pollutant degradation 4 conclusions for the application of solar driven photocatalysis in water treatment it is highly desired to develop an efficient photocatalyst with a large specific surface area and considerable adsorption capacity in this work the polymer layers were hypercrosslinked on tio2 graphene surface to the formation of porous composite photocatalyst with a high specific surface area of 988 m2 g the role of each component in the composite is elucidated i e ultrathin polymer layer is responsible for the enrichment of sdz and absorption of visible light graphene functions as a conductive carbon skeleton for knitting the polymer layer and improving the charge transfer tio2 provides the catalytic active sites to activate the oxygen molecules and generate oh and o2 radicals for sdz degradation thus the as obtained porous photocatalyst exhibits the enhanced absorption and photodegradation efficiency for the removal of several typical pollutants such as sulfadiazine 4 chlorophenol and methylene blue under visible light via an adsorption enhanced degradation mechanism the excellent adsorption ability of porous photocatalyst also enables it to be effectively applied in the water purification with low concentration pollutants more importantly the porous polymer layer can function as a filter for weakening the interference of tio2 surface with the natural matters from complex water matrices the adsorption and photocatalytic performance of the as obtained porous photocatalyst could be considered as one of the best values among the recently reported results in the removal of organic pollutants lee et al 2018 garcia diaz et al 2020 chen et al 2021b wang et al 2023 xu et al 2020 tian et al 2020 therefore the above findings indicate that the rational design of photocatalyst with the ideal porous surface can be an effective solution for enhancing the adsorptive and photocatalytic performance toward water contaminants removal further developments such as modulating adsorption selectivity of the polymer by molecular design and improving the reactivity of tio2 surface by cocatalysts can make this strategy more promising for practical applications in water treatment and other environmental remediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15321,the active control of urban drainage systems udss is playing an increasingly important role in the world threatened by urban flooding and associated disasters caused by insufficient drainage capacity however little research has recognized the importance of the optimal use of in pipe storage space to address this issue the use of the in pipe storage capacity was optimized in this study a novel approach that is dynamic programming with successive approximation considering the time lag of flow routing dpsa tl was developed to determine the control policies in addition to the commonly used passive rule based control rbc and evolutionary algorithm ea strategies a real life urban catchment considering flooding control and combined sewer overflow cso reduction was used as the case study first of all the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space was tested using the four control strategies in three storm events including a 3 year 2 hour design 46 5 mm a 5 year 2 hour design 56 0 mm and a 7 h historical 152 5 mm storm events results indicate that dpsa tl performed best in all cases without compromising the goal of flooding control it provided 16 5 12 6 and 3 0 reductions in cso volume for the three storm events when compared with the passive strategy due to the limited capacity of in pipe storage the relative improvement diminished as the total rainfall depth increased then control strategies were further applicated to the real time operation dpsa tl was found to be the best alternative for cso control with the cso volume reduced by 14 7 11 4 and 2 5 in the three storm events respectively the findings suggest that the performance of uds can be significantly improved by optimizing the use of in pipe storage capacity and the proposed method is effective in the offline optimization and real time control of udss graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban drainage system active control in pipe storage space dynamic programming combined sewer overflow control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid urbanization and climate change have combined to increase the risk of urban flooding and exacerbate water security issues in metropolitan areas he et al 2021 owolabi et al 2022 wang et al 2021a existing combined sewer systems which drain wastewater and stormwater together and are constructed in many cities of the developed and developing world burian et al 1999 cannot cope with the increasing drainage pressure from 2008 to 2010 more than 60 of 351 surveyed cities in china suffered from urban flooding and approximately 140 cities were flooded at least once per year yan et al 2020 among the available solutions for urban flooding and combined sewer overflow cso control gray and green infrastructure practices are commonly adapted alves et al 2020 dong et al 2017 grabowski et al 2022 joshi et al 2021 seyedashraf et al 2021 more recently advances in sensors wireless communications and data platforms enable a new generation of smart urban drainage systems udss that are coupled with online monitoring and real time adaptive management kerkez et al 2016 instead of increasing the buffer volume or conveyance capacities of udss actively controlling existing drainage infrastructures can enhance the system performance while requiring less capital investment garcia et al 2015 meneses et al 2018 sadler et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2021b reduced urban flooding by more than 20 for varying rainfall events using sluice control rules jean et al 2021 found the integration of the optimization of green and gray infrastructures with real time control rtc to be the best alternative for cso control considering cso volume reduction and capital investment in existing active control cases the control rules are mostly designed to improve the operation efficiency of storage tanks li 2020 sadler et al 2019 pumping stations liu et al 2016 and lakes with flood regulation storage wang et al 2021b a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of maximizing the use of in pipe storage capacity cembrano 2004 demonstrated reduced flooding and cso volumes by considering the penalty term of positive deviations from the sewer design flows in the cost function however the added value of pipe flow regulation was not highlighted in that study although langeveld et al 2013 customized rule based controls rbcs for pipe flow regulation stations to improve the water quality of receiving water the rbc rules can be site specific and their design requires the integration of multiple specific control objectives as well as experience from local stormwater personnel when applied to other udss garcia et al 2015 therefore the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space remains unclear incorporating more actuators such as flow regulation stations into the optimal operation of udss can complex the problems with exponentially expanded searching space and make the true optimization procedure difficult to accomplish in previous studies researchers have promoted the application of evolutionary algorithms eas and other metaheuristics to find the preferred control policies of actuators in udss jean et al 2021 rathnayake 2018 these approaches can be easily implemented in various udss once the control objectives and relevant constraints are determined however the fundamental limitation of metaheuristic solutions is that they are more prone to fall into a local optimum due to the rapidly expanding search space produced by the increase in the number of controlled objects and decision steps maier et al 2019 generally the optimal operation of udss is a multi dimensional and multi stage decision making problem in a number of studies researchers employed dynamic programming dp to solve this type of problem including the design of pipe networks mays and yen 1975 swamee and sharma 2013 water supply scheduling gong and cheng 2018 luna et al 2019 and reservoir operation cheng et al 2021 he et al 2022 wang et al 2021c by decomposing the initial problem into subproblems that are solved sequentially across each decision stage dp can effectively alleviate the curse of dimensionality and produce the theoretically optimal solution labadie 2004 the implementation of dp requires the problems to have markov property e g future states of the process depend only on the present state and does not depend on past history however the flow conditions in udss are complex and exhibit a non negligible time lag effect indicating that when applying dp a high order markov process with a complex state transition equation must be solved which is typically regarded as an impossible task thus there have been no studies in which dp was used to solve the problem of uds control this study aims to investigate the impact of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space with the control policies of pipe flow regulation stations optimized using an improved dp that is dynamic programming with successive approximation considering the time lag of flow routing dpsa tl the problem of multi actuator control is decomposed into several single actuator control problems using sa each of which is solved using dp the time lag effect from flow routing is considered in the objective function more specifically the goals of this study are to assess 1 to what extent system performance can be improved when the use of in pipe storage space is optimized and 2 how effective dpsa tl is compared with the passive rbc and ea control strategies 2 methodology the methodology consists of the model for simulating the dynamics of the uds methods for control policy searching and the model for real time control 1 the swmm model is chosen to represent the real uds the gates of pipe flow regulation stations are simulated using the orifices in swmm 2 four control strategies are designed to determine the control policies of system actuators including the passive rbc dpsa tl and ea strategies 3 the model predictive control mpc approach is developed to obtain the operation trajectory by coupling the process model and optimization method 2 1 urban drainage system modeling the latest version of swmm software epa swmm5 is capable of simulating the rainfall runoff pipe flow and water quality dynamics and has been extensively used for uds operation and design optimizations hamouz and muthanna 2019 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 sanudo et al 2020 the swmm model is chosen for a variety of reasons swmm is freely available and can be easily integrated with optimization methods to improve uds operation and design swmm uses orifices to describe the gates of pipe flow regulation stations an orifice can have either a circular or rectangular shape be located either at the bottom or along the side of the upstream node and have a flap gate to prevent backflow the area of an orifice s opening can be controlled dynamically through user defined control rules this feature can be used to model gate openings and closings rossman and simon 2022 the dynamic wave model was selected from the three alternative flow routing models provided by swmm it produces the most theoretically accurate results and can replicate backwater flow effects caused by downstream flow restrictions and flow regulation through orifices by solving the one dimensional saint venant equations rossman and simon 2022 2 2 control strategies 2 2 1 passive in the passive operation scenario there are no active control rules the orifices are completely open throughout the simulation 2 2 2 rule based control rbc in the rbc scenario the open scales of the orifices are determined by predefined if then rules using real time state variables and therefore the discharges of the pipes and storage units can be controlled this means a simple and quick selection of control actions the logical rules that link controller behaviors and system states can be set based on the characteristics of the system and the experience of local operators this indicates that the rules depend solely on real time system states and do not change during an event for orifices that regulate the pipe flow system performance can be improved by adjusting the orifice openings and closings for example flooding at full pipe segments can be effectively reduced if the flow from upstream pipes is retained however specific rbc rules depend on the catchments and operational objectives which are detailed in the case study section 2 2 3 dynamic programming with successive approximation considering the time lag of flow routing dpsa tl 2 2 3 1 objective function the operation goals of udss are generally concerned with flood control and cso reduction the objective function is expressed as 1 m i n f α i 1 n f t 1 t f l o o d i n g i t δ t β i 1 n c t 1 t c s o i t δ t where f is the objective function nf and nc denote the number of flooding nodes and cso nodes respectively f l o o d i n g i t and c s o i t denote the flooding and cso rate for node i at time t respectively α and β are the weighting factors of the two objectives t is the total number of flow routing steps and δ t is the time interval used for flow routing 2 2 3 2 improved dp that addresses the time lag effect of flow routing dpsa was introduced by bellman and dreyfus 1962 as a modification of the original dp formulation that alleviates the curse of dimensionality and later generalized by larson 1968 during dpsa optimization the multidimensional problem is decomposed into a series of one dimensional problems by optimizing over one state variable at a time with all other state variables remaining at their current values this requires the problem to have the markov property that is given the current state of a process and all the states of history its future state depends only on the current state and has nothing to do with the historical states however the operation of udss consists of the active control of system actuators and flow routing and time lags in flow routing can violate the fundamental requirements of dpsa considering the first order markov process although this problem can be formulated as a higher order markov process it can exponentially increase the dimensionality of the system state which makes the problem difficult to solve similarly this problem exists in the optimal operation of reservoirs mei 2000 introduced an improved progressive optimality algorithm poa that takes the time lag effect into account the original poa is another type of dp algorithm proposed by howson and sancho 1975 the effectiveness of the improved poa was further demonstrated by zhang et al 2015 who integrated the improved poa with successive approximation sa to solve the multi reservoir system operation problem 2 2 3 3 optimization procedure of dpsa tl following a similar optimization procedure to that of zhang et al 2015 shown in fig 1 this study employs sa for dimensionality reduction and dp to optimize the operation trajectory of each system actuator dp is used to replace poa because the simplex method used for solving the sub problems of poa in zhang et al 2015 may introduce unnecessary errors in iterations when a complex urban drainage model is used as the process model specifically the multi orifice optimal control problem is decomposed into m one dimensional subproblems using sa each of the subproblems is subsequently solved by dp keeping the operation trajectory of other orifices unchanged this requires an explicit representation of system decisions and states system decisions can be represented as the orifice opening and system states can be considered as the pipe storage and flooding volume within the orifice control region thus the recursive function of dpsa tl can be expressed as 2 m i n c f i t 1 s i t 1 f i t s i t o i t c f i t s i t 3 f i t s i t o i t α i 1 n f l t t l i f l o o d i n g i t δ t β i 1 n c l t t l i c s o i t δ t where s i t denotes the storage volume within the control region of orifice i at time t o i t denotes the control policy of orifice i at time t c f i t s i t denotes the cumulative flooding and cso volume from the first time period to the current time period time period t f i t s i t o i t denotes the flooding and cso volume of time period t l i denotes the time lag of flow routing impact on system performance which is represented as the time lag of the flow from the current control station to the downstream control station or the system outlet 2 2 4 benchmark optimization algorithm ea to compare dpsa tl and metaheuristics a metaheuristic is used in place of the dpsa tl optimization procedure to find effective control policies of system actuators an ea is selected for policy searching because it has been proven to be successful in other udss control applications maier et al 2014 shishegar et al 2018 this type of algorithm draws on the evolution selection and elimination mechanisms of organisms in nature an ea first produces a population in which each individual indicates a control policy then evolves and eliminates continuously to improve the fitness of the individuals from one generation to the next and finally produces excellent individuals who can survive in a harsh natural environment i e a feasible solution with a large fitness score or conversely a low cost the ea is implemented with the deap which is a python framework for flexibly configuring eas fortin et al 2012 the required parameters include the number of individuals in the initial population cross over rate mutation rate and stopping criteria the number of individuals is set to five times the total number of policies the cross over rate and mutation rate are set to 0 5 and 0 2 respectively and a generation of 15 is used as the stopping criteria 2 3 real time operation model mpc was commonly used for the real time operation of udss mpc uses the rolling rainfall forecasts to inform the operation of udss and the workflow is as follows 1 updating model states at time t with the most recent rainfall observations 2 feeding rainfall forecasts to the process model epa swmm5 and determining the optimal control trajectory in the control horizon t t m m refers to the number of control time steps using an optimization method 3 implementing controls for the decision period t 1 in this way controls can be obtained before they need to be implemented as long as the optimization time of each step is less than the control time step itself especially the orifices of the control stations were set to be completely open for the first time period 4 moving to the next time period and repeating steps 1 3 until the time comes to the end of the operation 3 case study and data yueyang is the second largest city in hunan province in south china and is located along the bank of dongting lake which is the third largest lake in china the central area of yueyang is dominated by a combined sewer system and has suffered from serious cso pollution in recent decades thus the system capacity has been expanded in recent years with newly built sewer pipes and storage tanks in this context effective strategies for maximizing the use of existing drainage infrastructures are in demand the uds shown in fig 2 is preliminarily designed for a 3 year return period and covers a 204 ha area including 28 subcatchments 276 conduits 272 junctions and one storage tank with a capacity of 20 000 m3 the inlet of the storage tank is regulated by an orifice whereas the water in the storage tank is directly pumped to the wastewater treatment plant the pumping station has a capacity of 20 000 m3 d and is designed to work on both dry days and wet days when the storage tank reaches its maximum water level or the flow rate exceeds the inflow capacity of the inlet of the storage tank the wastewater is discharged straight into the river via the cso path indicating that cso occurred three in sewer control stations are planned for the study area to improve the usage of the pipe storage capacity in this context synchronous control strategies for these control stations can be designed to mitigate the influence of urban flooding and cso the study area is divided into four regions with regions 2 4 controlled by c1 c3 the pipe flow in region 1 is not controlled because the pipe diameters in this region are relatively small additionally the operation of the pump is close to its capacity in dry weather and there is little spare capacity to allow the pump to be optimally used in wet weather therefore control strategies are only implemented for c1 c3 in the rbc scenario the openings of the orifices are set to 1 when no cso occurs and 0 when two criteria are satisfied 1 the upper conduit of the orifice is not at full capacity and 2 the cso drains directly to the receiving water in the dpsa tl scenario the weighting factors α and β in eq 1 are set to 1 and 0 05 respectively the input of the swmm model shown in fig s1 compromises two chicago pattern design storms one has a 2 h duration and 3 year return period and the other has a 2 h duration and 5 year return period a historical storm event on july 9 2020 was also used as the input which has a 7 h duration the total depths of the three storm events are 46 5 mm 56 0 mm and 152 5 mm respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space 4 1 1 overall performance table 1 compares the cso and flooding volumes of the drainage system in the passive rbc ea and dpsa tl control strategies and three rainfall events the control time step is set to 15 min and the outflow from each of the three control stations has a different time lag effect which is detailed in tab s1 a sensitive analysis of the hyper parameters in ea optimization based on the 3 year 2 hour storm event is also provided in fig s2 no flow measurements are available for directly calibrating the swmm model the accuracy of the model was assessed by considering the model performance under some special conditions table 1 shows that little flooding can be obtained in the 3 year 2 hour storm event indicating that the drainage capacity of the system coincides with its designed capacity furthermore flooding occurs in the simulation results of the 5 year 2 hour and historical storm events actual flooding was also reported on july 9 2020 for the 3 year 2 hour design storm event the rbc rules provide a 7 2 reduction in cso volume while the ea performs 6 6 better than the rbc strategy dpsa tl performs best among the four control strategies with the cso volume reduced by 16 6 compared with the passive scenario however as the total amount of precipitation increased the percentage improvements provided by implementing controls to control stations decreased the rbc ea and dpsa tl strategies respectively reduced the cso volume in the 5 year 2 hour design storm event by 5 3 7 9 and 12 6 while having little effect on flood volume similar results were obtained for the observed storm event on july 9 2020 the cso volume was reduced by 0 8 1 7 and 3 0 for the rbc ea and dpsa tl strategies respectively and the changes in flood volume were small 4 1 2 analysis of in pipe storage space use fig 3 maps the maximum node depths and conduit capacities under the 3 year 2 hour design storm event with control policies applied to pipe flow regulation stations both the node depth and conduit capacity significantly increased compared with those with the passive scenario specifically fig 4 shows the box plots of the maximum node depth and conduit capacity for control regions 1 4 separately the maximum node depths within regions 1 and 2 change slightly for region 1 no actuator directly regulates its pipe flow and the junction depths can be only influenced by the change of the hydraulic head downstream in region 2 pipe flow prefers to be discharged to avoid flooding at the node at high depth as shown in fig 4a however the maximum node depths within regions 3 and 4 obtain higher values when control strategies are implemented with the highest values provided by the dpsa tl scenario this means that more water is retained in the pipes when cso occurs and can be discharged as cso decreases in terms of the maximum pipe capacity significant increases can be observed when control strategies are implemented within regions 2 4 however because water is expected to be discharged sequentially from different regions and finally pumped to the wastewater treatment plant changes in capacity vary from region to region when the control method varies as indicated in fig 4b in all control strategies the preference is to make full use of the in pipe storage capacity of region 3 with priority the rbc and ea strategies have opposite priority orders for discharging the water in regions 2 and 4 additionally the dpsa tl scenario demonstrates the optimal use of in pipe storage capacity with the conduit capacity in regions 2 4 reaching higher values 4 1 3 impact of control time step on dpsa tl and ea given the benefits of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space illustrated above the effectiveness of dpsa tl and the ea is compared under varying control time steps for the 3 year 2 hour design storm event fig 5 shows the cost value for control time steps of 5 min 10 min 15 min and 20 min the parameter control time step is important in practice because the details of system dynamics cannot be captured when a coarse time step is used whereas a fine time step requires a longer optimization time intuitively the finer the time step of orifice control the lower the system flooding volume as evidenced by the results of dpsa tl a 6 5 reduction in cost value from 2 376 to 2 221 is observed when the control time step decreases from 20 min to 5 min however the results of the ea provide reverse monotonicity with the mean cost value for ten duplicate runs increasing from 2 414 to 2 679 when the control time step decreases from 20 min to 5 min it becomes more difficult for ea to identify the optimal solution from a larger search space as the time step gets smaller and the number of decision variables grows correspondingly specifically for a two hours simulation there are 72 decision variables to optimize when the control time step is 5 min and 18 when the control time step is 20 min therefore dpsa tl could be a better choice for searching for effective and reliable control policies 4 2 application of dpsa tl in real time control dpsa tl was further tested in real time control based on the mpc approach fig 6 depicts the results of real time control applications with the best results from ten ea optimizations displayed the computations were performed on a personal computer with an intel core i5 12 400 cpu the mean time required for finding the optimal controls of each control time step set to 15 min was 8 2 and 10 5 min for ea and dpsa tl respectively this indicates that the computing power of the personal computer can meet the requirement for real time applications the first column of fig 6 shows the overall performances of the four control strategies in different storm events it can be observed that both ea and dpsa tl strategies outperformed the passive and rbc strategies compared with ea dpsa tl further reduced the cso volume by 890 m3 1010 m3 and 1090 m3 for the 3 year 2 hour and 5 year 2 hour design storm events as well as the observed storm event on july 9 2020 respectively the second column of fig 6 shows the time series flow rate of cso in the 3 year 2 hour and 5 year 2 hour design storm events ea and dpsa tl provided significantly lower flow rates of cso than the other two control strategies and dpsa tl provided lower flow rates on both sides of the peak flow but slightly higher flow rates of cso at the peak segments than ea however in the historical storm event the improvements provided by optimizing the use of in pipe storage capacity were not significant compared with the design storm events this is because the drainage pipes were full for the majority of the time during such a heavy storm event with high rainfall intensity and long rainfall duration 5 conclusions flooding controls and cso regulations require not only the expansion of buffer volumes or conveyance capacities of udss but also effective control policies for existing drainage infrastructures to improve system performance with pipe flow regulation measures an improved dp algorithm dpsa tl was introduced to optimize actuator control in the system this approach is applicable to any uds that requires active control and can be easily implemented once the control objectives and constraints are determined the proposed approach was demonstrated for two applications evaluating the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space and implementation in real time operation both applications are based on three storm events including a 3 year 2 hour design storm event 46 5 mm a 5 year 2 hour design storm event 54 0 mm and a 7 h storm event on july 9 2020 152 5 mm the results demonstrated the following 1 system performance considering flooding control and cso reduction was significantly improved with the application of pipe flow regulations in evaluating the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space the relative improvements considering cso reduction in the 3 year 2 hour design storm event were the highest which range from 7 2 to 16 6 depending on the control strategies the reduced cso volumes in the 5 year 2 hour design storm event and observed storm event varied from 5 3 to 12 6 and 0 8 to 3 0 respectively the flooding volume changed slightly in all cases similar results are obtained in the real time operation in which the largest improvements were reduced by 1 9 1 2 and 0 5 for the three storm events respectively 2 dpsa tl was effective in both potential evaluation and real time operation with better performance than the rbc and ea strategies in the potential evaluation dpsa tl outperformed the ea strategy for various control time steps and offered additional cso reductions of 8 3 7 3 and 2 2 for three different storm events when compared to the rbc strategy respectively dpsa tl was also found to be the best alternative for cso control in real time operation with the cso volume reduced by 14 7 11 4 and 2 5 in the three storm events respectively in this study a novel approach dpsa tl was proposed to maximize the use of in pipe storage capacity and thus improve system performance this can be used to inform the design of real time control rules and pipe networks or it can be directly used for real time operation however this study did not consider the impact of uncertainties including those resulting from observed data rainfall forecasts and the process model

15321,the active control of urban drainage systems udss is playing an increasingly important role in the world threatened by urban flooding and associated disasters caused by insufficient drainage capacity however little research has recognized the importance of the optimal use of in pipe storage space to address this issue the use of the in pipe storage capacity was optimized in this study a novel approach that is dynamic programming with successive approximation considering the time lag of flow routing dpsa tl was developed to determine the control policies in addition to the commonly used passive rule based control rbc and evolutionary algorithm ea strategies a real life urban catchment considering flooding control and combined sewer overflow cso reduction was used as the case study first of all the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space was tested using the four control strategies in three storm events including a 3 year 2 hour design 46 5 mm a 5 year 2 hour design 56 0 mm and a 7 h historical 152 5 mm storm events results indicate that dpsa tl performed best in all cases without compromising the goal of flooding control it provided 16 5 12 6 and 3 0 reductions in cso volume for the three storm events when compared with the passive strategy due to the limited capacity of in pipe storage the relative improvement diminished as the total rainfall depth increased then control strategies were further applicated to the real time operation dpsa tl was found to be the best alternative for cso control with the cso volume reduced by 14 7 11 4 and 2 5 in the three storm events respectively the findings suggest that the performance of uds can be significantly improved by optimizing the use of in pipe storage capacity and the proposed method is effective in the offline optimization and real time control of udss graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban drainage system active control in pipe storage space dynamic programming combined sewer overflow control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid urbanization and climate change have combined to increase the risk of urban flooding and exacerbate water security issues in metropolitan areas he et al 2021 owolabi et al 2022 wang et al 2021a existing combined sewer systems which drain wastewater and stormwater together and are constructed in many cities of the developed and developing world burian et al 1999 cannot cope with the increasing drainage pressure from 2008 to 2010 more than 60 of 351 surveyed cities in china suffered from urban flooding and approximately 140 cities were flooded at least once per year yan et al 2020 among the available solutions for urban flooding and combined sewer overflow cso control gray and green infrastructure practices are commonly adapted alves et al 2020 dong et al 2017 grabowski et al 2022 joshi et al 2021 seyedashraf et al 2021 more recently advances in sensors wireless communications and data platforms enable a new generation of smart urban drainage systems udss that are coupled with online monitoring and real time adaptive management kerkez et al 2016 instead of increasing the buffer volume or conveyance capacities of udss actively controlling existing drainage infrastructures can enhance the system performance while requiring less capital investment garcia et al 2015 meneses et al 2018 sadler et al 2019 for instance wang et al 2021b reduced urban flooding by more than 20 for varying rainfall events using sluice control rules jean et al 2021 found the integration of the optimization of green and gray infrastructures with real time control rtc to be the best alternative for cso control considering cso volume reduction and capital investment in existing active control cases the control rules are mostly designed to improve the operation efficiency of storage tanks li 2020 sadler et al 2019 pumping stations liu et al 2016 and lakes with flood regulation storage wang et al 2021b a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of maximizing the use of in pipe storage capacity cembrano 2004 demonstrated reduced flooding and cso volumes by considering the penalty term of positive deviations from the sewer design flows in the cost function however the added value of pipe flow regulation was not highlighted in that study although langeveld et al 2013 customized rule based controls rbcs for pipe flow regulation stations to improve the water quality of receiving water the rbc rules can be site specific and their design requires the integration of multiple specific control objectives as well as experience from local stormwater personnel when applied to other udss garcia et al 2015 therefore the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space remains unclear incorporating more actuators such as flow regulation stations into the optimal operation of udss can complex the problems with exponentially expanded searching space and make the true optimization procedure difficult to accomplish in previous studies researchers have promoted the application of evolutionary algorithms eas and other metaheuristics to find the preferred control policies of actuators in udss jean et al 2021 rathnayake 2018 these approaches can be easily implemented in various udss once the control objectives and relevant constraints are determined however the fundamental limitation of metaheuristic solutions is that they are more prone to fall into a local optimum due to the rapidly expanding search space produced by the increase in the number of controlled objects and decision steps maier et al 2019 generally the optimal operation of udss is a multi dimensional and multi stage decision making problem in a number of studies researchers employed dynamic programming dp to solve this type of problem including the design of pipe networks mays and yen 1975 swamee and sharma 2013 water supply scheduling gong and cheng 2018 luna et al 2019 and reservoir operation cheng et al 2021 he et al 2022 wang et al 2021c by decomposing the initial problem into subproblems that are solved sequentially across each decision stage dp can effectively alleviate the curse of dimensionality and produce the theoretically optimal solution labadie 2004 the implementation of dp requires the problems to have markov property e g future states of the process depend only on the present state and does not depend on past history however the flow conditions in udss are complex and exhibit a non negligible time lag effect indicating that when applying dp a high order markov process with a complex state transition equation must be solved which is typically regarded as an impossible task thus there have been no studies in which dp was used to solve the problem of uds control this study aims to investigate the impact of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space with the control policies of pipe flow regulation stations optimized using an improved dp that is dynamic programming with successive approximation considering the time lag of flow routing dpsa tl the problem of multi actuator control is decomposed into several single actuator control problems using sa each of which is solved using dp the time lag effect from flow routing is considered in the objective function more specifically the goals of this study are to assess 1 to what extent system performance can be improved when the use of in pipe storage space is optimized and 2 how effective dpsa tl is compared with the passive rbc and ea control strategies 2 methodology the methodology consists of the model for simulating the dynamics of the uds methods for control policy searching and the model for real time control 1 the swmm model is chosen to represent the real uds the gates of pipe flow regulation stations are simulated using the orifices in swmm 2 four control strategies are designed to determine the control policies of system actuators including the passive rbc dpsa tl and ea strategies 3 the model predictive control mpc approach is developed to obtain the operation trajectory by coupling the process model and optimization method 2 1 urban drainage system modeling the latest version of swmm software epa swmm5 is capable of simulating the rainfall runoff pipe flow and water quality dynamics and has been extensively used for uds operation and design optimizations hamouz and muthanna 2019 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 sanudo et al 2020 the swmm model is chosen for a variety of reasons swmm is freely available and can be easily integrated with optimization methods to improve uds operation and design swmm uses orifices to describe the gates of pipe flow regulation stations an orifice can have either a circular or rectangular shape be located either at the bottom or along the side of the upstream node and have a flap gate to prevent backflow the area of an orifice s opening can be controlled dynamically through user defined control rules this feature can be used to model gate openings and closings rossman and simon 2022 the dynamic wave model was selected from the three alternative flow routing models provided by swmm it produces the most theoretically accurate results and can replicate backwater flow effects caused by downstream flow restrictions and flow regulation through orifices by solving the one dimensional saint venant equations rossman and simon 2022 2 2 control strategies 2 2 1 passive in the passive operation scenario there are no active control rules the orifices are completely open throughout the simulation 2 2 2 rule based control rbc in the rbc scenario the open scales of the orifices are determined by predefined if then rules using real time state variables and therefore the discharges of the pipes and storage units can be controlled this means a simple and quick selection of control actions the logical rules that link controller behaviors and system states can be set based on the characteristics of the system and the experience of local operators this indicates that the rules depend solely on real time system states and do not change during an event for orifices that regulate the pipe flow system performance can be improved by adjusting the orifice openings and closings for example flooding at full pipe segments can be effectively reduced if the flow from upstream pipes is retained however specific rbc rules depend on the catchments and operational objectives which are detailed in the case study section 2 2 3 dynamic programming with successive approximation considering the time lag of flow routing dpsa tl 2 2 3 1 objective function the operation goals of udss are generally concerned with flood control and cso reduction the objective function is expressed as 1 m i n f α i 1 n f t 1 t f l o o d i n g i t δ t β i 1 n c t 1 t c s o i t δ t where f is the objective function nf and nc denote the number of flooding nodes and cso nodes respectively f l o o d i n g i t and c s o i t denote the flooding and cso rate for node i at time t respectively α and β are the weighting factors of the two objectives t is the total number of flow routing steps and δ t is the time interval used for flow routing 2 2 3 2 improved dp that addresses the time lag effect of flow routing dpsa was introduced by bellman and dreyfus 1962 as a modification of the original dp formulation that alleviates the curse of dimensionality and later generalized by larson 1968 during dpsa optimization the multidimensional problem is decomposed into a series of one dimensional problems by optimizing over one state variable at a time with all other state variables remaining at their current values this requires the problem to have the markov property that is given the current state of a process and all the states of history its future state depends only on the current state and has nothing to do with the historical states however the operation of udss consists of the active control of system actuators and flow routing and time lags in flow routing can violate the fundamental requirements of dpsa considering the first order markov process although this problem can be formulated as a higher order markov process it can exponentially increase the dimensionality of the system state which makes the problem difficult to solve similarly this problem exists in the optimal operation of reservoirs mei 2000 introduced an improved progressive optimality algorithm poa that takes the time lag effect into account the original poa is another type of dp algorithm proposed by howson and sancho 1975 the effectiveness of the improved poa was further demonstrated by zhang et al 2015 who integrated the improved poa with successive approximation sa to solve the multi reservoir system operation problem 2 2 3 3 optimization procedure of dpsa tl following a similar optimization procedure to that of zhang et al 2015 shown in fig 1 this study employs sa for dimensionality reduction and dp to optimize the operation trajectory of each system actuator dp is used to replace poa because the simplex method used for solving the sub problems of poa in zhang et al 2015 may introduce unnecessary errors in iterations when a complex urban drainage model is used as the process model specifically the multi orifice optimal control problem is decomposed into m one dimensional subproblems using sa each of the subproblems is subsequently solved by dp keeping the operation trajectory of other orifices unchanged this requires an explicit representation of system decisions and states system decisions can be represented as the orifice opening and system states can be considered as the pipe storage and flooding volume within the orifice control region thus the recursive function of dpsa tl can be expressed as 2 m i n c f i t 1 s i t 1 f i t s i t o i t c f i t s i t 3 f i t s i t o i t α i 1 n f l t t l i f l o o d i n g i t δ t β i 1 n c l t t l i c s o i t δ t where s i t denotes the storage volume within the control region of orifice i at time t o i t denotes the control policy of orifice i at time t c f i t s i t denotes the cumulative flooding and cso volume from the first time period to the current time period time period t f i t s i t o i t denotes the flooding and cso volume of time period t l i denotes the time lag of flow routing impact on system performance which is represented as the time lag of the flow from the current control station to the downstream control station or the system outlet 2 2 4 benchmark optimization algorithm ea to compare dpsa tl and metaheuristics a metaheuristic is used in place of the dpsa tl optimization procedure to find effective control policies of system actuators an ea is selected for policy searching because it has been proven to be successful in other udss control applications maier et al 2014 shishegar et al 2018 this type of algorithm draws on the evolution selection and elimination mechanisms of organisms in nature an ea first produces a population in which each individual indicates a control policy then evolves and eliminates continuously to improve the fitness of the individuals from one generation to the next and finally produces excellent individuals who can survive in a harsh natural environment i e a feasible solution with a large fitness score or conversely a low cost the ea is implemented with the deap which is a python framework for flexibly configuring eas fortin et al 2012 the required parameters include the number of individuals in the initial population cross over rate mutation rate and stopping criteria the number of individuals is set to five times the total number of policies the cross over rate and mutation rate are set to 0 5 and 0 2 respectively and a generation of 15 is used as the stopping criteria 2 3 real time operation model mpc was commonly used for the real time operation of udss mpc uses the rolling rainfall forecasts to inform the operation of udss and the workflow is as follows 1 updating model states at time t with the most recent rainfall observations 2 feeding rainfall forecasts to the process model epa swmm5 and determining the optimal control trajectory in the control horizon t t m m refers to the number of control time steps using an optimization method 3 implementing controls for the decision period t 1 in this way controls can be obtained before they need to be implemented as long as the optimization time of each step is less than the control time step itself especially the orifices of the control stations were set to be completely open for the first time period 4 moving to the next time period and repeating steps 1 3 until the time comes to the end of the operation 3 case study and data yueyang is the second largest city in hunan province in south china and is located along the bank of dongting lake which is the third largest lake in china the central area of yueyang is dominated by a combined sewer system and has suffered from serious cso pollution in recent decades thus the system capacity has been expanded in recent years with newly built sewer pipes and storage tanks in this context effective strategies for maximizing the use of existing drainage infrastructures are in demand the uds shown in fig 2 is preliminarily designed for a 3 year return period and covers a 204 ha area including 28 subcatchments 276 conduits 272 junctions and one storage tank with a capacity of 20 000 m3 the inlet of the storage tank is regulated by an orifice whereas the water in the storage tank is directly pumped to the wastewater treatment plant the pumping station has a capacity of 20 000 m3 d and is designed to work on both dry days and wet days when the storage tank reaches its maximum water level or the flow rate exceeds the inflow capacity of the inlet of the storage tank the wastewater is discharged straight into the river via the cso path indicating that cso occurred three in sewer control stations are planned for the study area to improve the usage of the pipe storage capacity in this context synchronous control strategies for these control stations can be designed to mitigate the influence of urban flooding and cso the study area is divided into four regions with regions 2 4 controlled by c1 c3 the pipe flow in region 1 is not controlled because the pipe diameters in this region are relatively small additionally the operation of the pump is close to its capacity in dry weather and there is little spare capacity to allow the pump to be optimally used in wet weather therefore control strategies are only implemented for c1 c3 in the rbc scenario the openings of the orifices are set to 1 when no cso occurs and 0 when two criteria are satisfied 1 the upper conduit of the orifice is not at full capacity and 2 the cso drains directly to the receiving water in the dpsa tl scenario the weighting factors α and β in eq 1 are set to 1 and 0 05 respectively the input of the swmm model shown in fig s1 compromises two chicago pattern design storms one has a 2 h duration and 3 year return period and the other has a 2 h duration and 5 year return period a historical storm event on july 9 2020 was also used as the input which has a 7 h duration the total depths of the three storm events are 46 5 mm 56 0 mm and 152 5 mm respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space 4 1 1 overall performance table 1 compares the cso and flooding volumes of the drainage system in the passive rbc ea and dpsa tl control strategies and three rainfall events the control time step is set to 15 min and the outflow from each of the three control stations has a different time lag effect which is detailed in tab s1 a sensitive analysis of the hyper parameters in ea optimization based on the 3 year 2 hour storm event is also provided in fig s2 no flow measurements are available for directly calibrating the swmm model the accuracy of the model was assessed by considering the model performance under some special conditions table 1 shows that little flooding can be obtained in the 3 year 2 hour storm event indicating that the drainage capacity of the system coincides with its designed capacity furthermore flooding occurs in the simulation results of the 5 year 2 hour and historical storm events actual flooding was also reported on july 9 2020 for the 3 year 2 hour design storm event the rbc rules provide a 7 2 reduction in cso volume while the ea performs 6 6 better than the rbc strategy dpsa tl performs best among the four control strategies with the cso volume reduced by 16 6 compared with the passive scenario however as the total amount of precipitation increased the percentage improvements provided by implementing controls to control stations decreased the rbc ea and dpsa tl strategies respectively reduced the cso volume in the 5 year 2 hour design storm event by 5 3 7 9 and 12 6 while having little effect on flood volume similar results were obtained for the observed storm event on july 9 2020 the cso volume was reduced by 0 8 1 7 and 3 0 for the rbc ea and dpsa tl strategies respectively and the changes in flood volume were small 4 1 2 analysis of in pipe storage space use fig 3 maps the maximum node depths and conduit capacities under the 3 year 2 hour design storm event with control policies applied to pipe flow regulation stations both the node depth and conduit capacity significantly increased compared with those with the passive scenario specifically fig 4 shows the box plots of the maximum node depth and conduit capacity for control regions 1 4 separately the maximum node depths within regions 1 and 2 change slightly for region 1 no actuator directly regulates its pipe flow and the junction depths can be only influenced by the change of the hydraulic head downstream in region 2 pipe flow prefers to be discharged to avoid flooding at the node at high depth as shown in fig 4a however the maximum node depths within regions 3 and 4 obtain higher values when control strategies are implemented with the highest values provided by the dpsa tl scenario this means that more water is retained in the pipes when cso occurs and can be discharged as cso decreases in terms of the maximum pipe capacity significant increases can be observed when control strategies are implemented within regions 2 4 however because water is expected to be discharged sequentially from different regions and finally pumped to the wastewater treatment plant changes in capacity vary from region to region when the control method varies as indicated in fig 4b in all control strategies the preference is to make full use of the in pipe storage capacity of region 3 with priority the rbc and ea strategies have opposite priority orders for discharging the water in regions 2 and 4 additionally the dpsa tl scenario demonstrates the optimal use of in pipe storage capacity with the conduit capacity in regions 2 4 reaching higher values 4 1 3 impact of control time step on dpsa tl and ea given the benefits of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space illustrated above the effectiveness of dpsa tl and the ea is compared under varying control time steps for the 3 year 2 hour design storm event fig 5 shows the cost value for control time steps of 5 min 10 min 15 min and 20 min the parameter control time step is important in practice because the details of system dynamics cannot be captured when a coarse time step is used whereas a fine time step requires a longer optimization time intuitively the finer the time step of orifice control the lower the system flooding volume as evidenced by the results of dpsa tl a 6 5 reduction in cost value from 2 376 to 2 221 is observed when the control time step decreases from 20 min to 5 min however the results of the ea provide reverse monotonicity with the mean cost value for ten duplicate runs increasing from 2 414 to 2 679 when the control time step decreases from 20 min to 5 min it becomes more difficult for ea to identify the optimal solution from a larger search space as the time step gets smaller and the number of decision variables grows correspondingly specifically for a two hours simulation there are 72 decision variables to optimize when the control time step is 5 min and 18 when the control time step is 20 min therefore dpsa tl could be a better choice for searching for effective and reliable control policies 4 2 application of dpsa tl in real time control dpsa tl was further tested in real time control based on the mpc approach fig 6 depicts the results of real time control applications with the best results from ten ea optimizations displayed the computations were performed on a personal computer with an intel core i5 12 400 cpu the mean time required for finding the optimal controls of each control time step set to 15 min was 8 2 and 10 5 min for ea and dpsa tl respectively this indicates that the computing power of the personal computer can meet the requirement for real time applications the first column of fig 6 shows the overall performances of the four control strategies in different storm events it can be observed that both ea and dpsa tl strategies outperformed the passive and rbc strategies compared with ea dpsa tl further reduced the cso volume by 890 m3 1010 m3 and 1090 m3 for the 3 year 2 hour and 5 year 2 hour design storm events as well as the observed storm event on july 9 2020 respectively the second column of fig 6 shows the time series flow rate of cso in the 3 year 2 hour and 5 year 2 hour design storm events ea and dpsa tl provided significantly lower flow rates of cso than the other two control strategies and dpsa tl provided lower flow rates on both sides of the peak flow but slightly higher flow rates of cso at the peak segments than ea however in the historical storm event the improvements provided by optimizing the use of in pipe storage capacity were not significant compared with the design storm events this is because the drainage pipes were full for the majority of the time during such a heavy storm event with high rainfall intensity and long rainfall duration 5 conclusions flooding controls and cso regulations require not only the expansion of buffer volumes or conveyance capacities of udss but also effective control policies for existing drainage infrastructures to improve system performance with pipe flow regulation measures an improved dp algorithm dpsa tl was introduced to optimize actuator control in the system this approach is applicable to any uds that requires active control and can be easily implemented once the control objectives and constraints are determined the proposed approach was demonstrated for two applications evaluating the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space and implementation in real time operation both applications are based on three storm events including a 3 year 2 hour design storm event 46 5 mm a 5 year 2 hour design storm event 54 0 mm and a 7 h storm

regulations in evaluating the potential benefit of maximizing the use of in pipe storage space the relative improvements considering cso reduction in the 3 year 2 hour design storm event were the highest which range from 7 2 to 16 6 depending on the control strategies the reduced cso volumes in the 5 year 2 hour design storm event and observed storm event varied from 5 3 to 12 6 and 0 8 to 3 0 respectively the flooding volume changed slightly in all cases similar results are obtained in the real time operation in which the largest improvements were reduced by 1 9 1 2 and 0 5 for the three storm events respectively 2 dpsa tl was effective in both potential evaluation and real time operation with better performance than the rbc and ea strategies in the potential evaluation dpsa tl outperformed the ea strategy for various control time steps and offered additional cso reductions of 8 3 7 3 and 2 2 for three different storm events when compared to the rbc strategy respectively dpsa tl was also found to be the best alternative for cso control in real time operation with the cso volume reduced by 14 7 11 4 and 2 5 in the three storm events respectively in this study a novel

15322,membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is a promising electrochemical technique for water desalination previous studies have confirrmed the effectiveness of mcdi in removing contaminants from brackish groundwaters especially in remote areas where electricity is scarce however as with other water treatment technologies performance deterioration of the mcdi system still occurs hindering the stability of long term operation herein a machine learning ml modelling framework and various ml models were developed to i investigate the performance deterioration due particularly to insufficient charging discharging of the electrode caused by accumulation of ions and electrode scaling and ii optimise mcdi operating parameters such that the impacts of these deleterious effects on unit performance were minimized the ml models developed in this work exhibited a prediction accuracy of cycle time with average mean absolute percentage error mape values of 16 82 and 16 09 after 30 fold

predicts that approximately half the world s population will be living in areas experiencing high water stress by 2030 due to the depletion of freshwater resources caused by ongoing climate change and population growth united nations 2022 deemed to be a promising solution to freshwater shortage problems water desalination technologies have been widely used at both coastal and inland locations of the thermal distillation and pressure electro driven membrane desalination techniques capacitive deionization cdi has been suggested to be a particularly suitable technique for certain applications in view of its low operational cost and low water rejection ahmed et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 subramani and jacangelo 2015 cdi is an electrochemical desalination method that involves passage of the saline feed stream between stacks of porous carbon based anode cathode pairs with the ions present in the feed stream attracted to and retained in the electrodes of opposite charge thereby enabling production of an atleast partially deionised product stream additional layers of ion exchange membranes iems are typically inserted in front of either one or both electrodes to ensure the selective transport of counterions and prevent co ions from entering the channel space with this cdi variant commonly referred to as membrane capacitive deionization mcdi lee et al 2006 the presence of the iems has been shown to significantly enhance the salt removal and current efficiency compared to the conventional cdi cells without the inclusion of iems kim and choi 2010 sillanpää and shestakova 2017 mcdi requires comparatively low voltage 1 5 volts to charge the electrodes such that they are capable of adsorbing and desorbing ions liu et al 2016 tan et al 2020 with this low applied voltage also ensuring that the occurrence of current consuming faradaic reactions is minimized zhang et al 2018 while the capital and operating cost of mcdi for removal of salt from highly saline feedstreams such as seawater and other concentrated brines is excessive a number of analyses have shown that the technique may be cost effective for desalination of brackish waters of low to medium salinity i e salt concentrations of below 3000 ppm since unlike ro and thermal distillation methods no high pressure pumps or heat sources are required park and lee 2022 porada et al 2013 rabiee et al 2019 yao and ji 2020 zhao et al 2013 additionally pilot scale studies have shown that up to 40 of the consumed energy during electrode charging can be recovered by use of a high efficiency bidirectional direct current to direct current dc dc converter tan et al 2020 in view of the low voltage dc requirement the possibility also exists of powering the unit using photovoltaics with night time operation enabled through use of battery storage tan et al 2018 this option also renders mcdi technology of use in desalinating brackish source waters in remote locations where mains power is not available a typical mcdi cycle operated with constant current consists of four phases a charging phase a standby phase a discharging phase and a second standby phase fig s1 in the supplementary information the cycle commences at the open circuit voltage reached at the termination of the standby stage indicated as standby 2 in fig s1 at the end of discharging in the previous cycle a voltage jump occurs when charging current is applied the voltage then increases monotonically to 1 4 v where the charging stage ends followed by another standby stage standby 1 in fig s1 where no current is applied the discharging stage commences with a voltage drop occurring at the instant the discharge current is applied the voltage subsequently decreases slowly to 0 v as the discharging stage progresses and is followed by the second standby stage during which the brine stream is flushed from the system he et al 2021 performance deterioration is one of the key issues restricting continuous mcdi operation with this deterioration reflected by a reduction in cycle time and eventually a reduced capacity for salt removal and decreased water recovery a major cause of performance deterioration is the accumulation of ions in the electrodes and the precipitation of inorganic salts on the electrodes and or the ion exchange membranes shim et al 2021 both the trapped ions and any salt precipitates will occupy part of the adsorption capacity of the electrode severely shortening the duration of the charging discharging cycle as water production water recovery salt removal and other performance indicators of the mcdi system are susceptible to change in the cycle time the performance stability of the mcdi operation will be compromised while the occurrence of faradaic reactions is minimized by operation at applied voltages 1 4 v some oxidation of the porous carbon electrodes may occur leading to alteration in pore structure localised ph fluctuations and eventual mcdi performance decline cohen et al 2013 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 this decline however is expected to be relatively gradual with electrode lifetimes of five or more years expected compared with this longer term electrode ageing process the accumulation of ions and deposits in the electrodes and on the membranes is more critical to performance but should be relatively easily managed by optimising charging discharging conditions and implementing occasional clean in place cip procedures using mild cleaning solutions mcnair et al 2021 mossad and zou 2013 yao and tang 2017 zhang et al 2013 scope exists to optimise charging and discharging conditions and cip protocols through the use of mathematical models that are capable of capturing the dynamic variation of electrode performance during long term operation the existing mcdi performance models can be summarised into two groups as follows 1 mechanistic models describing the concentration changes and potential distribution in the mcdi processes due to ion transport behaviour biesheuvel et al 2011 honarparvar et al 2019 porada et al 2012 and 2 numerical parameterized models projecting the unit cost of water production ideal salt removal performance water recovery and energy consumption at different operating conditions bales et al 2021 hand et al 2019 wang and lin 2019 these models however rarely consider the effects of ion accumulation and or formation of precipitates within the electrode modules on the performance deterioration of the electrodes despite the fact that these factors are now recognized to be related to the long term performance decay of mcdi electrode modules yoon et al 2022 the exclusion of these issues in performance models is perhaps not surprising given the difficulty of predicting the long term impacts of scale formation and variation of operating and maintenance protocols including chemical cleaning on full scale mcdi systems that are operated under real world conditions insights into ion accumulation and salt precipitation are typically gained from experimental data sets of lab scale systems which may not be consistent with the actual ion accumulation and salt precipitation behaviours in the field even more challenging there are drastically diverse and continuously changing operational parameters such as flow rate and feed concentration that affect mcdi performance which markedly escalates the complexity of the modelling process in comparison with traditional modelling tools that depend largely on prior knowledge and assumptions of ideal system conditions machine learning ml has particular advantages in handling nonlinear data and revealing intricate mechanisms underlying the efficacy of water treatment processes including membrane distillation md behnam et al 2022 dudchenko and mauter 2020 mittal et al 2021 ray et al 2022 reverse osmosis ro barello et al 2014 choi et al 2020 karimanzira and rauschenbach 2021 libotean et al 2009 and m cdi saffarimiandoab et al 2021a 2021b son et al 2021 ml leverages the latest advances in computerized techniques to solve complex dynamic problems and is particularly proficient at reviewing large volumes of data which is defined as training data to discover the specific patterns hidden within millions of historical data points zhou et al 2017 ml algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning and unsupervised learning supervised learning requires predetermined input and output attributes prior to the training phase whereas unsupervised learning trains the model to find hidden structure in unlabelled data alloghani et al 2020 kotsiantis 2007 given the differences in learning approaches supervised learning is believed to be more suitable for classification and regression problems existing in water treatment plants such as forecasting of future operational data and trends of the ml regression models used in water engineering systems deep learning dl and ensemble learning el are the two main ml methods that are commonly applied to handle nonlinear regression analysis huang et al 2021 li et al 2021 niu et al 2022 one of the advantages of dl is its ability to learn from massive volumes of data and to promote faster learning with limited need for preliminary feature selections features input variables which are deemed particularly necessary in solving water related problems as the procured data are often captured in real time via in situ sensors and involve multiple parameters najafabadi et al 2015 similarly el is reported to have stronger model generalization ability thereby avoiding overfitting of the training data with any single contributing model thereby enhancing model performance in predicting unseen data huang et al 2009 sagi and rokach 2018 despite the increasing popularity in applying ml to environmental science and engineering ese problems the majority of research to date has focused on applying ml to provide performance analyses of lab scale systems very little published research has focussed on the long term performance of pilot full scale systems or dealt with the optimization of process control parameters furthermore previous ml models in the ese field commonly neglected the model validation or model interpretation steps that are essential in ensuring that the prediction results are in accordance with the fundamental principles of the underpinning technology and able to provide valuable feedback to the real world operation of that particular technology zhong et al 2021 therefore in this study we developed a detailed ml modelling framework including model development model validation and model interpretation that we consider appropriate to tackling real world ese problems this ml framework is specifically tailored for the mcdi water treatment system and has the particular objectives of 1 predicting the cycle time for long term plant scale mcdi operation 2 providing suggestions on when cip procedures need to be conducted on site and 3 optimising mcdi process control parameters to maximize the production capacity when the performance decline cannot be fully mitigated importantly the ml framework described here has been developed and validated using data from a pilot scale prototype mcdi unit operating under real world conditions for an extended period of time nine months 2 material and methods 2 1 prototype mcdi plant the prototype mcdi unit was deployed at a remote community in central australia approximately 400 km north of alice springs where the only accessible water source is brackish groundwater containing major ions and other contaminants including nitrate fluoride and uranium that are above the safety thresholds suggested by the australian drinking water guidelines adwg national health and medical research council 2011 a nine month field trial from oct 2021 to jul 2022 was undertaken to investigate the mcdi performance on reducing total dissolved solids tds or electrical conductivity ec of brackish groundwater for both domestic and agricultural water demands and the impacts of different operating parameters on performance of contaminant removal and water production the pilot unit which was housed in a standard 20 ft shipping container was composed of a feed pump two cartridge filters eight commercial mcdi electrode modules voltea is module each of which contained 408 electrode pairs a product water tank a product water pump a chemical gas cleaning system an energy recovery system and various monitoring sensors figs s2 s3 and s4 the electrode modules were arranged both hydraulically and electrically in parallel and water pumped through these modules using variable speed pumps at a flow rate of around 2 m3 h the treated stream was initially stored in a production water tank and then pumped into an elevated tank outside the unit to supply potable water to the local community mains supply was used to charge batteries that powered the unit at this location though the mcdi system could be powered by photovoltaics alone or a mix of photovoltaics and mains supply if set up appropriately a bidirectional dc dc convertor was attached to each electrode module to supply the power required for the charging of the electrodes within that module and to recover around 30 of the energy used in the charging process with this energy returned to the battery bank during the electrode discharging process electrode modules solenoid valves and pumps could be controlled either in manual mode or auto mode through a siemens simatic s7 200 smart programmable logic controller plc in auto mode operation of electrodes 2 to 8 is perfectly synchronized with that of the electrode 1 to ensure all the electrodes are charged discharged and produce desalinated hypersaline streams at the same time a remote operation interface and an operational digital twin of the unit were also developed to facilitate remote data logging and teleoperation lian et al 2022 2 2 data collection 62 mcdi parameters of the auto mode operation including time flowrate conductivity readings electrode current and voltage readings charging board digit indicating the status of the electrode and equipment status digit were continuously captured at a time interval of one second for the development of the ml model table s1 it should be noted that 1 s delay in data logging was occasionally observed due to the latency of data transmission and response latency of plcs cip procedures were implemented in february 2022 and may 2022 to recover the treatment performance of the unit the total number of data points collected for data processing of the ml model were 2411 082 55 of data points captured before the first cip and 35 of data points captured between the first cip and the second cip and 10 of data points captured after the second cip including 876 543 data points recorded during the charging period 1006 327 data points recorded during the discharging period and 528 212 data points recorded during the stand by periods 2 3 data pre processing and feature selection fig 1 describes the workflow of the data processing and the aforementioned data collection procedure cycle number average cycle flowrate feed conductivity effluent conductivity conductivity change average and individual charging discharging current cycle time charging discharging time and electrode voltage were extracted directly from the raw data set using a python script current efficiency production brine volume production brine rate and water recovery wr were obtained from the raw data set through data pre processing characterization section s4 in the supplementary information data pre processing also included some other system information that was not reflected in the raw data set however may have impacts on mcdi operation such as cip procedures interruption of operation and frequency of changes in current settings all the parameters pre processed in this study are summarised in table 1 to select the training and test features variables for the machine learning models kendall s tau correlation coefficient was computed to assess the nonlinear dependence between the ordinal level pre processed parameters the τ coefficient which ranges from 1 to 1 can be expressed as chok 2010 kendall 1938 puka 2011 1 τ 1 n n 1 2 i j sgn x i x j sgn y i y j where 2 s g n x i x

when x i x j and y i y j has the opposite sign x i x j or y i y j is disregarded in the τ calculation of conventional kendell s measure the closer τ is to 1 the stronger one parameter is positively or reversely correlated with the other parameter two parameters are otherwise independent of each other if τ approaches 0 2 4 ml modelling algorithms and approaches in this study the mcdi system was operated continuously for more than 119 days with more than 10 h on including 4 h on the standby mode after each day s operation to recover the electrode performance and less than 14 h off per day two types of performance deterioration of the mcdi unit were observed during this long term operation the first type occurred when the number of prolonged mcdi operations increased due to the scaling of the electrode by inorganic salts and the second type was often observed during the first few cycles of each prolonged mcdi operation which could be attributed to the accumulation of ions in the micropores of the electrodes the first kind of performance deterioration can be solved through the occasional cip while the second type of performance deterioration cannot be fully mitigated based on our lab experiment the latter performance deterioration could be possibly solved by discharging the electrode to negative voltages hence three categories of ml models were developed for different purposes as listed in the introduction section to facilitate the long term mcdi operation the first kind of ml model was based on the multilayer perceptron mlp and the random forest rf algorithms to predict the cycle time thereby providing an overall indicator of the long term mcdi performance under different operating conditions the second ml model was a rf model that predicted the change in water production between different prolonged operations to provide cip recommendations and help address the second type of performance deterioration issue finally another ml model also based on the rf algorithm was used to optimise the process control parameters of the mcdi system such that the performance of the system can be maintained at certain required level as long as possible before the electrodes were forced into the standby mode which typically lasted for several hours to recover the performance mlp and rf are the representative algorithms of dl and el respectively we selected mlp and rf in this study as most literature utilized these two algorithms to model membrane fouling predict the performance of membrane based water treatment system and assist the characterization analysis of system parameters huang et al 2021 niu et al 2022 while mlp models may show more accurate prediction results than rf models they are prone to the problems of overfitting and data imbalance in the original mcdi data set therefore we used mlp and rf for the first type of ml model in which prediction accuracy is the most important and rf for the second and third type of ml models where model generalization on unseen data is given more attention 2 4 1 multilayer perceptron mlp modelling process for prediciton of long term cycle time mlp is the most widely utilized artificial neural network in ml applications and it is composed of more than three layers of neuron like processing units an input layer an output layer and one or more intermediate hidden layers the specific number of hidden layers in the mlp is case dependant and needs to be determined through experimentation it has been suggested that mlp models with two or more hidden layers usually perform better than those with one layer and can result in more stable approximations for nonlinear systems chester 1990 sontag 1991 thomas et al 2017 considering the data complexity of the mcdi system a five layer mlp structure was used in this study matched with the number of model features input variables and labels output variables the input and output layer have eleven neurons and one neuron respectively three hidden layers consist of 256 128 and 64 neurons respectively three additional dropout layers each with a dropout rate of 10 were also employed to prevent the overfitting in the model training through bypassing arbitrarily selected neurons the mlp models in this study were developed using an open source python library called keras as illustrated in fig 2 for any given path from the ith input neuron in the input or hidden layer l 1 to the jth neuron in the layer l the output of the jth neuron unit a j l is determined by each layer s activation function ϕ l which indicates whether a neuron should be activated and pass its signal output to the neurons in the next layer a j l is dependant on the inputs x i l 1 the path weight w j i l and the bias of the jth unit b j l the weights allow the adjustment of the signal strength output values between the neurons in different layers and the biases allow the ϕ l to shift back and forth during iterations of model training to fit the training data set han et al 2018 the general mathematical representation of a single node output a j l in a mlp model is given by grosse 2019 3 a j l ϕ l j w ji l x i l 1 b j l in the learning process of the mlp model the weights are updated after each training iteration through the gradient value which may gradually diminish when the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to the current weights becomes too small basodi et al 2020 to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem exponential linear unit elu and rectified linear unit relu were chosen as the activation functions as their derivative of the positive part is permanently equal to one on the contrary derivatives of other activation functions such as tanh and sigmoid are contractive universally the elu and relu activation function is given by clevert et al 2015 4 f x x i f x 0 α exp x 1 i f x 0 where α 0 for relu and α 1 for elu a grid search algorithm was implemented to tune the hyperparameters whose values control the learning process of the mlp model the loss function optimizer batch size and epoch size were set to be mean absolute error mae function sgd 25 batches and 35 epochs based on the tuning results section s5 in the supplementary information mae is defined as 5 m a e 100 n i 1 n y i y i where y i represents the observed values from the operational data set y i represents the predicted values and n represents the total number of paired observed values and predicted values 2 4 2 rf modelling process for long term mcdi performance prediction and operating parameter optimization rf is an ensemble ml algorithm of tree predictors designed for both classification tasks and regression tasks as shown in fig 3 the rf regressor randomly splits the observations from the original data set to generate a bootstrap sample utilizing approximately 63 2 of the original sample the remaining unchosen observations form a subset of out of bag oob data each tree of the rf is constructed based on the corresponding bootstrap sample for a particular tree predictor the mse function normally acts as a criterion to control the splitting of each internal node and contribute to the prediction of individual tree the average of predictions across all the trees are computed through the bootstrap aggregation bagging to generate an accurate prediction breiman 2001 couronné et al 2018 schonlau and zou 2020 rf regression models in this study were developed through the ml library scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 based on the grid search with cross validation section s5 in the supplementary information hyperparameters of the rf regressor including the number of trees in the forest minimum number of samples required to split an internal node minimum number of samples left at a leaf node and the number of features to consider when looking for the best fit were tuned to be 300 2 4 40 2 5 model evaluation and validation although coefficient of determination r 2 was prevalently used in many research publications to evaluate the performance of nonlinear ml models developed for the water treatment application choi et al 2020 saffarimiandoab et al 2021b son et al 2021 wang et al 2021 a recent study warned that r 2 is inappropriate as an indicator for the evaluation of the nonlinear models and advised r 2 measure should be supplemented with other methods to quantify the validity of the nonlinear model fitting spiess and neumeyer 2010 to avoid leading to an over optimistic evaluation of performance the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean squared error rmse were employed as metrics to demonstrate the performance of the ml models with these defined as 6 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i y i and n have the same representations as in eq 5 several existing ml applications to desalination systems favour the hold out validation the conventional training validation test splitting approach to evaluation of model performance choi et al 2020 son et al 2021 which if used may lead to the problems listed below 1 the model provides a good fitting on the training and or validation data but fails to provide a similar prediction error rate of the test data set because of the different sample variabilities across the training validation and test data sets in this case it will be inaccurate to use either the prediction error or the average of these prediction errors for model evaluation and 2 as incomplete observations are used for training and testing processes of the ml models the prediction error of the entire model will usually be overestimated which may be inadequate to generate an unbiased performance evaluation of the overall ml model in consequence a k fold cross validation kfcv approach was selected in evaluation of the ml prediction models in our study regardless of its intensive computational demands a limited number of samples was used every time in order to provide a more conservative and less biased estimate of the ml models performance in general as illustrated in fig 4 the original data set is evenly split into k subsets or folds in kfcv k 30 was used in this study such that data points captured after the second cip were not all assigned into one subset for the nth iteration the nth subset separated from the original data set is utilized as the testing set with the remaining n 1 subsets used as the training set k different models generated from the kfcv are trained individually and make predictions based on features of their own testing subset by averaging the mape of all the testing subsets an evaluation indicator of the overall model is then obtained besides changes in water production of two different operation scenarios were predicted using the ml model with different values of input parameters as listed in table 2 the ml model delivered cip recommendations to the operators according to the prediction results the performance of the ml model was validated by comparison with the expected cip demands of the real mcdi pilot plant to validate the performance of the optimization model of the process control parameters the mcdi unit was operated under four different scenarios as listed in table 3 for simplicity the applied electrical current and influent flowrate were adjusted twice in scn1 with the guidance of the parameter combinations recommended by the ml model which split one prolonged operation of 37 cycles into three stages denoted as stg 1 stg 2 and stg 3 in comparison the respective process control parameters for the other three operational scenarios remained constant and were similar to the parameter settings applied at each stage of scn 1 the targeted values of conductivity change water productionand water recovery were set to be 750 μs cm 11 l min and 0 8 respectively process control parameters of other electrodes synced with electrode 1 were adjusted prior to the model validation such that the charging discharging efficiency of all the electrodes were identical to ensure the performance of each of the electrodes were close to one another it should be noted that the operational data used to validate the optimization model is not included in the original data set 2 6 ml model interpretation and the model variable importance vimp analysis to determine the contribution of each input feature of mcdi processes to the output labels i e cycle time in the performance prediction model and charging discharging current and flowrate in the operating parameter optimization model a variable importance vimp analysis was also performed on the developed rf models in this study vimp analysis plays an important role in providing insights into the fundamental black box mechanism of the ml model 2 6 1 gini importance and permutation based importance one of the significant advantages of the rf model is that the importance of variables can be easily evaluated when making regression predictions li et al 2021 as summarised by chen and ishwaran chen and ishwaran 2012 node impurity indices and permutation based importance parameters are the most common measures to evaluate the vimp gini index one of the typical node impurity indices reveals the vimp of the rf model via calculating the decrease in node impurity weighted by the probability of reaching that node then averaging the importance over all the nodes of each tree in the forest breiman 2001 menze et al 2009 gini importance which although it has been widely adopted with rf is nevertheless misleading for model features with high cardinality i e a data attribute that has many possible values gómez ramírez et al 2020 louppe et al 2013 since most of the attributes in mcdi ml models have thousands of distinct values the gini importance measure will be unsuitable for providing the intrinsic vimp results unlike the gini index that uses in sample impurity the other permutation based importance measure also called as breiman cutler importance overcomes the limitation of the former measure without producing a bias towards high cardinality attributes and was adopted in this study it randomly permutes the given variable s in the oob data that is left from the bootstrap sample n and defines the vimp i n s by comparing the prediction error of the model without s in the bootstrap sample to the prediction error of the original model breiman 2001 1996 8 i n s p e model without s p e o r i g i n a l m o d e l in a rf regression model with y y as the response and x x as the features eq 8 can be written as lu et al 2021 9 i n s ν 1 ϑ ν i ϑ ν l y i μ t x i s θ ν 1 ϑ ν i ϑ ν l y i μ t x i θ ν where ϑ ν denotes the oob data of the ν th bootstrap sample μ t x θ ν represents the ν th random tree predictor generated from the related bootstrap sample for the unknown function μ 0 x with a prechosen loss function l y μ x i s represents x when the s coordinate of the feature is randomly permuted and θ ν ν 1 v is the random quantities to grow the ν th tree 2 6 2 shapley additive explanation shap apart from permutation based feature importance another supplementary measure using shapley additive explanation shap values was also assigned in this study to strengthen the reliability and effectiveness of the results of vimp analysis one advantage of the shap value is its ability to describe how the model prediction will change based on the value changes in model features it provides both global and local interpretability of the black box ml models however its computational complexity grows dramatically as the number of model features increases aas et al 2021 the shap value is derived from the game theoretically optimal shapley value which delivers a justified method for payoff allocation amongst members of a coalition in the ml models the subset of the feature values represents the coalition and the prediction of the subset represents the coalition s payoff shap values can hence be specified as 10 g z ϕ 0 i 1 m ϕ i z i where m is the maximum subset size of the feature values ϕ i is the shapley value of a feature i and z ϵ 0 1 m is the simplified features with 1 or 0 indicating whether a ml model feature is present or absent when computing the shapley value 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation matrix and feature selection results fig 5 a highlights the correlation coefficients of all the alternative parameters for the prediction model of the long term mcdi performance cy cyc ecout vl0 vf4 and tcy are negatively correlated with a τ coefficient of 0 46 0 49 0 23 0 29 and 0 50 respectively conversely ec λavg and vf8 positively correlate with tcy to a high level with a respective τ coefficients of 0 26 0 27 and 0 71 the remaining parameters and tcy are correlated to a very limited extent 0 15 τ 0 15 since λavg vl0 vf4 and vf8 cannot be directly obtained from the real time data from the mcdi control system even if their τ coefficients with tcy are comparatively high these parameters were not included in the prediction model ic and idc were also not included in the model since the operation of all the electrodes were perfectly synced and their correlations with tcy were relatively low based on the correlation matrix and our fundamental understanding of the principles of electrochemistry both parameters with high τ coefficient cy cyc λavg and ec and those that will impact the mcdi performance from an electrochemical perspective cip p qavg ic 1 and idc 1 were selected as the input attributes of the long term performance ml model tcy was the output attribute of this ml model that was used as an indicator of overall mcdi performance p cy qavg ecin ic 1 and idc 1 were selected as the features of the ml model that could be used for providing recommendations on frequency of cip as these parameters directly influenced the water production of the mcdi system fig 5b shows the correlation coefficients of all the optional parameters for the optimization model of the mcdi operating parameters cip and ecout show strong negative correlations with qavg ic 1 and idc 1 τ 0 68 and 0 3 ec and qprod are strongly correlated with qavg ic 1 and idc 1 τ 0 42 and 0 62 cy cyc and wr show relatively weak correlations with qavg ic 1 and idc 1 with respective τ coefficients varying between 0 06 and 0 15 therefore cip ecout ec qprod were contained in the feature list cy and wr were also selected as model features in view of their practical impacts on mcdi operation qavg ic 1 and idc 1 were the labels of the optimization ml model 3 2 model prediction and evaluation results 3 2 1 ml models for prediction of cycle time the prediction results of the mcdi cycle time using the mlp and rf models are presented in figs s5 to s6 in the supplementary information apart from the original observations and the point predictions of the long term mcdi cycle time the 90 prediction interval i e 5 to 95 percentiles of the distribution of the predicted responses in the nodes leaves of each tree model of the rf model was also included to show the underlying distribution of the predicted response values and to provide an indication of the confidence with which the rf model predicted a single cycle time value the error rate of the model predictions obtained from kfcv is reported in table 4 the overall mape and rmse of the mlp model are 0 73 and 1 72 s lower than those of the rf model to be specific the mlp model made more accurate predictions for the first 15 folds that included operational data before the first cip however the rf model performed better in predicting most of the data after the first cip folds 16 to 30 it is partially for this reason that the rf approach was used in this study for the later performance prediction model to support the cip practice and the optimization model of the mcdi process control parameters the predictions of the cycle time between folds 11 and 15 16 and 20 and 26 and 30 exhibited a relatively high error rate since cip and associated drastic changes in the charging discharging current occurred within the time interval covered by these folds the results from both mlp and rf cycle time prediction models matched the actual trial data with an acceptable margin of error suggesting that the ml approach can be used to effectively construct a prediction model for the long term mcdi performance although the operation conditions and source water quality are complex and constantly changing in this particular plant scale application although it is unknown whether the same trained model can show similar performance for other mcdi units with similar operating conditions the ml modelling framework is applicable for other mcdi applications of different scales through retraining the model 3 2 3 ml model for prediction of water production to support cip practice table 5 lists the average mape and rmse of the rf model for prediction of water production of each cycle obtained from the 30 fold kfcv the developed water production prediction model shows a total average mape of 4 05 and a total average rmse of 0 691 l min changes in water production of the mcdi pilot unit can be used to indicate the cip demands the water production prediction of the first cycle of each prelonged mcdi operation each day i e water production prediction for each different p and the change in water production compared to the first cycle after the first chemical cleaning are shown in fig 6 prediction values of the water production of the first mcdi cycle hovered around a fixed value over the initial 15 to 20 periods of the prolonged operation 11 29 0 17 l min for the low current scenario and 13 11 0 06 l min for the high current scenario between the 20th and 30th period water production of the first cycle decreased by around 3 17 and 2 14 respectively compared to the that of the first period after 30 operation periods the change in water production dropped from 5 19 to 5 72 for the low current scenario and from 6 39 to 7 04 for the high current scenario based on the prediction results dramatic performance deterioration can be seen after the 36th period of these two scenarios which suggested the need for implementation of cip operators conducted the second cip based on the operational data at the 46th period in the real world operation which is in consistence with the ml model prediction results however as the original pilot trial was aimed at investigating the feasibility of groundwater treatment by mcdi and how different process control parameters will impact the mcdi performance process control parameters such as flow rate and applied electrical current that would impact the flow rate were changed frequently between the first and the second cip hence whether the water production under long term mcdi operation in the pilot plant will follow this stable first and then sharply decreased water production pattern remains unknown additional mcdi performance data with fixed feed flow rate and applied current settings will be collected to investigate the water production behaviour and to improve the performance of the water production prediction model so that it can be used to provide more reliable cip recommendations to the plant operator 3 2 4 ml model for optimization of operating parameters fig 7 shows the cycle time water production water recovery and conductivity change under fixed process control parameter settings scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 and optimised operating parameter settings according to the ml model scn 1 to achieve the production targets ec 750 μs cm qprod 11 l min and wr 0 8 the operating parameter settings of scn 2 to scn 4 were similar to the operating parameter settings used at three stages of scn 1 respectively as illustrated in fig 7a to fig 7c an obvious increase in mcdi performance can be observed between stg 1 and stg 2 for scn 1 cycle time water production and water recovery of scn 1 in stg 2 and stg 3 were predominantly higher than those of scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 in stg 2 and stg 3 on par with the steadily decreasing trend of the cycle time for scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 water production and water recovery of these three scenarios also shows a decreasing trend fig 7d shows the conductivity change of four different operation scenarios compared to the decreasing trend shown in cycle time water production and water recovery changes in the differences between feed conductivity and effluent conductivity fluctuated considerably however it still can be seen that the adjustment of applied electrical current and flow rate would cause a transient boost in capacity of conductivity change for scn1 between stg 1 and stg 2 two other sharp rises followed by drops in conductivity change can also be observed for scn 2 and scn 4 which was caused by the sudden change in feed conditions section s7 in the supplementary information fig 8 shows the conductivity change water production and water recovery values of four operational scenarios normalised to their targeted values ec 750 μs cm qprod 11 l min and wr 0 8 that were set as the input attribute values of the optimization model water production and water recovery of scn 1 were significantly higher than those of other operational scenarios the average water production and water recovery of scn 1 across three stages were 4 1 and 0 7 higher than their targeted values water production at 11 l min and water recovery at 0 8 which was the only operation scenario to achieve both targeted water production and water recovery in the model validation for comparison to scn 1 with normalized ratio of 1 041 the average water production normalized to the targeted value of scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 decreased in order from 1 023 to 0 996 similarly the average water recovery normalized to its targeted value also decreased in order from 0 978 to 0 920 for scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 average value changes in mcdi performance normalized to their targets of each stage are shown in fig 9 the water production and water recovery in stg 2 of scn 1 showed a reasonable increase by 4 7 and 6 1 compared to their respective stg 1 counterparts even though the water production and water recovery of stg 3 only increased by 2 2 and 2 3 due to the performance deterioration the performance of the mcdi system in these two stages was still above the targeted values of water production 11 l min and water recovery 0 8 inversely the results showed different levels of decrease in water production and water recovery in both stg 2 and stg 3 for scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 compared to their corresponding mcdi performance in stg 1 the performance including water production and water recovery of scn 2 and stg 3 decreased by 3 2 0 8 and 4 3 0 7 in stg 2 and stg 3 a high ratio of average conductivity change in stg 2 of scn 1 to the targeted value of conductivity reduction demonstrated that the adjustment of process control parameters could temporarily induce a boost in conductivity reduction capacity apart from scn 1 scn 2 was the only scenario in which the conductivity change was close to or slightly above the targeted value of conductivity change hence through changing the process control parameters according to the optimization results of the ml model the mcdi performance could be maintained around or above the targeted value and the performance deterioration could be delayed the developed ml model has a certain level of flexibility and can be used to recommend optimised process control parameters based on different targeted values of conductivity reduction water production and water recovery the generalizability of the model with regard to its application to other targeted production requirements and how the performance of the mcdi unit will change with respect to a much wider range of mcdi production requirements will be investigated further in future studies 3 3 vimp results of ml models and model interpretation since ml models are not using any assumptions of ideal system conditions they are considered to have advantages over mechanistic models and numerical models zhong et al 2021 nevertheless the model results are less transparent as a result of the existence of hidden layers in the mlp model and bootstrap sampling in the rf model to help overcome this lack of transparency vimp coefficients of the model features were analysed to potentially clarify the causal relationships underlying the apparent black box nature of the ml models fig 10 show the results of permutation based vimp coefficients the higher the coefficient the more significant was the contribution of this feature to the relative ml model outputs as illustrated in fig 10a variables of the prediction model could be separated into three groups to distinguish their different impacts on the cycle time the first group included cyc cy and p which had the highest vimp coefficients the variables in the second group exhibited vimp coefficients ranging from 0 11 to 0 25 including qavg ec ic 1 and idc 1 other remaining variables in the third group including cip ecout had weak impacts vimp coefficient 0 025 on the cycle time cyc contributed the most to the total cycle time in the ml model with a vimp coefficient of 3 32 cy was the second most important feature to the prediction model revealing that the mcdi cycle time varied significantly when the number of cycles with the same current settings increased total cycle time also showed large variations when there were changes in p vimp coefficient 0 53 and as such it could be inferred that mcdi performance gradually deteriorated as the unit operation continues every day without performing any cip the extremely low vimp coefficient 0 0005 of cip demonstrated that cip which indicated different chemical cleaning practices had low impacts on the cycle time itwas highly likely that cip managed to restore the performance of mcdi electrodes to relatively high level as the model produced the similar prediction values when only the cip was changed fig 10b shows the vimp coefficients of the ml model for optimization of process control parameters qprod contributed the most to the model outputs i e the charging discharging current of the electrode and the overall feed flow rate with a coefficient value of 1 308 cip exhibited a vimp coefficient of 0 416 and was ranked as the second most important amongst the other variables wr ec cy and ecout had limited impacts on the model outputs with their respective coefficients ranging from 0 038 to 0 119 to probe how the value increase or decrease on model features would impact the predictions of model labels shap values were also adopted in the vimp analysis fig 11 a outlines the distribution of the impacts of each feature on the output of the cycle time prediction model using the shap values variables on the y axis are listed in order of importance the sum of shap value magnitudes from top to bottom each dot on the chart represents one data point from the data set the colour of these dots varies from blue to red with the increase on the values of a feature in accord with the permutation based importance plot in fig 10 cyc and cy are still the most important features in the shap analysis higher values of cyc and p led to lower cycle time which indicates that both increase in number of cycles within one period of prolonged operation and increase in number of operation periods between two cip processes would exacerbate the performance degradation lower values of discharging current and charging current i e idc 1 and ic 1 would result in longer cycle time inversely increase in the value of ec led to lower cycle time in general no straightforward impact on the cycle time can be observed in fig 11a when qavg changed fig 11b shows the impacts of each feature on the ic 1 idc 1 and qavg from top to bottom in the optimization model of the mcdi operating parameters similar to the results of the permutation based vimp analysis qprod and cip contributed the most to the optimized process control parameters of the ml model in real operation the applied electrical current and feed flow rate for the mcdi unit showed a trend of fluctuating downward as the trial proceeded due to the particular water quality requirements of the product water which corresponds to the even distribution of cip shap values higher values of qprod would lead to higher values of charging discharging current of electrode 1 and average feed flowrate inversely to achieve higher wr the applied electrical current would need to be reduced as suggested by the ml model this agrees with literature reports that increase in the applied electrical current will lead to higher ohmic resistance and larger voltage jump before the charging phase and as a result the production volume and the wr of the mcdi electrodes will drop rosentreter et al 2021 3 4 challenges in model development and implementation although the developed ml models showed relatively satisfactory performance and the feature importance analysis successfully unveiled the nature of the black box ml models there are still a number of hurdles remaining in model development and implementation processes 1 flexibility as ml models are extremely dependant on massive amounts of data to learn and generate patterns for regressive predictions on unseen model inputs future system modification e g increase in number of electrode modules in the mcdi desalination system or drastic changes in system environment e g treatment of brackish water from other sources locations which may lead to variations in parameter weights and patterns will cause the potential collapse of pre trained model during implementation the pre trained ml models prevent new knowledge from being added to the existing base and a retraining of the ml model will be required to improve the flexibility of the developed ml models afaq et al 2021 recently the concept of continual learning has been proposed and can be used to overcome the catastrophic forgetting effect that causes ml models to lose already derived parameter patterns after re training on new data sets pfülb 2022 2 computation model training hyperparameter tuning and model interpretation require large amounts of computating power and time computing requirements will grow exponentially as the complexity and the size of data sets increase much more powerful computer processing unit and memory are needed so that ml models can be rapidly developed and implemented for large scale applications 3 human intervention in this present work data pre processing and model evaluation still involve some level of manual operation and intervention a user friendly interface for ml models that enables anyone to access them from anywhere has not been developed as yet with this limitation restricting the ability to demonstrate that ml models can be used to facilitate smart decision making without human intervention in the future we will integrate ml into ar vr enabled digital twins to potentially address this issue 4 conclusions a ml modelling framework for optimization of the operation and performance of a pilot scale mcdi unit has been presented in this study with the analysis ranging from model development to model validation and interpretation of results obtained from the field trial of the pilot scale mcdi unit the insights gained from this study may be of particular assistance in managing the long term performance deterioration that occurs between different cycles of a prolonged mcdi operation and between each operation day period three types of ml models based on the mlp and or rf algorithms were developed to 1 provide an overall indicator of long term mcdi performance under different operating conditions 2 provide reliable recommendations on cip frequency and 3 optimise the process control parameters of the mcdi system such that the performance of the system can be maximized the developed ml models exhibited an exceptional predictive accuracy of cycle time with an overall mape of 16 82 and 16 09 and rmse of 41 02 s and 39 30 s for rf and mlp models respectively after 30 fold cross validation by changing the features and label of the ml model accordingly the pre trained model was able to predict different deterioration rates of the water production under two different operating conditions and to recommend cip practices that matched with the real cip demands of the mcdi unit a case study on the adjustment of operating parameters using the optimized results derived from the ml model was also presented in this study the model validation results showed that through dynamic adjustment of the process control parameters the overall water production and water recovery of the system exceeds the mcdi system performance using the fixed parameter settings by 1 78 to 4 48 and 2 95 to 9 46 respectively permutation based coefficients and shap coefficients were employed in the vimp analysis to provide insight into causal features underlying the otherwise black box nature of the ml models future work will focus on assessing more advanced dl algorithms such as long short term memory lstm and continual learning through this proposed ml modelling framework to further improve the prediction and optimization accuracy of the ml model longer term mcdi trials will continue to capture more mcdi operational data especially the mcdi performance data under fixed feed flow rate and applied current settings to further verify the correctness of

15322,membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is a promising electrochemical technique for water desalination previous studies have confirrmed the effectiveness of mcdi in removing contaminants from brackish groundwaters especially in remote areas where electricity is scarce however as with other water treatment technologies performance deterioration of the mcdi system still occurs hindering the stability of long term operation herein a machine learning ml modelling framework and various ml models were developed to i investigate the performance deterioration due particularly to insufficient charging discharging of the electrode caused by accumulation of ions and electrode scaling and ii optimise mcdi operating parameters such that the impacts of these deleterious effects on unit performance were minimized the ml models developed in this work exhibited a prediction accuracy of cycle time with average mean absolute percentage error mape values of 16 82 and 16 09 after 30 fold cross validation for random forest rf and multilayer perceptron mlp models respectively the pre trained ml model predicted different declining trends of water production for two different operating conditions and provided corresponding recommendations on frequencies of chemical cleaning a case study on the adjustment of operating parameters using the results suggested by the optimization ml model was conducted the model validation results showed that the overall water production and water recovery of the system using the cycle based optimized process control parameters scn 1 exceeds the mcdi system performance under three fixed parameter settings that were used at each stage of scn 1 by 1 78 to 4 48 and 2 95 to 9 46 respectively permutation based and shapley additive explanation shap

predicts that approximately half the world s population will be living in areas experiencing high water stress by 2030 due to the depletion of freshwater resources caused by ongoing climate change and population growth united nations 2022 deemed to be a promising solution to freshwater shortage problems water desalination technologies have been widely used at both coastal and inland locations of the thermal distillation and pressure electro driven membrane desalination techniques capacitive deionization cdi has been suggested to be a particularly suitable technique for certain applications in view of its low operational cost and low water rejection ahmed et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 subramani and jacangelo 2015 cdi is an electrochemical desalination method that involves passage of the saline feed stream between stacks of porous carbon based anode cathode pairs with the ions present in the feed stream attracted to and retained in the electrodes of opposite charge thereby enabling production of an atleast partially deionised product stream additional layers of ion exchange membranes iems are typically inserted in front of either one or both electrodes to ensure the selective transport of counterions and prevent co ions from entering the channel space with this cdi variant commonly referred to as membrane capacitive deionization mcdi lee et al 2006 the presence of the iems has been shown to significantly enhance the salt removal and current efficiency compared to the conventional cdi cells without the inclusion of iems kim and choi 2010 sillanpää and shestakova 2017 mcdi requires comparatively low voltage 1 5 volts to charge the electrodes such that they are capable of adsorbing and desorbing ions liu et al 2016 tan et al 2020 with this low applied voltage also ensuring that the occurrence of current consuming faradaic reactions is minimized zhang et al 2018 while the capital and operating cost of mcdi for removal of salt from highly saline feedstreams such as seawater and other concentrated brines is excessive a number of analyses have shown that the technique may be cost effective for desalination of brackish waters of low to medium salinity i e salt concentrations of below 3000 ppm since unlike ro and thermal distillation methods no high pressure pumps or heat sources are required park and lee 2022 porada et al 2013 rabiee et al 2019 yao and ji 2020 zhao et al 2013 additionally pilot scale studies have shown that up to 40 of the consumed energy during electrode charging can be recovered by use of a high efficiency bidirectional direct current to direct current dc dc converter tan et al 2020 in view of the low voltage dc requirement the possibility also exists of powering the unit using photovoltaics with night time operation enabled through use of battery storage tan et al 2018 this option also renders mcdi technology of use in desalinating brackish source waters in remote locations where mains power is not available a typical mcdi cycle operated with constant current consists of four phases a charging phase a standby phase a discharging phase and a second standby phase fig s1 in the supplementary information the cycle commences at the open circuit voltage reached at the termination of the standby stage indicated as standby 2 in fig s1 at the end of discharging in the previous cycle a voltage jump occurs when charging current is applied the voltage then increases monotonically to 1 4 v where the charging stage ends followed by another standby stage standby 1 in fig s1 where no current is applied the discharging stage commences with a voltage drop occurring at the instant the discharge current is applied the voltage subsequently decreases slowly to 0 v as the discharging stage progresses and is followed by the second standby stage during which the brine stream is flushed from the system he et al 2021 performance deterioration is one of the key issues restricting continuous mcdi operation with this deterioration reflected by a reduction in cycle time and eventually a reduced capacity for salt removal and decreased water recovery a major cause of performance deterioration is the accumulation of ions in the electrodes and the precipitation of inorganic salts on the electrodes and or the ion exchange membranes shim et al 2021 both the trapped ions and any salt precipitates will occupy part of the adsorption capacity of the electrode severely shortening the duration of the charging discharging cycle as water production water recovery salt removal and other performance indicators of the mcdi system are susceptible to change in the cycle time the performance stability of the mcdi operation will be compromised while the occurrence of faradaic reactions is minimized by operation at applied voltages 1 4 v some oxidation of the porous carbon electrodes may occur leading to alteration in pore structure localised ph fluctuations and eventual mcdi performance decline cohen et al 2013 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 this decline however is expected to be relatively gradual with electrode lifetimes of five or more years expected compared with this longer term electrode ageing process the accumulation of ions and deposits in the electrodes and on the membranes is more critical to performance but should be relatively easily managed by optimising charging discharging conditions and implementing occasional clean in place cip procedures using mild cleaning solutions mcnair et al 2021 mossad and zou 2013 yao and tang 2017 zhang et al 2013 scope exists to optimise charging and discharging conditions and cip protocols through the use of mathematical models that are capable of capturing the dynamic variation of electrode performance during long term operation the existing mcdi performance models can be summarised into two groups as follows 1 mechanistic models describing the concentration changes and potential distribution in the mcdi processes due to ion transport behaviour biesheuvel et al 2011 honarparvar et al 2019 porada et al 2012 and 2 numerical parameterized models projecting the unit cost of water production ideal salt removal performance water recovery and energy consumption at different operating conditions bales et al 2021 hand et al 2019 wang and lin 2019 these models however rarely consider the effects of ion accumulation and or formation of precipitates within the electrode modules on the performance deterioration of the electrodes despite the fact that these factors are now recognized to be related to the long term performance decay of mcdi electrode modules yoon et al 2022 the exclusion of these issues in performance models is perhaps not surprising given the difficulty of predicting the long term impacts of scale formation and variation of operating and maintenance protocols including chemical cleaning on full scale mcdi systems that are operated under real world conditions insights into ion accumulation and salt precipitation are typically gained from experimental data sets of lab scale systems which may not be consistent with the actual ion accumulation and salt precipitation behaviours in the field even more challenging there are drastically diverse and continuously changing operational parameters such as flow rate and feed concentration that affect mcdi performance which markedly escalates the complexity of the modelling process in comparison with traditional modelling tools that depend largely on prior knowledge and assumptions of ideal system conditions machine learning ml has particular advantages in handling nonlinear data and revealing intricate mechanisms underlying the efficacy of water treatment processes including membrane distillation md behnam et al 2022 dudchenko and mauter 2020 mittal et al 2021 ray et al 2022 reverse osmosis ro barello et al 2014 choi et al 2020 karimanzira and rauschenbach 2021 libotean et al 2009 and m cdi saffarimiandoab et al 2021a 2021b son et al 2021 ml leverages the latest advances in computerized techniques to solve complex dynamic problems and is particularly proficient at reviewing large volumes of data which is defined as training data to discover the specific patterns hidden within millions of historical data points zhou et al 2017 ml algorithms can be categorized into supervised learning and unsupervised learning supervised learning requires predetermined input and output attributes prior to the training phase whereas unsupervised learning trains the model to find hidden structure in unlabelled data alloghani et al 2020 kotsiantis 2007 given the differences in learning approaches supervised learning is believed to be more suitable for classification and regression problems existing in water treatment plants such as forecasting of future operational data and trends of the ml regression models used in water engineering systems deep learning dl and ensemble learning el are the two main ml methods that are commonly applied to handle nonlinear regression analysis huang et al 2021 li et al 2021 niu et al 2022 one of the advantages of dl is its ability to learn from massive volumes of data and to promote faster learning with limited need for preliminary feature selections features input variables which are deemed particularly necessary in solving water related problems as the procured data are often captured in real time via in situ sensors and involve multiple parameters najafabadi et al 2015 similarly el is reported to have stronger model generalization ability thereby avoiding overfitting of the training data with any single contributing model thereby enhancing model performance in predicting unseen data huang et al 2009 sagi and rokach 2018 despite the increasing popularity in applying ml to environmental science and engineering ese problems the majority of research to date has focused on applying ml to provide performance analyses of lab scale systems very little published research has focussed on the long term performance of pilot full scale systems or dealt with the optimization of process control parameters furthermore previous ml models in the ese field commonly neglected the model validation or model interpretation steps that are essential in ensuring that the prediction results are in accordance with the fundamental principles of the underpinning technology and able to provide valuable feedback to the real world operation of that particular technology zhong et al 2021 therefore in this study we developed a detailed ml modelling framework including model development model validation and model interpretation that we consider appropriate to tackling real world ese problems this ml framework is specifically tailored for the mcdi water treatment system and has the particular objectives of 1 predicting the cycle time for long term plant scale mcdi operation 2 providing suggestions on when cip procedures need to be conducted on site and 3 optimising mcdi process control parameters to maximize the production capacity when the performance decline cannot be fully mitigated importantly the ml framework described here has been developed and validated using data from a pilot scale prototype mcdi unit operating under real world conditions for an extended period of time nine months 2 material and methods 2 1 prototype mcdi plant the prototype mcdi unit was deployed at a remote community in central australia approximately 400 km north of alice springs where the only accessible water source is brackish groundwater containing major ions and other contaminants including nitrate fluoride and uranium that are above the safety thresholds suggested by the australian drinking water guidelines adwg national health and medical research council 2011 a nine month field trial from oct 2021 to jul 2022 was undertaken to investigate the mcdi performance on reducing total dissolved solids tds or electrical conductivity ec of brackish groundwater for both domestic and agricultural water demands and the impacts of different operating parameters on performance of contaminant removal and water production the pilot unit which was housed in a standard 20 ft shipping container was composed of a feed pump two cartridge filters eight commercial mcdi electrode modules voltea is module each of which contained 408 electrode pairs a product water tank a product water pump a chemical gas cleaning system an energy recovery system and various monitoring sensors figs s2 s3 and s4 the electrode modules were arranged both hydraulically and electrically in parallel and water pumped through these modules using variable speed pumps at a flow rate of around 2 m3 h the treated stream was initially stored in a production water tank and then pumped into an elevated tank outside the unit to supply potable water to the local community mains supply was used to charge batteries that powered the unit at this location though the mcdi system could be powered by photovoltaics alone or a mix of photovoltaics and mains supply if set up appropriately a bidirectional dc dc convertor was attached to each electrode module to supply the power required for the charging of the electrodes within that module and to recover around 30 of the energy used in the charging process with this energy returned to the battery bank during the electrode discharging process electrode modules solenoid valves and pumps could be controlled either in manual mode or auto mode through a siemens simatic s7 200 smart programmable logic controller plc in auto mode operation of electrodes 2 to 8 is perfectly synchronized with that of the electrode 1 to ensure all the electrodes are charged discharged and produce desalinated hypersaline streams at the same time a remote operation interface and an operational digital twin of the unit were also developed to facilitate remote data logging and teleoperation lian et al 2022 2 2 data collection 62 mcdi parameters of the auto mode operation including time flowrate conductivity readings electrode current and voltage readings charging board digit indicating the status of the electrode and equipment status digit were continuously captured at a time interval of one second for the development of the ml model table s1 it should be noted that 1 s delay in data logging was occasionally observed due to the latency of data transmission and response latency of plcs cip procedures were implemented in february 2022 and may 2022 to recover the treatment performance of the unit the total number of data points collected for data processing of the ml model were 2411 082 55 of data points captured before the first cip and 35 of data points captured between the first cip and the second cip and 10 of data points captured after the second cip including 876 543 data points recorded during the charging period 1006 327 data points recorded during the discharging period and 528 212 data points recorded during the stand by periods 2 3 data pre processing and feature selection fig 1 describes the workflow of the data processing and the aforementioned data collection

reversely correlated with the other parameter two parameters are otherwise independent of each other if τ approaches 0 2 4 ml modelling algorithms and approaches in this study the mcdi system was operated continuously for more than 119 days with more than 10 h on including 4 h on the standby mode after each day s operation to recover the electrode performance and less than 14 h off per day two types of performance deterioration of the mcdi unit were observed during this long term operation the first type occurred when the number of prolonged mcdi operations increased due to the scaling of the electrode by inorganic salts and the second type was often observed during the first few cycles of each prolonged mcdi operation which could be attributed to the accumulation of ions in the micropores of the electrodes the first kind of performance deterioration can be solved through the occasional cip while the second type of performance deterioration cannot be fully mitigated based on our lab experiment the latter performance deterioration could be possibly solved by discharging the electrode to negative voltages hence three categories of ml models were developed for different purposes as listed in the introduction section to facilitate the long term mcdi operation the first kind of ml model was based on the multilayer perceptron mlp and the random forest rf algorithms to predict the cycle time thereby providing an overall indicator of the long term mcdi performance under different operating conditions the second ml model was a rf model that predicted the change in water production between different prolonged operations to provide cip recommendations and help address the second type of performance deterioration issue finally another ml model also based on the rf algorithm was used to optimise the process control parameters of the mcdi system such that the performance of the system can be maintained at certain required level as long as possible before the electrodes were forced into the standby mode which typically lasted for several hours to recover the performance mlp and rf are the representative algorithms of dl and el respectively we selected mlp and rf in this study as most literature utilized these two algorithms to model membrane fouling predict the performance of membrane based water treatment system and assist the characterization analysis of system parameters huang et al 2021 niu et al 2022 while mlp models may show more accurate prediction results than rf models they are prone to the problems of overfitting and data imbalance in the original mcdi data set therefore we used mlp and rf for the first type of ml model in which prediction accuracy is the most important and rf for the second and third type of ml models where model generalization on unseen data is given more attention 2 4 1 multilayer perceptron mlp modelling process for prediciton of long term cycle time mlp is the most widely utilized artificial neural network in ml applications and it is composed of more than three layers of neuron like processing units an input layer an output layer and one or more intermediate hidden layers the specific number of hidden layers in the mlp is case dependant and needs to be determined through experimentation it has been suggested that mlp models with two or more hidden layers usually perform better than those with one layer and can result in more stable approximations for nonlinear systems chester 1990 sontag 1991 thomas et al 2017 considering the data complexity of the mcdi system a five layer mlp structure was used in this study matched with the number of model features input variables and labels output variables the input and output layer have eleven neurons and one neuron respectively three hidden layers consist of 256 128 and 64 neurons respectively three additional dropout layers each with a dropout rate of 10 were also employed to prevent the overfitting in the model training through bypassing arbitrarily selected neurons the mlp models in this study were developed using an open source python library called keras as illustrated in fig 2 for any given path from the ith input neuron in the input or hidden layer l 1 to the jth neuron in the layer l the output of the jth neuron unit a j l is determined by each layer s activation function ϕ l which indicates whether a neuron should be activated and pass its signal output to the neurons in the next layer a j l is dependant on the inputs x i l 1 the path weight w j i l and the bias of the jth unit b j l the weights allow the adjustment of the signal strength output values between the neurons in different layers and the biases allow the ϕ l to shift back and forth during iterations of model training to fit the training data set han et al 2018 the general mathematical representation of a single node output a j l in a mlp model is given by grosse 2019 3 a j l ϕ l j w ji l x i l 1 b j l in the learning process of the mlp model the weights are updated after each training iteration through the gradient value which may gradually diminish when the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to the current weights becomes too small basodi et al 2020 to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem exponential linear unit elu and rectified linear unit relu were chosen as the activation functions as their derivative of the positive part is permanently equal to one on the contrary derivatives of other activation functions such as tanh and sigmoid are contractive universally the elu and relu activation function is given by clevert et al 2015 4 f x x i f x 0 α exp x 1 i f x 0 where α 0 for relu and α 1 for elu a grid search algorithm was implemented to tune the hyperparameters whose values control the learning process of the mlp model the loss function optimizer batch size and epoch size were set to be mean absolute error mae function sgd 25 batches and 35 epochs based on the tuning results section s5 in the supplementary information mae is defined as 5 m a e 100 n i 1 n y i y i where y i represents the observed values from the operational data set y i represents the predicted values and n represents the total number of paired observed values and predicted values 2 4 2 rf modelling process for long term mcdi performance prediction and operating parameter optimization rf is an ensemble ml algorithm of tree predictors designed for both classification tasks and regression tasks as shown in fig 3 the rf regressor randomly splits the observations from the original data set to generate a bootstrap sample utilizing approximately 63 2 of the original sample the remaining unchosen observations form a subset of out of bag oob data each tree of the rf is constructed based on the corresponding bootstrap sample for a particular tree predictor the mse function normally acts as a criterion to control the splitting of each internal node and contribute to the prediction of individual tree the average of predictions across all the trees are computed through the bootstrap aggregation bagging to generate an accurate prediction breiman 2001 couronné et al 2018 schonlau and zou 2020 rf regression models in this study were developed through the ml library scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 based on the grid search with cross validation section s5 in the supplementary information hyperparameters of the rf regressor including the number of trees in the forest minimum number of samples required to split an internal node minimum number of samples left at a leaf node and the number of features to consider when looking for the best fit were tuned to be 300 2 4 40 2 5 model evaluation and validation although coefficient of determination r 2 was prevalently used in many research publications to evaluate the performance of nonlinear ml models developed for the water treatment application choi et al 2020 saffarimiandoab et al 2021b son et al 2021 wang et al 2021 a recent study warned that r 2 is inappropriate as an indicator for the evaluation of the nonlinear models and advised r 2 measure should be supplemented with other methods to quantify the validity of the nonlinear model fitting spiess and neumeyer 2010 to avoid leading to an over optimistic evaluation of performance the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean squared error rmse were employed as metrics to demonstrate the performance of the ml models with these defined as 6 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i 7 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i y i and n have the same representations as in eq 5 several existing ml applications to desalination systems favour the hold out validation the conventional training validation test splitting approach to evaluation of model performance choi et al 2020 son et al 2021 which if used may lead to the problems listed below 1 the model provides a good fitting on the training and or validation data but fails to provide a similar prediction error rate of the test data set because of the different sample variabilities across the training validation and test data sets in this case it will be inaccurate to use either the prediction error or the average of these prediction errors for model evaluation and 2 as incomplete observations are used for training and testing processes of the ml models the prediction error of the entire model will usually be overestimated which may be inadequate to generate an unbiased performance evaluation of the overall ml model in consequence a k fold cross validation kfcv approach was selected in evaluation of the ml prediction models in our study regardless of its intensive computational demands a limited number of samples was used every time in order to provide a more conservative and less biased estimate of the ml models performance in general as illustrated in fig 4 the original data set is evenly split into k subsets or folds in kfcv k 30 was used in this study such that data points captured after the second cip were not all assigned into one subset for the nth iteration the nth subset separated from the original data set is utilized as the testing set with the remaining n 1 subsets used as the training set k different models generated from the kfcv are trained individually and make predictions based on features of their own testing subset by averaging the mape of all the testing subsets an evaluation indicator of the overall model is then obtained besides changes in water production of two different operation scenarios were predicted using the ml model with different values of input parameters as listed in table 2 the ml model delivered cip recommendations to the operators according to the prediction results the performance of the ml model was validated by comparison with the expected cip demands of the real mcdi pilot plant to validate the performance of the optimization model of the process control parameters the mcdi unit was operated under four different scenarios as listed in table 3 for simplicity the applied electrical current and influent flowrate were adjusted twice in scn1 with the guidance of the parameter combinations recommended by the ml model which split one prolonged operation of 37 cycles into three stages denoted as stg 1 stg 2 and stg 3 in comparison the respective process control parameters for the other three operational scenarios remained constant and were similar to the parameter settings applied at each stage of scn 1 the targeted values of conductivity change water productionand water recovery were set to be 750 μs cm 11 l min and 0 8 respectively process control parameters of other electrodes synced with electrode 1 were adjusted prior to the model validation such that the charging discharging efficiency of all the electrodes were identical to ensure the performance of each of the electrodes were close to one another it should be noted that the operational data used to validate the optimization model is not included in the original data set 2 6 ml model interpretation and the model variable importance vimp analysis to determine the contribution of each input feature of mcdi processes to the output labels i e cycle time in the performance prediction model and charging discharging current and flowrate in the operating parameter optimization model a variable importance vimp analysis was also performed on the developed rf models in this study vimp analysis plays an important role in providing insights into the fundamental black box mechanism of the ml model 2 6 1 gini importance and permutation based importance one of the significant advantages of the rf model is that the importance of variables can be easily evaluated when making regression predictions li et al 2021 as summarised by chen and ishwaran chen and ishwaran 2012 node impurity indices and permutation based importance parameters are the most common measures to evaluate the vimp gini index one of the typical node impurity indices reveals the vimp of the rf model via calculating the decrease in node impurity weighted by the probability of reaching that node then averaging the importance over all the nodes of each tree in the forest breiman 2001 menze et al 2009 gini importance which although it has been widely adopted with rf is nevertheless misleading for model features with high cardinality i e a data attribute that has many possible values gómez ramírez et al 2020 louppe et al 2013 since most of the attributes in mcdi ml models have thousands of distinct values the gini importance measure will be unsuitable for providing the intrinsic vimp results unlike the gini index that uses in sample impurity the other permutation based importance measure also called as breiman cutler importance overcomes the limitation of the former measure without producing a bias towards high cardinality attributes and was adopted in this study it randomly permutes the given variable s in the oob data that is left from the bootstrap sample n and defines the vimp i n s by comparing the prediction error of the model without s in the bootstrap sample to the prediction error of the original model breiman 2001 1996 8 i n s p e model without s p e o r i g i n a l m o d e l in a rf regression model with y y as the response and x x as the features eq 8 can be written as lu et al 2021 9 i n s ν 1 ϑ ν i ϑ ν l y i μ t x i s θ ν 1 ϑ ν i ϑ ν l y i μ t x i θ ν where ϑ ν denotes the oob data of the ν th bootstrap sample μ t x θ ν represents the ν th random tree predictor generated from the related bootstrap sample for the unknown function μ 0 x with a prechosen loss function l y μ x i s represents x when the s coordinate of the feature is randomly permuted and θ ν ν 1 v is the random quantities to grow the ν th tree 2 6 2 shapley additive explanation shap apart from permutation based feature importance another supplementary measure using shapley additive explanation shap values was also assigned in this study to strengthen the reliability and effectiveness of the results of vimp analysis one advantage of the shap value is its ability to describe how the model prediction will change based on the value changes in model features it provides both global and local interpretability of the black box ml models however its computational complexity grows dramatically as the number of model features increases aas et al 2021 the shap value is derived from the game theoretically optimal shapley value which delivers a justified method for payoff allocation amongst members of a coalition in the ml models the subset of the feature values represents the coalition and the prediction of the subset represents the coalition s payoff shap values can hence be specified as 10 g z ϕ 0 i 1 m ϕ i z i where m is the maximum subset size of the feature values ϕ i is the shapley value of a feature i and z ϵ 0 1 m is the simplified features with 1 or 0 indicating whether a ml model feature is present or absent when computing the shapley value 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation matrix and feature selection results fig 5 a highlights the correlation coefficients of all the alternative parameters for the prediction model of the long term mcdi performance cy cyc ecout vl0 vf4 and tcy are negatively correlated with a τ coefficient of 0 46 0 49 0 23 0 29 and 0 50 respectively conversely ec λavg and vf8 positively correlate with tcy to a high level with a respective τ coefficients of 0 26 0 27 and 0 71 the remaining parameters and tcy are correlated to a very limited extent 0 15 τ 0 15 since λavg vl0 vf4 and vf8 cannot be directly obtained from the real time data from the mcdi control system even if their τ coefficients with tcy are comparatively high these parameters were not included in the prediction model ic and idc were also not included in the model since the operation of all the electrodes were perfectly synced and their correlations with tcy were relatively low based on the correlation matrix and our fundamental understanding of the principles of electrochemistry both parameters with high τ coefficient cy cyc λavg and ec and those that will impact the mcdi performance from an electrochemical perspective cip p qavg ic 1 and idc 1 were selected as the input attributes of the long term performance ml model tcy was the output attribute of this ml model that was used as an indicator of overall mcdi performance p cy qavg ecin ic 1 and idc 1 were selected as the features of the ml model that could be used for providing recommendations on frequency of cip as these parameters directly influenced the water production of the mcdi system fig 5b shows the correlation coefficients of all the optional parameters for the optimization model of the mcdi operating parameters cip and ecout show strong negative correlations with qavg ic 1 and idc 1 τ 0 68 and 0 3 ec and qprod are strongly correlated with qavg ic 1 and idc 1 τ 0 42 and 0 62 cy cyc and wr show relatively weak correlations with qavg ic 1 and idc 1 with respective τ coefficients varying between 0 06 and 0 15 therefore cip ecout ec qprod were contained in the feature list cy and wr were also selected as model features in view of their practical impacts on mcdi operation qavg ic 1 and idc 1 were the labels of the optimization ml model 3 2 model prediction and evaluation results 3 2 1 ml models for prediction of cycle time the prediction results of the mcdi cycle time using the mlp and rf models are presented in figs s5 to s6 in the supplementary information apart from the original observations and the point predictions of the long term mcdi cycle time the 90 prediction interval i e 5 to 95 percentiles of the distribution of the predicted responses in the nodes leaves of each tree model of the rf model was also included to show the underlying distribution of the predicted response values and to provide an indication of the confidence with which the rf model predicted a single cycle time value the error rate of the model predictions obtained from kfcv is reported in table 4 the overall mape and rmse of the mlp model are 0 73 and 1 72 s lower than those of the rf model to be specific the mlp model made more accurate predictions for the first 15 folds that included operational data before the first cip however the rf model performed better in predicting most of the data after the first cip folds 16 to 30 it is partially for this reason that the rf approach was used in this study for the later performance prediction model to support the cip practice and the optimization model of the mcdi process control parameters the predictions of the cycle time between folds 11 and 15 16 and 20 and 26 and 30 exhibited a relatively high error rate since cip and associated drastic changes in the charging discharging current occurred within the time interval covered by these folds the results from both mlp and rf cycle time prediction models matched the actual trial data with an acceptable margin of error suggesting that the ml approach can be used to effectively construct a prediction model for the long term mcdi performance although the operation conditions and source water quality are complex and constantly changing in this particular plant scale application although it is unknown whether the same trained model can show similar performance for other mcdi units with similar operating conditions the ml modelling framework is applicable for other mcdi applications of different scales through retraining the model 3 2 3 ml model for prediction of water production to support cip practice table 5 lists the average mape and rmse of the rf model for prediction of water production of each cycle obtained from the 30 fold kfcv the developed water production prediction model shows a total average mape of 4 05 and a total average rmse of 0 691 l min changes in water production of the mcdi pilot unit can be used to indicate the cip demands the water production prediction of the first cycle of each prelonged mcdi operation each day i e water production prediction for each different p and the change in water production compared to the first cycle after the first chemical cleaning are shown in fig 6 prediction values of the water production of the first mcdi cycle hovered around a fixed value over the initial 15 to 20 periods of the prolonged operation 11 29 0 17 l min for the low current scenario and 13 11 0 06 l min for the high current scenario between the 20th and 30th period water production of the first cycle decreased by around 3 17 and 2 14 respectively compared to the that of the first period after 30 operation periods the change in water production dropped from 5 19 to 5 72 for the low current scenario and from 6 39 to 7 04 for the high current scenario based on the prediction results dramatic performance deterioration can be seen after the 36th period of these two scenarios which suggested the need for implementation of cip operators conducted the second cip based on the operational data at the 46th period in the real world operation which is in consistence with the ml model prediction results however as the original pilot trial was aimed at investigating the feasibility of groundwater treatment by mcdi and how different process control parameters will impact the mcdi performance process control parameters such as flow rate and applied electrical current that would impact the flow rate were changed frequently between the first and the second cip hence whether the water production under long term mcdi operation in the pilot plant will follow this stable first and then sharply decreased water production pattern remains unknown additional mcdi performance data with fixed feed flow rate and applied current settings will be collected to investigate the water production behaviour and to improve the performance of the water production prediction model so that it can be used to provide more reliable cip recommendations to the plant operator 3 2 4 ml model for optimization of operating parameters fig 7 shows the cycle time water production water recovery and conductivity change under fixed process control parameter settings scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 and optimised operating parameter settings according to the ml model scn 1 to achieve the production targets ec 750 μs cm qprod 11 l min and wr 0 8 the operating parameter settings of scn 2 to scn 4 were similar to the operating parameter settings used at three stages of scn 1 respectively as illustrated in fig 7a to fig 7c an obvious increase in mcdi performance can be observed between stg 1 and stg 2 for scn 1 cycle time water production and water recovery of scn 1 in stg 2 and stg 3 were predominantly higher than those of scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 in stg 2 and stg 3 on par with the steadily decreasing trend of the cycle time for scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 water production and water recovery of these three scenarios also shows a decreasing trend fig 7d shows the conductivity change of four different operation scenarios compared to the decreasing trend shown in cycle time water production and water recovery changes in the differences between feed conductivity and effluent conductivity fluctuated considerably however it still can be seen that the adjustment of applied electrical current and flow rate would cause a transient boost in capacity of conductivity change for scn1 between stg 1 and stg 2 two other sharp rises followed by drops in conductivity change can also be observed for scn 2 and scn 4 which was caused by the sudden change in feed conditions section s7 in the supplementary information fig 8 shows the conductivity change water production and water recovery values of four operational scenarios normalised to their targeted values ec 750 μs cm qprod 11 l min and wr 0 8 that were set as the input attribute values of the optimization model water production and water recovery of scn 1 were significantly higher than those of other operational scenarios the average water production and water recovery of scn 1 across three stages were 4 1 and 0 7 higher than their targeted values water production at 11 l min and water recovery at 0 8 which was the only operation scenario to achieve both targeted water production and water recovery in the model validation for comparison to scn 1 with normalized ratio of 1 041 the average water production normalized to the targeted value of scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 decreased in order from 1 023 to 0 996 similarly the average water recovery normalized to its targeted value also decreased in order from 0 978 to 0 920 for scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 average value changes in mcdi performance normalized to their targets of each stage are shown in fig 9 the water production and water recovery in stg 2 of scn 1 showed a reasonable increase by 4 7 and 6 1 compared to their respective stg 1 counterparts even though the water production and water recovery of stg 3 only increased by 2 2 and 2 3 due to the performance deterioration the performance of the mcdi system in these two stages was still above the targeted values of water production 11 l min and water recovery 0 8 inversely the results showed different levels of decrease in water production and water recovery in both stg 2 and stg 3 for scn 2 scn 3 and scn 4 compared to their corresponding mcdi performance in stg 1 the performance including water production and water recovery of scn 2 and stg 3 decreased by 3 2 0 8 and 4 3 0 7 in stg 2 and stg 3 a high ratio of average conductivity change in stg 2 of scn 1 to the targeted value of conductivity reduction demonstrated that the adjustment of process control parameters could temporarily induce a boost in conductivity reduction capacity apart from scn 1 scn 2 was the only scenario in which the conductivity change was close to or slightly above the targeted value of conductivity change hence through changing the process control parameters according to the optimization results of the ml model the mcdi performance could be maintained around or above the targeted value and the performance deterioration could be delayed the developed ml model has a certain level of flexibility and can be used to recommend optimised process control parameters based on different targeted values of conductivity reduction water production and water recovery the generalizability of the model with regard to its application to other targeted production requirements and how the performance of the mcdi unit will change with respect to a much wider range of mcdi production requirements will be investigated further in future studies 3 3 vimp results of ml models and model interpretation since ml models are not using any assumptions of ideal system conditions they are considered to have advantages over mechanistic models and numerical models zhong et al 2021 nevertheless the model results are less transparent as a result of the existence of hidden layers in the mlp model and bootstrap sampling in the rf model to help overcome this lack of transparency vimp coefficients of the model features were analysed to potentially clarify the causal relationships underlying the apparent black box nature of the ml models fig 10 show the results of permutation based vimp coefficients the higher the coefficient the more significant was the contribution of this feature to the relative ml model outputs as illustrated in fig 10a variables of the prediction model could be separated into three groups to distinguish their different impacts on the cycle time the first group included cyc cy and p which had the highest vimp coefficients the variables in the second group exhibited vimp coefficients ranging from 0 11 to 0 25 including qavg ec ic 1 and idc 1 other remaining variables in the third group including cip ecout had weak impacts vimp coefficient 0 025 on the cycle time cyc contributed the most to the total cycle time in the ml model with a vimp coefficient of 3 32 cy was the second most important feature to the prediction model revealing that the mcdi cycle time varied significantly when the number of cycles with the same current settings increased total cycle time also showed large variations when there were changes in p vimp coefficient 0 53 and as such it could be inferred that mcdi performance gradually deteriorated as the unit operation continues every day without performing any cip the extremely low vimp coefficient 0 0005 of cip demonstrated that cip which indicated different chemical cleaning practices had low impacts on the cycle time itwas highly likely that cip managed to restore the performance of mcdi electrodes to relatively high level as the model produced the similar prediction values when only the cip was changed fig 10b shows the vimp coefficients of the ml model for optimization of process control parameters qprod contributed the most to the model outputs i e the charging discharging current of the electrode and the overall feed flow rate with a coefficient value of 1 308 cip exhibited a vimp coefficient of 0 416 and was ranked as the second most important amongst the other variables wr ec cy and ecout had limited impacts on the model outputs with their respective coefficients ranging from 0 038 to 0 119 to probe how the value increase or decrease on model features would impact the predictions of model labels shap values were also adopted in the vimp analysis fig 11 a outlines the distribution of the impacts of each feature on the output of the cycle time prediction model using the shap values variables on the y axis are listed in order of importance the sum of shap value magnitudes from top to bottom each dot on the chart represents one data point from the data set the colour of these dots varies from blue to red with the increase on the values of a feature in accord with the permutation based importance plot in fig 10 cyc and cy are still the most important features in the shap analysis higher values of cyc and p led to lower cycle time which indicates that both increase in number of cycles within one period of prolonged operation and increase in number of operation periods between two cip processes would exacerbate the performance degradation lower values of discharging current and charging current i e idc 1 and ic 1 would result in longer cycle time inversely increase in the value of ec led to lower cycle time in general no straightforward impact on the cycle time can be observed in fig 11a when qavg changed fig 11b shows the impacts of each feature on the ic 1 idc 1 and qavg from top to bottom in the optimization model of the mcdi operating parameters similar to the results of the permutation based vimp analysis qprod and cip contributed the most to the optimized process control parameters of the ml model in real operation the applied electrical current and feed flow rate for the mcdi unit showed a trend of fluctuating downward as the trial proceeded due to the particular water quality requirements of the product water which corresponds to the even distribution of cip shap values higher values of qprod would lead to higher values of charging discharging current of electrode 1 and average feed flowrate inversely to achieve higher wr the applied electrical current would need to be reduced as suggested by the ml model this agrees with literature reports that increase in the applied electrical current will lead to higher ohmic resistance and larger voltage jump before the charging phase and as a result the production volume and the wr of the mcdi electrodes will drop rosentreter et al 2021 3 4 challenges in model development and implementation although the developed ml models showed relatively satisfactory performance and the feature importance analysis successfully unveiled the nature of the black box ml models there are still a number of hurdles remaining in model development and implementation processes 1 flexibility as ml models are extremely dependant on massive amounts of data to learn and generate patterns for regressive predictions on unseen model inputs future system modification e g increase in number of electrode modules in the mcdi desalination system or drastic changes in system environment e g treatment of brackish water from other sources locations which may lead to variations in parameter weights and patterns will cause the potential collapse of pre trained model during implementation the pre trained ml models prevent new knowledge from being added to the existing base and a retraining of the ml model will be required to improve the flexibility of the developed ml models afaq et al 2021 recently the concept of continual learning has been proposed and can be used to overcome the catastrophic forgetting effect that causes ml models to lose already derived parameter patterns after re training on new data sets pfülb 2022 2 computation model training hyperparameter tuning and model interpretation require large amounts of computating power and time computing requirements will grow exponentially as the complexity and the size of data sets increase much more powerful computer processing unit and memory are needed so that ml models can be rapidly developed and implemented for large scale applications 3 human intervention in this present work data pre processing and model evaluation still involve some level of manual operation and intervention a user friendly interface for ml models that enables anyone to access them from anywhere has not been developed as yet with this limitation restricting the ability to demonstrate that ml models can be used to facilitate smart decision making without human intervention in the future we will integrate ml into ar vr enabled digital twins to potentially address this issue 4 conclusions a ml modelling framework for optimization of the operation and performance of a pilot scale mcdi unit has been presented in this study with the analysis ranging from model development to model validation and interpretation of results obtained from the field trial of the pilot scale mcdi unit the insights gained from this study may be of particular assistance in managing the long term performance deterioration that occurs between different cycles of a prolonged mcdi operation and between each operation day period three types of ml models based on the mlp and or rf algorithms were developed to 1 provide an overall indicator of long term mcdi performance under different operating conditions 2 provide reliable recommendations on cip frequency and 3 optimise the process control parameters of the mcdi system such that the performance of the system can be maximized the developed ml models exhibited an exceptional predictive accuracy of cycle time with an overall mape of 16 82 and 16 09 and rmse of 41 02 s and 39 30 s for rf and mlp models respectively after 30 fold cross validation by changing the features and label of the ml model accordingly the pre trained model was able to predict different deterioration rates of the water production under two different operating conditions and to recommend cip practices that matched with the real cip demands of the mcdi unit a case study on the adjustment of operating parameters using the optimized results derived from the ml model was also presented in this study the model validation results showed that through dynamic adjustment of the process control parameters the overall water production and water recovery of the system exceeds the mcdi system performance using the fixed parameter settings by 1 78 to 4 48 and 2 95 to 9 46 respectively permutation based coefficients and shap coefficients were employed in the vimp analysis to provide insight into causal features underlying the otherwise black box nature of the ml models future work will focus on assessing more advanced dl algorithms such as long short term memory lstm and continual learning through this proposed ml modelling framework to further improve the prediction and optimization accuracy of the ml model longer term mcdi trials will continue to capture more mcdi operational data especially the mcdi performance data under fixed feed flow rate and applied current settings to further verify the correctness of the pattern of decreasing water production in plant scale mcdi systems and the effectiveness of the recommended process control parameters by the ml models declaration of competing interest the

phytoplankton and cyanobacteria accounting half of the total doc pool in the ocean thornton 2014 verdugo 2021 in the freshwater environment eps also have high mg g level in sediments singh et al 2021 and hundreds mg l in the water morelle et al 2017 one tenth of the doc pool about 70 pg c is in the form of transparent exopolymer particles which are assembled by eps verdugo et al 2004 eps including their transparent particulate exopolymers are the key components in the aquatic environments as the major components of microgel eps play a central role of the ocean in global carbon cycling verdugo 2021 as typical dom eps was considered to be a kind of dynamic self assembly in the water environment with the interaction similar to multilayer adsorption devarajan et al 2020 kong et al 2021 supramolecular assembly was driven by non covalent intermolecular interacting forces including hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions hydrophobic forces metal coordination van der waals forces and π π stacking lou and yang 2020 different components of eps assembled into a relatively stable supramolecular dynamic associate with a certain regular geometric appearance through non covalent bonds which may change the original inherent properties lehmann et al 2008 this important process contributed to the formation of particles in the aqueous environment notably due to the heterogeneity of eps and weak interactions between supramolecules the assembly mechanism was very sensitive to changes in the self assembly environment piccolo 2001 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a general term for a large complex and ever expanding group of manufactured chemicals williams et al 2022 which have arisen increasing global attention due to their highly persistent to degradation in natural environment and worldwide pollution of various water environments in recent decades muir and miaz 2021 perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos one of the most typical pfass has been detected in various environments worldwide evich et al 2022 sunantha and vasudevan 2016 it has been reported that the concentration of pfos in the water environment generally ranges from dozens of pg l to dozens of μg l kurwadkar et al 2022 and even reaches mg l level in highly polluted areas ahrens 2011 which is far exceeding the health advisory level 70 ng l proposed by united states environmental protection agency epa 2019 the omnipresent of pfos in aquatic environment poses great risk to aquatic organisms and human being due to its chemical stability high bioaccumulation and long range migration properties tu et al 2019 the ubiquitous eps and global pollution of pfos in aquatic environments make them inevitable interaction what is interesting and most important is that the important components in eps such as protein polysaccharide humus and pfos are natural and synthetic surfactant like organic compounds in the environment respectively which have fixed hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in the molecular structure schwichtenberg et al 2020 eps are rich in both polar and nonpolar functional groups on its surface such as hydroxyl carboxyl and phosphate amino groups ding et al 2019 the amphiphilic pfos can be bound to different substances with different hydrophobicity hydrophilicity via supramolecular forces the so3 hydrophilic end in the pfos structure interacts with polar groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and phosphoric acid groups in eps through intermolecular forces such as electrostatic force and hydrogen bond isolating the c f hydrophobic long chain and non polar hydrocarbon chain from the water phase kleber et al 2007 pontoni et al 2021 this interaction may lead to original phase separation between eps components and supramolecular recombination to form eps pfos supramolecular system pletikapić et al 2014 sutton and sposito 2005 however some key scientific questions related to interaction between eps and pfos need to be answered whether pfos of environmental concentrations can trigger supramolecular reassembly of eps or not if so eps and pfos reorganized in what way how do eps and pfos restructured furthermore the eps pfos supramolecular associates may have different physicochemical properties compared to initial intrinsic properties and thus may affect occurrence transformation or degradation of eps the change of the shape size and reorganization structure of supramolecular associates after recombination not only affects the spatial distribution of eps and its related elements c n in the hydrosphere lu et al 2022 but also may affect degradability and photoconversion efficiency of eps to a certain extent dhangar and kumar 2021 and finally influence carbon cycling baltar et al 2016 in addition pfos is highly resistant to physical chemical and biological degradation while eps is generally labile and relatively susceptible to be decomposed when the extremely persistent pfos whose concentration generally ranged from several to hundreds of ng l is assembled with labile eps whether can it exert influence on transformation and photodegradation of eps is unclear this is a critical question to be elucidated because of the huge amount of eps in global aquatic environment and its central role in carbon cycling under global warming background at present despite the importance of self assembly of eps and their interaction with organic pollutants deep understanding of these processes and mechanisms are still highly limited by the availability of nano chemical imaging techniques we have no idea about the reorganization way of eps with pfos and the structures with chemical information at nanometer scale recently the rapidly emerging afm ir atomic force microscopy based infrared spectroscopy technique is a rapidly emerging technique provides an ideal tool to visualize supramolecular assembly at nanoscale since this technique can reliably image the chemical composition with spatial resolution far below conventional optical diffraction limits afm ir simultaneously provide morphology with spatial resolution of afm and nanoscale mappings of infrared spectroscopy in this study interaction between lake eps and pfos of environmental concentrations were investigated by eem fluorescence spectroscopy and ftir spectroscopy and the nano chemical structures of eps pfos associates were further visually probed by afm ir based on these data the supramolecular assembly mechanisms of formation of eps pfos associates were revealed finally the role of pfos of environmental concentrations as a shield against photodegradation of eps was evaluated the findings provide novel insights into the interaction mechanism between pfos and biomolecules as well as its potential effect on the geochemical cycling of biopolymers such as eps in aquatic environments it s of great importance to understand behavior and fate ubiquitous pfos as well as its effects on carbon cycling under the background of global warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm collection and eps extraction biofilm sample was collected from a freshwater lake n30 32 28 47 and e119 56 54 69 near the xiazhu lake wetland park deqing zhejiang

from 14 c to 27 c and the uv index was 11 data were taken from huzhou weather forecast website https lishi tianqi com huzhou index html 2 6 fluorescence quenching titration supramolecular interaction mechanism between eps and pfos was studied by fluorescence quenching titration take 20 ml of diluted eps toc 7 7 mg l in a 25 ml beaker and titrate it with 1 g l of pfos stock solution at 25 c the volume of each drop is 100 μl the fluorescence spectra eem were recorded after the solution was thoroughly mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min the equilibrium time was set as 10 min since fluorescence intensities at peaks varied little after 10 min reaction the solution ph before and after titration was recorded all the titration experiments were triplicated and the mean values were used the fluorescence quenching process can be dynamic quenching which is due to collision between the fluorophore and quencher or static quenching due to the complexation between the fluorophore and the quencher to investigate the binding mechanism between eps and pfos the fluorescence intensity data were fitted with the stern volmer equation zhang et al 2010 f 0 f k s v p f o s 1 k q τ 0 p f o s 1 where f 0 and f represent the fluorescence intensity in absence and presence of quencher respectively k s v is the fluorescence quenching constant k q is the quenching rate constant p f o s is the quencher concentration τ 0 is the average lifetime of the fluorescence in absence of quencher which is taken as 10 8 s 2 7 size exclusion chromatography sec size exclusion chromatography sec separates solutes according to the relative relationship between the pore size of the gel pores and the linear group size of polymer samples which can quickly provide a comprehensive information of the composition of samples in molecular weight mw and simply determine whether the samples are simple or complex mixtures smaller molecules can enter most of the pores in the gel and are strongly retained in the column resulting in slower elution protein molecular weight mw of eps was qualitatively determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an uv detector lc 20a shimadzu japan and a sec column bio sec 5 300å 7 8 300 mm agilent technologies inc us molecular weight was used for qualitative protein analysis which contained protein markers of 1 17 45 150 670 kda

respectively each injection volume was 80 μl eps different mws were classified according to retention time r time mainly divided into r time less than 11 min 11 12 min and greater than 12 min calculate the percentage of contribution for each retention time interval associated with different mw proteins that is peak area of each retention time interval total integral area which was carried out on the origin data analysis software specifically it was to perform area integration processing on the peaks after establishing the baseline 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments in this paper were triplicated and all characterizations of samples were performed thrice the medians and the standard errors of measured values were calculated which performed with excel all the data were exported to the origin r2018 software originlab usa for graph preparation 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoscale chemical mappings of eps fig 1a showed the exemplified infrared spectra of eps and pfos there were typical characteristic peaks belonging to proteins 1646 cm 1 and polysaccharides 1102 cm 1 fig 1b showed the nanoscale chemical mappings of eps no infrared signals at 1258 cm 1 of the f c functional group of pfos were found in the mappings of eps samples it was interesting that eps has spheric multilayer nanostructures with protein polysaccharide segregative phase separation the components containing hydroxyl groups were distributed in clumps due to the ubiquity of hydroxyl groups not limited to polysaccharides and protein macromolecules fig 1c such well ordered nanostructures may be explained by the supramolecular self assembly of biomacromolecules in eps by intermolecular forces in the water relatively hydrophobic biological macromolecules first gathered and polar hydrophilic groups isolated them in the water phase to form stable hydrophobic cores mcswain et al 2005 nagae and yamaguchi 2014 this stable core can be either protein or polysaccharide in terms of molecular structure and properties or the mixture formed by the association of their micro molecules similar to multilayer adsorption glycoproteins proteoglycans were eventually formed through intermolecular interactions especially hydrophobicity lin et al 2014 the relatively loose and unstable kinetic region in the outermost layer of the gel seemed to be the breakthrough for the disintegration of eps supramolecular association 3 2 sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures when pfos of environmental concentrations was introduced pfos was clearly concentrated by eps this result was in consistent with one early study that reported that pfas per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and natural doc dissolved organic carbon were enriched by surface water foams the authors explained that larger organic matter structure and higher concentrations of doc could explain the enrichment of doc and pfas in the foam rather than the water phase schwichtenberg et al 2020 which consistent with our findings what is more interesting and important it was found that the protein polysaccharide segregative eps structure was sandwiched with pfos fig 2 yu et al 2021 the spatial distribution of polysaccharides proteins and hydroxyl containing organic matter was similar to that of the pfos free eps which was mainly due to the similar structure of surfactants qiu et al 2022 unlike strong chemical bonding between eps and other organic pollutants which leaded to changes in the secondary structure of proteins in eps feng et al 2018 eps and pfos were associated by weak physical intermolecular forces yan et al 2021 pfos formed multilayer nano sandwich structures between polysaccharides and proteins based on the amphiphilic interaction which was different from the hydrophobic lipophilicity of traditional persitent organic pollutants the presence of sulfonate functional groups and c f bonds was the underlying reason for characteristic surfactant behavior of pfos and the separation of protein and polysaccharide phases aromatic and amide groups in the protein structure had a favorable adsorption for pfos specifically the aromatic group attracts the f c chain by hydrophobic interaction while the amide group binds to the pfos sulfonic acid group by electrostatic suction yan et al 2021 ribose mannose glucose and glucuronic acid are the main monomeric units of polysaccharides in eps and a large number of hydroxyl groups ether bond polar functional groups and aliphatic non polar chains in their structure dominated cross association with pfos lin et al 2014 vimala et al 2020 previous studies had shown that the removal of target pfas during nanofiltration nf was improved due to the presence of bsa protein or sa polysaccharide and the effect of bsa appeared to be stronger which also supported the formation of this sandwich structure wang et al 2018 3 3 supramolecular interaction mechanism for sandwiched pfos eps structure the pfos sandwiched eps nanostructures could be explained by their supramolecular interaction the amphiphilic pfos has binding capacity for both the non polar and polar functional groups in eps which was a mixture of hydrophobic hydrophilic and amphiphilic components on the one hand the amphiphilic supramolecular structure of eps provided a hydrophobic environment and the ability for electrostatic interactions to drive pfos retention park et al 2020 on the other hand eps supramolecular association was considered to be a dynamic self assembly process and the self assembly mechanism was highly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions as a super surfactant pfos will definitely profoundly affect the eps assembly mechanism from the spatial distribution mappings of eps it was observed that pfos not only existed in the periphery of eps gel but also detected a strong pfos signal between eps components which indicated that pfos led to the phase separation of eps components and undergo molecular co reorganization it can be illustrated that pfos interacted with eps mainly through intermolecular forces van der waals forces hydrophobic interactions hydrogen bonds aromatic ring stacking and other non covalent bonds schmidt and martínez 2018 despite such low bond energy of intermolecular force the interaction will become more relatively stable due to their cooperation and complexity in the system pletikapić et al 2014 based on the chemical structural formula of pfos it was believed that the interaction between pfos and eps was not in the form of strong and firm binding such as intermolecular covalent bonds or complexation reactions but through non covalent bonds intermolecular force eventually forms a dynamic equilibrium and relatively stable supramolecular association this explained the formation of sandwiched eps pfos nanostructures in water environment in order to verify this supramolecular mechanism for formation of pfos eps structure interaction between pfos and eps was examined by ftir and fluorescence spectroscopy 3 3 1 evidences from fluorescence quenching titration fig 3 a showed that eps had two obvious fluorescent groups ex em 280 345 ex em 345 445 representing tryptophan protein and humic acid like substances jacquin et al 2017 respectively although the final pfos concentration in the system was as high as 29 1 mg l which was far more than the concentration of eps after 6 times of equivalent volume titrations there was subtle decrease of fluorescence intensity for tryptophan proteins from 646 to 500 as for the humic acid like substances in the eps its final fluorescence intensity decreased by only 24 fig 3c the quenching process was carried out at room temperature and the solution ph almost unchanged at a constant of about 7 3 the fluorescence quenching constant kq of peaks a and b derived from the stern volmer equation fig s2 were 5 61 1011 and 1 73 1011 respectively the kq values were relatively close to the maximum value of biopolymers and largely much lower than those for interaction between eps and heavy metals or other pollutants with formation of complexes pan et al 2010a implying that the observed fluorescence quenching of eps by pfos occurred through the dynamic quenching which was caused by electron transfer from the excited eps fluorophores to the surface of pfos after their intermolecular collision this means that there was no complex formed between pfos and eps and their interaction was weak 3 3 2 evidences from ftir spectroscopy the ft ir spectra of pfos the eps and their mixture further confirmed this fig 4 it can be seen that the ftir spectrum of the pfos eps mixture was a simple overlap of the ftir spectra of pfos and the eps in other words no new complexes were produced after interaction between pfos and eps based on these results the sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures induced by pfos of environmental concentrations could be explained by the supramolecule theory it should be clear that both pfos and eps conform to the supramolecular properties proposed by the predecessors that was amphiphilicity which drove their self assembly in the aqueous environment ding et al 2008 eps and pfos as synthetic and natural surfactant like organic compounds had a high degree of similarity in structure therefore pfos triggered phase separation and recombination of the original eps supramolecular components this also explained strong signals of pfos detected at the eps periphery and between eps components the proposed model for eps pfos supramolecular nanostructures was described as follows at first the hydrophobic macromolecules converged polar hydrophilic groups wrapped non polar hydrophobic groups to protect the hydrophobic interior from contact with water molecules forming a relatively stable core han et al 2020 this stable core may be a protein or a polysaccharide or a mixture formed by the association of their small molecules verdugo and santschi 2010 in addition it may include pfos sandwiched between its components secondly hydrophilic groups further interacted and polar groups of amphiphilic molecules interacted through ligand exchange hydrogen bonding etc to form relatively stable core complexes kleber et al 2007 thirdly the hydrophobic part exposed to water phase in amphiphilic molecules adsorbed on the core was electrically bonded with non polar groups of other amphiphilic molecules through hydrophobic interaction forming hydrophobic bimolecular region which was again isolated from the water layer iscen and schatz 2017 finally organic molecules adsorbed on hydrophobic bilayers formed an external region or dynamic region which was loosely bound by cation bridges hydrogen bonds and other interactions kotov 2017 based on all above mentioned eps and pfos were spontaneously and sequentially assembled into sandwiched nanostructures 3 4 sandwiched pfos shielded eps against photodegradation we hypothesized that eps was sandwiched with multilayer pfos the latter may act as armor like substance that may shelter eps components from photodegradation due to its highly resistant to physicochemical degradation in order to evaluate whether the sandwiched pfos influence photodegradation of eps variation of concentration of ions and molecular weight of eps during photodegradation in the absence and presence of pfos of environmental concentrations were monitored 3 4 1 evidence from release of ions the complexation of free metals and docs had been extensively studied and considered as a crosslinker during the conversion of doc to poc hjorth and jørgensen 2012 therefore some small molecules and ions would be released when eps components were decomposed and therefore it was reasonable to monitor concentrations of various ions cl nh4 so4 2 and no3 and electric conductivity the comprehensive indicator to indicate eps photodegradation kinetics on the whole concentration of various ions was increased upon light irradiation indicating that the degradation of eps occurred the alkalization of eps solutions ph from 7 25 to around 7 75 illustrated the formation of alkaline secondary products such as urea li et al 2020 fig 5 showed that environmental concentration pfos generally reduced the concentration of released ions cl nh4 so4 2 and no3 during 12h of photodegradation in comparison with the pfos free control specifically concentration of the released cl was reduced by more than 10 mg l and nh4 had a decrease of 0 02 0 05 mg l in the presence of pfos the change of cl concentration showed completely different trends in two types of experimental groups on the one hand the increase of cl concentration was explained by the decomposition of halogen containing organic matter although so4 2 and no3 concentrations increased more for the pfos groups than the control after 3h of irradiation their concentrations were significantly lower for the pfos groups than the control with more irradiation time up to 12h in most cases the increase of so4 2 and no3 implied the degradation of nitrogen and sulfur containing proteins and polysaccharides in a word the presence of pfos caused slower release of ions from eps due to photodegradation compared to the control the increased concentration of ions implies that some organic molecules were decomposed into ions and smaller molecules or some bound ions by the organic matter were released due to their supramolecular disintegration behavior under irradiation li et al 2022 the general decreases in concentration of various ions in the presence of various concentrations of pfos resulted in decreases of electric conductivity these data indicated that pfos of environmental concentrations could exert enough inhibitory effect on photodegradation of eps 3 4 2 evidence from mw data the change of mw of eps during photodegradation further confirmed the sheltering effect of sandwiched pfos on photodegradation of eps fig 6 from the first column in fig 6a the sec chromatogram of the ck group it could be observed that light irradiation promoted conversion of protein macromolecules to micro molecules which indicated disassembly or decomposition of proteins valencia et al 2013 the change of initial mw and composition of pfos group indicated that eps components were sensitive to light irradiation shammi et al 2017 with irradiation time the proportion of low mw components generally showed an increasing trend the preferential photodegradation of high mw fraction led to an increase in the proportion of low mw fraction which was similar to the previously reported photocatalytic degradation of nom from a bog lake tercero espinoza et al 2009 the area of components with mw over 15 min after 12h of light irradiation was 184 63 which were almost negligible from 0 6h on the contrary the area of components with high mw before 11 min decreased from the initial 193 61 to 43 18 at 12h in the presence of pfos of environmental concentrations 5 500 ng l although the changes of mw distribution pattern of eps components showed similar trends to that of the control increases of the proportion of high mw over 15 min with the area of 12 47 12 01 15 59 for 5 50 500 ng l pfos treated groups respectively were much less than the control area of 184 63 the changes of mw of eps during light irradiation clearly showed that the presence of pfos of environmental concentrations significantly inhibited photodegradation because of the sandwiched pfos eps structure 3 4 3 mechanism mode for pfos sheltering eps from photodegradation the light exposure experiments in this study were carried out under natural radiation and testing the uv visible uv vis and uv diffuse reflectance uv visdrs spectra of pfos were helpful for understanding the underlying mechanism of its photo effect on eps the light shielding effect of eps against photodegradation could be attributed to the optical properties and persistence of pfos molecules and the pfos sandwiched eps nanostructures firstly fig 7 showed the uv vis absorption spectrum and drift reflection spectrum of pfos in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm which covered the visible 400 760 nm and the invisible ultraviolet 400 nm infrared 760 nm wavelengths the absorption intensity of pfos in the range of 290 800 nm was almost 0 while its diffuse reflection spectrum was characterized by over 90 reflectivity above 400 nm and 62 90 reflectivity in the range of 290 400 nm such optical properties of pfos means that most of the visible light and uv light energy which accounts for 3 to 5 of sunlight chen et al 2007 was reflected this means that pfos plays as a light shield for the organic matter it enclosed secondly the high persistence of pfos to physicochemical degradation which was due to its multiple and extremely strong c f bonds bentel et al 2019 means it can act a robust light shield furthermore adjacent fluorine atoms along the perfluoroalkyl chain could electrostatically and sterically protect carbon carbon bonds from direct radiation kirsch 2013 the almost no absorption and the excellent reflectivity of pfos to solar radiation were the strongest evidences for the above inhibited photodegradation effect which could be simply described as shielding effect of pfos thirdly the protective effect of pfos from eps photodegradation was majorly owing to its supramolecular interaction with eps and formed distinct nanostructures pfos induced phase separation of different eps components through intermolecular forces formed pfos eps sandwich nanostructures with pfos nanolayers inserted between different components of eps therefore the sandwiched pfos multilayers from inside to outside repeatedly blocked solar radiation to eps which finally caused the inhibitory effect on eps photodegradation to summarize the above mechanisms we proposed the light shielding mechanism mode of pfos against photodegradation of eps fig 8 pfos of environmental concentrations was firstly efficiently trapped and concentrated by eps and the latter in turn induced phase separation of different components such as proteins and polysaccharides of the former and formed pfos eps multilayer sandwich structures via spontaneous supramolecular reassembly the pfos microlayers therefore acted as persistent and effective shields against solar irradiation to reach the eps components it enclosed 3 5 implication for global aquatic carbon cycle eps as one of the most important forms of doc in global aquatic environments eps usually occur at mg l in various freshwater and marine environments morelle et al 2018 eps participate in various biogeochemical cycle processes and play critical role in global carbon cycle guidi et al 2016 because of their viscosity hydrophobicity carbon richness and nutrient richness which profoundly affects the circulation of carbon and nitrogen nutrients in water yang et al 2020 without regard to the soluble eps the global mass of transparent particulate eps tep was as high as about 70 pg c verdugo et al 2004 eps is also the key link connecting doc to poc earlier studies have elucidated the effects of eps driving ocean particle formation and eps microgel self assembly on ocean carbon pumps even if a small percentage of docs are self assembling marine scientists will have to modify the rationale for an established aquatic paradigm verdugo and santschi 2010 the omnipresence of pfos at ng l levels in global waters is enough to trigger the reassembly of eps and reduce photodecomposition of eps in the aquatic environments pfos in water environments may thus greatly challenge the prevailing global organic carbon cycle paradigm furthermore the presence of pfos has also been shown to have a negative effect on the growth sheng et al 2021 and diversity of microorganisms chen et al 2021 ji et al 2021 the light shielding effect of pfos retards microbial degradation of eps into small molecules grunert et al 2021 to enter the carbon cycle biopolymers must be cleaved by microbial ectoenzymes into subunits 600 da verdugo and santschi 2010 pfos leads to a decline in utilization of biological macromolecules and this reducd the conversion between biocarbon and abiotic carbon yu et al 2018 and ultimately affected the global carbon cycle and its turnover in addition eps self assembly brings a key new link in carbon flux to the microbial cycle which is particularly important for understanding the mass transfer of carbon related elements in the deep ocean kerner et al 2003 in summary eps can trap and concentrate pfos and form supramolecular sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures that exerts a profound impact on transformation and turnover of bioorganic carbon and nitrogen in the aquatic environment because of the ubiquity of eps and pfos in both fresh water and seawater elucidation of supramolecular pfos eps interaction in the environment is critical for us to get deep insight into global carbon cycle in the context of global warming processes that affect the distribution of organic carbon between dissolved and particulate phases will play important roles in the fate of carbon in the oceans larowe et al 2020 the abiotic conversion of doc to poc has great ecological significance due to the absence of carbon loss and has a great impact on carbon conversion in aquatic systems kerner et al 2003 based on the abiotic aggregation of eps triggered by environmental concentrations of pfos in this study environmental behavior of pfos eps supramolecular and their long term impact on carbon cycling and the associated environmental fate of pfos should be further studied 4 conclusion in this study interaction between lake eps and pfos of environmental concentrations was for the first time visually probed by afm ir technique the results showed that eps could effectively trap pfos environmental concentration of pfos could trigger nanoscale reorganization between eps and pfos through supramolecular interaction forces and formed sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures the multi microlayers of pfos sandwiched in eps acted as effective

15323,eps exopolymers play a central role in global carbon cycling due to huger amount in aquatic environment and pfos perfluorooctane sulfonate is also ubiquitous and persistent pollutant whether and how can pfos of environmental concentrations affect behavior and fate of eps was unclear in this study for the first time interaction between lake eps and pfos of environmental concentrations was visually probed by afm ir technique it was found that eps could effectively trap pfos and the latter of environmental concentrations could trigger nanoscale reassembly of the former sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures were formed via supramolecular interaction between eps and pfos confirmed by fluorescence quenching titration and ftir spectroscopy the pfos microlayers sandwiched in eps was proven to be a light shield that could protect eps from photodegradation because of its high reflectivity and nearly zero absorbance of uv vis light the light shielding effect of pfos was confirmed by evidences from photodegradation experiments including change of concentrations of ions released and molecular weight distribution patterns these novel findings provided valuable information for deep insight into environmental behavior of pfos and its effects on biogeochemical carbon cycle of biopolymers in global waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon cycle eps light shield pfos nanoscale supramolecular reorganization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction a high proportion of total organic carbon in global rivers lakes and oceans is in the form of dissolved organic carbon doc lau 2021 quigg et al 2021 among which exopolymers eps secreted from bacteria microalgae and other microorganisms are the major fraction eps are composed of macromolecules such as polysaccharides proteins and humic substances it was estimated that 0 5 gt of organic carbon dominated by eps is released annually to the ocean by phytoplankton and cyanobacteria accounting half of the total doc pool in the ocean thornton 2014 verdugo 2021 in the freshwater environment eps also have high mg g level in sediments singh et al 2021 and hundreds mg l in the water morelle et al 2017 one tenth of the doc pool about 70 pg c is in the form of transparent exopolymer particles which are assembled by eps verdugo et al 2004 eps including their transparent particulate exopolymers are the key components in the aquatic environments as the major components of microgel eps play a central role of the ocean in global carbon cycling verdugo 2021 as typical dom eps was considered to be a kind of dynamic self assembly in the water environment with the interaction similar to multilayer adsorption devarajan et al 2020 kong et al 2021 supramolecular assembly was driven by non covalent intermolecular interacting forces including hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions hydrophobic forces metal coordination van der waals forces and π π stacking lou and yang 2020 different components of eps assembled into a relatively stable supramolecular dynamic associate with a certain regular geometric appearance through non covalent bonds which may change the original inherent properties lehmann et al 2008 this important process contributed to the formation of particles in the aqueous environment notably due to the heterogeneity of eps and weak interactions between supramolecules the assembly mechanism was very sensitive to changes in the self assembly environment piccolo 2001 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a general term for a large complex and ever expanding group of manufactured chemicals williams et al 2022 which have arisen increasing global attention due to their highly persistent to degradation in natural environment and worldwide pollution of various water environments in recent decades muir and miaz 2021 perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos one of the most typical pfass has been detected in various environments worldwide evich et al 2022 sunantha and vasudevan 2016 it has been reported that the concentration of pfos in the water environment generally ranges from dozens of pg l to dozens of μg l kurwadkar et al 2022 and even reaches mg l level in highly polluted areas ahrens 2011 which is far exceeding the health advisory level 70 ng l proposed by united states environmental protection agency epa 2019 the omnipresent of pfos in aquatic environment poses great risk to aquatic organisms and human being due to its chemical stability high bioaccumulation and long range migration properties tu et al 2019 the ubiquitous eps and global pollution of pfos in aquatic environments make them inevitable interaction what is interesting and most important is that the important components in eps such as protein polysaccharide humus and pfos are natural and synthetic surfactant like organic compounds in the environment respectively which have fixed hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in the molecular structure schwichtenberg et al 2020 eps are rich in both polar and nonpolar functional groups on its surface such as hydroxyl carboxyl and phosphate amino groups ding et al 2019 the amphiphilic pfos can be bound to different substances with different hydrophobicity hydrophilicity via supramolecular forces the so3 hydrophilic end in the pfos structure interacts with polar groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and phosphoric acid groups in eps through intermolecular forces such as electrostatic force and hydrogen bond isolating the c f hydrophobic long chain and non polar hydrocarbon chain from the water phase kleber et al 2007 pontoni et al 2021 this interaction may lead to original phase separation between eps components and supramolecular recombination to form eps pfos supramolecular system pletikapić et al 2014 sutton and sposito 2005 however some key scientific questions related to interaction between eps and pfos need to be answered whether pfos of environmental concentrations can trigger supramolecular reassembly of eps or not if so eps and pfos reorganized in what way how do eps and pfos restructured furthermore the eps pfos supramolecular associates may have different physicochemical properties compared to initial intrinsic properties and thus may affect occurrence transformation or degradation of eps the change of the shape size and reorganization structure of supramolecular associates after recombination not only affects the spatial distribution of eps and its related elements c n in the hydrosphere lu et al 2022 but also may affect degradability and photoconversion efficiency of eps to a certain extent dhangar and kumar 2021 and finally influence carbon cycling baltar et al 2016 in addition pfos is highly resistant to physical chemical and biological degradation while eps is generally labile and relatively susceptible to be decomposed when the extremely persistent pfos whose concentration generally ranged from several to hundreds of ng l is assembled with labile eps whether can it exert influence on transformation and photodegradation of eps is unclear this is a critical question to be elucidated because of the huge amount of eps in global aquatic environment and its central role in carbon cycling under global warming background at present despite the importance of self assembly of eps and their interaction with organic pollutants deep understanding of these processes and mechanisms are still highly limited by the availability of nano chemical imaging techniques we have no idea about the reorganization way of eps with pfos and the structures with chemical information at nanometer scale recently the rapidly emerging afm ir atomic force microscopy based infrared spectroscopy technique is a rapidly emerging technique provides an ideal tool to visualize supramolecular assembly at nanoscale since this technique can reliably image the chemical composition with spatial resolution far below conventional optical diffraction limits afm ir simultaneously provide morphology with spatial resolution of afm and nanoscale mappings of infrared spectroscopy in this study interaction between lake eps and pfos of environmental concentrations were investigated by eem fluorescence spectroscopy and ftir spectroscopy and the nano chemical structures of eps pfos associates were further visually probed by afm ir based on these data the supramolecular assembly mechanisms of formation of eps pfos associates were revealed finally the role of pfos of environmental concentrations as a shield against photodegradation of eps was evaluated the findings provide novel insights into the interaction mechanism between pfos and biomolecules as well as its potential effect on the geochemical cycling of biopolymers such as eps in aquatic environments it s of great importance to understand behavior and fate ubiquitous pfos as well as its effects on carbon cycling under the background of global warming

pfos k stock solution with a concentration of 100 mg l was prepared with background solution and continuous sonication was required during the preparation process the stock solution was stored in a polypropylene container wrapped in aluminum foil at 4 c the storage time was 40 d according to the environmental concentration of pfos in surface water reported in previous research the pfos concentration gradient in this experiment was set as 0 control 5 50 and 500 ng l specifically 0 25 ng l 25 ng l 2 5 μg l of pfos solution and eps solution were mixed at a ratio of 1 4 and the eps pfos system solution was obtained after standing at room temperature for 24 h which also ensures the consistent of the eps concentration in each experimental group 2 4 afm ir analysis afm ir is an ultra

on the gold sheet fixed on the petri dish and quickly freeze to complete the sample preparation gold sheets were used as the test base because gold has no infrared absorption 2 5 photoreaction experiments to examine the effects of solar radiation on eps in the presence of pfos a photoreaction experiment with an exposure time of 12 h was set up the eps pfos system solutions of different

from 14 c to 27 c and the uv index was 11 data were taken from huzhou weather forecast website https lishi tianqi com huzhou index html 2 6 fluorescence quenching titration supramolecular interaction mechanism between eps and pfos was studied by fluorescence quenching titration take 20 ml of diluted eps toc 7 7 mg l in a 25 ml beaker and titrate it with 1 g l of pfos stock solution at 25 c the volume of each drop is 100 μl the fluorescence spectra eem were recorded after the solution was thoroughly mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 10 min the equilibrium time was set as 10 min since fluorescence intensities at peaks varied little after 10 min reaction the solution ph before and after titration was recorded all the titration experiments were triplicated and the mean values were used the fluorescence quenching process can be dynamic quenching which is due to collision between the fluorophore and quencher or static quenching due to the complexation between the fluorophore and the quencher to investigate the binding mechanism between eps and pfos the fluorescence intensity data were fitted with the stern volmer equation zhang et al 2010 f 0 f k s v p f o s 1 k q τ 0 p f o s 1 where f 0 and f represent the fluorescence intensity in absence and presence of quencher respectively k s v is the fluorescence quenching constant k q is the quenching rate constant p f o s is the quencher concentration τ 0 is the average lifetime of the fluorescence in absence of quencher which is taken as 10 8 s 2 7 size exclusion chromatography sec size exclusion chromatography sec separates solutes according to the relative relationship between the pore size of the gel pores and the linear group size of polymer samples which can quickly provide a comprehensive information of the composition of samples in molecular weight mw and simply determine whether the samples are simple or complex mixtures smaller molecules can enter most of the pores in the gel and are strongly retained in the column resulting in slower elution protein molecular weight mw of eps was qualitatively determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system equipped with an uv detector lc 20a shimadzu japan and a sec column bio sec 5 300å 7 8 300 mm agilent technologies inc us molecular weight was used for qualitative protein analysis which contained protein markers of 1 17 45 150 670 kda

respectively each injection volume was 80 μl eps different mws were classified according to retention time r time mainly divided into r time less than 11 min 11 12 min and greater than 12 min calculate the percentage of contribution for each retention time interval associated with different mw proteins that is peak area of each retention time interval total integral area which was carried out on the origin data analysis software specifically it was to perform area integration processing on the peaks after establishing the baseline 2 8 statistical analysis all experiments in this paper were triplicated and all characterizations of samples were performed thrice the medians and the standard errors of measured values were calculated which performed with excel all the data were exported to the origin r2018 software originlab usa for graph preparation 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoscale chemical mappings of eps fig 1a showed the exemplified infrared spectra of eps and pfos there were typical characteristic peaks belonging to proteins 1646 cm 1 and polysaccharides 1102 cm 1 fig 1b showed the nanoscale chemical mappings of eps no infrared signals at 1258 cm 1 of the f c functional group of pfos were found in the mappings of eps samples it was interesting that eps has spheric multilayer nanostructures with protein polysaccharide segregative phase separation the components containing hydroxyl groups were distributed in clumps due to the ubiquity of hydroxyl groups not limited to polysaccharides and protein macromolecules fig 1c such well ordered nanostructures may be explained by the supramolecular self assembly of biomacromolecules in eps by intermolecular forces in the water relatively hydrophobic biological macromolecules first gathered and polar hydrophilic groups isolated them in the water phase to form stable hydrophobic cores mcswain et al 2005 nagae and yamaguchi 2014 this stable core can be either protein or polysaccharide in terms of molecular structure and properties or the mixture formed by the association of their micro molecules similar to multilayer adsorption glycoproteins proteoglycans were eventually formed through intermolecular interactions especially hydrophobicity lin et al 2014 the relatively loose and unstable kinetic region in the outermost layer of the gel seemed to be the breakthrough for the disintegration of eps supramolecular association 3 2 sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures when pfos of environmental concentrations was introduced pfos was clearly concentrated by eps this result was in consistent with one early study that reported that pfas per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and natural doc dissolved organic carbon were enriched by surface water foams the authors explained that larger organic matter structure and higher concentrations of doc could explain the enrichment of doc and pfas in the foam rather than the water phase schwichtenberg et al 2020 which consistent with our findings what is more interesting and important it was found that the protein polysaccharide segregative eps structure was sandwiched with pfos fig 2 yu et al 2021 the spatial distribution of polysaccharides proteins and hydroxyl containing organic matter was similar to that of the pfos free eps which was mainly due to the similar structure of surfactants qiu et al 2022 unlike strong chemical bonding between eps and other organic pollutants which leaded to changes in the secondary structure of proteins in eps feng et al 2018 eps and pfos were associated by weak physical intermolecular forces yan et al 2021 pfos formed multilayer nano sandwich structures between polysaccharides and proteins based on the amphiphilic interaction which was different from the hydrophobic lipophilicity of traditional persitent organic pollutants the presence of sulfonate functional groups and c f bonds was the underlying reason for characteristic surfactant behavior of pfos and the separation of protein and polysaccharide phases aromatic and amide groups in the protein structure had a favorable adsorption for pfos specifically the aromatic group attracts the f c chain by hydrophobic interaction while the amide group binds to the pfos sulfonic acid group by electrostatic suction yan et al 2021 ribose mannose glucose and glucuronic acid are the main monomeric units of polysaccharides in eps and a large number of hydroxyl groups ether bond polar functional groups and aliphatic non polar chains in their structure dominated cross association with pfos lin et al 2014 vimala et al 2020 previous studies had shown that the removal of target pfas during nanofiltration nf was improved due to the presence of bsa protein or sa polysaccharide and the effect of bsa appeared to be stronger which also supported the formation of this sandwich structure wang et al 2018 3 3 supramolecular interaction mechanism for sandwiched pfos eps structure the pfos sandwiched eps nanostructures could be explained by their supramolecular interaction the amphiphilic pfos has binding capacity for both the non polar and polar functional groups in eps which was a mixture of hydrophobic hydrophilic and amphiphilic components on the one hand the amphiphilic supramolecular structure of eps provided a hydrophobic environment and the ability for electrostatic interactions to drive pfos retention park et al 2020 on the other hand eps supramolecular association was considered to be a dynamic self assembly process and the self assembly mechanism was highly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions as a super surfactant pfos will definitely profoundly affect the eps assembly mechanism from the spatial distribution mappings of eps it was observed that pfos not only existed in the periphery of eps gel but also detected a strong pfos signal between eps components which indicated that pfos led to the phase separation of eps components and undergo molecular co reorganization it can be illustrated that pfos interacted with eps mainly through intermolecular forces van der waals forces hydrophobic interactions hydrogen bonds aromatic ring stacking and other non covalent bonds schmidt and martínez 2018 despite such low bond energy of intermolecular force the interaction will become more relatively stable due to their cooperation and complexity in the system pletikapić et al 2014 based on the chemical structural formula of pfos it was believed that the interaction between pfos and eps was not in the form of strong and firm binding such as intermolecular covalent bonds or complexation reactions but through non covalent bonds intermolecular force eventually forms a dynamic equilibrium and relatively stable supramolecular association this explained the formation of sandwiched eps pfos nanostructures in water environment in order to verify this supramolecular mechanism for formation of pfos eps structure interaction between pfos and eps was examined by ftir and fluorescence spectroscopy 3 3 1 evidences from fluorescence quenching titration fig 3 a showed that eps had two obvious fluorescent groups ex em 280 345 ex em 345 445 representing tryptophan protein and humic acid like substances jacquin et al 2017 respectively although the final pfos concentration in the system was as high as 29 1 mg l which was far more than the concentration of eps after 6 times of equivalent volume titrations there was subtle decrease of fluorescence intensity for tryptophan proteins from 646 to 500 as for the humic acid like substances in the eps its final fluorescence intensity decreased by only 24 fig 3c the quenching process was carried out at room temperature and the solution ph almost unchanged at a constant of about 7 3 the fluorescence quenching constant kq of peaks a and b derived from the stern volmer equation fig s2 were 5 61 1011 and 1 73 1011 respectively the kq values were relatively close to the maximum value of biopolymers and largely much lower than those for interaction between eps and heavy metals or other pollutants with formation of complexes pan et al 2010a implying that the observed fluorescence quenching of eps by pfos occurred through the dynamic quenching which was caused by electron transfer from the excited eps fluorophores to the surface of pfos after their intermolecular collision this means that there was no complex formed between pfos and eps and their interaction was weak 3 3 2 evidences from ftir spectroscopy the ft ir spectra of pfos the eps and their mixture further confirmed this fig 4 it can be seen that the ftir spectrum of the pfos eps mixture was a simple overlap of the ftir spectra of pfos and the eps in other words no new complexes were produced after interaction between pfos and eps based on these results the sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures induced by pfos of environmental concentrations could be explained by the supramolecule theory it should be clear that both pfos and eps conform to the supramolecular properties proposed by the predecessors that was amphiphilicity which drove their self assembly in the aqueous environment ding et al 2008 eps and pfos as synthetic and natural surfactant like organic compounds had a high degree of similarity in structure therefore pfos triggered phase separation and recombination of the original eps supramolecular components this also explained strong signals of pfos detected at the eps periphery and between eps components the proposed model for eps pfos supramolecular nanostructures was described as follows at first the hydrophobic macromolecules converged polar hydrophilic groups wrapped non polar hydrophobic groups to protect the hydrophobic interior from contact with water molecules forming a relatively stable core han et al 2020 this stable core may be a protein or a polysaccharide or a mixture formed by the association of their small molecules verdugo and santschi 2010 in addition it may include pfos sandwiched between its components secondly hydrophilic groups further interacted and polar groups of amphiphilic molecules interacted through ligand exchange hydrogen bonding etc to form relatively stable core complexes kleber et al 2007 thirdly the hydrophobic part exposed to water phase in amphiphilic molecules adsorbed on the core was electrically bonded with non polar groups of other amphiphilic molecules through hydrophobic interaction forming hydrophobic bimolecular region which was again isolated from the water layer iscen and schatz 2017 finally organic molecules adsorbed on hydrophobic bilayers formed an external region or dynamic region which was loosely bound by cation bridges hydrogen bonds and other interactions kotov 2017 based on all above mentioned eps and pfos were spontaneously and sequentially assembled into sandwiched nanostructures 3 4 sandwiched pfos shielded eps against photodegradation we hypothesized that eps was sandwiched with multilayer pfos the latter may act as armor like substance that may shelter eps components from photodegradation due to its highly resistant to physicochemical degradation in order to evaluate whether the sandwiched pfos influence photodegradation of eps variation of concentration of ions and molecular weight of eps during photodegradation in the absence and presence of pfos of environmental concentrations were monitored 3 4 1 evidence from release of ions the complexation of free metals and docs had been extensively studied and considered as a crosslinker during the conversion of doc to poc hjorth and jørgensen 2012 therefore some small molecules and ions would be released when eps components were decomposed and therefore it was reasonable to monitor concentrations of various ions cl nh4 so4 2 and no3 and electric conductivity the comprehensive indicator to indicate eps photodegradation kinetics on the whole concentration of various ions was increased upon light irradiation indicating that the degradation of eps occurred the alkalization of eps solutions ph from 7 25 to around 7 75 illustrated the formation of alkaline secondary products such as urea li et al 2020 fig 5 showed that environmental concentration pfos generally reduced the concentration of released ions cl nh4 so4 2 and no3 during 12h of photodegradation in comparison with the pfos free control specifically concentration of the released cl was reduced by more than 10 mg l and nh4 had a decrease of 0 02 0 05 mg l in the presence of pfos the change of cl concentration showed completely different trends in two types of experimental groups on the one hand the increase of cl concentration was explained by the decomposition of halogen containing organic matter although so4 2 and no3 concentrations increased more for the pfos groups than the control after 3h of irradiation their concentrations were significantly lower for the pfos groups than the control with more irradiation time up to 12h in most cases the increase of so4 2 and no3 implied the degradation of nitrogen and sulfur containing proteins and polysaccharides in a word the presence of pfos caused slower release of ions from eps due to photodegradation compared to the control the increased concentration of ions implies that some organic molecules were decomposed into ions and smaller molecules or some bound ions by the organic matter were released due to their supramolecular disintegration behavior under irradiation li et al 2022 the general decreases in concentration of various ions in the presence of various concentrations of pfos resulted in decreases of electric conductivity these data indicated that pfos of environmental concentrations could exert enough inhibitory effect on photodegradation of eps 3 4 2 evidence from mw data the change of mw of eps during photodegradation further confirmed the sheltering effect of sandwiched pfos on photodegradation of eps fig 6 from the first column in fig 6a the sec chromatogram of the ck group it could be observed that light irradiation promoted conversion of protein macromolecules to micro molecules which indicated disassembly or decomposition of proteins valencia et al 2013 the change of initial mw and composition of pfos group indicated that eps components were sensitive to light irradiation shammi et al 2017 with irradiation time the proportion of low mw components generally showed an increasing trend the preferential photodegradation of high mw fraction led to an increase in the proportion of low mw fraction which was similar to the previously reported photocatalytic degradation of nom from a bog lake tercero espinoza et al 2009 the area of components with mw over 15 min after 12h of light irradiation was 184 63 which were almost negligible from 0 6h on the contrary the area of components with high mw before 11 min decreased from the initial 193 61 to 43 18 at 12h in the presence of pfos of environmental concentrations 5 500 ng l although the changes of mw distribution pattern of eps components showed similar trends to that of the control increases of the proportion of high mw over 15 min with the area of 12 47 12 01 15 59 for 5 50 500 ng l pfos treated groups respectively were much less than the control area of 184 63 the changes of mw of eps during light irradiation clearly showed that the presence of pfos of environmental concentrations significantly inhibited photodegradation because of the sandwiched pfos eps structure 3 4 3 mechanism mode for pfos sheltering eps from photodegradation the light exposure experiments in this study were carried out under natural radiation and testing the uv visible uv vis and uv diffuse reflectance uv visdrs spectra of pfos were helpful for understanding the underlying mechanism of its photo effect on eps the light shielding effect of eps against photodegradation could be attributed to the optical properties and persistence of pfos molecules and the pfos sandwiched eps nanostructures firstly fig 7 showed the uv vis absorption spectrum and drift reflection spectrum of pfos in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm which covered the visible 400 760 nm and the invisible ultraviolet 400 nm infrared 760 nm wavelengths the absorption intensity of pfos in the range of 290 800 nm was almost 0 while its diffuse reflection spectrum was characterized by over 90 reflectivity above 400 nm and 62 90 reflectivity in the range of 290 400 nm such optical properties of pfos means that most of the visible light and uv light energy which accounts for 3 to 5 of sunlight chen et al 2007 was reflected this means that pfos plays as a light shield for the organic matter it enclosed secondly the high persistence of pfos to physicochemical degradation which was due to its multiple and extremely strong c f bonds bentel et al 2019 means it can act a robust light shield furthermore adjacent fluorine atoms along the perfluoroalkyl chain could electrostatically and sterically protect carbon carbon bonds from direct radiation kirsch 2013 the almost no absorption and the excellent reflectivity of pfos to solar radiation were the strongest evidences for the above inhibited photodegradation effect which could be simply described as shielding effect of pfos thirdly the protective effect of pfos from eps photodegradation was majorly owing to its supramolecular interaction with eps and formed distinct nanostructures pfos induced phase separation of different eps components through intermolecular forces formed pfos eps sandwich nanostructures with pfos nanolayers inserted between different components of eps therefore the sandwiched pfos multilayers from inside to outside repeatedly blocked solar radiation to eps which finally caused the inhibitory effect on eps photodegradation to summarize the above mechanisms we proposed the light shielding mechanism mode of pfos against photodegradation of eps fig 8 pfos of environmental concentrations was firstly efficiently trapped and concentrated by eps and the latter in turn induced phase separation of different components such as proteins and polysaccharides of the former and formed pfos eps multilayer sandwich structures via spontaneous supramolecular reassembly the pfos microlayers therefore acted as persistent and effective shields against solar irradiation to reach the eps components it enclosed 3 5 implication for global aquatic carbon cycle eps as one of the most important forms of doc in global aquatic environments eps usually occur at mg l in various freshwater and marine environments morelle et al 2018 eps participate in various biogeochemical cycle processes and play critical role in global carbon cycle guidi et al 2016 because of their viscosity hydrophobicity carbon richness and nutrient richness which profoundly affects the circulation of carbon and nitrogen nutrients in water yang et al 2020 without regard to the soluble eps the global mass of transparent particulate eps tep was as high as about 70 pg c verdugo et al 2004 eps is also the key link connecting doc to poc earlier studies have elucidated the effects of eps driving ocean particle formation and eps microgel self assembly on ocean carbon pumps even if a small percentage of docs are self assembling marine scientists will have to modify the rationale for an established aquatic paradigm verdugo and santschi 2010 the omnipresence of pfos at ng l levels in global waters is enough to trigger the reassembly of eps and reduce photodecomposition of eps in the aquatic environments pfos in water environments may thus greatly challenge the prevailing global organic carbon cycle paradigm furthermore the presence of pfos has also been shown to have a negative effect on the growth sheng et al 2021 and diversity of microorganisms chen et al 2021 ji et al 2021 the light shielding effect of pfos retards microbial degradation of eps into small molecules grunert et al 2021 to enter the carbon cycle biopolymers must be cleaved by microbial ectoenzymes into subunits 600 da verdugo and santschi 2010 pfos leads to a decline in utilization of biological macromolecules and this reducd the conversion between biocarbon and abiotic carbon yu et al 2018 and ultimately affected the global carbon cycle and its turnover in addition eps self assembly brings a key new link in carbon flux to the microbial cycle which is particularly important for understanding the mass transfer of carbon related elements in the deep ocean kerner et al 2003 in summary eps can trap and concentrate pfos and form supramolecular sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures that exerts a profound impact on transformation and turnover of bioorganic carbon and nitrogen in the aquatic environment because of the ubiquity of eps and pfos in both fresh water and seawater elucidation of supramolecular pfos eps interaction in the environment is critical for us to get deep insight into global carbon cycle in the context of global warming processes that affect the distribution of organic carbon between dissolved and particulate phases will play important roles in the fate of carbon in the oceans larowe et al 2020 the abiotic conversion of doc to poc has great ecological significance due to the absence of carbon loss and has a great impact on carbon conversion in aquatic systems kerner et al 2003 based on the abiotic aggregation of eps triggered by environmental concentrations of pfos in this study environmental behavior of pfos eps supramolecular and their long term impact on carbon cycling and the associated environmental fate of pfos should be further studied 4 conclusion in this study interaction between lake eps and pfos of environmental concentrations was for the first time visually probed by afm ir technique the results showed that eps could effectively trap pfos environmental concentration of pfos could trigger nanoscale reorganization between eps and pfos through supramolecular interaction forces and formed sandwiched pfos eps nanostructures the multi microlayers of pfos sandwiched in eps acted as effective uv visible light shield and reduced photodegradation of eps in the sun our study provided valuable information for deep insight into environmental behavior of pfos and its effects on biogeochemical

15324,in wastewater treatment plants wwtps the stable operation of biological wastewater treatment is strongly dependent on the stability of associated microbiota bacteriophages phages viruses that specifically infect bacteria and archaea are highly abundant and diverse in wwtps although phages do not have known metabolic functions for themselves they can shape functional microbiota via various phage host interactions to impact biological wastewater treatment however the developments of phage host interaction in wwtps and their impact on biological wastewater treatment are overlooked here we review the current knowledge regarding the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment mainly focusing on the characteristics of different phage populations the phage driven changes in functional microbiota and the potential driving factors of phage host interactions we also discuss the efforts required further to understand and manipulate the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment overall this review advocates more attention to the phage dynamics in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plants biological wastewater treatment phage host interaction environmental risk data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction bacteriophages phages are the virus that can infect bacteria archaea sorek et al 2008 and are the most abundant biological entity phages outnumber their host by approximately 10 fold on the earth rohwer 2003 suttle 2007 typically the canonical phage infection cycles are classified as productive cycle and non productive cycle fig 1 chevallereau et al 2021 warwick dugdale et al 2019 furthermore phages can be categorized into three types depending on their infection cycle 1 filamentous phages that follow a chronic cycle some of them enable to enter a non productive lysogenic cycle marvin et al 2014 2 temperate phages that characterized by their ability to be lysogenic the dormant state of temperate phages so called prophages will enter either a chronic or a lytic cycle upon induction and 3 virulent phages that replicate only through a lytic cycle fig 1 these phages are found in a wide variety of natural and artificial environments including wastewater treatment plants wwtps paez espino et al 2016 in wwtps biological treatments e g activated sludge method are the most common methods of meeting the constant demand for low cost and efficient wastewater treatment gernaey et al 2004 these methods recruit specific functional microbiota to degrade contaminants including excess nutrients in wastewater efficiently wu et al 2019 it is worth pointing out that in fact all microorganisms are functional but in this article functional microbiota specifically refers to microbiota that can achieve specific goal of biological wastewater treatment e g ammonia oxidizes bacteria the healthy development of functional microbiota is the priority of biological wastewater treatment and operational problems will occur e g degraded performance if the composition of the functional microbiota changes significantly in a short time different from adaptive evolution such as the acute exposure of exogenous pollutant fan et al 2020 generally phages can hijack the machinery e g transcription and resource e g nucleobase of their host for own replication which inhibits the growth of their host even lead to host lysis chevallereau et al 2021 conversely phage infection also can redirect bacterial metabolism through the expression of auxiliary metabolic genes amgs which might facilitate the fitness of their hosts lindell et al 2005 zheng et al 2022 therefore phages are deemed to shape the taxonomic and functional composition of microbiota as well as its stability suttle 1994 waller et al 2014 meanwhile phage driven microbiota changes have critical implications for larger scale ecological functions e g biogeochemical cycles breitbart et al 2018 roossinck 2011 although phages do not have known metabolic functions for themselves phage populations are closely related to associated abundance activity and community composition of their host in wwtps mathieu et al 2019 a recent study stated that phage infection widely spans 58 bacterial and 8 archaeal phyla in six wwtps and these viruses are linked with aerobic anaerobic heterotrophs and other functional microorganisms controlling nitrogen phosphorous removal and encode extensive amgs e g function related to carbon fixation pathways chen et al 2021 which implies that the developments of phage host interactions in wwtps is likely to affect functional microbiota and further impacting the related biological wastewater treatment recently liu et al 2021 well summarized phage ecology in wwtps and runa et al 2021 highlighted suitable methods for studying phages in wwtps but they neglected to review the driving factors of phage host interactions which may be important for future control strategies of biological wastewater treatment more important the performance changes in biological wastewater treatments were caused by changes in phage host interactions not phages themselves nevertheless the phage host interactions in wwtps have so far received very limited attention considering the central role of prokaryotes in biological wastewater treatments it is necessary to advocate the assessment of the phage host interactions in wwtps this work aims to review the state of the art knowledge regarding the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment in wwtps here we first summarized the characteristics of different phage populations including virulent phages temperate phages and chronic phages subsequently the effects of phage host interaction development i e phage predation and prophage induction on biological wastewater treatment was reviewed then the driving factors affecting phage host interactions was outlined in which highlighted the developments of phage host interactions in wwtps might be largely overlooked finally we demonstrated the challenges and proposed further research orientation toward phage host interactions research in wwtps in doing so this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the phage host interactions involved in biological wastewater treatment in wwtps and highlights the necessity to focus on phage dynamics within such an engineered environment 2 the phage populations in biological wastewater treatment 2 1 overall view in wwtps activated sludge is the most extensive biological method in existence xia et al 2010 and such process utilizes specific functional microbiota to reduce the levels of organic and inorganic compounds ju and zhang 2015 the number of phages in such an artificial habitat may be numerous as the microbe rich environment provides many potential hosts in a study in 1980 the maximum total phage concentrations in the fluid phase of sewage the activated sludge mixed liquor and the reactor effluent of an activated sludge wwtp were counted for 2 2 107 9 5 107 and 8 4 107 per ml respectively ewert donald and paynter 1980 however such data was based on direct electron microscopic counts of phage plaques thus these concentrations were skewed by ignoring phages that cause ineffective infections the introduction of fluorescent dyes has corrected for such negative deviation otawa et al 2007 and several studies support activated sludge has a higher viral abundance than that in other environments with a prevalent concentration of 107 to 1010 virus like particles vlps per ml otawa et al 2007 rosenberg et al 2010 wu and liu 2009 based on the pore size of the filter and the quantitative method vlps are usually defined as an individual visible concentrated nucleic acid stain not the particles themselves with a diameter of 0 02 0 22 μm as such these abundance estimates may be inaccurate including potential underestimated e g result from the exclusion of large viruses and the inability to see small rna or single stranded dna viruses or inflated e g resulting from counting small bacteria or membrane bound extracellular vesicles that are in the same size range as viruses biller et al 2016 forterre et al 2013 tomaru and nagasaki 2007 indeed the vlps to bacterial cells ratio in wwtps was presented to approximate 10 1 rosenberg et al 2010 which was similar to values obtained from marine rohwer and thurber 2009 and soil environments adriaenssens et al 2017 before the application of genomic techniques to characterize phage diversity the observations based on transmission electron microscopy have revealed a rich variety of phages in wwtps park et al 2007 whereafter some genomic based efforts have been made to uncover the phage diversity in the biological wastewater treatments calusinska et al 2016 li et al 2021 parmar et al 2018 tamaki et al 2012 wang et al 2018 but a large majority of viral associated sequences in metagenomic datasets do not align with any known sequence and constitute the so called viral dark matter krishnamurthy and wang 2017 based on the available knowledge the members of the family podoviridae short tailed phages from the caudovirales order could be the most abundant recognizable dna phages in activated sludge chen et al 2021 modin et al 2022 o brien et al 2017 moreover previous limitations of sample processing and sequencing techniques result in the poor detection of rna phages callanan et al 2021 recent studies expanded the number of complete rna phage sequences from 16 at that time the number of complete dna phage genomes exceeded 1000 to more than 1000 callanan et al 2020 indicating that rna phages might be also abundant and diverse in wwtps therefore the diversity of phage populations is also highly abundant in wwtps obviously the roles of different phage populations in biological wastewater treatment surely deserves more attention than that given to it so far when considering the impact of phage driven development of bacterial communities on other environments chevallereau et al 2021 consequently we summarized the latest knowledge regarding different types of phages in wwtps 2 2 virulent phages the top down effects the ecological concept that organismal growth and abundance are primarily regulated by predation instead of resource limitation derived from virulent phages on microbiota in biological wastewater treatments are well documented hantula et al 1991 kunin et al 2008 generally the relationship between virulent phages and their host have been thought to follow the kill the winner hypothesis which based on the lotka volterra interspecies competition model holds that a negative frequency dependent selection of microbial populations is the primary force driving the interaction between phages and their hosts thingstad 2000 winter et al 2010 virulent phages kill their hosts when releasing new virions threatening the health of functional microbiota in wwtps and the functional microbiota collapse driven by virulent phage predation will be discussed later reciprocally under phage mediated negative frequency dependent selection the rare taxa will continue to increase until the phage that infects it appears this interaction can lead to the periodical rise and fall of specific microbial populations which may help to maintain bacterial diversity by regulating the more competitive host genotype and allowing different microbe coexistence bouvier and del giorgio 2007 therefore virulent phages are inclined to maintain bacterial diversity since they offset the proliferation of a single dominant species in biological wastewater treatment virulent phages might play a significant role in maintaining community diversity in the context of fierce competition and community diversity is the basis of functional redundancy in biological wastewater treatments rodriguez valera et al 2009 shapiro et al 2010 2 3 temperate phages in different habitats the distribution of lytic cycle virulent phages and lysogenic temperate phages cycle is unevenly and is regarded to be driven by host density at least partly erez et al 2017 typically lytic replication cycle is generally favored under conditions in which the prokaryotic hosts of phages can proliferate and reach high densities whereas lysogeny is generally favored when corresponding host abundance is low this long established concept is well supported by theoretical and experimental studies berngruber et al 2013 berngruber et al 2015 but data from environmental studies is ambiguous some studies have reported a positive negative correlation between the frequency of lytic lysogenic phages and host density liang et al 2020 whereas other studies reported weak or no correlations knowles et al 2017 contradicting this view the nutrient rich bacterially dense habitat of the mammalian gut is dominated by lysogenic bacteria kim and bae 2018 mathieu et al 2020 touchon et al 2016 knowles et al 2016 proposed the piggyback the winner model to describe the relationship between lysogeny infection and host density wherein lysogeny becomes increasingly predominant in ecosystems with high microbial densities the piggyback the winner model predicts that at high host densities temperate phages are favored to exploit their hosts through lysogeny with increasing host density lysogen resistance to infection by related viruses may become increasingly important thingstad et al 2014 the distribution of virulent and temperate phage in wwtps is uncertain partly attributed to the nutritional status in biological wastewater treatment obscure specifically municipal wastewater usually contains many nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus which can be called a nutrient rich environment alternatively the abundant microbes make a fierce competition for resources in sludge so the individual cells are under limited nutrient availability in wwtps lysogenic strategy may be favored as lysogenic infection may confer an ecological competitive advantage in such habitat since prophages and their hosts are retained while free phage particles are continually washed out with the effluents breitbart et al 2018 generally speaking the percentage of lysogen bacterial cells containing an inducible prophage to the total number of bacteria varies between undetectable and over 80 which depends on different environments and induction methods weinbauer 2004 of note temperate phages are heterogeneous populations since not all temperate phages enter the lysogenic cycle upon infection feiner et al 2015 although there are no available estimates of percent lysogeny in wwtps the importance of temperate phages is not negligible given their unique life cycle especially given that temperate phages can complicate the top down effect because prophages can exit the dormant form either upon exogenous stimuli or spontaneously and switch to the lytic cycle such particular behavior is called prophage induction and will be discussed in more detailed later 2 4 chronic phages most chronic phages identified to date belong to the family inoviridae which is composed of filamentous single stranded dna ssdna phage species roux et al 2019 a recent survey expanded the number of known inovirus sequences by two orders of magnitude indicating the prevalence of chronic phages roux et al 2019 meanwhile the abundance of inoviruses in a defined ecosystem may be overestimated due to the amplification protocols used before library preparation that introduce a positive bias towards small ssdna but their diversity is remarkable in consideration of their association to hosts spans the domains archaea and bacteria including almost all bacterial phyla hay and lithgow 2019 mai prochnow et al 2015b roux et al 2019 a notable characteristic of filamentous phages is their ability to replicate without killing their host in contrast to true lysogens the filamentous phage commonly continually sheds viral particles without host cell death even when inserted into the bacterial genome as a prophage askora et al 2011 das et al 2011 mcleod et al 2005 filamentous phages predominantly infect gram negative bacteria and make an important contribution to host physiology ecology and virulence reviewed by mai prochnow et al 2015a to date the interactions between chronic phages and their host in wwtps is less documented but the roles of chronic phages in other ecosystems speculate on their ecological role in biological wastewater treatment for example filamentous phages f327 confer properties advantageous to its host survival in the arctic sea ice environment where microbes are subject to many extreme conditions yu et al 2015 besides the structural formation of biofilm attached and aggregated microbes surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix flemming and wingender 2010 might be correlated with filamentous phages in one study pf phages produced new filamentous virions that can self assemble with the host produced extracellular matrix thus promoting the formation of robust biofilms by their bacterial host pseudomonas aeruginosa by enhancing adhesion and tolerance to desiccation and antibiotics secor et al 2015 these observations imply that filamentous phages may enhance host fitness through metabolic redirection and their special physical characteristics recent studies suggested that filamentous phages may contribute to the development of aerobic granules sludge by releasing extracellular dna or playing a structural component chan et al 2021 wang et al 2020 overall chronic phages receive less attention in biological wastewater treatment than virulent phages even temperate phages but they may have more fascinating interactions with their hosts 3 effects of the developments of phage host interaction on the performance of biological wastewater treatment wwtps are particular interesting environments because there is a constant large influx of phages and bacteria from the sewage but also significant resident populations involved in the biological processing these recruited resident populations for specific wastewater treatment tasks have a relatively stable pattern sun et al 2021 even though phage populations have been long term neglected in wwtps phage host interactions have recently attracted interest due to their potential impact on resident populations krysiak baltyn et al 2017 olsen et al 2020 generally chronic phages that do not lyse their hosts are rarely discussed separately in biological wastewater treatment because quantifying the effects of chronic phages is very difficult in such a complex environment in contrast virulent phages and temperate phages by prophage induction have the potential to alter the resident functional microbiota via lysing their hosts and thus affect related biological wastewater treatment performance fig 2 to date scientists have so far found that the development of phage host interactions can affect the performance of quite a few biological wastewater treatment processes including nitrification denitrification dissolved organic carbon removal and phosphate removal therefore the effects of the predator prey dynamic driven by virulent phages and the prophage induction related to temperate phages on biological wastewater treatment performance were next reviewed 3 1 predator prey dynamic phage predation can initiate predator prey dynamics in biological wastewater treatments recently the influences of changing microbiota driven by phage predation on biological wastewater treatment performance have been observed in wwtps table 1 liu et al 2017 addressed the knowledge gap of phage population dynamics defined as the number of phages changing over time during sludge bulking they observed a significant decrease in nitrifying bacteria abundance with sludge bulking the viral contigs linked with nitrifiers were identified more frequently and with greater abundance in the viromes defined as the ensembles of viral genomes within a given habitat retrieved from the bulking sludge samples these results implied that phage predation might contribute to the loss of autotrophic nitrifiers under bulking conditions liu et al 2017 during two years of monitoring in a full scale activated sludge plant the virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude 3 18 108 to 3 41 109 vlps per ml and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance community composition and effluent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n and system function brown et al 2019 in a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor mainly accumulibacter barr et al 2010 found the unexpected decrement in the phosphorus removal performance of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr was attributed to phage predation and not a result of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos glycogen accumulating organisms gaos competition in full scale wwtps albertsen et al 2012 2013 further revealed the potential importance of phage predation on the dynamics of accumulibacter populations by metagenomic sequencing these observations suggested phage predation can shape microbiota in activated sludge and further affect the performance of activated sludge the predator prey dynamics may explain some previous observations such as the re occurring seasonal pattern of bacterial community dynamics in a full scale ebpr plant flowers et al 2013 phage predation may also exert positive effects on biological wastewater treatments in a sludge bulking sewage plant dominated by slow growing microthrix parvicella the abundances of microthrix associated viral genotypes were low whereas viruses related to fast growing taxa were abundant this implies that phage predation for fast growing hosts may facilitate the overgrowth of m parvicella liu et al 2017 however the contribution of phage predation to the development of slow growing functional bacterial communities e g anammox bacteria remains unknown overall the predator driven microbiota collapse in biological wastewater treatment remains poorly characterized this situation may result from inadequate research effort or the high microbial diversity found in biological wastewater treatment where the activity of competing populations compensates selective lysis of a population accountable to a specific metabolic function flowers et al 2013 3 2 prophage induction since the dissemination of temperate phages can be both horizontal and vertical not depending on host lysis the fitness interests of temperate phages and their hosts are more aligned resulting in more mutualistic or less destructive behaviors compared with virulent phages it has been speculated that phage associated sequences can account for 10 20 of the genome sequences of infecting bacteria canchaya et al 2003 and a plethora of auxiliary metabolic and functional genes have been identified in prophages calero cáceres et al 2019 ghosh et al 2008 tang et al 2019 problematically temperate phages can result in substantial host mortality by inducing prophage brum et al 2016 or driving the evolution of ultra virulent mutants cornuault et al 2020 although ultra virulent mutants are difficult to observe in the fleeting environment of wwtps prophage induction can lead to a surge in host lysis in short period and an observable failure of biological wastewater treatments motlagh et al 2015 illustrated that prophage activation besides phage predation was responsible for some failed ebpr processes in that study the addition of copper ion 0 05 to 1 mg l cyanide 50 to1000 mg l and ciprofloxacin 0 05 to 0 4 mg ml resulted in prophage release within 6 h and a decline in the polyphosphate kinase gene ppk1 clades copy number phosphorus accumulation capacity and phosphorus removal performance motlagh et al 2015 therefore the prophage induction derived from specific chemical agents i e prophage inducers could negatively affect the wastewater treatment process our recent work showed that benzyl butyl phthalate which is generally derived from the leaching of plastic fragments can induce prophage in a microbiota centered on the short chain fatty acid scfa producers leading to scfa accumulation upset in the sludge anaerobic digestion reactor table 1 tang et al 2021 in short the prophage induction can cause excess host lysis and the latter is responsible for certain wastewater treatment failures 4 the driving factor of phage host interactions for any kind of phage its relationship with their host is related to corresponding host density and infection frequency which is determined by its essence of parasite thus both host density and infection frequency can drive the development of phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment for example in a laboratory scale anoxic aerobic system the simultaneous exposure to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole significantly inhibited the abundance of phages and bacteria but the phage delivery receptor binding protein genes was increased and phages population restored faster than bacteria du et al 2021 these results suggested on the one hand the existence of host density dependent phage population dynamic in such habitat and on the other hand implied that the host range of phages was evolved as infection frequency declined in addition the relationship between temperature phages and their host is also affected by prophage inducers hereinafter we have outlined the latest knowledge regarding the driving factors of phage host interactions and described how these drivers potentially affect biological wastewater treatment 4 1 host density the density of host is decisive for the proliferation of different phages exactly as kill the winner hypothesis for virulent phage and piggyback the winner hypothesis for temperate phage the sequencing data from four anaerobic digesters in full scale wastewater treatment plants across china demonstrated phage and prokaryotic groups fluctuated monthly over a year study period showing significant correlations between those two groups at the α and β diversity levels zhang et al 2017 these results supported that cell lysis could be a density driven cycle although microbial communities vary widely in different biological treatment systems abiotic factors such as temperature chen and chang 2017 sun et al 2021 and ph zhang et al 2011 can strongly shape microbial communities in wwtps which may lead to drastic changes in host density currently many pretreatment methods have been applied in wwtps and such methods enhance the biodegradability of waste activated sludge by destroying the sludge structure zeng et al 2022 therefore the disintegration of sludge particles is expected to alter phage host interactions during sludge anaerobic digestion largely furthermore changes in the host density of polyvalent phages in biological wastewater treatment are more difficult to estimate generally phage host range depends on the specificity of the interaction between phage attachment structures and host cell surface receptors although phages are generally assumed to display narrow host specificities polyvalent phages viruses that can infect different bacteria so called broad host range phages have been frequently isolated from wwtps khan et al 2002 yu et al 2016 one recent study demonstrated a weak host specialism of the staphylococcal phages from wastewater in wwtps and this suggests the potentially wide host range of phages in such habitat göller et al 2021 wwtps are biologically dense environment where special in that it has a stable resident population and a variable floating population sun et al 2021 the influx of floating populations gives polyvalent phages an ecological advantage because they have the opportunity to infect more potential hosts correspondingly resident population facilitated the specialized phages and robust specialized phages in turn reduce the density of resident population through phage predation or prophage induction in addition multiple in vitro meyer et al 2016 2012 sant et al 2021 and recent in vivo cornuault et al 2020 de sordi et al 2017 evolution experiments have demonstrated that the range of host infection is a highly evolvable trait which can expand or contract heineman et al 2008 meyer et al 2012 therefore when considering phage host interaction development driven by host density the complexity of the host range should also be taken into account 4 2 infection frequency in wwtps the infection frequency of different phages has different consequences on the one hand when the infection frequency of virulent phages is high then excessive death of prokaryotes may occur although there are many differences between different virulent phages such as titer and infection cycle on the other hand when the infection frequency of temperature phages is high although homoimmunity conferred by prophages inhibits the subsequent infection of its host by a closely related phage these latent prophages would be timebomb because when induced they could trigger the collapse of the microbiota in biological wastewater treatment due to the lack of high resolution high coverage phage host association datasets it is unknown what factors can significantly alter the infection frequency of specific phages in biological wastewater treatment nevertheless the available evidence gives us a glimpse into the changes in the ability of phages to infect in biological wastewater treatments virulent phages and their host undergo special coevolutionary dynamics which is called arms race where phage infectivity and host resistance generally increase over time prokaryotes have developed many strategies to limit the invasion of phages and they can be divided into two classes 1 a well studied class of protein based defense mechanisms which perform a variety of defense behaviors such as preventing phage entry adsorption injection targeting phage nucleic acids restriction modification systems crispr cas systems abortive infection toxin antitoxin systems and phage assembly interference reviewed by azam and tanji 2019 rostøl and marraffini 2019 and 2 a new chemical anti phage defense mechanism kronheim et al 2018 some of these defense mechanisms have been observed in wwtps for instance kunin et al 2008 found that highly related and geographically remote candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis cap strains differed mostly in genomic regions encoding phage defense mechanisms by analyzing metagenomics data from cap dominated laboratory scale ebpr bioreactors in the usa and australia indicating that cap strains are globally dispersed but must adapt to phage predation pressure locally in the comparison between the crispr loci identified and reconstructed from ebpr sludge metagenomics data with the phage genome skennerton et al 2013 also demonstrated the arms race in which phages persist in the system and evolve rapidly in response to the crispr imposed resistance of the host however the endless defense and counter defense process between hosts and phages inevitably multiplied the cost of bacterial resistance and phage infectious resistance therefore the arms race dynamics may decay and eventually be replaced by fluctuating selection dynamics where phage and host genotype frequencies oscillate over time because of negative frequency dependent selection hall et al 2011 interestingly just like the kill the winner hypothesis the fluctuating selection dynamics may give an advantage to rare bacterial resistance alleles through phage evolution to infect common bacterial genotypes gandon et al 2008 in addition arms race could even arise between different phages recently phage encoded crispr cas systems targeting other phages medvedeva et al 2019 pausch et al 2020 or systems triggering premature lysis of competing phages hays and seed 2020 have been uncovered and the mechanisms that allow phages to overcome these restrictions have also been identified bondy denomy et al 2016 these competitive behaviors limited global phage infection in biological wastewater treatment but phages will also continue to evolve to circumvent the limitations of their potential hosts de jonge et al 2019 inevitably comprehensive arms race makes it difficult to assess the exact frequency of phages infections 4 3 prophage inducer there is a specific repression system in lysogens which is genetically determined by the prophage and can prevent the expression of essential genes required by progeny virions while bacteria serve as a sanctuary for prophages prophages can excise from the host chromosome to commence a potential lytic cycle when detection of host cell damage fornelos et al 2016 tzipilevich et al 2017 if such lysis cycle occurs globally it has the potential to threaten the operation of biological wastewater treatment in wwtps a typical scenario is that the influent contains prophage inducer at high concentration which induce a large number of virion release when they contact with lysogens in biological wastewater treatment the released virion can further lyse more potential hosts eventually leading to the collapse of the resident microbial population there are many substances that can damage lysogens and initiate prophage activation we thus reviewed the prophage inducers that have been proven to induce prophages in laboratory scale biological wastewater treatment table 2 and with particular focus on the potential prophage inducers that may be present in wwtps 4 3 1 heavy metals heavy metals are of concern because of their persistence and biological toxicity yi et al 2011 zou et al 2016 in general heavy metals exert toxicity on cell by inducing oxidative stress and interfering with protein folding and function nies 1999 which may induce prophage release lee et al 2006 firstly demonstrated the prophage activation capacity of copper ions cu ii after 6 h of induction the plaque forming units pfus per 1 0 106 as 1 lysogenic phage bearing a nidulans were 13 6 0 2 control 27 4 1 2 with 3 1 10 4 m cuso4 24 8 1 6 with 3 1 10 5 m cuso4 and 39 2 0 4 with 3 1 10 6 m cuso4 respectively lee et al 2006 this result indicated that cu ii could serve as prophage inducer within a short period but high concentration of cu ii induces lethality furthermore the presence of cu ii 0 05 to 1 00 mg l led to prophage activation in the ebpr reactor and impeded the performance of phosphorus removal motlagh et al 2015 chromium cr is another widespread heavy metal which usually exists in an oxidation state in the environment i e cr iii and cr vi typically more toxic cr vi could attack membrane lipids dna and proteins thereby disrupting cellular integrity and functions when inside the cell meyn et al 1977 further triggering an sos response which might eventually lead to prophage activation in one study cr vi at five different levels 0 002 to 1 mm were spiked to evaluate its impact on nitrosospira multiformis 25196 an ammonia oxidizing bacteria and its potential for phage induction as a result the number of vlps increased by 5 0 109 6 3 109 and 10 3 109 per ml in the presence of 0 002 0 01 and 0 1 mm cr vi respectively consequently the corresponding nh3 n oxidation rates were 2 7 2 1 and 1 3 n h l respectively choi et al 2010 the increment of vlps after exposure also indicated that cr vi triggered the activation of prophage in ammonia oxidizing bacteria culminating in cell lysis in short cu ii and cr vi are typical heavy metals and can serve as prophage inducers in both microbial pure culture systems and biological wastewater treatment processes therefore the influences of more heavy metals on phage host interactions should be elucidated especially for wwtps that receive industrial wastewater 4 3 2 antibiotics there are many kinds of antibiotics and they mainly inhibit or kill bacteria by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell wall increasing the permeability of cytoplasmic membrane inhibiting the synthesis of critical proteins or inhibiting nucleic acid replication however damage to bacterial host may activate the harbored prophages in microbial pure cultures system e coli carrying prophage λ is the most studied strain gots et al 1955 found that l azaserine can act as an inducer of prophage in lysogenic e coli k 12 λ research suggested that bleomycin functions by induction of dna strand breaks with a concentration of 10 μg l can result in a rapid prophage activation in exponentially growing cultures of e coli k12 λ busolo et al 1975 moreover it has been evinced that daunorubicin adriamycin and hydroxyurea are also mutagens and can induce prophage λ anderson et al 1980 bachur et al 1979 barbé et al 1987 most chemical inducers of prophage λ can damage dna either by forming a covalent adduct e g aflatoxin b1 miller and miller 2020 or by causing base damage removal e g bleomycin lown and sim 1977 besides of prophage λ los et al 2010 demonstrated that the presence of 0 2 μg ml of norfloxacin led to the activation of a shiga toxin converting prophage in e coli o157 h7 as shown in table 2 the reported antibiotics that act as prophage inducers all function by inhibiting nucleic acid replication but the effects of other types of antibiotics e g antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis on prophage activation are unclear notably among different antibiotics mitomycin c mitc which as a chemotherapeutic agent by virtue of its antitumor activity is used as the standard agent for prophage induction choi et al 2010 martín et al 2006 shousha et al 2015 tang et al 2019 overall a large number of antibiotics can act as prophage inducers but only a few have been demonstrated for their potential impact on the performance degradation of biological wastewater treatments for example ciprofloxacin in 0 05 0 4 mg l causes the death of paos resulting in the deterioration of phosphorus removal motlagh et al 2015 noteworthily antibiotics are unique threats in wwtps since they act as both the prophage inducer and the survival selection pressure of host which underlines the necessity of incorporating phage inducing capacity into the assessment of the spread risk of args 4 3 3 nanomaterials nanomaterials are typically incorporating metal nanoparticles and nonmetallic nanoparticles metal nanoparticles are applied in numerous areas such as biomedical imaging solar energy generation drug delivery electronic devices and biosensors due to their desirable optical and electrochemical properties the mechanisms and modes of metal nanoparticles toxic effect comprise oxidative stress inflammasome activation membrane damage genotoxicity and fibrosis tortella et al 2020 recently several metal nanomaterials have been identified as prophage inducers guo et al 2017 firstly showed that cuo nanoparticles up regulated the expression of phage pf1 gene cluster pa0717 pa0728 although there were no increases in lytic phage particles when p aeruginosa pao1 dsm22644 exposured to tested concentrations of cuo nanoparticles i e 0 1 10 and 50 mg l these genes showed extremely high expression with up to a 2031 fold elevate for pa0720 in the presence of 50 mg l cuo nanoparticles besides xu et al 2018 investigated the interactions of diversely functionalized cdte quantum dots with e coli containing lambda prophages e coli dsm4230 to declare the potential ability of mass produced quantum dots to induce prophage they found that a nanomolar concentration of cdte quantum dot low as 0 5 nm could lead to prophage release to date tremendous amounts of metal nanoparticles are manufactured for industrial and daily products kim et al 2010 nel et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 and wwtps inevitably receive these nanoparticles the heavy metal ion leaching and reactive oxygen species ros induction are critical contributors to the toxicity of metal nanoparticles franklin et al 2007 xia et al 2008 and both of them have the potential to induce prophages therefore the stabilization of functional microbiota in biological wastewater treatment where metal nanoparticles may be incorporated is of concern besides metal nanoparticles the potential phage inducing ability of nonmetallic nanoparticles cannot be ignored for example plastics with particle diameters 5 mm are known as microplastics which have aroused increasing concerns due to their ubiquitous pollution and toxicity risks to aquatic species and human beings lee et al 2013 richard et al 2004 the microplastics with a particle size 100 nm could be further subdivided into nanoplastics which are supposed to have more significant toxicity bouwmeester et al 2015 the toxicity of nanomaterials depends on their size typically the smaller the size the greater the toxicity the extensive sources of nanoplastics render their retention in various environments including wwtps enfrin et al 2019 sun et al 2019 nanoplastic induced ros might confer microplastic with the potential of prophage induction wei et al 2019 meanwhile the high field concentration of chemical additive emanated from the leaching behavior of nanoplastics might also induce prophage tang et al 2021 therefore the prophage induction potential of nanoplastics should be revealed in the future until today there is no work combined the prophage activation with the toxicity of metal nanoparticles or nonmetallic nanoparticles in biological wastewater treatment which deserves further attention due to the increasing exposure risk of nanoparticles 4 3 4 others in addition to the above inducers there are some factors that can also act as prophage inducer but they are not widely studied so we integrate them together for discussion firstly treatment with ultraviolet zhang et al 2020 or h2o2 los et al 2010 or some antibiotics generates invalidity of the repression system in some lysogenic bacteria and allows the production of phage so called spontaneous induction several extrinsic factors can trigger spontaneous prophage induction for example lunde et al 2005 investigated the impacts of several environmental conditions on the frequency of spontaneous ɸlc3 prophage induction in l lactis imnc1814 specifically the four environmental factors were growth broth dilution reflecting nutrient availability different initial ph reflecting acidity nacl addition reflecting osmolarity and growth temperature above the optimum for l lactis statistical analysis demonstrated that all tested factors affected the stability of prophage ɸlc3 and the separate environmental factors were involved in intricate interactions and the frequency of spontaneous prophage ɸlc3 induction simultaneously elevated from 0 08 to 1 76 a few studies have also employed changes in temperature chu et al 2011 kirby et al 1967 lunde et al 2005 nutrient availability lunde et al 2005 nikoleta et al 2015 williamson and paul 2006 wilson et al 1998 and ph choi et al 2010 wallin carlquist et al 2010 meijer et al 1998 to induce prophage in the single cell experiment besides of spontaneous induction various concentrations ranging from 0 015 mm to 0 3 mm of potassium cyanide kcn can induced prophage release from nitrosospira multiformis 25196 culture choi et al 2010 which highlighted the potential phage inducing capacity of the widespread toxicants one recent study showed that low intensity cold atmospheric plasma 35 2 w was 6 5 times more efficient in phage activation than the conventional mitc induction and had the potential for efficient bacterial inactivation and biofilm disruption gu et al 2022 in short there are many factors or substances besides heavy metal antibiotics and nanoparticles that can activate prophage expression those factors deserve particular attention since the composition of the influent water in wwtps is variable as far as we know the extent to which the development of phage host interactions driven by changes in influent composition e g nutrient availability affects biol the performance of biological wastewater treatment has not been considered 5 what should we do next 5 1 detailed descriptions of phage populations today the investments in phage related studies in different ecospheres are vastly different numerous studies have provided great insights into and underpin our understanding of phage ecology in marine and freshwater environments benefiting from the relatively easy viral separation procedure coutinho et al 2017 mojica et al 2016 paul 2008 suttle 2007 waldbauer et al 2019 in addition there are continually emerging researches on phage host interplay in more heterogeneous contaminated soil huang et al 2021 liang et al 2020 tang et al 2019 however knowledge regarding the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment in which bacteria play critical roles is limited the phage populations in different biological wastewater treatments should be further described through viral metagenomics and better methods for different phage extraction concentrations from wastewater should also be developed to avoid the experimental bias to rna phages one available approach is total transcriptome sequencing which can reveal the entire viromes in a sample in an unbiased manner chen et al 2022 in addition the distribution of prophage in the phage populations was poorly illuminated further development of tools that ascertain whether prophages are dormant or active on the basis of viral metagenomic data will be promising provide valuable information about the distributions of lysogeny and lysis in wwtps and how they depend on the environmental conditions in wwtps kieft and anantharaman 2021 in nature variations in the compositions of phage populations may thus have profound consequences e g shape microbial communities waller et al 2014 selection of resistance mutations meyer et al 2012 and modulation of bacterial mutation rate pal et al 2007 intuitively the contribution of phage populations in biological wastewater treatments should be comparable however there is no information regarding the contribution of phage populations to the development of the microbiome in such processes which might be limited by the fact that most microorganisms in wwtps cannot be isolated by culture dependent methods stable isotope probing sip analysis counts on the incorporation of a substrate that is highly enriched in a stable isotope e g 13c and the identification of active microbial populations by selective recovery and analysis of isotope enriched cellular components typically sip analysis enables us to link microbial activity and phylogeny in complex environments and has been successfully applied to identify active bacteria involved in the degradation of various contaminants dam et al 2019 dumont and murrell 2005 previously sip was used to target the phage related genes in soil lee et al 2012 li et al 2013 combining sip with viral metagenomics could enable us to evaluate the active phage populations in a restricted system obtaining the functional phage profiles involved in wastewater treatments will greatly advance potential phage applications in biological wastewater treatments rather than the current limited use scenarios e g biofilm elimination rogovski et al 2021 and foam control petrovski et al 2022 knowledge regarding phage bacterium interplay in wwtps is not nearly done and more works are needed to fully appreciate how abiotic factors and biodiversity impact phage bacterium ecological and evolutionary dynamics with a full understanding of phage populations in biological wastewater treatment we can more precisely describe the development of phage host interactions and even manipulate it for instance when a decrease in resident microbial populations driven by phage predation is found we can artificially create operating conditions that are more suitable for lysogenization e g reducing hydraulic retention time to flush out released free phages 5 2 more attention on prophage induction fairly limited studies referring to phage induction in complex environments were performed in comparison with microbial pure cultures system table 2 the prevalence of prophage inducers has been ignored in wwtps because the substances that can damage cells are ubiquitous during the conventional wastewater treatment processes one majority concern is that a large number of pollutants e g heavy metals nanoparticles and antibiotics are concentrated in wwtps luo et al 2020 it is certainly anticipated that a considerable part of microbiota collapse driven by phage induction has not been documented in fact there are some prophage inducers that may have high concentrations in wwtps and are likely to be affecting certain biological wastewater treatment processes for instance the typical cu ii concentration in dry sludge is about 200 mg kg which is equivalent to 4 0 mg l in the concentrated waste activated sludge counted as 20 g total solids l dai et al 2007 thus cu ii has great potential to affect the phage host interactions in some processes e g anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge although other low concentration phage inducers may be unable to initiate an observable collapse of the microbiota in biological wastewater treatment they may still affect phage host interactions through their combined effects besides prophage activation within resident microbial population provides a new perspective on the deteriorating performance of biological wastewater treatment under the stress of exogenous pollutants that is exogenous pollutants initiate the global lysis at least on a large scale of resident microbial population by activating prophages taking the above into account prophage activation in biological wastewater treatment deserves more attention furthermore the phage populations temperate phages in particular are increasingly considered an essential factor in maintaining the microbiota ecological function because temperate phages can furnish many benefits to bacterial hosts including the ability to respond rapidly to variations in the environment howard varona et al 2017 obeng et al 2016 warwick dugdale et al 2019 obviously global prophage activation in biological wastewater treatment will change the ecological functions of specific microbiota however to date the relationship between the ecological function changes of microbiota e g adaptability in the wastewater treatment process and prophage activation is poorly understood which should be elaborated in the future 6 concluding remarks studying the concepts of phage host interactions is pivotal for fundamental knowledge and more stable biological wastewater treatments in wwtps the biological wastewater treatment process recruit phage populations that are richer than the general environment it is becoming increasingly clear that the developments of phage host interactions are closely related to the performance of biological wastewater treatments however the stable microbiome in biological wastewater treatments is challenged by changes in phage host interaction such as predator prey dynamic and prophage induction these phage host interactions are driven by host density phage infection frequency and concentrated specific contaminants i e prophage inducers to achieve the ultimate goal of manipulating phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatments the profile of phage populations in wwtps needs to be better understood one the one hand more viral metagenomic studies attempt to describe the phage populations in wwtps is encouraged for the following reasons 1 wwtps may be an important source of polyvalent phages 2 the spatiotemporal distribution of environment dependent temperature phages is unclear and 3 little is known about the contribution of chronic phages in biological wastewater treatment on the other hand advances in methods e g sip will provide more insights into phage bacterium ecological and evolutionary dynamics in biological wastewater treatments besides abundant contaminants admitted to wwtps may cause the failure of biological wastewater treatment by activating prophages in a short term period a challenge that requires particular attention declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15324,in wastewater treatment plants wwtps the stable operation of biological wastewater treatment is strongly dependent on the stability of associated microbiota bacteriophages phages viruses that specifically infect bacteria and archaea are highly abundant and diverse in wwtps although phages do not have known metabolic functions for themselves they can shape functional microbiota via various phage host interactions to impact biological wastewater treatment however the developments of phage host interaction in wwtps and their impact on biological wastewater treatment are overlooked here we review the current knowledge regarding the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment mainly focusing on the characteristics of different phage populations the phage driven changes in functional microbiota and the potential driving factors of phage host interactions we also discuss the efforts required further to understand and manipulate the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment overall this review advocates more attention to the phage dynamics in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plants biological wastewater treatment phage host interaction environmental risk data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction bacteriophages phages are the virus that can infect bacteria archaea sorek et al 2008 and are the most abundant biological entity phages outnumber their host by approximately 10 fold on the earth rohwer 2003 suttle 2007 typically the canonical phage infection cycles are classified as productive cycle and non productive cycle fig 1 chevallereau et al 2021 warwick dugdale et al 2019 furthermore phages can be categorized into three types depending on their infection cycle 1 filamentous phages that follow a chronic cycle some of them enable to enter a non productive lysogenic cycle marvin et al 2014 2 temperate phages that characterized by their ability to be lysogenic the dormant state of temperate phages so called prophages will enter either a chronic or a lytic cycle upon induction and 3 virulent phages that replicate only through a lytic cycle fig 1 these phages are found in a wide variety of natural and artificial environments including wastewater treatment plants wwtps paez espino et al 2016 in wwtps biological treatments e g activated sludge method are the most common methods of meeting the constant demand for low cost and efficient wastewater treatment gernaey et al 2004 these methods recruit specific functional microbiota to degrade contaminants including excess nutrients in wastewater efficiently wu et al 2019 it is worth pointing out that in fact all microorganisms are functional but in this article functional microbiota specifically refers to microbiota that can achieve specific goal of biological wastewater treatment e g ammonia oxidizes bacteria the healthy development of functional microbiota is the priority of biological wastewater treatment and operational problems will occur e g degraded performance if the composition of the functional microbiota changes significantly in a short time different from adaptive evolution such as the acute exposure of exogenous pollutant fan et al 2020 generally phages can hijack the machinery e g transcription and resource e g nucleobase of their host for own replication which inhibits the growth of their host even lead to host lysis chevallereau et al 2021 conversely phage infection also can redirect bacterial metabolism through the expression of auxiliary metabolic genes amgs which might facilitate the fitness of their hosts lindell et al 2005 zheng et al 2022 therefore phages are deemed to shape the taxonomic and functional composition of microbiota as well as its stability suttle 1994 waller et al 2014 meanwhile phage driven microbiota changes have critical implications for larger scale ecological functions e g biogeochemical cycles breitbart et al 2018 roossinck 2011 although phages do not have known metabolic functions for themselves phage populations are closely related to associated abundance activity and community composition of their host in wwtps mathieu et al 2019 a recent study stated that phage infection widely spans 58 bacterial and 8 archaeal phyla in six wwtps and these viruses are linked with aerobic anaerobic heterotrophs and other functional microorganisms controlling nitrogen phosphorous removal and encode extensive amgs e g function related to carbon fixation pathways chen et al 2021 which implies that the developments of phage host interactions in wwtps is likely to affect functional microbiota and further impacting the related biological wastewater treatment recently liu et al 2021 well summarized phage ecology in wwtps and runa et al 2021 highlighted suitable methods for studying phages in wwtps but they neglected to review the driving factors of phage host interactions which may be important for future control strategies of biological wastewater treatment more important the performance changes in biological wastewater treatments were caused by changes in phage host interactions not phages themselves nevertheless the phage host interactions in wwtps have so far received very limited attention considering the central role of prokaryotes in biological wastewater treatments it is necessary to advocate the assessment of the phage host interactions in wwtps this work aims to review the state of the art knowledge regarding the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment in wwtps here we first summarized the characteristics of different phage populations including virulent phages temperate phages and chronic phages subsequently the effects of phage host interaction development i e phage predation and prophage induction on biological wastewater treatment was reviewed then the driving factors affecting phage host interactions was outlined in which highlighted the developments of phage host interactions in wwtps might be largely overlooked finally we demonstrated the challenges and proposed further research orientation toward phage host interactions research in wwtps in doing so this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the phage host interactions involved in biological wastewater treatment in wwtps and highlights the necessity to focus on phage dynamics within such an engineered environment 2 the phage populations in biological wastewater treatment 2 1 overall view in wwtps activated sludge is the most extensive biological method in existence xia et al 2010 and such process utilizes specific functional microbiota to reduce the levels of organic and inorganic compounds ju and zhang 2015 the number of phages in such an artificial habitat may be numerous as the microbe rich environment provides many potential hosts in a study in 1980 the maximum total phage concentrations in the fluid phase of sewage the activated sludge mixed liquor and the reactor effluent of an activated sludge wwtp were counted for 2 2 107 9 5 107 and 8 4 107 per ml respectively ewert donald and paynter 1980 however such data was based on direct electron microscopic counts of phage plaques thus these concentrations were skewed by ignoring phages that cause ineffective infections the introduction of fluorescent dyes has corrected for such negative deviation otawa et al 2007 and several studies support activated sludge has a higher viral abundance than that in other environments with a prevalent concentration of 107 to 1010 virus like particles vlps per ml otawa et al 2007 rosenberg et al 2010 wu and liu 2009 based on the pore size of the filter and the quantitative method vlps are usually defined as an individual visible concentrated nucleic acid stain not the particles themselves with a diameter of 0 02 0 22 μm as such these abundance estimates may be inaccurate including potential underestimated e g result from the exclusion of large viruses and the inability to see small rna or single stranded dna viruses or inflated e g resulting from counting small bacteria or membrane bound extracellular vesicles that are in the same size range as viruses biller et al 2016 forterre et al 2013 tomaru and nagasaki 2007 indeed the vlps to bacterial cells ratio in wwtps was presented to approximate 10 1 rosenberg et al 2010 which was similar to values obtained from marine rohwer and thurber 2009 and soil environments adriaenssens et al 2017 before the application of genomic techniques to characterize phage diversity the observations based on transmission electron microscopy have revealed a rich variety of phages in wwtps park et al 2007 whereafter some genomic based efforts have been made to uncover the phage diversity in the biological wastewater treatments calusinska et al 2016 li et al 2021 parmar et al 2018 tamaki et al 2012 wang et al 2018 but a large majority of viral associated sequences in metagenomic datasets do not align with any known sequence and constitute the so called viral dark matter krishnamurthy and wang 2017 based on the available knowledge the members of the family podoviridae short tailed phages from the caudovirales order could be the most abundant recognizable dna phages in activated sludge chen et al 2021 modin et al 2022 o brien et al 2017 moreover previous limitations of sample processing and sequencing techniques result in the poor detection of rna phages callanan et al 2021 recent studies expanded the number of complete rna phage sequences from 16 at that time the number of complete dna phage genomes exceeded 1000 to more than 1000 callanan et al 2020 indicating that rna phages might be also abundant and diverse in wwtps therefore the diversity of phage populations is also highly abundant in wwtps obviously the roles of different phage populations in biological wastewater treatment surely deserves more attention than that given to it so far when considering the impact of phage driven development of bacterial communities on other environments chevallereau et al 2021 consequently we summarized the latest knowledge regarding different types of phages in wwtps 2 2 virulent phages the top down effects the ecological concept that organismal growth and abundance are primarily regulated by predation instead of resource limitation derived from virulent phages on microbiota in biological wastewater treatments are well documented hantula et al 1991 kunin et al 2008 generally the relationship between virulent phages and their host have been thought to follow the kill the winner hypothesis which based on the lotka volterra interspecies competition model holds that a negative frequency dependent selection of microbial populations is the primary force driving the interaction between phages and their hosts thingstad 2000 winter et al 2010 virulent phages kill their hosts when releasing new virions threatening the health of functional microbiota in wwtps and the functional microbiota collapse driven by virulent phage predation will be discussed later reciprocally under phage mediated negative frequency dependent selection the rare taxa will continue to increase until the phage that infects it appears this interaction can lead to the periodical rise and fall of specific microbial populations which may help to maintain bacterial diversity by regulating the more competitive host genotype and allowing different microbe coexistence bouvier and del giorgio 2007 therefore virulent phages are inclined to maintain bacterial diversity since they offset the proliferation of a single dominant species in biological wastewater treatment virulent phages might play a significant role in maintaining community diversity in the context of fierce competition and community diversity is the basis of functional redundancy in biological wastewater treatments rodriguez valera et al 2009 shapiro et al 2010 2 3 temperate phages in different habitats the distribution of lytic cycle virulent phages and lysogenic temperate phages cycle is unevenly and is regarded to be driven by host density at least partly erez et al 2017 typically lytic replication cycle is generally favored under conditions in which the prokaryotic hosts of phages can proliferate and reach high densities whereas lysogeny is generally favored when corresponding host abundance is low this long established concept is well supported by theoretical and experimental studies berngruber et al 2013 berngruber et al 2015 but data from environmental studies is ambiguous some studies have reported a positive negative correlation between the frequency of lytic lysogenic phages and host density liang et al 2020 whereas other studies reported weak or no correlations knowles et al 2017 contradicting this view the nutrient rich bacterially dense habitat of the mammalian gut is dominated by lysogenic bacteria kim and bae 2018 mathieu et al 2020 touchon et al 2016 knowles et al 2016 proposed the piggyback the winner model to describe the relationship between lysogeny infection and host density wherein lysogeny becomes increasingly predominant in ecosystems with high microbial densities the piggyback the winner model predicts that at high host densities temperate phages are favored to exploit their hosts through lysogeny with increasing host density lysogen resistance to infection by related viruses may become increasingly important thingstad et al 2014 the distribution of virulent and temperate phage in wwtps is uncertain partly attributed to the nutritional status in biological wastewater treatment obscure specifically municipal wastewater usually contains many nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus which can be called a nutrient rich environment alternatively the abundant microbes make a fierce competition for resources in sludge so the individual cells are under limited nutrient availability in wwtps lysogenic strategy may be favored as lysogenic infection may confer an ecological competitive advantage in such habitat since prophages and their hosts are retained while free phage particles are continually washed out with the effluents breitbart et al 2018 generally speaking the percentage of lysogen bacterial cells containing an inducible prophage to the total number of bacteria varies between undetectable and over 80 which depends on different environments and induction methods weinbauer 2004 of note temperate phages are heterogeneous populations since not all temperate phages enter the lysogenic cycle upon infection feiner et al 2015 although there are no available estimates of percent lysogeny in wwtps the importance of temperate phages is not negligible given their unique life cycle especially given that temperate phages can complicate the top down effect because prophages can exit the dormant form either upon exogenous stimuli or spontaneously and switch to the lytic cycle such particular behavior is called prophage induction and will be discussed in more detailed later 2 4 chronic phages most chronic phages identified to date belong to the family inoviridae which is composed of filamentous single stranded dna ssdna phage species roux et al 2019 a recent survey expanded the number of known inovirus sequences by two orders of magnitude indicating the prevalence of chronic phages roux et al 2019 meanwhile the abundance of inoviruses in a defined ecosystem may be overestimated due to the amplification protocols used before library preparation that introduce a positive bias towards small ssdna but their diversity is remarkable in consideration of their association to hosts spans the domains archaea and bacteria including almost all bacterial phyla hay and lithgow 2019 mai prochnow et al 2015b roux et al 2019 a notable characteristic of filamentous phages is their ability to replicate without killing their host in contrast to true lysogens the filamentous phage commonly continually sheds viral particles without host cell death even when inserted into the bacterial genome as a prophage askora et al 2011 das et al 2011 mcleod et al 2005 filamentous phages predominantly infect gram negative bacteria and make an important contribution to host physiology ecology and virulence reviewed by mai prochnow et al 2015a to date the interactions between chronic phages and their host in wwtps is less documented but the roles of chronic phages in other ecosystems speculate on their ecological role in biological wastewater treatment for example filamentous phages f327 confer properties advantageous to its host survival in the arctic sea ice environment where microbes are subject to many extreme conditions yu et al 2015 besides the structural formation of biofilm attached and aggregated microbes surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix flemming and wingender 2010 might be correlated with filamentous phages in one study pf phages produced new filamentous virions that can self assemble with the host produced extracellular matrix thus promoting the formation of robust biofilms by their bacterial host pseudomonas aeruginosa by enhancing adhesion and tolerance to desiccation and antibiotics secor et al 2015 these observations imply that filamentous phages may enhance host fitness through metabolic redirection and their special physical characteristics recent studies suggested that filamentous phages may contribute to the development of aerobic granules sludge by releasing extracellular dna or playing a structural component chan et al 2021 wang et al 2020 overall chronic phages receive less attention in biological wastewater treatment than virulent phages even temperate phages but they may have more fascinating interactions with their hosts 3 effects of the developments of phage host interaction on the performance of biological wastewater treatment wwtps are particular interesting environments because there is a constant large influx of phages and bacteria from the sewage but also significant resident populations involved in the biological processing these recruited resident populations for specific wastewater treatment tasks have a relatively stable pattern sun et al 2021 even though phage populations have been long term neglected in wwtps phage host interactions have recently attracted interest due to their potential impact on resident populations krysiak baltyn et al 2017 olsen et al 2020 generally chronic phages that do not lyse their hosts are rarely discussed separately in biological wastewater treatment because quantifying the effects of chronic phages is very difficult in such a complex environment in contrast virulent phages and temperate phages by prophage induction have the potential to alter the resident functional microbiota via lysing their hosts and thus affect related biological wastewater treatment performance fig 2 to date scientists have so far found that the development of phage host interactions can affect the performance of quite a few biological wastewater treatment processes including nitrification denitrification dissolved organic carbon removal and phosphate removal therefore the effects of the predator prey dynamic driven by virulent phages and the prophage induction related to temperate phages on biological wastewater treatment performance were next reviewed 3 1 predator prey dynamic phage predation can initiate predator prey dynamics in biological wastewater treatments recently the influences of changing microbiota driven by phage predation on biological wastewater treatment performance have been observed in wwtps table 1 liu et al 2017 addressed the knowledge gap of phage population dynamics defined as the number of phages changing over time during sludge bulking they observed a significant decrease in nitrifying bacteria abundance with sludge bulking the viral contigs linked with nitrifiers were identified more frequently and with greater abundance in the viromes defined as the ensembles of viral genomes within a given habitat retrieved from the bulking sludge samples these results implied that phage predation might contribute to the loss of autotrophic nitrifiers under bulking conditions liu et al 2017 during two years of monitoring in a full scale activated sludge plant the virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude 3 18 108 to 3 41 109 vlps per ml and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance community composition and effluent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n and system function brown et al 2019 in a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor mainly accumulibacter barr et al 2010 found the unexpected decrement in the phosphorus removal performance of enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr was attributed to phage predation and not a result of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos glycogen accumulating organisms gaos competition in full scale wwtps albertsen et al 2012 2013 further revealed the potential importance of phage predation on the dynamics of accumulibacter populations by metagenomic sequencing these observations suggested phage predation can shape microbiota in activated sludge and further affect the performance of activated sludge the predator prey dynamics may explain some previous observations such as the re occurring seasonal pattern of bacterial community dynamics in a full scale ebpr plant flowers et al 2013 phage predation may also exert positive effects on biological wastewater treatments in a sludge bulking sewage plant dominated by slow growing microthrix parvicella the abundances of microthrix associated viral genotypes were low whereas viruses related to fast growing taxa were abundant this implies that phage predation for fast growing hosts may facilitate the overgrowth of m parvicella liu et al 2017 however the contribution of phage predation to the development of slow growing functional bacterial communities e g anammox bacteria remains unknown overall the predator driven microbiota collapse in biological wastewater treatment remains poorly characterized this situation may result from inadequate research effort or the high microbial diversity found in biological wastewater treatment where the activity of competing populations compensates selective lysis of a population accountable to a specific metabolic function flowers et al 2013 3 2 prophage induction since the dissemination of temperate phages can be both horizontal and vertical not depending on host lysis the fitness interests of temperate phages and their hosts are more aligned resulting in more mutualistic or less destructive behaviors compared with virulent phages it has been speculated that phage associated sequences can account for 10 20 of the genome sequences of infecting bacteria canchaya et al 2003 and a plethora of auxiliary metabolic and functional genes have been identified in prophages calero cáceres et al 2019 ghosh et al 2008 tang et al 2019 problematically temperate phages can result in substantial host mortality by inducing prophage brum et al 2016 or driving the evolution of ultra virulent mutants cornuault et al 2020 although ultra virulent mutants are difficult to observe in the fleeting environment of wwtps prophage induction can lead to a surge in host lysis in short period and an observable failure of biological wastewater treatments motlagh et al 2015 illustrated that prophage activation besides phage predation was responsible for some failed ebpr processes in that study the addition of copper ion 0 05 to 1 mg l cyanide 50 to1000 mg l and ciprofloxacin 0 05 to 0 4 mg ml resulted in prophage release within 6 h and a decline in the polyphosphate kinase gene ppk1 clades copy number phosphorus accumulation capacity and phosphorus removal performance motlagh et al 2015 therefore the prophage induction derived from specific chemical agents i e prophage inducers could negatively affect the wastewater treatment process our recent work showed that benzyl butyl phthalate which is generally derived from the leaching of plastic fragments can induce prophage in a microbiota centered on the short chain fatty acid scfa producers leading to scfa accumulation upset in the sludge anaerobic digestion reactor table 1 tang et al 2021 in short the prophage induction can cause excess host lysis and the latter is responsible for certain wastewater treatment failures 4 the driving factor of phage host interactions for any kind of phage its relationship with their host is related to corresponding host density and infection frequency which is determined by its essence of parasite thus both host density and infection frequency can drive the development of phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment for example in a laboratory scale anoxic aerobic system the simultaneous exposure to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole significantly inhibited the abundance of phages and bacteria but the phage delivery receptor binding protein genes was increased and phages population restored faster than bacteria du et al 2021 these results suggested on the one hand the existence of host density dependent phage population dynamic in such habitat and on the other hand implied that the host range of phages was evolved as infection frequency declined in addition the relationship between temperature phages and their host is also affected by prophage inducers hereinafter we have outlined the latest knowledge regarding the driving factors of phage host interactions and described how these drivers potentially affect biological wastewater treatment 4 1 host density the density of host is decisive for the proliferation of different phages exactly as kill the winner hypothesis for virulent phage and piggyback the winner hypothesis for temperate phage the sequencing data from four anaerobic digesters in full scale wastewater treatment plants across china demonstrated phage and prokaryotic groups fluctuated monthly over a year study period showing significant correlations between those two groups at the α and β diversity levels zhang et al 2017 these results supported that cell lysis could be a density driven cycle although microbial communities vary widely in different biological treatment systems abiotic factors such as temperature chen and chang 2017 sun et al 2021 and ph zhang et al 2011 can strongly shape microbial communities in wwtps which may lead to drastic changes in host density currently many pretreatment methods have been applied in wwtps and such methods enhance the biodegradability of waste activated sludge by destroying the sludge structure zeng et al 2022 therefore the disintegration of sludge particles is expected to alter phage host interactions during sludge anaerobic digestion largely furthermore changes in the host density of polyvalent phages in biological wastewater treatment are more difficult to estimate generally phage host range depends on the specificity of the interaction between phage attachment structures and host cell surface receptors although phages are generally assumed to display narrow host specificities polyvalent phages viruses that can infect different bacteria so called broad host range phages have been frequently isolated from wwtps khan et al 2002 yu et al 2016 one recent study demonstrated a weak host specialism of the staphylococcal phages from wastewater in wwtps and this suggests the potentially wide host range of phages in such habitat göller et al 2021 wwtps are biologically dense environment where special in that it has a stable resident population and a variable floating population sun et al 2021 the influx of floating populations gives polyvalent phages an ecological advantage because they have the opportunity to infect more potential hosts correspondingly resident population facilitated the specialized phages and robust specialized phages in turn reduce the density of resident population through phage predation or prophage induction in addition multiple in vitro meyer et al 2016 2012 sant et al 2021 and recent in vivo cornuault et al 2020 de sordi et al 2017 evolution experiments have demonstrated that the range of host infection is a highly evolvable trait which can expand or contract heineman et al 2008 meyer et al 2012 therefore when considering phage host interaction development driven by host density the complexity of the host range should also be taken into account 4 2 infection frequency in wwtps the infection frequency of different phages has different consequences on the one hand when the infection frequency of virulent phages is high then excessive death of prokaryotes may occur although there are many differences between different virulent phages such as titer and infection cycle on the other hand when the infection frequency of temperature phages is high although homoimmunity conferred by prophages inhibits the subsequent infection of its host by a closely related phage these latent prophages would be timebomb because when induced they could trigger the collapse of the microbiota in biological wastewater treatment due to the lack of high resolution high coverage phage host association datasets it is unknown what factors can significantly alter the infection frequency of specific phages in biological wastewater treatment nevertheless the available evidence gives us a glimpse into the changes in the ability of phages to infect in biological wastewater treatments virulent phages and their host undergo special coevolutionary dynamics which is called arms race where phage infectivity and host resistance generally increase over time prokaryotes have developed many strategies to limit the invasion of phages and they can be divided into two classes 1 a well studied class of protein based defense mechanisms which perform a variety of defense behaviors such as preventing phage entry adsorption injection targeting phage nucleic acids restriction modification systems crispr cas systems abortive infection toxin antitoxin systems and phage assembly interference reviewed by azam and tanji 2019 rostøl and marraffini 2019 and 2 a new chemical anti phage defense mechanism kronheim et al 2018 some of these defense mechanisms have been observed in wwtps for instance kunin et al 2008 found that highly related and geographically remote candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis cap strains differed mostly in genomic regions encoding phage defense mechanisms by analyzing metagenomics data from cap dominated laboratory scale ebpr bioreactors in the usa and australia indicating that cap strains are globally dispersed but must adapt to phage predation pressure locally in the comparison between the crispr loci identified and reconstructed from ebpr sludge metagenomics data with the phage genome skennerton et al 2013 also demonstrated the arms race in which phages persist in the system and evolve rapidly in response to the crispr imposed resistance of the host however the endless defense and counter defense process between hosts and phages inevitably multiplied the cost of bacterial resistance and phage infectious resistance therefore the arms race dynamics may decay and eventually be replaced by fluctuating selection dynamics where phage and host genotype frequencies oscillate over time because of negative frequency dependent selection hall et al 2011 interestingly just like the kill the winner hypothesis the fluctuating selection dynamics may give an advantage to rare bacterial resistance alleles through phage evolution to infect common bacterial genotypes gandon et al 2008 in addition arms race could even arise between different phages recently phage encoded crispr cas systems targeting other phages medvedeva et al 2019 pausch et al 2020 or systems triggering premature lysis of competing phages hays and seed 2020 have been uncovered and the mechanisms that allow phages to overcome these restrictions have also been identified bondy denomy et al 2016 these competitive behaviors limited global phage infection in biological wastewater treatment but phages will also continue to evolve to circumvent the limitations of their potential hosts de jonge et al 2019 inevitably comprehensive arms race makes it difficult to assess the exact frequency of phages infections 4 3 prophage inducer there is a specific repression system in lysogens which is genetically determined by the prophage and can prevent the expression of essential genes required by progeny virions while bacteria serve as a sanctuary for prophages prophages can excise from the host chromosome to commence a potential lytic cycle when detection of host cell damage fornelos et al 2016 tzipilevich et al 2017 if such lysis cycle occurs globally it has the potential to threaten the operation of biological wastewater treatment in wwtps a typical scenario is that the influent contains prophage inducer at high concentration which induce a large number of virion release when they contact with lysogens in biological wastewater treatment the released virion can further lyse more potential hosts eventually leading to the collapse of the resident microbial population there are many substances that can damage lysogens and initiate prophage activation we thus reviewed the prophage inducers that have been proven to induce prophages in laboratory scale biological wastewater treatment table 2 and with particular focus on the potential prophage inducers that may be present in wwtps 4 3 1 heavy metals heavy metals are of concern because of their persistence and biological toxicity yi et al 2011 zou et al 2016 in general heavy metals exert toxicity on cell by inducing oxidative stress and interfering with protein folding and function nies 1999 which may induce prophage release lee et al 2006 firstly demonstrated the prophage activation capacity of copper ions cu ii after 6 h of induction the plaque forming units pfus per 1 0 106 as 1 lysogenic phage bearing a nidulans were 13 6 0 2 control 27 4 1 2 with 3 1 10 4 m cuso4 24 8 1 6 with 3 1 10 5 m cuso4 and 39 2 0 4 with 3 1 10 6 m cuso4 respectively lee et al 2006 this result indicated that cu ii could serve as prophage inducer within a short period but high concentration of cu ii induces lethality furthermore the presence of cu ii 0 05 to 1 00 mg l led to prophage activation in the ebpr reactor and impeded the performance of phosphorus removal motlagh et al 2015 chromium cr is another widespread heavy metal which usually exists in an oxidation state in the environment i e cr iii and cr vi typically more toxic cr vi could attack membrane lipids dna and proteins thereby disrupting cellular integrity and functions when inside the cell meyn et al 1977 further triggering an sos response which might eventually lead to prophage activation in one study cr vi at five different levels 0 002 to 1 mm were spiked to evaluate its impact on nitrosospira multiformis 25196 an ammonia oxidizing bacteria and its potential for phage induction as a result the number of vlps increased by 5 0 109 6 3 109 and 10 3 109 per ml in the presence of 0 002 0 01 and 0 1 mm cr vi respectively consequently the corresponding nh3 n oxidation rates were 2 7 2 1 and 1 3 n h l respectively choi et al 2010 the increment of vlps after exposure also indicated that cr vi triggered the activation of prophage in ammonia oxidizing bacteria culminating in cell lysis in short cu ii and cr vi are typical heavy metals and can serve as prophage inducers in both microbial pure culture systems and biological wastewater treatment processes therefore the influences of more heavy metals on phage host interactions should be elucidated especially for wwtps that receive industrial wastewater 4 3 2 antibiotics there are many kinds of antibiotics and they mainly inhibit or kill bacteria by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell wall increasing the permeability of cytoplasmic membrane inhibiting the synthesis of critical proteins or inhibiting nucleic acid replication however damage to bacterial host may activate the harbored prophages in microbial pure cultures system e coli carrying prophage λ is the most studied strain gots et al 1955 found that l azaserine can act as an inducer of prophage in lysogenic e coli k 12 λ research suggested that bleomycin functions by induction of dna strand breaks with a concentration of 10 μg l can result in a rapid prophage activation in exponentially growing cultures of e coli k12 λ busolo et al 1975 moreover it has been evinced that daunorubicin adriamycin and hydroxyurea are also mutagens and can induce prophage λ anderson et al 1980 bachur et al 1979 barbé et al 1987 most chemical inducers of prophage λ can damage dna either by forming a covalent adduct e g aflatoxin b1 miller and miller 2020 or by causing base damage removal e g bleomycin lown and sim 1977 besides of prophage λ los et al 2010 demonstrated that the presence of 0 2 μg ml of norfloxacin led to the activation of a shiga toxin converting prophage in e coli o157 h7 as shown in table 2 the reported antibiotics that act as prophage inducers all function by inhibiting nucleic acid replication but the effects of other types of antibiotics e g antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis on prophage activation are unclear notably among different antibiotics mitomycin c mitc which as a chemotherapeutic agent by virtue of its antitumor activity is used as the standard agent for prophage induction choi et al 2010 martín et al 2006 shousha et al 2015 tang et al 2019 overall a large number of antibiotics can act as prophage inducers but only a few have been demonstrated for their potential impact on the performance degradation of biological wastewater treatments for example ciprofloxacin in 0 05 0 4 mg l causes the death of paos resulting in the deterioration of phosphorus removal motlagh et al 2015 noteworthily antibiotics are unique threats in wwtps since they act as both the prophage inducer and the survival selection pressure of host which underlines the necessity of incorporating phage inducing capacity into the assessment of the spread risk of args 4 3 3 nanomaterials nanomaterials are typically incorporating metal nanoparticles and nonmetallic nanoparticles metal nanoparticles are applied in numerous areas such as biomedical imaging solar energy generation drug delivery electronic devices and biosensors due to their desirable optical and electrochemical properties the mechanisms and modes of metal nanoparticles toxic effect comprise oxidative stress inflammasome activation membrane damage genotoxicity and fibrosis tortella et al 2020 recently several metal nanomaterials have been identified as prophage inducers guo et al 2017 firstly showed that cuo nanoparticles up regulated the expression of phage pf1 gene cluster pa0717 pa0728 although there were no increases in lytic phage particles when p aeruginosa pao1 dsm22644 exposured to tested concentrations of cuo nanoparticles i e 0 1 10 and 50 mg l these genes showed extremely high expression with up to a 2031 fold elevate for pa0720 in the presence of 50 mg l cuo nanoparticles besides xu et al 2018 investigated the interactions of diversely functionalized cdte quantum dots with e coli containing lambda prophages e coli dsm4230 to declare the potential ability of mass produced quantum dots to induce prophage they found that a nanomolar concentration of cdte quantum dot low as 0 5 nm could lead to prophage release to date tremendous amounts of metal nanoparticles are manufactured for industrial and daily products kim et al 2010 nel et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 and wwtps inevitably receive these nanoparticles the heavy metal ion leaching and reactive oxygen species ros induction are critical contributors to the toxicity of metal nanoparticles franklin et al 2007 xia et al 2008 and both of them have the potential to induce prophages therefore the stabilization of functional microbiota in biological wastewater treatment where metal nanoparticles may be incorporated is of concern besides metal nanoparticles the potential phage inducing ability of nonmetallic nanoparticles cannot be ignored for example plastics with particle diameters 5 mm are known as microplastics which have aroused increasing concerns due to their ubiquitous pollution and toxicity risks to aquatic species and human beings lee et al 2013 richard et al 2004 the microplastics with a particle size 100 nm could be further subdivided into nanoplastics which are supposed to have more significant toxicity bouwmeester et al 2015 the toxicity of nanomaterials depends on their size typically the smaller the size the greater the toxicity the extensive sources of nanoplastics render their retention in various environments including wwtps enfrin et al 2019 sun et al 2019 nanoplastic induced ros might confer microplastic with the potential of prophage induction wei et al 2019 meanwhile the high field concentration of chemical additive emanated from the leaching behavior of nanoplastics might also induce prophage tang et al 2021 therefore the prophage induction potential of nanoplastics should be revealed in the future until today there is no work combined the prophage activation with the toxicity of metal nanoparticles or nonmetallic nanoparticles in biological wastewater treatment which deserves further attention due to the increasing exposure risk of nanoparticles 4 3 4 others in addition to the above inducers there are some factors that can also act as prophage inducer but they are not widely studied so we integrate them together for discussion firstly treatment with ultraviolet zhang et al 2020 or h2o2 los et al 2010 or some antibiotics generates invalidity of the repression system in some lysogenic bacteria and allows the production of phage so called spontaneous induction several extrinsic factors can trigger spontaneous prophage induction for example lunde et al 2005 investigated the impacts of several environmental conditions on the frequency of spontaneous ɸlc3 prophage induction in l lactis imnc1814 specifically the four environmental factors were growth broth dilution reflecting nutrient availability different initial ph reflecting acidity nacl addition reflecting osmolarity and growth temperature above the optimum for l lactis statistical analysis demonstrated that all tested factors affected the stability of prophage ɸlc3 and the separate environmental factors were involved in intricate interactions and the frequency of spontaneous prophage ɸlc3 induction simultaneously elevated from 0 08 to 1 76 a few studies have also employed changes in temperature chu et al 2011 kirby et al 1967 lunde et al 2005 nutrient availability lunde et al 2005 nikoleta et al 2015 williamson and paul 2006 wilson et al 1998 and ph choi et al 2010 wallin carlquist et al 2010 meijer et al 1998 to induce prophage in the single cell experiment besides of spontaneous induction various concentrations ranging from 0 015 mm to 0 3 mm of potassium cyanide kcn can induced prophage release from nitrosospira multiformis 25196 culture choi et al 2010 which highlighted the potential phage inducing capacity of the widespread toxicants one recent study showed that low intensity cold atmospheric plasma 35 2 w was 6 5 times more efficient in phage activation than the conventional mitc induction and had the potential for efficient bacterial inactivation and biofilm disruption gu et al 2022 in short there are many factors or substances besides heavy metal antibiotics and nanoparticles that can activate prophage expression those factors deserve particular attention since the composition of the influent water in wwtps is variable as far as we know the extent to which the development of phage host interactions driven by changes in influent composition e g nutrient availability affects biol the performance of biological wastewater treatment has not been considered 5 what should we do next 5 1 detailed descriptions of phage populations today the investments in phage related studies in different ecospheres are vastly different numerous studies have provided great insights into and underpin our understanding of phage ecology in marine and freshwater environments benefiting from the relatively easy viral separation procedure coutinho et al 2017 mojica et al 2016 paul 2008 suttle 2007 waldbauer et al 2019 in addition there are continually emerging researches on phage host interplay in more heterogeneous contaminated soil huang et al 2021 liang et al 2020 tang et al 2019 however knowledge regarding the phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatment in which bacteria play critical roles is limited the phage populations in different biological wastewater treatments should be further described through viral metagenomics and better methods for different phage extraction concentrations from wastewater should also be developed to avoid the experimental bias to rna phages one available approach is total transcriptome sequencing which can reveal the entire viromes in a sample in an unbiased manner chen et al 2022 in addition the distribution of prophage in the phage populations was poorly illuminated further development of tools that ascertain whether prophages are dormant or active on the basis of viral metagenomic data will be promising provide valuable information about the distributions of lysogeny and lysis in wwtps and how they depend on the environmental conditions in wwtps kieft and anantharaman 2021 in nature variations in the compositions of phage populations may thus have profound consequences e g shape microbial communities waller et al 2014 selection of resistance mutations meyer et al 2012 and modulation of bacterial mutation rate pal et al 2007 intuitively the contribution of phage populations in biological wastewater treatments should be comparable however there is no information regarding the contribution of phage populations to the development of the microbiome in such processes which might be limited by the fact that most microorganisms in wwtps cannot be isolated by culture dependent methods stable isotope probing sip analysis counts on the incorporation of a substrate that is highly enriched in a stable isotope e g 13c and the identification of active microbial populations by selective recovery and analysis of isotope enriched cellular components typically sip analysis enables us to link microbial activity and phylogeny in complex environments and has been successfully applied to identify active bacteria involved in the degradation of various contaminants dam et al 2019 dumont and murrell 2005 previously sip was used to target the phage related genes in soil lee et al 2012 li et al 2013 combining sip with viral metagenomics could enable us to evaluate the active phage populations in a restricted system obtaining the functional phage profiles involved in wastewater treatments will greatly advance potential phage applications in biological wastewater treatments rather than the current limited use scenarios e g biofilm elimination rogovski et al 2021 and foam control petrovski et al 2022 knowledge regarding phage bacterium interplay in wwtps is not nearly done and more works are needed to fully appreciate how abiotic factors and biodiversity impact phage bacterium ecological and evolutionary dynamics with a full understanding of phage populations in biological wastewater treatment we can more precisely describe the development of phage host interactions and even manipulate it for instance when a decrease in resident microbial populations driven by phage predation is found we can artificially create operating conditions that are more suitable for lysogenization e g reducing hydraulic retention time to flush out released free phages 5 2 more attention on prophage induction fairly limited studies referring to phage induction in complex environments were performed in comparison with microbial pure cultures system table 2 the prevalence of prophage inducers has been ignored in wwtps because the substances that can damage cells are ubiquitous during the conventional wastewater treatment processes one majority concern is that a large number of pollutants e g heavy metals nanoparticles and antibiotics are concentrated in wwtps luo et al 2020 it is certainly anticipated that a considerable part of microbiota collapse driven by phage induction has not been documented in fact there are some prophage inducers that may have high concentrations in wwtps and are likely to be affecting certain biological wastewater treatment processes for instance the typical cu ii concentration in dry sludge is about 200 mg kg which is equivalent to 4 0 mg l in the concentrated waste activated sludge counted as 20 g total solids l dai et al 2007 thus cu ii has great potential to affect the phage host interactions in some processes e g anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge although other low concentration phage inducers may be unable to initiate an observable collapse of the microbiota in biological wastewater treatment they may still affect phage host interactions through their combined effects besides prophage activation within resident microbial population provides a new perspective on the deteriorating performance of biological wastewater treatment under the stress of exogenous pollutants that is exogenous pollutants initiate the global lysis at least on a large scale of resident microbial population by activating prophages taking the above into account prophage activation in biological wastewater treatment deserves more attention furthermore the phage populations temperate phages in particular are increasingly considered an essential factor in maintaining the microbiota ecological function because temperate phages can furnish many benefits to bacterial hosts including the ability to respond rapidly to variations in the environment howard varona et al 2017 obeng et al 2016 warwick dugdale et al 2019 obviously global prophage activation in biological wastewater treatment will change the ecological functions of specific microbiota however to date the relationship between the ecological function changes of microbiota e g adaptability in the wastewater treatment process and prophage activation is poorly understood which should be elaborated in the future 6 concluding remarks studying the concepts of phage host interactions is pivotal for fundamental knowledge and more stable biological wastewater treatments in wwtps the biological wastewater treatment process recruit phage populations that are richer than the general environment it is becoming increasingly clear that the developments of phage host interactions are closely related to the performance of biological wastewater treatments however the stable microbiome in biological wastewater treatments is challenged by changes in phage host interaction such as predator prey dynamic and prophage induction these phage host interactions are driven by host density phage infection frequency and concentrated specific contaminants i e prophage inducers to achieve the ultimate goal of manipulating phage host interactions in biological wastewater treatments the profile of phage populations in wwtps needs to be better understood one the one hand more viral metagenomic studies attempt to describe the phage populations in wwtps is encouraged for the following reasons 1 wwtps may be an important source of polyvalent phages 2 the spatiotemporal distribution of environment dependent temperature phages is unclear and 3 little is known about the contribution of chronic phages in biological wastewater treatment on the other hand advances in methods e g sip will provide more insights into phage bacterium ecological and evolutionary dynamics in biological wastewater treatments besides abundant contaminants admitted to wwtps may cause the failure of biological wastewater treatment by activating prophages in a short term period a challenge that requires particular attention declaration of competing interest the authors declare
