11620,the agricultural production systems simulator apsim is a key tool to identify agricultural management practices seeking to simultaneously optimize agronomic productivity and input use efficiencies the aims of this study were to validate apsim for prediction of stover and grain yield of corn in four contrasting soils with varied n fertilizer applications 156 269kgnha 1 and to predict timing and volume from artificial subsurface drains in continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in a silty clay loam soil at west lafayette in the apsim validation was carried out using a long term dataset of corn stover and grain yields from the north central region of in the ccc concordance correlation coefficient and sb simulation bias were used to statistically evaluate the model performance the ccc integrates precision through pearson s correlation coefficient and accuracy by bias and sb indicates the bias of the simulation from the measurement the model demonstrated very good ccc 0 96 sb 0 and satisfactory ccc 0 85 sb 2 ability to simulate stover and grain yield respectively grain yield was better predicted in continuous corn ccc 0 73 0 91 sb 19 21 than in corn soybean rotations ccc 0 56 0 63 sb 17 18 while stover yield was well predicted in both crop rotations ccc 0 85 0 98 sb 1 17 the model demonstrated acceptable ability to simulate annual subsurface drainage in both rotations ccc 0 63 0 75 sb 2 37 with accuracy being lower in the continuous corn system than in corn soybean rotation system ccc 0 61 0 63 sb 9 12 daily subsurface drainage events were well predicted by apsim during late spring and summer when crop water use was high but under predicted during fall winter and early spring when evapotranspiration was low occasional flow events occurring in summer when soils were not saturated were not predicted by apsim and may represent preferential flow paths currently not represented in the model apsim is a promising tool for simulating yield and water losses for corn based cropping systems in north central indiana us keywords maize corn based cropping systems water flow model validation indiana 1 introduction the us corn belt is not only an important contributor for global corn zea mays l grain supply but also is an increasing provider of cellulosic feedstock for biofuels perlack et al 2005 wilhelm et al 2007 wallander et al 2011 in fact bioenergy products are essential elements for a global policy to increase energy supplies and reduce dependence on petroleum perlack et al 2005 currently corn grain accounts for the feedstock of more than 90 of the feedstock used for us ethanol production morris and hill 2006 however corn stover is expected to provide the majority of the estimated biofuel from crop residues in the future graham et al 2007 cibin et al 2012 stover residues on soil surface protect it from erosion and contributes to soil organic carbon pools shaver et al 2003 wilhelm et al 2007 a key factor of soil quality wilhelm et al 2004 surface residues also reduce water losses by runoff and evaporation hatfield 2015 as a consequence there is increasing concern of the potential negative impacts of removing stover for biomass on soil and water resources and the environment jaynes and miller 1999 zhang et al 2001 caviglia et al 2004 hatfield 2015 stephens et al 2001 simpson et al 2008 graham et al 2007 the most extensively used crop rotations in the us corn belt are continuous corn and corn soybean glycine max l merr rainfall often exceeds evapotranspiration et in spring king et al 2014 delaying crop establishment and in fall slowing harvest smith et al 2015 generating excess water this excess soil water is commonly drained through a network of subsurface tile or perforated plastic drains randall et al 1997 smith and pappas 2007 smith et al 2015 it has been estimated that 25 of the land currently in crop production in us and canada could not be farmed without a subsurface drainage system skaggs et al 1994 and 37 of us corn belt has benefited from these systems zucker and brown 1998 biophysical models are a key tool to predict impacts of crop management scenarios on both watershed hydrology cibin et al 2016 and stover production persson et al 2009 although considerable effort has been devoted in the development of simulation models for hydrological processes at watershed scale e g hanson et al 1998 arnold et al 1998 cibin et al 2016 the validation of certain processes like subsurface water loss from artificial drains and corn stover biomass production have not been thoroughly evaluated for the us corn belt dietzel et al 2016 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 has been shown to predict biomass production of perennial rhizomatous grasses across several us environments ojeda et al 2017 and grain yields of corn lyon et al 2003 hammer et al 2009 lobell et al 2013 archontoulis et al 2014a and soybean malone et al 2007 archontoulis et al 2014b dietzel et al 2016 the ability of apsim to accurately predict stover and grain yields of corn while simultaneously estimating the timing and volume of subsurface drainage from these fields is not known corn growth using the maize module of apsim has been tested in several environments carberry et al 1989 1996 shamudzarira and robertson 2002 chen et al 2010 liu et al 2012 pembleton et al 2013 several sub module routines representing key processes like growth soil water soil n climate etc form apsim programmatic elements plant growth maize module responds to climate temperature rainfall and solar radiation from the met module soil water supply from the soilwat module and soil nitrogen n from the soiln module likewise the model can differentiate between different water loss mechanisms e g drainage versus runoff and includes the ability to predict the flow of water and nutrients through artificial subsurface drainage systems e g snow et al 2007 therefore apsim could be used to predict field scale water balances if appropriately calibrated and validated if successful this would improve our understanding of the relationship between corn production water use efficiency and environmental impacts of production system choices in this study we used several field datasets to evaluate the ability of apsim to simulate the corn stover and grain yield of continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in three indiana in locations and the subsurface water loss to artificial drains in one in location the aims of this study were to validate apsim i to predict corn stover and grain yield in four contrasting soils from in and ii to predict subsurface drainage in continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in a silty clay loam soil at west lafayette in 2 materials and methods the apsim validation was carried out as follows using data from three indiana us locations i data on climate table 1 soil table 2 and management table 3 were provided to the model ii soil parametrization was generated for each experiment iii the validation was performed through graphical comparison and statistical analyses of observed and modelled corn stover and grain yields with the objective to increase the concordance correlation coefficient ccc and decrease the simulation bias sb finally an additional model validation was carried out in order to predict corn stover and grain yields and timing and drainflow volume from artificial subsurface drains as influenced by crop rotation and n fertilizer rate using data from purdue university s water quality field station wqfs 2017 a complete description of datasets used for model validation is provided in table 3 2 1 data used for model simulations the datasets used in this study covered the most important crop processes during the crop growth season table 3 briefly the detailed data used for model validation were obtained from three purdue university research stations two datasets were from the agronomy center for research and education acre 2017 near west lafayette in 40 28 12 n 87 0 36 w with additional datasets from pinney purdue agricultural center ppac 2017 near wanatah in 41 26 24 n 86 56 24 w and throckmorton purdue agricultural center tpac 2017 south of lafayette in 40 17 60 n 86 54 0 w the west lafayette location included field experiments in two soil series chalmers and drummer table 2 the apsim s validation dataset from the experiment conducted on the chalmers soil was derived from robles et al 2012 these dataset included data on stover and grain yields during the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons and in all cases field experiments followed soybean nitrogen fertilizer was pre plant applied as nh3 at a rate of 225kgnha 1 conventional tillage practices involved full width spring cultivation after nh3 application and before planting the wqfs a highly instrumented in field laboratory dedicated to the study of agricultural impacts on water and air quality is located on the drummer soil series at acre and was the source for linked datasets on corn productivity and subsurface drainage losses a long term dataset 1995 2012 excluding 1996 on corn yield was derived from four cropping systems corn soybean rotations fertilized with 156 or 201kgnha 1 and continuous corn rotations fertilized with 224kgnha 1 or 72500lha 1 of manure effluent hofmann 2002 ruark et al 2009 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 issa 2012 however corn yield data from the cropping systems mentioned before were not available during the whole period of years table 3 the n rate applied as manure in continuous corn was 247kgnha 1 determined as kjeldahl n bremner 1996 all plots received starter fertilizer that contained an additional 22kgnha 1 at sowing the starter n and the primary n application are reported in table 3 as the first and second n application respectively and the total n application used to describe these treatments e g 22 247 269kgnha 1 during this long term experiment 13 corn hybrids were used table 4 these data sets included detailed measurements of grain and stover yields at the final harvest but also in season corn stover dry matter accumulation an accompanying wqfs drainage water dataset for the treatments described above was used to validate apsim s ability to accurately predict the timing and volume of subsurface drainage available drainage data spanned 1998 2011 but excluded 2007 due to missing data associated with facility rehabilitations at the wqfs subsurface water loss to artificial drains is monitored on a daily basis throughout the year to permit the collection of subsurface drainage from a hydrologically isolated volume of soil each wqfs treatment plot 10 8m 48m 518m2 contains a large in ground lysimeter 10 8m 24 4m 264m2 constructed as a bottomless clay box the lysimeters are centrally located in the plots and the bentonite clay walls extend down to the glacial till 1 5m depth running lengthwise down each plot are a pair collection and companion of plastic agricultural drains 0 1m diameter buried at 0 9m the collection drain is perforated only for the length of the lysimeter and is unperforated as it passes through the plot area outside the lysimeter the companion drain is immediately adjacent to the collection drain it is not perforated within the lysimeter but is perforated outside the lysimeter collectively the paired tiles maintain similar soil moisture status throughout a treatment plot and simulate 10m drain spacing companion drains discharge to a surface ditch while the collection drains discharge into instrument huts where calibrated tipping buckets quantify hourly drainflow volume in this study the hourly volumes were aggregated into daily volumes to validate apsim a complete description of the subsurface drainflow measurements are presented in ruark et al 2009 and ale et al 2009 at the time of wqfs construction 1992 the simulated 10m drain spacing at the wqfs was closer than typically recommended 12 24m for in soils franzmeier et al 2001 but drainage management has intensified dramatically in the last 20 years and subsurface drain spacings 10m are now commonly studied christianson and harmel 2015 the wanatah location included field experiments in a sebewa soil series table 2 the apsim s validation dataset from the experiment conducted on this location was derived from ciampitti and vyn 2011 this dataset included data on aboveground biomass partitioned into leaf stem ear and grain components of two corn genotypes table 4 measured at four developmental stages v14 r1 r3 and r6 ritchie and hanway 1982 grown at three plant densities 5 4 7 9 and 10 4plm 2 and fertilized with three n side dress rates 0 165 and 330kgnha 1 during 2009 at planting time all treatments received 25kgnha 1 10 34 0 as starter fertilizer the n fertilizer source for side dress application was urea ammonium nitrate uan 28 0 0 corn field experiments were established following soybean and conventional tillage practices involved full width spring field cultivation before planting ciampitti and vyn 2011 model validation also used additional corn data from tpac s field experiments in a lauramie soil series located at lafayette unpublished data these experiments included data on stover and grain yields at three plant densities 6 1 6 7 and 7 3plm 2 fertilized with three n rates 0 50 100 150 and 200kgnha 1 during 2011 2012 and 2013 a complete description of crop management is provided in table 3 2 2 apsim platform the agricultural production systems simulator apsim is a crop simulation platform used around the world to assess complex interactions between climate soils crops and management practices keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 the apsim framework integrates sub models describing soil crop and farm management processes with weather data in a mechanistic approach to simulate crop growth and development as well as soil water and n dynamics keating et al 2003 pembleton et al 2016 details on apsim performance in a diverse range of studies carried out in different environments can be found at apsim website apsim 2017 2 3 model configuration 2 3 1 plant module and manager rules crop simulations were undertaken using a daily time step of the apsim version 7 5 keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 corn was simulated by the maize module carberry et al 1989 this module is based on enhancements to ceres maize ritchie 1972 jones and kiniry 1986 carberry and abrecht 1991 combined with modifications to simulate biomass accumulation based on resource capture concepts monteith 1986 different management rules i e tillage sowing harvesting fertilization plant density row spacing etc were created according to practices used in the field and are reported in detail in table 3 the corn in the corn soybean rotation was sown in paired plots every year in order to obtain data on both crop components of this system each year every year crop residues were incorporated into the soil using the tillage manager rule on fixed date provided by the model the corn hybrids used in these studies were not pre identified in apsim therefore new hybrids were created within the model based on thermal time requirements at each phenological stage table 4 the crop was harvested at 0 1m above the ground issa 2012 using the model harvesting rule if the exact dates of management interventions were not available local average dates for the application of these practices were used the model outputs called leafgreenwt stemgreenwt stover and yield were used for validation 2 3 2 manure module in west lafayette the manure manager rule on fixed date provided by the model was used to simulate manure effluent the manure module allows specification of the manure c n ratio this enables apsim to model the effect of manure composition on n mineralisation patterns following manure application delve and probert 2004 the following information was needed to specify the rule in the model application amount 72500lha 1 manure c n ratio 12 archontoulis et al 2014a and manure c p ratio 30 default apsim value 2 3 3 climate data sources daily climate data for each location were derived from two data sources the daily solar radiation was obtained from the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource climatology resource for agroclimatology nasa power 2017 maximum and minimum air temperatures and rainfall were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa this us agency through their national centers for environmental information is responsible for providing public access to the us s climate and historical weather data and information noaa 2017 following the methodology used by ojeda et al 2017 this long term database was used as a secondary source of maximum and minimum air temperatures due to the noaa database s large number of consecutive absent values for daily maximum and minimum temperatures long term monthly mean minimum air temperature ranged from 9 8 to 19 0 c and the monthly mean maximum air temperature between 0 0 29 6 c the mean annual rainfall was similar between field experiments 971 7mm a summary of climate information by location is reported in table 1 2 3 4 soil parametrization as the soil database of apsim did not include the soil types of the locations used in this study new soil profiles were created table 2 the dominant soil series were identified for each field experiment based on data provided in previous studies ale et al 2009 ruark et al 2009 ciampitti and vyn 2011 issa 2012 and in consultation with local scientists the specific soil properties texture organic carbon oc and ph for each soil series were obtained from the national cooperative soil survey soil characterization database ncss 2017 table 2 this application allows us to obtain a complete characterization of several soil profiles from the national soil survey center kellogg soil survey laboratory and cooperating laboratories as soil hydraulic parameters required to run the simulations were not available drained lower limit ll drained upper limit dul bulk density bd and hydraulic conductivity ks were estimated by the hydraulic properties calculator software saxton and rawls 2006 following the methodology described by ojeda et al 2017 table 2 in addition for each soil air dry water content ad saturated volumetric water sat total porosity po and the drainage coefficient swcon were estimated this parameter indicates the rate at which water drains when soil water content is above dul saturated flow the soil moisture limit to which soil can dry by evaporation ad was estimated as 0 5 ll for 0 0 15m soil depth 0 9 ll for 0 15 0 30m soil depth and equivalent to ll at deeper depths than 0 30m cresswell et al 2009 saturated volumetric water content was calculated from bd as described by dalgliesh and foale 2005 the po was estimated as 1 bd 2 6 according to the reported by burk and dalgliesh 2008 the swcon the rate at which water drains from the drainable porosity i e water held between sat and dul was estimated from dul and bd jones and kiniry 1986 in addition for each soil layer the water extraction coefficient kl was set at 0 08mmd 1 robertson et al 1993a 1993b dardanelli et al 1997 2004 the kl integrates soil root interactions and it limits the rate of water uptake by the roots i e a low kl value results in low water uptake on the other hand the root exploration factor xf was set to 1 for up to 1m depth and then decreased exponentially to 0 6 at the maximum soil depth monti and zatta 2009 actual oc values were used for initialization of the simulations table 2 to initialize the soil nitrogen pool a 10 year simulation of previous management at the experimental locations corn soybean rotations the location specific meteorology and soil data were used also for each soil organic matter om om oc 1 72 dalgliesh and foale 2005 soil ph 1 5 ph measured for a ratio of 1 part soil and 5 parts water solutions according to globalsoilmap 2012 and estimated by libohova et al 2014 were estimated table 2 2 3 5 soilwat module the soilwat module one of the two soil water models available in apsim was used in this study this module runs a water balance on a daily step in which soil evaporation plant transpiration drainage and runoff are included water limitations on yield depend on soil water supply in the root exploration area and on the conversion efficiency of water into yield i e transpiration efficiency dolling et al 2005 for the simulations we used apsim s default transpiration efficiency values for corn 9pa which is a constant parameter during the whole period of crop growth the hydrological processes represented in soilwat were adapted from a long history of cascading bucket style water balances such as watbal keig and mcalpine 1976 and ceres ritchie 1972 jones and kiniry 1986 the main processes that determine the water drainage in the model are i the saturated flow which occurs when any soil layer fills above dul where a specified proportion defined by the user through swcon of the water in excess of dul drains to the next soil layer and ii the unsaturated flow at water contents below dul where gradients in soil water content occur between layers e g in response to rainfall events or evaporation keating et al 2003 for extractable soil water esw below dul water movement depends on the water content gradient between adjacent layers and the soil diffusivity which is a function of the average water content of the two soil layers in this study the diffusivity constant and slope were estimated from soil texture class according to dalgliesh et al 2012 40 and 16 respectively the associated parameter value for runoff cn2bare was derived from soil hydrological group and field slope information 78 dalgliesh et al 2012 the soil evaporation coefficients u represents the amount of accumulated evaporation before soil supply become limiting and cona is the ratio between the cumulative second stage evaporation and the square root of time were estimated from soil texture according to littleboy et al 1989 10 and 3 9 respectively initial soil water was not available at most locations hence these conditions were estimated using the approach described by ojeda et al 2017 based on this analysis initial soil water was set to 100 for all simulations i e as a fraction of maximum available water in the soil profile the initial soil water in spring was always close to dul for model validation to predict water loss by drainage the model output called drain was evaluated 2 4 evaluation of apsim performance model performance was assessed by comparing scatter plots of observed values in the y axis v modelled values in the x axis piñeiro et al 2008 for corn stover grain yield in all locations in west lafayette the over and under predictions of daily subsurface drainage were plotted against modelled esw in order to determine the role of soil water profile variations on the model performance the evaluation of model performance described in tedeschi 2006 and kobayashi and us salam 2000 was used to statistically evaluate model performance to predict corn stover grain yield and annual subsurface drainage this included observed and modelled mean and standard deviation the ccc mean square error mse and root mean square error rmse the ccc integrates precision through pearson s correlation coefficient which represents the proportion of the total variance in the observed data that can be explained by apsim and accuracy by bias which indicates how far the regression line deviates from the line 1 1 similarly the mse was partitioned into sb the simulation bias from the observation and mean square variation msv the difference between the simulation and the observation with respect to the deviation from the means using irene software fila et al 2003 simulation bias and msv are orthogonal and as a consequence can be analysed independently kobayashi and us salam 2000 the crop model performance was categorically evaluated based on the values of several statistical parameters and upper and lower limits were used as the model judgment according to the suggested by bellocchi et al 2010 we have considered that a step of parameter optimization was not necessary because the preliminary model performance was in the range proposed by ojeda et al 2017 i e calibration was deemed complete when ccc 0 60 and sb 40 for annual predictions for model validation upper and lower statistical limits were set as very good when ccc 0 90 and sb 20 satisfactory when 0 75 ccc 0 90 and 20 sb 30 acceptable when 0 60 ccc 0 75 and 30 sb 40 and poor with other values 3 results 3 1 stover and grain yield overall the model with the default settings demonstrated very good and satisfactory ability to simulate corn stover and grain yields respectively this was indicated by the summary statistics comparing observed and modelled stover 0 96 for ccc and 0 for sb and grain yields 0 85 and 2 for ccc and sb respectively figs 1 and 2 table 5 the mean observed stover and grain yields were 6213 3141kgha 1 and 8823 2201kgha 1 respectively the rmse for stover and grain yield varied between 545 1571 and 835 2099kgha 1 the apsim accuracy for predicting stover yield was better at wanatah and west lafayette fig 1a b and c ccc 0 95 0 99 and sb 2 8 than at lafayette fig 1d table 5 a satisfactory model prediction of grain yield was found at west lafayette and lafayette fig 2b c and d table 5 as indicated by the ccc 0 78 0 93 and the sb 5 27 table 5 nevertheless the model accuracy to predict grain yield at wanatah was poor fig 2a ccc 0 49 the model was also evaluated against end of season stover and grain yield data showing a very good performance for the long term dataset from west lafayette fig 3 the modelled data were 20 of observed data most years despite of n rate and crop rotation fig 3 simulations of stover and corn grain yield matched observations more closely when data were clustered by rotation 0 76 0 98 for ccc and 0 1 for sb and n rate 0 73 0 98 for ccc and 0 2 for sb fig 3 table 6 corn grain yield was predicted more accurately in continuous corn ccc 0 73 0 91 and sb 19 21 than in corn soybean rotations ccc 0 56 0 63 and sb 17 18 however corn stover yield was well predicted in both rotations 0 85 0 98 and 1 17 for ccc and sb respectively fig 3 table 6 the stover and grain yield model prediction was improved as the n rate was increased except for grain yield in the corn soybean rotation fig 3 table 6 the ccc and sb for stover yield ranged from 0 85 and 17 for the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 to 0 98 and 1 for the continuous corn rotation fertilized with 269kgnha 1 respectively however the ccc and sb for stover yield ranged from 0 56 and 17 for the corn soybean rotation fertilized by 201kgnha 1 to 0 91 and 21 for the continuous corn rotation fertilized with the highest n rate respectively 3 2 annual subsurface drainage in general the model with the default settings demonstrated acceptable ability to simulate annual subsurface drainflow from artificial drains under corn rotations 0 63 0 75 for ccc and 2 37 for sb fig 4 table 7 fig a1 the rmse for subsurface drainage varied between 60 and 96mm the apsim accuracy was better for predicting subsurface drainage in the corn soybean rotation fertilized with a low n rate 156kgnha 1 as evidenced by the ccc 0 75 and sb 2 fig 4a table 7 than for the n rate 201kgnha 1 ccc 0 66 and sb 37 fig 4b the model ability to predict the subsurface drainage in the continuous corn rotations was lower than in the corn soybean rotations ccc 0 61 0 63 and sb 9 12 fig 4 the observed subsurface drainage ranged from 151mm in the corn soybean rotation with 156kgnha 1 to 236mm in the continuous corn with 201kgnha 1 the modelled subsurface drainage was a 12 24 less than observed in all the treatments except for the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 where was higher in the order of 5 3 3 seasonal and daily subsurface drainage drain flow of these corn rotations occurred primarily in winter and early spring regardless of cropping system fig 5 however monthly subsurface drainage and rainfall were not clearly associated fig 5 for instance the subsurface drainage during winter months was circa 2 fold that in fall with similar monthly rainfalls in both seasons fig 5 when the ratio drainage rainfall d r was plotted against rainfall fig 6 a decrease of d r was shown as the monthly fig 6c and d and daily fig 6e and f rainfalls increase however no evident relationship between d r and rainfall was found plotting observed fig 6a and modelled fig 6b data by year the model predictions of subsurface drainage were acceptable at a monthly base ccc 0 59 0 70 sb 0 2 and poor at a daily base ccc 0 42 0 49 sb 0 table 8 although the apsim performance to simulate daily subsurface drainage timing and volumes was poor the under predicted events were higher during winter and in early spring when corn growth was slow figs 7 and 8 table 8 than during late spring and summer i e the time with corn growth was rapid figs 7 and 8 table 8 likewise there were several drainage events during fall as corn growth slowed where the model under predicted the daily subsurface drainage figs 7 a c and 8 the daily subsurface drainage was modelled by apsim only when the esw was greater than 455mm fig 9 for esw values greater than dul the model predicted a constant daily subsurface drainage of 20mm fig 9 likewise the model over predicted the daily subsurface drainage only for esw values greater than 455mm fig 10 however the model under predicted the daily subsurface drainage for a large range of esw values 380 470mm the number of under predicted daily observations of subsurface drainage was more than 3 times than the over predicted daily observations fig 10 the model performance to predict daily subsurface drainage for continuous corn and corn soybean rotations during 2001 and 2002 is shown as an illustrative example in figs 7 and 8 respectively both years were selected from the complete long term dataset figs a2 a9 the dynamics of daily subsurface drainage had similar pattern among different rotations and n rates for all years figs 7 8 and a2 a9 observed peak daily subsurface drainage usually occurred within the same day that a major rainfall event occurred figs 7 and 8 likewise the highest d r values were near 15 fig 6e and f however only 3 5 and 9 3 of the total modelled n 928 and observed n 905 d r values were higher than 3 4 discussion this study had two main objectives firstly to evaluate the apsim ability to simulate corn stover and grain yields in four contrasting soil series across three in locations secondly to evaluate the model performance to predict artificial subsurface drainage by cropping system rotation and n rate in a silty clay loam soil at west lafayette in 4 1 stover and grain yield the apsim model through the maize module of apsim provided a very good prediction for corn stover yield and a satisfactorily prediction of grain yield at these in locations fig 1 model performance in predicting corn grain yield was similar to that reported for other apsim validation studies including northern carberry et al 1996 and south eastern australia pembleton et al 2013 zimbabwe shamudzarira and robertson 2002 and the north plain chen et al 2010 and northeast china liu et al 2012 several studies have evaluated the accuracy and precision of apsim to simulate corn grain yield in continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in the us corn belt lyon et al 2003 malone et al 2007 dietzel et al 2016 lyon et al 2003 reported similar metrics of apsim performance ccc 0 96 for grain yield prediction in ia us using a limited number of observations n 10 however malone et al 2007 using single or split n applications in ia found that apsim did not simulate grain yield well ccc 0 28 and suggested that the poor accuracy was associated with the relatively simple n uptake routine which overemphasized n stress at floral initiation in contrast archontoulis et al 2014a reported very good corn yield predictions by apsim on three soil types typic aquic hapludoll and typic endoaquoll over multiple years in ia following best management practices for this region in agreement with our results these authors reported excellent agreement between predicted and observed corn grain yield r2 0 88 and in biomass yield predictions r2 0 97 0 99 although they not evaluated the apsim performance to predict corn stover yield several biophysical models have been used to predicted corn yields including the root zone water quality model rzwqm ahmed et al 2007 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat liu et al 2011 issa 2012 and hybrid maize grassini et al 2009 2011 issa 2012 using data from around north america however with the exception of the unpublished modelling study reported by issa 2012 using hybrid maize and dssat there are few published modelling reports evaluating crop model performance in predicting both corn stover and grain yield in the eastern corn belt of the us the apsim model showed very good accuracy for predicting stover yield at west lafayette and wanatah but the model accuracy to predict stover yield at lafayette was poor 8 out of 14 observations were under predicted fig 1d in contrast the apsim ability to predict grain yield at that location was satisfactory table 5 interestingly the difference between the observed and modelled standard deviation of stover yield 60 was much greater than for the grain yield 8 in lafayette this could be attributable to differences in the experimental handling among locations added to the few available data for this location n 14 as compared with the others n 63 76 surprisingly apsim performed much better for corn grain yield prediction in the continuous corn than in the corn soybean rotations whereas the model provided very good predictions of stover yield in both rotations fig 3 table 6 the model also predicted satisfactorily the year to year variability of grain and stover yield within a given cropping system fig 3 however there were notable exceptions including 1998 when the model under predicted stover yield in the continuous corn fig 3e and g and 2008 and 2010 where it under predicted grain yield in the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 fig 3b agricultural production systems simulator was able to satisfactorily predict biomass accumulation during corn growth including early growth stages fig 1 however neither biomass nor stover accumulations were directly related with grain yield predictions table 6 4 2 annual subsurface drainage the apsim model through soilwat module simulated the annual subsurface drainage in the corn rotations with acceptable accuracy for a silty clay loam soil at west lafayette table 7 the rmse in our study was between the values reported in the literature 103mm shen et al 1998 garrison et al 1999 ma et al 2007 dietzel et al 2016 this module is interfaced with the residue soiln modules and the plant module i e maize which indicates that simulation of the soil water balance is determined by variations in the status of surface residues e g tillage and decay rate and canopy cover this suggests that the model was able to capture the cropping system effect into the simulation fig 4 early attempts to calibrate crop models to predict subsurface drainage in the us corn belt were conducted by garrison et al 1999 at ia using continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in the ceres maize model the method used by these authors was based on the estimation of two parameters conductivity and effective drain spacing to describe subsurface flow and subsequently soil water dynamics they found rmse values of annual subsurface drainage between 14 54 and 32 91mm for a typic hapludoll and an aquic hapludoll respectively more recently malone et al 2007 reported that inaccurate yield estimations by apsim resulted in inaccurate subsurface drainage predictions however we did not find any correlation between grain yield and subsurface drainage at west lafayette not shown either for observed and modelled data for instance the lowest fit between observed and modelled corn grain yield in the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 ccc 0 63 and sb 18 table 6 corresponded to the best fit between observed and modelled subsurface drainage at the same rotation and n rate level ccc 0 75 and sb 2 table 7 several biophysical models such as rzwqm hanson et al 1998 drainmod youssef et al 2005 ale et al 2009 luo et al 2010 swat arnold et al 1998 cibin et al 2016 and apsim malone et al 2007 dietzel et al 2016 have been reported to simulate subsurface drainage with varying degrees of success recent studies have used swat to simulate the effects of management practices on hydrologic and water quality response at various spatial and temporal scales gassman et al 2007 baskaran et al 2010 chiang et al 2010 for example srinivasan et al 2010 reported a better prediction for streamflow ccc 1 and sb 5 than for corn grain yield ccc 0 34 and sb 47 in the upper mississippi river watershed although most of these studies were carried out at the watershed level some studies have been used swat to simulate perennial bioenergy feedstock production at the field scale trybula et al 2014 at the same field experiment ale et al 2009 showed that drainmod tended to under and over predicted the subsurface drainage during the growing season and the whole year in continuous corn rotations respectively the apsim accuracy to predict annual subsurface drainage was better in the corn soybean fig 4a and b than in the continuous corn rotations fig 4c and d in contrast malone et al 2007 found that the subsurface drainage under no till continuous corn was accurately predicted compared to the subsurface drainage in a no till corn soybean rotation because of higher residue i e less soil evaporation and lower transpiration on continuous corn rotation however apsim predicted annual subsurface drainage at these in locations better in the corn soybean fig 4a and b than in the continuous corn rotations fig 4c and d this could be attributed to the fact that the high cover residues of continuous corn v corn soybean rotations were incorporated to the soil every year using spring tillage therefore some effects such as increased infiltration due to additional surface residue weed and kanwar 1996 were not well simulated by apsim other studies have reported greater subsurface drainage from no till continuous corn compared to no till corn soybean rotations weed and kanwar 1996 kanwar et al 1997 while we found that subsurface drainage varied with crop rotations fig 4 our results have not been consistent with the body of literature for these environments therefore additional modelling studies evaluating subsurface drainage as affected by the interaction of crop rotations and tillage systems are required in this region 4 3 seasonal and daily subsurface drainage the greater subsurface drainage in winter and early spring than in summer and fall was evident in this study especially from january to june fig 5 also the modelled esw values during summer and fall months corresponding with the late crop growth were less than dul in the soil profile figs 7 8 and a2 a9 this indicated that evaporation and transpiration were dominant processes during summer and early fall soils in this region of in and the eastern corn belt are generally frozen and snow covered during winter months the first drainage water flow usually occurs during the snowmelt period in late winter early spring gray et al 2001 reported up to 120mm of snowmelt contribution to water infiltration in canada and northern latitudes of north america likewise previous modelling efforts have described snowmelt infiltration in south central mn us luo et al 2010 using drainmod the soilwat module of apsim is unable to simulate soil water input originating from snow and therefore the estimated soil water content and drainage in our study would not reflect this additional water source this could be the primary reason for the under prediction of subsurface flow in winter and early spring fig 6d by apsim where the soil profile could have received additional water from snowmelt instead only rainfall which may have increase the subsurface drainage figs 7 and 8 however the infiltration of meltwater into frozen soils is a complex process as it involves coupled heat and mass flow with phase changes likewise this process is defined by the soil thermal and hydro physical properties the soil temperature and moisture regimes and the quantity and the rate of release of meltwater from the snow cover gray et al 2001 an alternative to simulate this additional water from snowmelt could be add the equivalent rainfall amount to the rainfall input of apsim dietzel et al 2016 the d r increased as the rainfall events decreased either in a monthly fig 6c and d and daily base fig 6e and f which has been suggested as very important for the fine textured soils in low rainfall environments asseng et al 2000 however under in conditions soils are usually well supplied with water most months of the year due abundant snowmelt and rainfall that collectively keeps the soil near dul except when et is high during the growing season figs 7 8 and a2 a9 therefore the subsurface drainage under in conditions would be greater with smaller rainfall events during winter and early spring when the soils are close to dul figs 7 8 and a2 a9 likewise the analysis in a monthly patterns of d r v rainfall showed a better fit for observed data from july to december than january to june as evidenced by the r2 0 34 0 47 and 0 04 0 23 respectively fig 6c this seasonal difference is associated with completely canopy cover and high et in july to december that reduced esw values below the dul figs 7 and 8 and collectively leading to the very low subsurface drainage 10mm fig 5 by comparison low et and minimal canopy cover from january to june resulted in high subsurface flow rates fig 5 and esw values near to dul figs 7 and 8 certain daily peaks of subsurface drainage occurred the same day when a significant daily rainfall event higher than 30 40mm occurred during the corn growing season that were not simulated by the model especially when esw less than 463mm figs 7 a c 8 a c this flow that occurs under unsaturated soil conditions suggests possible preferential flow of water through soil macropores similar results were found during fallow periods in western australia george et al 1997 in response to large rainfall events dolling et al 2006 moreover preferential water flows were reported by several studies for different soil types and cropping systems singh and kanwar 1991 edwards et al 1993 kanwar et al 1997 jiang et al 2017 for example stone and wilson 2006 reported that preferential water flow through soil macropores during storms in a subsurface drained field in in contributed between 11 and 51 of total subsurface drainage with peak contributions between 40 and 81 coinciding with times of peak subsurface flow similar results were found for till and no till continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in silty soils at ia us kanwar et al 1997 the timing of peak flow was between 0 5h to about 6h after the beginning of a major rainfall event bjorneberg and melvin 1996 our study showed that apsim poorly predicted the daily subsurface drainage within a narrow range of esw fig 10 additionally there were a large number of flow under predictions for esw values less than the dul fig 10 this further suggests that preferential flow occurred and apsim through soilwat was not able to accurately predict this pathway of water loss which relies on the module mechanism to simulate daily subsurface drainage while drainage from each soil layer in apsim can be changed via the swcon parameter dolling et al 2006 as currently programmed swcon cannot simulate preferential flow further research is required to determine a more accurate and independent method of determining daily subsurface drainage from one layer to the next due to preferential flow although the inclusion of preferential flow processes into soilwat module could lead to greater apsim accuracy to predict subsurface drainage it is not clear at this time how best to parametrize this process in this sense as pointed out by others the more accurately the processes are described the greater the error introduced through incorrect parametrization van der laan et al 2014 as many of the input parameters required to simulate soil water balance in the model cannot be measured directly calibration with observed data is key particularly for models such as apsim where important processes are represented empirically likewise a model sensitivity analysis may also help to identify key parameters or variables that should be measured to generate useful calibration data van der laan et al 2014 ojeda et al 2016 2017 5 conclusions we used a long term dataset of continuously cropped corn and corn soybean rotations to demonstrate the potential of apsim to predict corn stover and grain and simultaneous subsurface drainage in north central indiana us during winter and early spring the model under predicted the daily subsurface drainage additionally there were a large number of flow under predictions for modelled extractable soil water values less than drained upper limit during the late growing corn season soil water dynamic driven by the cascading bucket approach was identified as a critical aspect of the model for accurate simulation of subsurface drainage when monthly and daily rainfalls were smaller but modelled extractable soil water values were higher than drained upper limit more drainage per unit of rainfall was found our results confirm using apsim to predict subsurface drainage in corn based cropping systems in north central indiana us additional studies will improve the model accuracy and inference space the ability

were well predicted by apsim during late spring and summer when crop water use was high but under predicted during fall winter and early spring when evapotranspiration was low occasional flow events

yield and water losses for corn based cropping systems in north central indiana us keywords maize corn based cropping systems water flow model validation indiana 1 introduction the us corn belt is not only an important contributor for global corn zea mays l grain supply but also is an increasing provider of cellulosic feedstock for biofuels perlack et al 2005 wilhelm et al 2007 wallander et al 2011 in fact bioenergy products are essential elements for a global policy to increase energy supplies and reduce dependence on petroleum perlack et al 2005 currently corn grain accounts for the feedstock of more than 90 of the feedstock used for us ethanol production morris and hill 2006 however corn stover is expected to provide the majority of the estimated biofuel from crop residues in the future graham et al 2007 cibin et al 2012 stover residues on soil surface protect it from erosion and contributes to soil organic carbon pools shaver et al 2003 wilhelm et al 2007 a key factor of soil quality wilhelm et al 2004 surface residues also reduce water losses by runoff and evaporation hatfield 2015 as a consequence there is increasing concern of the potential negative impacts of removing stover for biomass on soil and water resources and the environment jaynes and miller 1999 zhang et al 2001 caviglia et al 2004 hatfield 2015 stephens et al 2001 simpson et al 2008 graham et al 2007 the most extensively used crop rotations in the us corn belt are continuous corn and corn soybean glycine max l merr rainfall often exceeds evapotranspiration et in spring king et al 2014 delaying crop establishment and in fall slowing harvest smith et al 2015 generating excess water this excess soil water is commonly drained through a network of subsurface tile or perforated plastic drains randall et al 1997 smith and pappas 2007 smith et al 2015 it has been estimated that 25 of the land currently in crop production in us and canada could not be farmed without a subsurface drainage system skaggs et al 1994 and 37 of us corn belt has benefited from these systems zucker and brown 1998 biophysical models are a key tool to predict impacts of crop management scenarios on both watershed hydrology cibin et al 2016 and stover production persson et al 2009 although considerable effort has been devoted in the development of simulation models for hydrological processes at watershed scale e g hanson et al 1998 arnold et al 1998 cibin et al 2016 the validation of certain processes like subsurface water loss from artificial drains and corn stover biomass production have not been thoroughly evaluated for the us corn belt dietzel et al 2016 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 has been shown to predict biomass production of perennial rhizomatous grasses across several us environments ojeda et al 2017 and grain yields of corn lyon et al 2003 hammer et al 2009 lobell et al 2013 archontoulis et al 2014a and soybean malone et al 2007 archontoulis et al 2014b dietzel et al 2016 the ability of apsim to accurately predict stover and grain yields of corn while simultaneously estimating the timing and volume of subsurface drainage from these fields is not known corn growth using the maize module of apsim has been tested in several environments carberry et al 1989 1996 shamudzarira and robertson 2002 chen et al 2010 liu et al 2012 pembleton et al 2013 several sub module routines representing key processes like growth soil water soil n climate etc form apsim programmatic elements plant growth maize module responds to climate temperature rainfall and solar radiation from the met module soil water supply from the soilwat module and soil nitrogen n from the soiln module likewise the model can differentiate between different water loss mechanisms e g drainage versus runoff and includes the ability to predict the flow of water and nutrients through artificial subsurface drainage systems e g snow et al 2007 therefore apsim could be used to predict field scale water balances if appropriately calibrated and validated if successful this would improve our understanding of the relationship between corn production water use efficiency and environmental impacts of production system choices in this study we used several field datasets to evaluate the ability of apsim to simulate the corn stover and grain yield of continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in three indiana in locations and the subsurface water loss to artificial drains in one in location the aims of this study were to validate apsim i to predict corn stover and grain yield in four contrasting soils from in and ii to predict subsurface drainage in continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in a silty clay loam soil at west lafayette in 2 materials and methods the apsim validation was carried out as follows using data from three indiana us locations i data on climate table 1 soil table 2 and management table 3 were provided to the model ii soil parametrization was generated for each experiment iii the validation was performed through graphical comparison and statistical analyses of observed and modelled corn stover and grain yields with the objective to increase the concordance correlation coefficient ccc and decrease the simulation bias sb finally an additional model validation was carried out in order to predict corn stover and grain yields and timing and drainflow volume from artificial subsurface drains as influenced by crop rotation and n fertilizer rate using data from purdue university s water quality field station wqfs 2017 a complete description of datasets used for model validation is provided in table 3 2 1 data used for model simulations the datasets used in this study covered the most important crop processes during the crop growth season table 3 briefly the detailed data used for model validation were obtained from three purdue university research stations two datasets were from the agronomy center for research and education acre 2017 near west lafayette in 40 28 12 n 87 0 36 w with additional datasets from pinney purdue agricultural center ppac 2017 near wanatah in 41 26 24 n 86 56 24 w and throckmorton purdue agricultural center tpac 2017 south of lafayette in 40 17 60 n 86 54 0 w the west lafayette location included field experiments in two soil series chalmers and drummer table 2 the apsim s validation dataset from the experiment conducted on the chalmers soil was derived from robles et al 2012 these dataset included data on stover and grain yields during the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons and in all cases field experiments followed soybean nitrogen fertilizer was pre plant applied as nh3 at a rate of 225kgnha 1 conventional tillage practices involved full width spring cultivation after nh3 application and before planting the wqfs a highly instrumented in field laboratory dedicated to the study of agricultural impacts on water and air quality is located on the drummer soil series at acre and was the source for linked datasets on corn productivity and subsurface drainage losses a long term dataset 1995 2012 excluding 1996 on corn yield was derived from four cropping systems corn soybean rotations fertilized with 156 or 201kgnha 1 and continuous corn rotations fertilized with 224kgnha 1 or 72500lha 1 of manure effluent hofmann 2002 ruark et al 2009 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 issa 2012 however corn yield data from the cropping systems mentioned before were not available during the whole period of years table 3 the n rate applied as manure in continuous corn was 247kgnha 1 determined as kjeldahl n bremner 1996 all plots received starter fertilizer that contained an additional 22kgnha 1 at sowing the starter n and the primary n application are reported in table 3 as the first and second n application respectively and the total n application used to describe these treatments e g 22 247 269kgnha 1 during this long term experiment 13 corn hybrids were used table 4 these data sets included detailed measurements of grain and stover yields at the final harvest but also in season corn stover dry matter accumulation an accompanying wqfs drainage water dataset for the treatments described above was used to validate apsim s ability to accurately predict the timing and volume of subsurface drainage available drainage data spanned 1998 2011 but excluded 2007 due to missing data associated with facility rehabilitations at the wqfs subsurface water loss to artificial drains is monitored on a daily basis throughout the year to permit the collection of subsurface drainage from a hydrologically isolated volume of soil each wqfs treatment plot 10 8m 48m 518m2 contains a large in ground lysimeter 10 8m 24 4m 264m2 constructed as a bottomless clay box the lysimeters are centrally located in the plots and the bentonite clay walls extend down to the glacial till 1 5m depth running lengthwise down each plot are a pair collection and companion of plastic agricultural drains 0 1m diameter buried at 0 9m the collection drain is perforated only for the length of the lysimeter and is unperforated as it passes through the plot area outside the lysimeter the companion drain is immediately adjacent to the collection drain it is not perforated within the lysimeter but is perforated outside the lysimeter collectively the paired tiles maintain similar soil moisture status throughout a treatment plot and simulate 10m drain spacing companion drains discharge to a surface ditch while the collection drains discharge into instrument huts where calibrated tipping buckets quantify hourly drainflow volume in this study the hourly volumes were aggregated into daily volumes to validate apsim a complete description of the subsurface drainflow measurements are presented in ruark et al 2009 and ale et al 2009 at the time of wqfs construction 1992 the simulated 10m drain spacing at the wqfs was closer than typically recommended 12 24m for in soils franzmeier et al 2001 but drainage management has intensified dramatically in the last 20 years and subsurface drain spacings 10m are now commonly studied christianson and harmel 2015 the wanatah location included field experiments in a sebewa soil series table 2 the apsim s validation dataset from the experiment conducted on this location was derived from ciampitti and vyn 2011 this dataset included data on aboveground biomass partitioned into leaf stem ear and grain components of two corn genotypes table 4 measured at four developmental

soybean and conventional tillage practices involved full width spring field cultivation before planting ciampitti and vyn 2011 model validation also used additional corn data from tpac s field experiments in a lauramie soil series located at lafayette unpublished data these experiments included data on stover and grain yields at three plant densities 6 1 6 7 and 7 3plm 2 fertilized with three n rates 0 50 100 150 and 200kgnha 1 during 2011 2012 and 2013 a complete description of crop management is provided in table 3 2 2 apsim platform the agricultural production systems simulator apsim is a crop simulation platform used around the world to assess complex interactions between climate soils crops and management practices keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 the apsim framework integrates sub models describing soil crop and farm management processes with weather data in a mechanistic approach to simulate crop growth and development as well as soil water and n dynamics keating et al 2003 pembleton et al 2016 details on apsim performance in a diverse range of studies carried out in different environments can be found at apsim website apsim 2017 2 3 model configuration 2 3 1 plant module and manager rules crop simulations were undertaken using a daily time step of the apsim version 7 5 keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 corn was simulated by the maize module carberry et al 1989 this module is based on enhancements to ceres maize ritchie 1972 jones and kiniry 1986 carberry and abrecht 1991 combined with modifications to simulate biomass accumulation based on resource capture concepts monteith 1986 different management rules i e tillage sowing harvesting fertilization plant density row spacing etc were created according to practices used in the field and are reported in detail in table 3 the corn in the corn soybean rotation was sown in paired plots every year in order to obtain data on both crop components of this system each year every year crop residues were incorporated into the soil using the tillage manager rule on fixed date provided by the model the corn hybrids used in these studies were not pre identified in apsim therefore new hybrids were created within the model based on thermal time requirements at each phenological stage table 4 the crop was harvested at 0 1m above the ground issa 2012 using the model harvesting rule if the exact dates of management interventions were not available local average dates for the application of these practices were used the model outputs called leafgreenwt stemgreenwt stover and yield were used for validation 2 3 2 manure module in west lafayette the manure manager rule on fixed date provided by the model was used to simulate manure effluent the manure module allows specification of the manure c n ratio this enables apsim to model the effect of manure composition on n mineralisation patterns following manure application delve and probert 2004 the following information was needed to specify the rule in the model application amount 72500lha 1 manure c n ratio 12 archontoulis et al 2014a and manure c p ratio 30 default apsim value 2 3 3 climate data sources daily climate data for each location were derived from two data sources the daily solar radiation was obtained from the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource climatology resource for agroclimatology nasa power 2017 maximum and minimum air temperatures and rainfall were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa this us agency through their national centers for environmental information is responsible for providing public access to the us s climate and historical weather data and information noaa 2017 following the methodology used by ojeda et al 2017 this long term database was used as a secondary source of maximum and minimum air temperatures due to the noaa database s large number of consecutive absent values for daily maximum and minimum temperatures long term monthly mean minimum air temperature ranged from 9 8 to 19 0 c and the monthly mean maximum air temperature between 0 0 29 6 c the mean annual rainfall was similar between field experiments 971 7mm a summary of climate information by location is reported in table 1 2 3 4 soil parametrization as the soil database of apsim did not include the soil types of the locations used in this study new soil profiles were created table 2 the dominant soil series were identified for each field experiment based on data provided in previous studies ale et al 2009 ruark et al 2009 ciampitti and vyn 2011 issa 2012 and in consultation with local scientists the specific soil properties texture organic carbon oc and ph for each soil series were obtained from the national cooperative soil survey soil characterization database ncss 2017 table 2 this application allows us to obtain a complete characterization of several soil profiles from the national soil survey center kellogg soil survey laboratory and cooperating laboratories as soil hydraulic parameters required to run the simulations were not available drained lower limit ll drained upper limit dul bulk density bd and hydraulic conductivity ks were estimated by the hydraulic properties calculator software saxton and rawls 2006 following the methodology described by ojeda et al 2017 table 2 in addition for each soil air dry water content ad saturated volumetric water sat total porosity po and the drainage coefficient swcon were estimated this parameter indicates the rate at which water drains when soil water content is above dul saturated flow the soil moisture limit to which soil can dry by evaporation ad was estimated as 0 5 ll for 0 0 15m soil depth 0 9 ll for 0 15 0 30m soil depth and equivalent to ll at deeper depths than 0 30m cresswell et al 2009 saturated volumetric water content was calculated from bd as described by dalgliesh and foale 2005 the po was estimated as 1 bd 2 6 according to the reported by burk and dalgliesh 2008 the swcon the rate at which water drains from the drainable porosity i e water held between sat and dul was estimated from dul and bd jones and kiniry 1986 in addition for each soil layer the water extraction coefficient kl was set at 0 08mmd 1 robertson et al 1993a 1993b dardanelli et al 1997 2004 the kl integrates soil root interactions and it limits the rate of water uptake by the roots i e a low kl value results in low water uptake on the other hand the root exploration factor xf was set to 1 for up to 1m depth and then decreased exponentially to 0 6 at the maximum soil depth monti and zatta 2009 actual oc values were used for initialization of the simulations table 2 to initialize the soil nitrogen pool a 10 year simulation of previous management at the experimental locations corn soybean rotations the location specific meteorology and soil data were used also for each soil organic matter om om oc 1 72 dalgliesh and foale 2005 soil ph 1 5 ph measured for a ratio of 1 part soil and 5 parts water solutions according to globalsoilmap 2012 and estimated by libohova et al 2014 were estimated table 2 2 3 5 soilwat module the soilwat module one of the two soil water models available in apsim was used in this study this module runs a water balance on a daily step in which soil evaporation plant transpiration drainage and runoff are included water limitations on yield depend on soil water supply in the root exploration area and on the conversion efficiency of water into yield i e transpiration efficiency dolling et al 2005 for the simulations we used apsim s default transpiration efficiency values for corn 9pa which is a constant parameter during the whole period of crop growth the hydrological processes represented in soilwat were adapted from a long history of cascading bucket style water balances such as watbal keig and mcalpine 1976 and ceres ritchie 1972 jones and kiniry 1986 the main processes that determine the water drainage in the model are i the saturated flow which occurs when any soil layer fills above dul where a specified proportion defined by the user through swcon of the water in excess of dul drains to the next soil layer and ii the unsaturated flow at water contents below dul where gradients in soil water content occur between layers e g in response to rainfall events or evaporation keating et al 2003 for extractable soil water esw below dul water movement depends on the water content gradient between adjacent layers and the soil diffusivity which is a function of the average water content of the two soil layers in this study the diffusivity constant and slope were estimated from soil texture class according to dalgliesh et al 2012 40 and 16 respectively the associated parameter value for runoff cn2bare was derived from soil hydrological group and field slope information 78 dalgliesh et al 2012 the soil evaporation coefficients u represents the amount of accumulated evaporation before soil supply become limiting and cona is the ratio between the cumulative second stage evaporation and the square root of time were estimated from soil texture according to littleboy et al 1989 10 and 3 9 respectively initial soil water was not available at most locations hence these conditions were estimated using the approach described by ojeda et al 2017 based on this analysis initial soil water was set to 100 for all simulations i e as a fraction of maximum available water in the soil profile the initial soil water in spring was always close to dul for model validation to predict water loss by drainage the model output called drain was evaluated 2 4 evaluation of apsim performance model performance was assessed by comparing scatter plots of observed values in the y axis v modelled values in the x axis piñeiro et al 2008 for corn stover grain yield in all locations in west lafayette the over and under predictions of daily subsurface drainage were plotted against modelled esw in order to determine the role of soil water profile variations on the model performance the evaluation of model performance described in tedeschi 2006 and kobayashi and us salam 2000 was used to statistically evaluate model performance to predict corn stover grain yield and annual subsurface drainage this included observed and modelled mean and standard deviation the ccc mean square error mse and root mean square error rmse the ccc integrates precision through pearson s correlation coefficient which represents the proportion of the total variance in the observed data that can be explained by apsim and accuracy by bias which indicates how far the regression line deviates from the line 1 1 similarly the mse was partitioned into sb the simulation bias from the observation and mean square variation msv the difference between the simulation and the observation with respect to the deviation from the means using irene software fila et al 2003 simulation bias and msv are orthogonal and as a consequence can be analysed independently kobayashi and us salam 2000 the crop model performance was categorically evaluated based on the values of several statistical parameters and upper and lower limits were used as the model judgment according to the suggested by bellocchi et al 2010 we have considered that a step of parameter optimization was not necessary because the preliminary model performance was in the range proposed by ojeda et al 2017 i e calibration was deemed complete when ccc 0 60 and sb 40 for annual predictions for model validation upper and lower statistical limits were set as very good when ccc 0 90 and sb 20 satisfactory when 0 75 ccc 0 90 and 20 sb 30 acceptable when 0 60 ccc 0 75 and 30 sb 40 and poor with other values 3 results 3 1 stover and grain yield overall the model with the default settings demonstrated very good and satisfactory ability to simulate corn stover and grain yields respectively this was indicated by the summary statistics comparing observed and modelled stover 0 96 for ccc and 0 for sb and grain yields 0 85 and 2 for ccc and sb respectively figs 1 and 2 table 5 the mean observed stover and grain yields were 6213 3141kgha 1 and 8823 2201kgha 1 respectively the rmse for stover and grain yield varied between 545 1571 and 835 2099kgha 1 the apsim accuracy for predicting stover yield was better at wanatah and west lafayette fig 1a b and c ccc 0 95 0 99 and sb 2 8 than at lafayette fig 1d table 5 a satisfactory model prediction of grain yield was found at west lafayette and lafayette fig 2b c and d table 5 as indicated by the ccc 0 78 0 93 and the sb 5 27 table 5 nevertheless the model accuracy to predict grain yield at wanatah was poor fig 2a ccc 0 49 the model was also evaluated against end of season stover and grain yield data showing a very good performance for the long term dataset from west lafayette fig 3 the modelled data were 20 of observed data most years despite of n rate and crop rotation fig 3 simulations of stover and corn grain yield matched observations more closely when data were clustered by rotation 0 76 0 98 for ccc and 0 1 for sb and n rate 0 73 0 98 for ccc and 0 2 for sb fig 3 table 6 corn grain yield was predicted more accurately in continuous corn ccc 0 73 0 91 and sb 19 21 than in corn soybean rotations ccc 0 56 0 63 and sb 17 18 however corn stover yield was well predicted in both rotations 0 85 0 98 and 1 17 for ccc and sb respectively fig 3 table 6 the stover and grain yield model prediction was improved as the n rate was increased except for grain yield in the corn soybean rotation fig 3 table 6 the ccc and sb for stover yield ranged from 0 85 and 17 for the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 to 0 98 and 1 for the continuous corn rotation fertilized with 269kgnha 1 respectively however the ccc and sb for stover yield ranged from 0 56 and 17 for the corn soybean rotation fertilized by 201kgnha 1 to 0 91 and 21 for the continuous corn rotation fertilized with the highest n rate respectively 3 2 annual subsurface drainage in general the model with the default settings demonstrated acceptable ability to simulate annual subsurface drainflow from artificial drains under corn rotations 0 63 0 75 for ccc and 2 37 for sb fig 4 table 7 fig a1 the rmse for subsurface drainage varied between 60 and 96mm the apsim accuracy was better for predicting subsurface drainage in the corn soybean rotation fertilized with a low n rate 156kgnha 1 as evidenced by the ccc 0 75 and sb 2 fig 4a table 7 than for the n rate 201kgnha 1 ccc 0 66 and sb 37 fig 4b the model ability to predict the subsurface drainage in the continuous corn rotations was lower than in the corn soybean rotations ccc 0 61 0 63 and sb 9 12 fig 4 the observed subsurface drainage ranged from 151mm in the corn soybean rotation with 156kgnha 1 to 236mm in the continuous corn with 201kgnha 1 the modelled subsurface drainage was a 12 24 less than observed in all the treatments except for the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 where was higher in the order of 5 3 3 seasonal and daily subsurface drainage drain flow of these corn rotations occurred primarily in winter and early spring regardless of cropping system fig 5 however monthly subsurface drainage and rainfall were not clearly associated fig 5 for instance the subsurface drainage during winter months was circa 2 fold that in fall with similar monthly rainfalls in both seasons fig 5 when the ratio drainage rainfall d r was plotted against rainfall fig 6 a decrease of d r was shown as the monthly fig 6c and d and daily fig 6e and f rainfalls increase however no evident relationship between d r and rainfall was found plotting observed fig 6a and modelled fig 6b data by year the model predictions of subsurface drainage were acceptable at a monthly base ccc 0 59 0 70 sb 0 2 and poor at a daily base ccc 0 42 0 49 sb 0 table 8 although the apsim performance to simulate daily subsurface drainage timing and volumes was poor the under predicted events were higher during winter and in early spring when corn growth was slow figs 7 and 8 table 8 than during late spring and summer i e the time with corn growth was rapid figs 7 and 8 table 8 likewise there were several drainage events during fall as corn growth slowed where the model under predicted the daily subsurface drainage figs 7 a c and 8 the daily subsurface drainage was modelled by apsim only when the esw was greater than 455mm fig 9 for esw values greater than dul the model predicted a constant daily subsurface drainage of 20mm fig 9 likewise the model over predicted the daily subsurface drainage only for esw values greater than 455mm fig 10 however the model under predicted the daily subsurface drainage for a large range of esw values 380 470mm the number of under predicted daily observations of subsurface drainage was more than 3 times than the over predicted daily observations fig 10 the model performance to predict daily subsurface drainage for continuous corn and corn soybean rotations during 2001 and 2002 is shown as an illustrative example in figs 7 and 8 respectively both years were selected from the complete long term dataset figs a2 a9 the dynamics of daily subsurface drainage had similar pattern among different rotations and n rates for all years figs 7 8 and a2 a9 observed peak daily subsurface drainage usually occurred within the same day that a major rainfall event occurred figs 7 and 8 likewise the highest d r values were near 15 fig 6e and f however only 3 5 and 9 3 of the total modelled n 928 and observed n 905 d r values were higher than 3 4 discussion this study had two main objectives firstly to evaluate the apsim ability to simulate corn stover and grain yields in four contrasting soil series across three in locations secondly to evaluate the model performance to predict artificial subsurface drainage by cropping system rotation and n rate in a silty clay loam soil at west lafayette in 4 1 stover and grain yield the apsim model through the maize module of apsim provided a very good prediction for corn stover yield and a satisfactorily prediction of grain yield at these in locations fig 1 model performance in predicting corn grain yield was similar to that reported for other apsim validation studies including northern carberry et al 1996 and south eastern australia pembleton et al 2013 zimbabwe shamudzarira and robertson 2002 and the north plain chen et al 2010 and northeast china liu et al 2012 several studies have evaluated the accuracy and precision of apsim to simulate corn grain yield in continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in the us corn belt lyon et al 2003 malone et al 2007 dietzel et al 2016 lyon et al 2003 reported similar metrics of apsim performance ccc 0 96 for grain yield prediction in ia us using a limited number of observations n 10 however malone et al 2007 using single or split n applications in ia found that apsim did not simulate grain yield well ccc 0 28 and suggested that the poor accuracy was associated with the relatively simple n uptake routine which overemphasized n stress at floral initiation in contrast archontoulis et al 2014a reported very good corn yield predictions by apsim on three soil types typic aquic hapludoll and typic endoaquoll over multiple years in ia following best management practices for this region in agreement with our results these authors reported excellent agreement between predicted and observed corn grain yield r2 0 88 and in biomass yield predictions r2 0 97 0 99 although they not evaluated the apsim performance to predict corn stover yield several biophysical models have been used to predicted corn yields including the root zone water quality model rzwqm ahmed et al 2007 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat liu et al 2011 issa 2012 and hybrid maize grassini et al 2009 2011 issa 2012 using data from around north america however with the exception of the unpublished modelling study reported by issa 2012 using hybrid maize and dssat there are few published modelling reports evaluating crop model performance in predicting both corn stover and grain yield in the eastern corn belt of the us the apsim model showed very good accuracy for predicting stover yield at west lafayette and wanatah but the model accuracy to predict stover yield at lafayette was poor 8 out of 14 observations were under predicted fig 1d in contrast the apsim ability to predict grain yield at that location was satisfactory table 5 interestingly the difference between the observed and modelled standard deviation of stover yield 60 was much greater than for the grain yield 8 in lafayette this could be attributable to differences in the experimental handling among locations added to the few available data for this location n 14 as compared with the others n 63 76 surprisingly apsim performed much better for corn grain yield prediction in the continuous corn than in the corn soybean rotations whereas the model provided very good predictions of stover yield in both rotations fig 3 table 6 the model also predicted satisfactorily the year to year variability of grain and stover yield within a given cropping system fig 3 however there were notable exceptions including 1998 when the model under predicted stover yield in the continuous corn fig 3e and g and 2008 and 2010 where it under predicted grain yield in the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 fig 3b agricultural production systems simulator was able to satisfactorily predict biomass accumulation during corn growth including early growth stages fig 1 however neither biomass nor stover accumulations were directly related with grain yield predictions table 6 4 2 annual subsurface drainage the apsim model through soilwat module simulated the annual subsurface drainage in the corn rotations with acceptable accuracy for a silty clay loam soil at west lafayette table 7 the rmse in our study was between the values reported in the literature 103mm shen et al 1998 garrison et al 1999 ma et al 2007 dietzel et al 2016 this module is interfaced with the residue soiln modules and the plant module i e maize which indicates that simulation of the soil water balance is determined by variations in the status of surface residues e g tillage and decay rate and canopy cover this suggests that the model was able to capture the cropping system effect into the simulation fig 4 early attempts to calibrate crop models to predict subsurface drainage in the us corn belt were conducted by garrison et al 1999 at ia using continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in the ceres maize model the method used by these authors was based on the estimation of two parameters conductivity and effective drain spacing to describe subsurface flow and subsequently soil water dynamics they found rmse values of annual subsurface drainage between 14 54 and 32 91mm for a typic hapludoll and an aquic hapludoll respectively more recently malone et al 2007 reported that inaccurate yield estimations by apsim resulted in inaccurate subsurface drainage predictions however we did not find any correlation between grain yield and subsurface drainage at west lafayette not shown either for observed and modelled data for instance the lowest fit between observed and modelled corn grain yield in the corn soybean rotation fertilized with 156kgnha 1 ccc 0 63 and sb 18 table 6 corresponded to the best fit between observed and modelled subsurface drainage at the same rotation and n rate level ccc 0 75 and sb 2 table 7 several biophysical models such as rzwqm hanson et al 1998 drainmod youssef et al 2005 ale et al 2009 luo et al 2010 swat arnold et al 1998 cibin et al 2016 and apsim malone et al 2007 dietzel et al 2016 have been reported to simulate subsurface drainage with varying degrees of success recent studies have used swat to simulate the effects of management practices on hydrologic and water quality response at various spatial and temporal scales gassman et al 2007 baskaran et al 2010 chiang et al 2010 for example srinivasan et al 2010 reported a better prediction for streamflow ccc 1 and sb 5 than for corn grain yield ccc 0 34 and sb 47 in the upper mississippi river watershed although most of these studies were carried out at the watershed level some studies have been used swat to simulate perennial bioenergy feedstock production at the field scale trybula et al 2014 at the same field experiment ale et al 2009 showed that drainmod tended to under and over predicted the subsurface drainage during the growing season and the whole year in continuous corn rotations respectively the apsim accuracy to predict annual subsurface drainage was better in the corn soybean fig 4a and b than in the continuous corn rotations fig 4c and d in contrast malone et al 2007 found that the subsurface drainage under no till continuous corn was accurately predicted compared to the subsurface drainage in a no till corn soybean rotation because of higher residue i e less soil evaporation and lower transpiration on continuous corn rotation however apsim predicted annual subsurface drainage at these in locations better in the corn soybean fig 4a and b than in the continuous corn rotations fig 4c and d this could be attributed to the fact that the high cover residues of continuous corn v corn soybean rotations were incorporated to the soil every year using spring tillage therefore some effects such as increased infiltration due to additional surface residue weed and kanwar 1996 were not well simulated by apsim other studies have reported greater subsurface drainage from no till continuous corn compared to no till corn soybean rotations weed and kanwar 1996 kanwar et al 1997 while we found that subsurface drainage varied with crop rotations fig 4 our results have not been consistent with the body of literature for these environments therefore additional modelling studies evaluating subsurface drainage as affected by the interaction of crop rotations and tillage systems are required in this region 4 3 seasonal and daily subsurface drainage the greater subsurface drainage in winter and early spring than in summer and fall was evident in this study especially from january to june fig 5 also the modelled esw values during summer and fall months corresponding with the late crop growth were less than dul in the soil profile figs 7 8 and a2 a9 this indicated that evaporation and transpiration were dominant processes during summer and early fall soils in this region of in and the eastern corn belt are generally frozen and snow covered during winter months the first drainage water flow usually occurs during the snowmelt period in late winter early spring gray et al 2001 reported up to 120mm of snowmelt contribution to water infiltration in canada and northern latitudes of north america likewise previous modelling efforts have described snowmelt infiltration in south central mn us luo et al 2010 using drainmod the soilwat module of apsim is unable to simulate soil water input originating from snow and therefore the estimated soil water content and drainage in our study would not reflect this additional water source this could be the primary reason for the under prediction of subsurface flow in winter and early spring fig 6d by apsim where the soil profile could have received additional water from snowmelt instead only rainfall which may have increase the subsurface drainage figs 7 and 8 however the infiltration of meltwater into frozen soils is a complex process as it involves coupled heat and mass flow with phase changes likewise this process is defined by the soil thermal and hydro physical properties the soil temperature and moisture regimes and the quantity and the rate of release of meltwater from the snow cover gray et al 2001 an alternative to simulate this additional water from snowmelt could be add the equivalent rainfall amount to the rainfall input of apsim dietzel et al 2016 the d r increased as the rainfall events decreased either in a monthly fig 6c and d and daily base fig 6e and f which has been suggested as very important for the fine textured soils in low rainfall environments asseng et al 2000 however under in conditions soils are usually well supplied with water most months of the year due abundant snowmelt and rainfall that collectively keeps the soil near dul except when et is high during the growing season figs 7 8 and a2 a9 therefore the subsurface drainage under in conditions would be greater with smaller rainfall events during winter and early spring when the soils are close to dul figs 7 8 and a2 a9 likewise the analysis in a monthly patterns of d r v rainfall showed a better fit for observed data from july to december than january to june as evidenced by the r2 0 34 0 47 and 0 04 0 23 respectively fig 6c this seasonal difference is associated with completely canopy cover and high et in july to december that reduced esw values below the dul figs 7 and 8 and collectively leading to the very low subsurface drainage 10mm fig 5 by comparison low et and minimal canopy cover from january to june resulted in high subsurface flow rates fig 5 and esw values near to dul figs 7 and 8 certain daily peaks of subsurface drainage occurred the same day when a significant daily rainfall event higher than 30 40mm occurred during the corn growing season that were not simulated by the model especially when esw less than 463mm figs 7 a c 8 a c this flow that occurs under unsaturated soil conditions suggests possible preferential flow of water through soil macropores similar results were found during fallow periods in western australia george et al 1997 in response to large rainfall events dolling et al 2006 moreover preferential water flows were reported by several studies for different soil types and cropping systems singh and kanwar 1991 edwards et al 1993 kanwar et al 1997 jiang et al 2017 for example stone and wilson 2006 reported that preferential water flow through soil macropores during storms in a subsurface drained field in in contributed between 11 and 51 of total subsurface drainage with peak contributions between 40 and 81 coinciding with times of peak subsurface flow similar results were found for till and no till continuous corn and corn soybean rotations in silty soils at ia us kanwar et al 1997 the timing of peak flow was between 0 5h to about 6h after the beginning of a major rainfall event bjorneberg and melvin 1996 our study showed that apsim poorly predicted the daily subsurface drainage within a narrow range of esw fig 10 additionally there were a large number of flow under predictions for esw values less than the dul fig 10 this further suggests that preferential flow occurred and apsim through soilwat was not able to accurately predict this pathway of water loss which relies on the module mechanism to simulate daily subsurface drainage while drainage from each soil layer in apsim can be changed via the swcon parameter dolling et al 2006 as currently programmed swcon cannot simulate preferential flow further research is required to determine a more accurate and independent method of determining daily subsurface drainage from one layer to the next due to preferential flow although the inclusion of preferential flow processes into soilwat module could lead to greater apsim accuracy to predict subsurface drainage it is not clear at this time how best to parametrize this process in this sense as pointed out by others the more accurately the processes are described the greater the error introduced through incorrect parametrization van der laan et al 2014 as many of the input parameters required to simulate soil water balance in the model cannot be measured directly calibration with observed data is key particularly for models such as apsim where important processes are represented empirically likewise a model sensitivity analysis may also help to identify key parameters or variables that should be measured to generate useful calibration data van der laan et al 2014 ojeda et al 2016 2017 5 conclusions we used a long term dataset of continuously cropped corn and corn soybean rotations to demonstrate the potential of apsim to predict corn stover and grain and simultaneous subsurface drainage in north central indiana us during winter and early spring the model under predicted the daily subsurface drainage additionally there were a large number of flow under predictions for modelled extractable soil water values less than drained upper limit during the late growing corn season soil water dynamic driven by the cascading bucket approach was identified as a critical aspect of the model for accurate simulation of subsurface drainage when monthly and daily rainfalls were smaller but modelled extractable soil water values were higher than drained upper limit more drainage per unit of rainfall was found our results confirm using apsim to predict subsurface drainage in corn based cropping systems in north central indiana us additional studies will improve the model accuracy and inference space the ability

11621,the crop water use phone app is a weather based program developed by the missouri extension service to help farmers with irrigation scheduling a limitation of the program is that it only works on missouri fields the app is linked to the state agricultural weather station network which supplies daily standardized short crop evapotranspiration eto for farmers outside the network the cost of installing and maintaining appropriately maintained weather stations is cost prohibitive a less costly option would be to install atmometers within the field of interest the objective of this study was to compare eto data from atmometers to electronic weather stations with traditional sensors in 2015 and 2016 electronic atmometers were installed at three locations in missouri atmometers were placed near electronic weather stations programmed to calculate daily eto each atmometer ceramic cup was fitted with a disposable paper wafer and 30 diffusion canvas cover and wired to an event data logger to record daily eto measurements regression analysis showed a close relationship between eto measured with atmometers and weather station across locations and years r2 0 74 however eto from atmometers averaged 15 lower than weather stations regional or localized calibration equations may be required before using eto from atmometers in irrigation scheduling apps but additional research is needed to determine if the observed differences impact recommended irrigation intervals keywords atmometer etgage evapotranspiration weather station irrigation scheduling phone app 1 introduction water is an important management factor for row crop production especially in regions where irrigation is applied to supplement rainfall farmers are encouraged to maximize irrigation efficiency in fields to reduce input costs conserve water resources and minimize nutrient runoff to streams usda natural resources conservation service 2015 irrigation scheduling programs are useful tools for improving water efficiency several state extension services have developed mobile phone apps linked to electronic weather station networks to calculate evapotranspiration used for irrigation scheduling andales et al 2015 migliaccio et al 2016 peters 2015 et is a critical element in irrigation scheduling and helps calculate a running soil water balance in crop fields et is the combination of transpiration from the crop and evaporation of the water from the soil or plant surfaces scherer et al 1999 in the central united states the climate is humid but periods of low rainfall are common in the summer months when crops are growing irrigation is often applied in fields to prevent water stress and increase crop yields the university of missouri extension service maintains an agricultural weather station network mesonet which provides weather data to farmers for managing irrigation the weather stations meet standards approved by the american society of agricultural

mesonet have a campbell scientific cr 1000 data logger which is programmed to calculate standardized short grass evapotranspiration called eto campbell sci 2015 for farmers calculating daily crop et for irrigation scheduling eto is multiplied by a coefficient kc specific to the crop in the field in the northern hemisphere eto is usually highest in june and july when days are longer fig 1 eto varies from year to year which is a limitation for irrigation scheduling from printed charts that rely on long term weather averages a modified penman monteith equation is commonly used to calculate eto monteith 1985 campbell scientific weather stations use a standardized version of the equation developed by the task committee on standardization of reference evapotranspiration and included in their technical committee report to the environmental and water resources institute of the american society of civil engineers campbell sci 1999 walter et al 2000 most farmers do not have time to manually calculate daily crop et and soil water deficits from weather data for their fields in 2015 the university of missouri extension service released an irrigation app for mobile phones called the crop water use app which uses daily eto from the state mesonet stevens et al 2016 many of the equations in the missouri program including crop coefficients were modified from the arkansas irrigation scheduler cahoon et al 1990 vories et al 2009 most state extension irrigation scheduling apps including missouri s program make recommendations using the water balance approach andales et al 2011 lack of eto data is a limitation for farmers wanting to use these apps for irrigation scheduling some states in the region have mesonets but do not calculate eto while other states are data sparse when it comes to the number of weather stations that do calculate it one of the largest systems for sharing weather data among universities and government agencies operates in the western region the irrigation scheduler mobile phone app developed at washington state university accesses eto from agrimet pacific northeast a group of 270 weather stations maintained by the bureau of reclamation and mesonets in washington montana colorado arizona north dakota south dakota and california palmer and hamel 2009 in georgia and florida developers of an irrigation app for cotton called cotton smartirrigation are testing novel ways to provide eto values to farmers using their program in other states vellidis et al 2016 an experimental forecast et tool fret produced by the national weather service was evaluated as a substitute for local weather station generated et a shortcoming of the fret tool is that the national weather service predicts eto for tomorrow and the near future but does not calculate eto values from actual weather from the past vellidis et al 2016 found that fret often overestimated eto which could lead to recommendations for unnecessary irrigation applications hopefully fret and similar tools will improve with time another approach is to install more weather stations in states without mesonets but appropriately equipped and remotely accessible electronic weather stations are expensive to install and keep maintained in missouri each electronic weather stations with sensors for et calculation costs about 10 000 us communication equipment and annual maintenance add another 3000 to the cost electronic modified atmometers model e etgage co loveland co which cost about 1000 us may be a less expensive way to supply daily et data to farmers in places that they do not have an established mesonet as with conventional weather stations a modem or radio would be needed with an atmometer to remotely upload weather data however less expensive manually read versions of the etgage are also available if remote access is not required little research has been reported in humid environments comparing electronic atmometers to weather stations with sensors for solar radiation wind temperature and humidity a few experiments have been conducted using an atmometer to measure et outside the us however they occurred in the semiarid and subtropical environments of spain and italy magliulo et al 2003 gavilán and castillo llanque 2009 in the semiarid environment of colorado gleason et al 2013 showed a strong correlation comparing atmometers to weather station data for et over four growing seasons in that study an alfalfa or tall grass reference etr was evaluated instead of short grass eto an atmometer functions the opposite of a rain gauge where instead of collecting and measuring the amount of rain in a gauge the amount of water removed from a gauge is measured the ceramic cup located on the top of the atmometer is an evaporative surface which wicks water through a tube from the reservoir located in the base of the instrument the ceramic cup is similar to the evaporimeter that sir john leslie constructed in the late 1880 s that used an earthenware ball instead of paper as the wicking device colby and williams 1917 over the years improvements have been made to the design of atmometers bauder 1999 irmak et al 2005 the etgage model e atmometer has a reservoir below the evaporator which holds distilled water water is drawn from the reservoir during evaporation events and passes through a calibrated glass measuring vial one full vial corresponds with 0 254mm evapotranspiration etgage model e manual loveland co electronics in the gage detect when the vial is empty and use a solenoid valve to refill it each time the vial is filled an open collector transistor sends a pulse signal similar to the output from a tipping bucket rain gauge most event loggers can record this type of input the electronic etgage is powered with four aa alkaline batteries or a 5 16v dc external power supply a green canvas diffusion cover is placed over the disc to mimic a growing crop the etgage company sells 30 diffusion covers to simulate eto and 54 darker green covers to simulate etr et readings with the 54 cover are usually 10 15 greater than readings with the 30 cover etgage user manual 2015 between the green canvas and the ceramic cup is a paper wafer cover that allows water to pass through in one direction preventing rainfall from entering the gage the wafer may help the accuracy in a humid environment where there is a higher annual precipitation than the locations in the previous experiments the cup of each atmometer is filled with distilled water to saturate the pores and allow for water to naturally wick away the cost of the atmometer is much less than a fully equipped electronic weather station and may be more viable to install in farms in other states without mesonets or in developing countries if they are accurate atmometers could be used anywhere in the world where a daily et estimate is needed for irrigation scheduling using the water balance approach the objective of this study was to validate the use of an atmometer in a humid environment and compare the resulting eto data to values calculated with a weather station with traditional sensors 2 materials and methods in 2015 two methods for calculating eto from data collected from a weather station at portageville mo were compared based on the asce standardized penman monteith pm equation walter et al 2000 daily eto values generated by a factory installed program in a cr 1000 datalogger were recorded and solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures humidity and average wind speed were entered into an excel spreadsheet program called pmday developed by richard snyder at university of california for 0 12m short cool season grass synder and eching 2006 in april 2015 and 2016 electronic etgage model e loveland co atmometers were installed at three of the university of missouri college of agriculture food and natural resources experiment farms located across the state in 2015 one atmometer was installed in the northwest region at the hundley whaley research center in albany mo 40 24 n 94 34 w atmometers were also installed in the southeast region at fisher delta research center marsh farm

linneus from may 18 to september 30 and at portageville from may 12 to august 25 at each location an atmometer was installed near a campbell scientific weather station that computed real time eto weather information including rainfall in 5 min intervals was sent from each location to a server on campus at the university of missouri where it was archived this provided a resource for comparing

spreadsheet software was used to make linear regression charts and calculate evapotranspiration with the standardized penman monteith equation microsoft corp redmond wa 3 results and discussion the benchmark chosen to evaluate atmometer accuracy was eto values calculated by the cr 1000 datalogger program in the campbell weather stations in a validation test eto calculations from the portageville weather station agreed closely with eto values from the pmday spreadsheet calculations since these both use the asce standardized equation the only difference was the fact that campbell uses the sum of hourly values while pmday calculates a single day value in a graph polynomial trend lines for both methods overlapped fig 1 using a linear regression model eto estimates between weather station dataloggers and the spreadsheet were correlated r2 0 93 across all days in 2015 cr 1000 evapotranspiration estimates averaged 3 less with the datalogger than pm calculations using the snyder spreadsheet program weather station and atmometers produced similar eto estimates increasing on sunny days and decreasing on cloudy days but daily atmometer estimates of eto with atmometers were usually lower than pm equation calculated values from weather stations eto estimates in a regression model across all stations for the two years showed atmometers predicted 15 less eto than datalogger calculations fig 2 the r2 from linear regression between methods was 0 8113 the difference in distance from the ground between instruments may have impacted the et estimates for ease of maintenance the etgage manual recommends placing the top of the atmometer evaporator 1m from the ground however wind anemometers and humidity sensors on weather stations in agricultural networks are usually placed 3m and 1 5m respectively from the ground stull 1988 reported that wind speed decreases when instruments are placed closer to the ground while humidity increases near the ground wind and humidity conditions may have been enough to account for the difference in eto estimates between instruments in colorado gleason et al 2013 found that atmometers tended to underestimate alfalfa reference et similar results of slight underestimation of eto by atmometers were found in california battany 2013 a potential problem with using atmometers in humid regions is interference of frequent rainfall affecting evaporation from the canvas covers however no consistent pattern of discrepancy between weather station and atmometers relative to average daily rainfall was found fig 3 in this study from july 1 to august 19 albany missouri in 2015 had the most rainfall of the weather stations in the 50day period but the greatest discrepancy between eto from weather stations and atmometers for the period occurred at linneus in 2016 the deviation at portageville the only location observed both years was very similar between two years with different average daily rainfall amounts a slightly larger deviation was observed between portageville and hayward in 2015 two stations that are only 7 9km apart plotting eto readings from weather station and atmometers on charts showed a similar pattern between methods of measurement figs 4 9 generally on days that rainfall occurred both methods showed reduced eto estimates probably from low solar radiation and lower temperature likewise on sunny days eto estimates increased using both methods the main concern with the atmometers was that they generally underestimated eto compared to weather stations an anomaly occurred at portageville on august 3 2015 fig 5 measured eto from the atmometer increased 3 1mm from the previous day but calculated eto from the weather station only increased 0 3mm observing the individual events from the data logger showed that ten events were recorded over a period of 31s on the morning of august 3 air bubbles in the atmometer may have dislodged that day causing pulses that were read as evaporation while error testing associated with most mesonets would note such an anomaly individual users probably would not however an individual user would probably be using a less expensive manual gage and the error would not occur finally to more closely observe the effect of rainfall on agreement between the two methods hourly data from portageville on june 19 20 were compared fig 10 a total of 25mm of rainfall was recorded on june 19 and the calculated eto value was 0 8mm greater than the atmometer value no rainfall was recorded on june 20 and the calculated eto value was 0 9mm greater than the atmometer value 4 conclusion electronic atmometers were about one tenth the cost of purchasing an automated weather station made to asabe standards for estimating evapotranspiration and manually read gauges are even less expensive a two year study at three locations in missouri showed that atmometers and weather stations tracked eto in similar patterns increasing and decreasing in response to changes in daily weather conditions however atmometers underestimated evapotranspiration relative to the calculated values localized or regional calibration equations may be required before using eto from atmometers in irrigation scheduling apps this research showed that atmometer measured eto may have potential for irrigation scheduling in humid regions further experiments with different canvas green covers for the atmometer or installing them higher from the ground might also be helpful if anometers are placed 3m from the ground a step latter may be required to add more water to the reservoir during the season the differences between methods may result in only minor differences in irrigation scheduling the average daily differences observed at portageville were approximately 0 2mm in both a wet and a dry year compared to a typical allowable soil water deficit to trigger irrigation in missouri 25mm additional research is needed to further investigate the difference and determine the effect on irrigation intervals 
11621,the crop water use phone app is a weather based program developed by the missouri extension service to help farmers with irrigation scheduling a limitation of the program is that it only works on missouri fields the app is linked to the state agricultural weather station network which supplies daily standardized short crop evapotranspiration eto for farmers outside the network the cost of installing and maintaining appropriately maintained weather stations is cost prohibitive a less costly option would be to install atmometers within the field of interest the objective of this study was to compare eto data from atmometers to electronic weather stations with traditional sensors in 2015 and 2016 electronic atmometers were installed at three locations in missouri atmometers were placed near electronic weather stations programmed to calculate daily eto each atmometer ceramic cup was fitted with a disposable paper wafer and 30 diffusion canvas cover and wired to an event data logger to record daily eto measurements regression analysis showed a close relationship between eto measured with atmometers and weather station across locations and years r2 0 74 however eto from atmometers averaged 15 lower than weather stations regional or localized calibration equations may be required before using eto from atmometers in irrigation scheduling apps but additional research is needed to determine if the observed differences impact recommended irrigation intervals keywords atmometer etgage evapotranspiration weather station irrigation scheduling phone app 1 introduction water is an important management factor for row crop production especially in regions where irrigation is applied to supplement rainfall farmers are encouraged to maximize irrigation efficiency in fields to reduce input costs conserve water resources and minimize nutrient runoff to streams usda natural resources conservation service 2015 irrigation scheduling programs are useful tools for improving water efficiency several state extension services have developed mobile phone apps linked to electronic weather station networks to calculate evapotranspiration used for irrigation scheduling andales et al 2015 migliaccio et al 2016 peters 2015 et is a critical element in irrigation scheduling and helps calculate a running soil water balance in crop fields et is the combination of transpiration from the crop and evaporation of the water from the soil or plant surfaces scherer et al 1999 in the central united states the climate is humid but periods of low rainfall are common in the summer months when crops are growing irrigation is often applied in fields to prevent water stress and increase crop yields the university of missouri extension service maintains an agricultural weather station network mesonet which provides weather data to farmers for managing irrigation the weather stations meet standards approved by the american society of agricultural

x and battery charged with a solar panel the wind anemometers are installed 3m above the ground the datalogger and battery are stored in a weather resistant enclosure most of the 34 stations in the mesonet have a campbell scientific cr 1000 data logger which is programmed to calculate standardized short grass evapotranspiration called eto campbell sci 2015 for farmers calculating daily crop et for irrigation scheduling eto is multiplied by a coefficient kc specific to the crop in the field in the northern hemisphere eto is usually highest in june and july when days are longer fig 1 eto varies from year to year which is a limitation for irrigation scheduling from printed charts that rely on long term weather averages a modified penman monteith equation is commonly used to calculate eto monteith 1985 campbell scientific weather stations use a standardized version of the equation developed by the task committee on standardization of reference evapotranspiration and included in their technical committee report to the environmental and water resources institute of the american society of civil engineers campbell sci 1999 walter et al 2000 most farmers do not have time to manually calculate daily crop et and soil water deficits from weather data for their fields in 2015 the university of missouri extension service released an irrigation app for mobile phones called the crop water use app which uses daily eto from the state mesonet stevens et al 2016 many of the equations in the missouri program including crop coefficients were modified from the arkansas irrigation scheduler cahoon et al 1990 vories et al 2009 most state extension irrigation scheduling apps including missouri s program make recommendations using the water balance approach andales et al 2011 lack of eto data is a limitation for farmers wanting to use these apps for irrigation scheduling some states in the region have mesonets but do not calculate eto while other states are data sparse when it comes to the number of weather stations that do calculate it one of the largest systems for sharing weather data among universities and government agencies operates in the western region the irrigation scheduler mobile phone app developed at washington state university accesses eto from agrimet pacific northeast a group of 270 weather stations maintained by the bureau of reclamation and mesonets in washington montana colorado arizona north dakota south dakota and california palmer and hamel 2009 in georgia and florida developers of an irrigation app for cotton called cotton smartirrigation are testing novel ways to provide eto values to farmers using their program in other states vellidis et al 2016 an experimental forecast et tool fret produced by the national weather service was evaluated as a substitute for local weather station generated et a shortcoming of the fret tool is that the national weather service predicts eto for tomorrow and the near future but does not calculate eto values from actual weather from the past vellidis et al 2016 found that fret often overestimated eto which could lead to recommendations for unnecessary irrigation applications hopefully fret and similar tools will improve with time another approach is to install more weather stations in states without mesonets but appropriately equipped and remotely accessible electronic weather stations are expensive to install and keep maintained in missouri each electronic weather stations with sensors for et calculation costs about 10 000 us communication equipment and annual maintenance add another 3000 to the cost electronic modified atmometers model e etgage co loveland co which cost about 1000 us may be a less expensive way to supply daily et data to farmers in places that they do not have an established mesonet as with conventional weather stations a modem or radio would be needed with an atmometer to remotely upload weather data however less expensive manually read versions of the etgage are also available if remote access is not required little research has been reported in humid environments comparing electronic atmometers to weather stations with sensors for solar radiation wind temperature and humidity a few experiments have been conducted using an atmometer to measure et outside the us however they occurred in the semiarid and subtropical environments of spain and italy magliulo et al 2003 gavilán and castillo llanque 2009 in the semiarid environment of colorado gleason et al 2013 showed a strong correlation comparing atmometers to weather station data for et over four growing seasons in that study an alfalfa or tall grass reference etr was evaluated instead of short grass eto an atmometer functions the opposite of a rain gauge where instead of collecting and measuring the amount of rain in a gauge the amount of water removed from a gauge is measured the ceramic cup located on the top of the atmometer is an evaporative surface which wicks water through a tube from the reservoir located in the base of the instrument the ceramic cup is similar to the evaporimeter that sir john leslie constructed in the late 1880 s that used an earthenware ball instead of paper as the wicking device colby and williams 1917 over the years improvements have been made to the design of atmometers bauder 1999 irmak et al 2005 the etgage model e atmometer has a reservoir below the evaporator which holds distilled water water is drawn from the reservoir during evaporation events and passes through a calibrated glass measuring vial one full vial corresponds with 0 254mm evapotranspiration etgage model e manual loveland co electronics in the gage detect when the vial is empty and use a solenoid valve to refill it each time the vial is filled an open collector transistor sends a pulse signal similar to the output from a tipping bucket rain gauge most event loggers can record this type of input the electronic etgage is powered with four aa alkaline batteries or a 5 16v dc external power supply a green canvas diffusion cover is placed over the disc to mimic a growing crop the etgage company sells 30 diffusion covers to simulate eto and 54 darker green covers to simulate etr et readings with the 54 cover are usually 10 15 greater than readings with the 30 cover etgage user manual 2015 between the green canvas and the ceramic cup is a paper wafer cover that allows water to pass through in one direction preventing rainfall from entering the gage the wafer may help the accuracy in a humid environment where there is a higher annual precipitation than the locations in the previous experiments the cup of each atmometer is filled with distilled water to saturate the pores and allow for water to naturally wick away the cost of the atmometer is much less than a fully equipped electronic weather station and may be more viable to install in farms in other states without mesonets or in developing countries if they are accurate atmometers could be used anywhere in the world where a daily et estimate is needed for irrigation scheduling using the water balance approach the objective of this study was to validate the use of an atmometer in a humid environment and compare the resulting eto data to values calculated with a weather station with traditional sensors 2 materials and methods in 2015 two methods for calculating eto from data collected from a weather station at portageville mo were compared based on the asce standardized penman monteith pm equation walter et al 2000 daily eto values generated by a factory installed program in a cr 1000 datalogger were recorded and solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures humidity and average wind speed were entered into an excel

linneus from may 18 to september 30 and at portageville from may 12 to august 25 at each location an atmometer was installed near a campbell scientific weather station that computed real time eto weather information including rainfall in 5 min intervals was sent from each location to a server on campus at the university of missouri where it was archived this provided a resource for comparing

11622,for the simulation of soil water movement nitrogen n dynamics and crop growth under tile drainage current interdisciplinary models or modules were integrated into an established model through a typical technique for solving specific soil crop modeling issues a drainmod based drainage component was developed for the soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns model the newly developed model was validated using two field experiment datasets from iowa i four year data of daily monthly annual subsurface drain flow and n losses and seasonal crop growth data and ii 16year data of subsurface drain flow for the drainage enhanced whcns model the mean n 4 calibration validation corn soybean normalized root mean square errors nrmse for soil water storage crop dry matter yield and crop n uptake simulation were 8 0 18 9 6 9 and 12 5 respectively the nrmse values for annual subsurface drainage and n losses totals were 5 8 and 37 9 respectively meanwhile the monthly subsurface

subsurface drainage water nitrate concentrations within the federal drinking water standard 10mgl 1 while maintaining corn yield the newly developed model showed a great potential to evaluate the short long term effects of subsurface drainage system operations on water balance n losses and crop growth keyword subsurface drainage nitrogen losses optimal n application rate drainmod whcns 1 introduction artificially drained cropland accounting for nearly 17 of the total cultivated areas in the world is vital to sustaining global crop production particularly given its role in reducing the incidence of waterlogging and saline alkali soils valipour 2014 two types of agricultural drainage systems include open surface ditches and subsurface tile drains the latter of which are widely implemented in several agricultural production systems in developed countries because they can control water logging and salinization while maintaining crop yields skaggs 1978 while agricultural subsurface drainage systems contribute to reducing the incidence of waterlogging and saline alkali soil problems and maintaining crop production their improper design and management can lead to the following environmental issues i accelerated losses of field water nitrogen n and other nutrients and ii altered hydrology and water quality of downstream water courses leading to eutrophication salinization and other issues smedema 2000 rabalais et al 2001 approximately 9 3mha of land in iowa is dedicated to row crop production of which nearly 40 is subsurface drained baker et al 2004 contributing over 0 2 gg n y 1 about 26kgnha 1 to the mississippi river basin schilling and libra 2000 the recurrent occurrence of hypoxic areas in the gulf of mexico where eutrophication arises from excessive algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water is often attributed to the subsurface drainage water bearing high loads of nitrate n discharged into the mississippi river rabalais et al 2001 usepa 2007 libra 1998 estimated that 25 of the nitrate in the gulf of mexico originated from the mississippi river originates in iowa although iowa occupies less than 5 of the mississippi s drainage basin excessive agricultural n inputs and inappropriate water management practices are suspected to be major reasons for the water quality degradation due to intensive crop production in iowa and elsewhere usepa 2007 thus optimizing n management and reducing environmental pollution risks are necessary agricultural system models present marked advantages in the quantitative evaluation of the effects of soil climate and field practices on crop yield and their environmental costs holzworth et al 2015 over the past few decades many process based models have been developed to simulate the processes of soil plant atmosphere continuum each being focused on specifying the aspects of driving factors environment conditions and key processes in agricultural production for example century metherell et al 1993 rothc coleman and jenkinson 1996 and dndc li et al 1992 were typically developed for simulating carbon c and n cycles and greenhouse gas emission where daisy hansen et al 1990 rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 dssat jones et al 2003 and apsim keating et al 2003 were developed for crop growth and associated water and n management practices however all these models were initially developed for nondrained agricultural systems few models can be used to design drainage systems and water and n management practices under drainage system for example drainmod has been successfully tested and applied to hydrological simulations under subsurface drainage conditions skaggs 1978 davis et al 2000 singh et al 2006 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2006 successfully employed drainmod to optimize the design of subsurface drainage system in pocahontas iowa usa and suggested that the drain depth of 1 05m and drain spacing of 25m are the best combination at the study area for maximum crop production while minimizing subsurface drainage and its associated nitrate leaching luo et al 2010 applied drainmod nii model to simulate the long term effect of drain spacing on subsurface drainage n losses from drains and corn yield in northern corn belt reported that the annual subsurface and n losses from drains can be reduced by 20 30 without significantly decreasing corn yield through optimizing drain spacing design agricultural drainage and pesticide transport adapt model was also widely used to analyze the impacts of the design of subsurface drainage system on subsurface drainage and nitrate leaching gowda et al 2012 using this model davis et al 2000 analyzed the effect of subsurface drainage system design and n application on n losses from drains in upper midwestern usa and found that the rate of n loss was higher at decreased n application rates than at increased in drain spacing or decreased in drain depth drainmod and adapt lack mechanistic crop growth model and are thus unable to simulate the detailed crop growth and development to solve this problem negm et al 2014 fully integrated drainmod drainmod nii and dssat into a new drainmod dssat model the newly developed model successfully used in evaluating the effects of controlled drainage on water balance water quality and crop yield in a corn soybean cropping system in central iowa negm et al 2017 however in the drainmod drainmod nii and drainmod dssat models a water balance method is used to simulate soil water movement and thus the water flow interaction between the unsaturated and saturated layers of soil especially for the upward water flow from saturated layer is disregarded meanwhile some agricultural system models including rzwqm dssat apsim and daisy had been integrated in the subsurface drainage components in the recent studies saseendran et al 2007 malone et al 2007a mollerup et al 2014 however in these models the subsurface drainage module used in these models was not based on drainmod and the drainage flow was calculated by a steady state hooghoudt equation singh and kanwar 1995 pointed out that the method generally underestimates the magnitudes of peak drainage flows and overestimates total drainage flows this phenomenon was also observed by qi et al 2011 recently liang et al 2016a developed a process based water and n management model whcns this model can simulate water c and n dynamics and plant growth under various agricultural management practices the model is adopted to simulate soil water movement soil n transport and crop growth successfully in north china li et al 2015b liang et al 2016b however lack of a hydrological module of whcns prevents it from simulating subsurface drainage and its potential effects on crop growth and n losses in the present study a drainmod based subsurface drainage module was developed to enable the whcns model to simulate soil water movement c and n cycles and crop growth under tile drained conditions this new modelling tool will further expand the whcns to analyze the effect of various agricultural practices on crop production and environment in drained cropland thus in the present study we aim to i develop a subsurface drainage component for the whcns model by coupling it with the drainmod model ii test the capability of the coupled model to simulate subsurface drainage and n losses under short and long term subsurface drainage conditions and iii optimize n application rates for subsurface drained corn field to reduce the risk of downstream water eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1

modified green ampt approach hachum and alfaro 1980 water redistribution is simulated by the richards equation moreover soil evaporation and plant uptake are considered as upper boundary condition and sink in the richards equation respectively and runoff is calculated using the scs curve approach designed by the u s natural resource conservation service nrcs 2004 the soil heat transfer simulation follows the approach used in the hydrus 1d model by convection dispersion equation simunek et al 1998 soil c and n cycling concepts are drawn from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the organic matter in soil is divided into three main pools namely added organic matter aom soil microbial biomass smb and dead native soil organic matter som each of which is divided into two subpools one subpool has a slow turnover rate e g aom1 smb1 and som1 whereas the other with a fast turnover rate e g aom2 smb2 and som2 the c flows between different pools were calculated by the first order kinetic equation and corresponding n flows were computed through the c n ratios of the pools which are assumed to be constant over time soil n transport was described by convection dispersion equation n transformations

nitrification and n fixation were assumed to follow the michaelis menten kinetics urea hydrolysis ammonia volatilization and denitrification are described by the first order kinetic equation the

grain yield monteith s approach for potential biomass monteith and moss 1977 and stress adjustments for water temperature and n availability in the root zone of the soil profile the water stress factor was derived by dividing the actual transpiration by the potential transpiration the n stress was calculated based on the simulation of the crop n demand actual soil n supply and crop n uptake

crop growth under tile drained conditions 2 2 field experiment and data collection the field study was conducted at the agricultural drainage water quality research and demonstration site adwq rds formerly the agricultural drainage well site near gilmore city pocahontas county north central iowa 43 0 n 92 5 w in the area the predominant soils are nicollet fine loamy mixed superactive and mesic aquic hapludoll webster fine loamy mixed superactive calcareous and mesic typic endoaquolls canisteo fine loamy mixed superactive calcareous and mesic typic endoaquolls and okoboji fine senectitic and mesic cumulic vertic endoaquolls usda 1985 the basic soil physical properties are shown in table 1 the site had a total of 78 identically laid out individually drained plots each of which was 38m in length and 15 2m in width plots were established after the installation of a corrugated plastic drain pipe through the center and along both boundaries parallel to the long dimension 7 6m spacing at a depth of 1 06m the two border drains which were installed to help prevent lateral flow between adjacent plots have outlets to the surface at a remote location the design of this drainage site and the layout of the plots were described in detail by lawlor et al 2008 initiated in the fall of 2004 a five year field experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design where 78 plots were assigned to blocks according to their long term drainage performance the following treatments were used in this study t1 corn in odd years and soybean in even years and t2 soybean in odd years and corn in even years starting in april 2006 weekly soil moisture content daily subsurface drainage flow volume and monthly nitrate n concentration in drainage flow were measured for all t1 and t2 treatment plots for each plot weekly measurements of gravimetric soil water content were made from disturbed soil samples collected from depths of 0 0 15m 0 15 0 30m and 0 30 0 60m with a jmc soil sampler clements associates inc newton ia usa observed soil volumetric moisture content was then obtained by multiplying the gravimetric moisture content by soil bulk density soil water storage sws was calculated by multiplying the depth with soil volumetric water content the aboveground biomass of corn and soybean were sampled at three week intervals during the growing seasons from 2006 to 2009 samples were dried at 60 c for a week and weighed total n content was analyzed using the combustion method to determine crop yield twelve of twenty rows of corn or soybean in each plot were harvested with a combine total grain yield was measured by weight and subsamples were taken to determine moisture details on measurements can be found elsewhere qi et al 2011 to validate the whcns model for long term hydrological simulation a distinct 16 year long term subsurface drainage dataset was employed the experiment was conducted at the same experiment site from 1989 to 2004 the subsurface drainage was observed from 1989 to 2004 in this site the detailed experimental design can be found in lawlor et al 2008 and qi et al 2012 2 3 optimizing n application rates nitrogen application rates had a significant effect on crop yield and n losses from drains davis et al 2000 saseendran et al 2007 negm et al 2014 to explore the relationship between n losses from subsurface drainage and n application rates for corn optimizing n fertilizer application to match crop requirements is crucial in this study the newly developed whcns model was used to optimize n application rates based on the results from 2006 to 2009 in the field experiments the timing of n application was fixed but the total n fertilizer inputs ranged from 0 to 240kgnha 1 in the increments of 20kgnha 1 i e 13 different n application rates resulting in 52 scenarios 13n application rates 4years 2 4 model input and calibration field data from the t1 and t2 treatments in 2006 and 2007 calibration phase were used to calibrate the model calibration was performed using a trial and error approach to adjust the n transformation parameters ksat l and crop parameters to achieve the best possible agreement between simulated and measured sws subsurface water drainage n losses from subsurface drainage crop dry matter dm and yield after calibration field data from the t1 and t2 treatments in 2008 and 2009 validation phase were used to validate the model the detailed input parameters include soil hydraulic parameters soil c and n transformation parameters and crop parameters 2 4 1 soil hydraulic parameters soil water retention θ h and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h functions were used in the van genuchten 1987 and mualem 1976 models respectively initial parameters in the functions are derived from measured data qi et al 2011 and then calibrated to achieve the closest possible match between simulated and measured soil moisture contents saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity ksat l a key parameter in predicting subsurface drainage flux in hooghout s and kirkham s equations was similarly adjusted to achieve the best match between the simulated and measured daily drainage fluxes inputs for bulk density particle size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were obtained directly from the measurements table 1 2 4 2 soil carbon and nitrogen transformation parameters in the whcns model the scope of microbial activity in the soil on the basis of which simulations of soil n transformation processes mineralization immobilization nitrification and denitrification are made can be set according to soil depth in the present study the scope of soil microbial activity was set from 0 to 0 50m soil depth the initial parameters of n transformation were adopted from the default values of the daisy model hansen et al 1990 and then calibrated according to measured n loss data thorp et al 2007 simulated the effect of n application rate on n balances using rzwqm dssat in iowa and found that n gas emission was low in this area in this study the denitrification and volatilization parameters were set to low values to match with those of thorp et al 2007 the calibrated n transformation parameters are listed in table 2 as the long term dynamic simulation of som was not the main goal of this study parameters for som decomposition and decay rate were all drawn from previous studies as shown in table 2 hansen et al 1990 mueller et al 1998 similarly the initial c n ratio of residues and the distribution coefficient of the som pools were drawn from the literature jensen et al 2005 2 4 3 meteorological data meteorological data including daily precipitation solar radiation minimum and maximum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed at 2m above ground level were obtained from an automatic record weather station situated at the site these data were used to calculate et p and crop development stage missing daily rainfall data were obtained from the national climate data center weather station at humboldt iowa about 20km east of the site 2 4 4 crop parameters crop parameters for the epic crop module were initially drawn from literature cabelguenne et al 1999 whereas converting energy to biomass be maximum leaf area index laimax harvested index hi and maximum root depth r max were calibrated by a trial and error method to match simulated crop dm and yield with measured values the calibrated crop parameters are shown in table 3 2 5 model evaluation statistics four statistical indices were used to evaluate model

the i th measured value and si is the i th simulated value the rmse represents the mean difference between observed and predicted values whereas the nrmse shows the relative magnitude of the mean difference as a percentage of the measured mean willmott 1982 a number of studies describe nrmse 15 as good agreement 15 30 as moderate agreement and 30 as poor agreement li et al 2015a the index of agreement 0 ia 1 is intended to be a descriptive measure the closer the value of ia is to 1 the better is the model performance yang et al 2014 suggested that for soil moisture and mineral n drainage losses a value of ia 0 75 represents an accurate simulation for crop dry matter and yield simulation liu et al 2011 suggested that ia 0 9 indicates excellent agreement while 0 8 ia 0 9 represents a good agreement between measured and predicted values the nse ranges from to 1 this value is close to 1 which is better model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water storage soil water storage in the 0 0 60m soil profile for t1 and t2 treatments from 2006 to 2009 is illustrated in fig 2 in both t1 and t2 rotations a good agreement existed between simulated and measured sws in the 0 0 60m depth soil profile during the calibration phase fig 2 as indicated by statistical indices 14 2mm rmse 17 3mm 7 6 nrmse 8 8 and 0 60 ia 0 80 table 4 similarly a good agreement existed for the validation phase 11 6mm rmse 18 3mm 5 8 nrmse 9 0 and 0 56 ia 0 86 fig 2 table 4 however the nse values were negative in most of years and ranged from 0 98 to 0 32 which are unsatisfactory for simulating sws using the same dataset qi et al 2011 also found that the nse values for rzwqm dssat that simulated sws were negative and ranged from 0 79 to 0 04 therefore the simulation of sws under subsurface drainage condition is needed to improve further for both whcns and rzwqm dssat models 3 2 crop growth and n uptake with the exception of corn dm in 2008 fig 3 g simulated and measured aboveground dm for soybean and corn agreed well fig 3 across all treatments deviations were within an acceptable range for both the calibration phase 289kgha 1 rmse 3134kgha 1 6 5 nrmse 28 4 0 94 ia 0

excellent agreement between modeled and observed yields with a value of r2 rmse nrmse ia and nse of 0 98 379 4kgha 1 6 9 0 99 and 0 98 respectively the indices of r2 rmse nrmse ia and nse of crop n uptake simulation were 0 751 23 6kgnha 1 12 5 0 87 and 0 87 respectively table 5 which showed a good agreement qi et al 2011 adopted rzwqm dssat model to simulated corn and soybean growth using the same dataset the results showed that the average nrmse value of total aboveground matter was 18 the values of nrmse of corn and soybean crop yield ranged from 10 to 21 the values of nrmse of crop n uptake ranged from 13 to 24 compared with the results simulated by the rzwqm dssat model the prediction accuracies of crop yield and crop n uptake by the new model were apparently improved therefore the integrated whcns model was capable of accurately simulating crop growth under subsurface drained conditions 3 3 subsurface drainage the daily drainage measurements were initiated on april 12 2006 but few drainage events occurred in 2006 thus only measured and simulated daily drainages for 2007 2008 and 2009 were used to evaluate the performance of the whcns model in simulating daily drainage the subsurface drainage data in 2007 were used for calibration and other two year data for validation for both crops and rotations given the exception of a single measured drainage peak missed by the simulation april 24 30 may 2009 figs 4 c and 4f simulated daily drainage values generally showed a fairly good match with measured drainage peaks fig 4 the ia r2 indices for the two phases of calibration and validation were 0 82 0 515 and 0 71 0 339 respectively annual rainfall in 2009 684 4mm was significantly less than in 2007 1049 8mm and 2008 926 3mm simulated results showed that given dry soil conditions the 40mm of rainfall received between april 24 and 30 2009 supplemented the soil water storage this discrepancy between simulated and measured drainages may also be attributable to the whcns model that ignored microclimate condition soil spatial variability and preferential flow strong correlations between measured and simulated drainages were found on a monthly r 2 0 84 and annual r 2 0 99 bases table 5 the accuracy of monthly drainage simulations was satisfactory rmse 31 7mm nrmse 37 9 ia 0 95 and nse 0 78 as those of annual drainage simulations rmse 18 4mm nrmse 5 8 ia 0 99 and nse 0 96 the relatively high nrmse for monthly drainage was mainly due to the drainage peak before june in 2009 that was missed by the model figs 4c and 4f excluding the missed drainage peak in 2009 the nrmse reduced to 22 3 this finding indicated that the model s subsurface drainage component of the model performed well in modelling daily monthly and annual subsurface drainages and the performance become better with the increase of time scale from daily to annual 3 4 nitrogen losses the coefficients of determination r2 for the linear relationship between simulated and measured monthly and annual n losses from subsurface drainage were 0 74 and 0 96 respectively along with an ia 0 90 and nse 0 85 table 5 respectively this result indicated a fairly good correspondence between simulated and measured values the nrmse value for the monthly simulation was relative high 63 0 because the drainage peak before june in 2009 was not captured by the model but for the value for the annual simulation was only 12 1 the simulated monthly and annual flow weighted n concentrations also showed a significant correlation with measured values and their values of r2 were 0 54 and 0 57 respectively the ranges of ia and nse for monthly and annual flow weighted n concentration simulations were 0 85 0 87 and 0 43 0 49 respectively this finding represents a satisfactory simulation however the nrmse value was 93 8 for monthly flow weighted n concentration simulation given that n transformations in the soil represent a very complex process several studies have shown a high nrmse values for this parameter yang et al 2007 dadfar et al 2007 the nse values of the simulated monthly drainage and n losses by drainmod dssat were 0 83 and 0 70 which reported by negm et al 2014 respectively using the drainmod n model to simulate n losses from subsurface drainage yang et al 2007 found the nrmse values ranging from 6 91 to 106 2 thus the simulation accuracy of monthly drainage and n losses can be considered as acceptable in the present case table 4 3 5 nitrogen balance simulations the proper quantification of n transformation processes is the basis of modelling n losses thorp et al 2007 qi et al 2011 negm et al 2014 negm et al 2014 table 6 summarized the simulated n balance for soybean and corn by the coupled model fertilizer n application n fixation by soybean and net mineralization are the three major components of n inputs for soybean corn cropping system the simulated annual n fixation anf by soybean ranged from 194 8 to 228 6kgnha 1 with the mean value of 209 5kgnha 1 in the four year simulation table 6 compared with anf the amount of annual net mineralization anm is smaller and varied from 71 2 to 119 2kgnha 1 table 6 negm et al 2014 adopted the drainmod dssat model to simulate n balance under different n application rates for soybean corn cropping system and reported that the ranges of anf and anm were 247 272kgnha 1 and 101 8 111 6kgnha 1 respectively the average value of anm simulated by rzwqm dssat for soybean corn cropping system was 131 4kgnha 1 as reported by thorp et al 2007 in this study the simulated anf and anm are within the ranges simulated by other models and are considered as acceptable for n consumptions crop n uptake and n leaching were validated using the measured values in section 3 2 and section 3 4 respectively in addition runoff can be ignored therefore only the amount of denitrification volatilization and n loss through seepage remained unclear previous simulations by rzwqm dssat in the study area showed that the amount of denitrification and volatilization was small and had a close relationship with n application rates thorp et al 2007 qi et al 2011 only n fertilizer applied for corn in this study led to larger ammonia volatilization for corn 11 2kgnha 1 compared with that of soybean 2 9kgnha 1 table 6 the simulated average amounts of denitrification and volatilization were 13 3 and 7 1kgnha 1 respectively this finding is similar to the results simulated by rzwqm dssat the n loss through seepage was not simulated in the study of qi et al 2011 however the results showed the relatively low values 3 1kgnha 1 in the literature of negm et al 2014 which were close to that in our study overall the simulated n balance by the newly developed model coincided with those of the previous studies and was considered reasonable soil n balance nbal represents the difference between soil n income and output table 6 the values of nbal were positive in soybean season and ranged from 108 6to 166 2kgnha 1 which indicated that soybean improved soil n supply by n fixation while the values of nbal were negative in corn season and ranged from 76 9kgnha 1 to 6 7kgnha 1 indicating that soil n consumption was bigger than n income in corn season in general the soil n was accumulated in the whole soybean corn rotation which suggested that there exists a great potential to optimize the n management practices in the study area 3 6 long term hydrological validation the subsurface drainage component model underestimated annual subsurface drainages in 1992 1996 and 2002 fig 5 the differences in rainfall distribution pattern were the main reason for example nearly 54 5 of the annual rainfall concentrated in the crop growing season in 1992 with compared to 37 8 in 1990 although the total amounts of rainfall in 1990 88 2cm and 1992 82 6cm were not significantly different similar rainfall pattern was also found in 1996 and 2002 therefore in 1992 1996 and 2002 more rainfall replenished the soil water budget during the period of crop growth due to root water uptake which was the reason for the lower simulated subsurface drainage in those two years in general the simulated values from 1989 to 2004 compared well with measured values fig 5 in terms of overall accuracy values for r 2 rmse nrmse ia and nse were 0 92 59mm 23 4 0 97 and 0 9 respectively this finding showed that the long term water drainage simulation had an acceptable accuracy table 5 as the experimental site was located in a rain fed agricultural region rainfall was the main factor leading to drainage thus estimated subsurface drainage had a close relationship with annual rainfall fig 5 annual measured rainfall and simulated subsurface drainage ranged between 506 and 966mm and 0 560mm respectively the minimum and maximum annual rainfall occurred in 1989 506mm and 1993 966mm respectively this finding corresponds to the years of minimum and maximum simulated subsurface drainages 0 and 560mm respectively this result also indicated that subsurface drainage was reasonably simulated under different rainfall conditions furthermore fig 5 illustrates that the simulated evapotranspiration eta was closely tied to rainfall i e the greater the rainfall is the greater is the eta the values of the simulated eta ranged from 372mm to 535mm using the same dataset to validate the capability of the rzwqm dssat model for long term hydrological simulation qi et al 2012 found that eta ranged from 426mm to 558mm similarly ma et al 2007 studied simulating the long term 26 years water balance for a soybean corn cropping system in northeast iowa and found a mean simulated eta of 546mm so the eta simulated in this study was within a reasonable range altogether overall the newly developed whcns model showed the capability to accurately simulate a long term water balance subsurface water drainage and eta making it a useful tool in evaluating the long term effects of a subsurface drainage system on water balance 3 7 optimizing n fertilization rate the relationship between simulated corn yield and n application rate from 2006 to 2009 fig 6 showed that the average annual corn yield over four years increased quickly with an increase in n application rate which reached a plateau at an n application rate of 100kgnha 1 above this amount increasing the amount of n fertilizer has no significant effect on crop yield corn yield was also affected by the weather condition and the sequence of corn yield from highest to lowest was 2008 2006 2009 and 2007 the lowest corn yield occurred in 2007 due to the early mature of corn the harvesting date in 2007 was about 20days earlier than those of the other three years the four year mean corn yield at n application rates of 100 and 240kgnha 1 were 8252 and 8598kgha 1 respectively the n losses from subsurface drainage were affected by n application rates the average quantity and concentration of nitrate losses from drainage were 24 1kgnha 1 and 8 6mgnl 1at an n application rate of 60kgha 1 fig 6b and c respectively above this application rate increasing the n application rate significantly increased the quantity of n losses to the deeper soil layers and being discharged through tile drains a great variation of nitrate losses occurred within those four years with the amount of nitrate losses in the order of 2007 2008 2009 2006 rainfall and root n uptake played important roles in impacting the nitrate losses and the largest nitrate losses occurred in 2007 with the highest rainfall and the lowest root n uptake the average nitrate concentration of drainage water was close to the who s drinking water standard of 10mgl 1 at an n application rate of 120kgnha 1 fig 6c the subsurface water drainage discharged into the mississippi river affects downstream water quality which taints a major source of drinking water for metropolitan residents based on modelling results n application rates from 100 to 120kgnha 1 are recommended to achieve high corn yield with relatively low nitrate n discharge in iowa malone et al 2007b used rzwqm model to quantify the effects of n application rate on subsurface drainage and corn yield in northeast iowa and founded that 100kgnha 1 was the critical n application to maintain corn yield and reduce the n losses from drains furthermore the n losses from drains increased as the quadratic function of n application when the n application rate increased from 100 to 200kgnha 1 our result was similar with this result meanwhile the optimal n application rate for iowa s large rain fed agriculture was relatively lower than those in the regions of intensive agricultural system with different field management practices and soils for example zhang et al 2015 found that the optimal n application rate for maize on the north china plain ranged from 150 to 240kgnha 1 this reduced nitrate losses below 18 4kgnha 1 while maintaining a yield of 9410kgha 1 furthermore fang et al 2008 recommended an optimal n application rate of 200kgnha 1 for a double cropping system which could reduce n leaching by about 60 without reducing crop yield compared with that of farming practice however the optimal n application was larger compared with those of studies conducted in northwest china where the large amount of mineral n accumulated in the soil profile hu et al 2010 reported that the n application of 75kgnha 1 sufficed the crop n requirement under high n cumulative soil studied in the same area liang et al 2016b also found that the n application rate had no significance on crop yield but increased soil nitrate leaching these findings indicated that n application rate should be optimized to eliminate environmental impacts and maximize the crop production based on the survey of soil fertility especially for exploring the regional n management using whcns model in the future however some limitations were encountered in this study for example several studies found that n application rate had an effect on n loss by ammonia volatilization and denitrification zhang et al 2004 the present study did not address this impact because of lack of measured data the timing of n application was fixed in this study therefore combing the timing of the n application with n application rate might be a way to further optimize n management in the future 4 conclusions the newly developed whcns model performed well in simulating soil water storage crop dm yield crop n uptake subsurface drainage and n losses under tile drained condition the mean nrmse for soil water storage crop dm yield and crop n uptake were 8 0 18 9 6 9 and 12 5 respectively the values of nrmse for the modelling of the annual and monthly subsurface drainages were 5 8 and 37 9 respectively while for n losses from subsurface drainage were 63 0 and 12 1 for 16 year long term annual drainage simulation validation phase the simulated values agreed well with measured values in most years with the overall values of 0 92 59mm 23 4 0 97 and 0 90 for r 2 rmse nrmse ia and nse respectively all these findings indicated that the integrated model demonstrated the potential to simulate water balance n losses and crop growth for subsurface drained crop production systems based on scenario analysis for iowa the optimal n application rate ranged from 100 to 120kgnha 1 this state could reduce nitrate concentration in drainage water to below the drinking water criterion of 10mgnl 1 and maintain corn yield over 8200kgha 1 in further applications the whcns model can serve as a tool to evaluate the short and long term effects of subsurface drainage on the water balance n loss and crop growth in different crop production systems acknowledgements the study was funded by the national key research

11622,for the simulation of soil water movement nitrogen n dynamics and crop growth under tile drainage current interdisciplinary models or modules were integrated into an established model through a typical technique for solving specific soil crop modeling issues a drainmod based drainage component was developed for the soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns model the newly developed model was validated using two field experiment datasets from iowa i four year data of daily monthly annual subsurface drain flow and n losses and seasonal crop growth data and ii 16year data of subsurface drain flow for the drainage enhanced whcns model the mean n 4 calibration validation corn soybean normalized root mean square errors nrmse for soil water storage crop dry matter yield and crop n uptake simulation were 8 0 18 9 6 9 and 12 5 respectively the nrmse values for annual subsurface drainage and n losses totals were 5 8 and 37 9 respectively meanwhile the monthly subsurface drainage was 12 1 and the n losses was 63 0 for the 16 year drainage plots the annual subsurface drainage simulated during the validation phase closely matched measured values in most years coefficient of determination r 2 0 92 rmse 59mm nrmse 23 4 index of agreement ia 0 97 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 9 thus indicating that the integrated model can be used to simulate water balance n losses and crop growth in a subsurface drained crop production system based on scenario analyses an optimal n application rate ranging from 100 to 120kgnha 1 was recommended to reduce subsurface drainage water nitrate concentrations within the federal drinking water standard 10mgl 1 while maintaining corn yield the newly developed model showed a great potential to evaluate the short long term effects of subsurface drainage system operations on water balance n losses and crop growth keyword subsurface drainage nitrogen losses optimal n application rate drainmod whcns 1 introduction artificially drained cropland accounting for nearly 17 of the total cultivated areas in the world is vital to sustaining global crop production particularly given its role in reducing the incidence of waterlogging and saline alkali soils valipour 2014 two types of agricultural drainage systems include open surface ditches and subsurface tile drains the latter of which are widely implemented in several agricultural production systems in developed countries because they can control water logging and salinization while maintaining crop yields skaggs 1978 while agricultural subsurface drainage systems contribute to reducing the incidence of waterlogging and saline alkali soil problems and maintaining crop production their improper design and management can lead to the following environmental issues i accelerated losses of field water nitrogen n and other nutrients and ii altered hydrology and water quality of downstream water courses leading to eutrophication salinization and other issues smedema 2000 rabalais et al 2001 approximately 9 3mha of land in iowa is dedicated to row crop production of which nearly 40 is subsurface drained baker et al 2004 contributing over 0 2 gg n y 1 about 26kgnha 1 to the mississippi river basin schilling and libra 2000 the recurrent occurrence of hypoxic areas in the gulf of mexico where eutrophication arises from excessive algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water is often attributed to the subsurface drainage water bearing high loads of nitrate n discharged into the mississippi river rabalais et al 2001 usepa 2007 libra 1998 estimated that 25 of the nitrate in the gulf of mexico originated from the mississippi river originates in iowa although iowa occupies less than 5 of the mississippi s drainage basin excessive agricultural n inputs and inappropriate water management practices are suspected to be major reasons for the water quality degradation due to intensive crop production in iowa and elsewhere usepa 2007 thus optimizing n management and reducing environmental pollution risks are necessary agricultural system models present marked advantages in the quantitative evaluation of the effects of soil climate and field practices on crop yield and their environmental costs holzworth et al 2015 over the past few decades many process based models have been developed to simulate the processes of soil plant atmosphere continuum each being focused on specifying the aspects of driving factors environment conditions and key processes in agricultural production for example century metherell et al 1993 rothc coleman and jenkinson 1996 and dndc li et al 1992 were typically developed for simulating carbon c and n cycles and greenhouse gas emission where daisy hansen et al 1990 rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 dssat jones et al 2003 and apsim keating et al 2003 were developed for crop growth and associated water and n management practices however all these models were initially developed for nondrained agricultural systems few models can be used to design drainage systems and water and n management practices under drainage system for example drainmod has been successfully tested and applied to hydrological simulations under subsurface drainage conditions skaggs 1978 davis et al 2000 singh et al 2006 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2006 successfully employed drainmod to optimize the design of subsurface drainage system in pocahontas iowa usa and suggested that the drain depth of 1 05m and drain spacing of 25m are the best combination at the study area for maximum crop production while minimizing subsurface drainage and its associated nitrate leaching luo et al 2010 applied drainmod nii model to simulate the long term effect of drain spacing on subsurface drainage n losses from drains and corn yield in northern corn belt reported that the annual subsurface and n losses from drains can be reduced by 20 30 without significantly decreasing corn yield through optimizing drain spacing design agricultural drainage and pesticide transport adapt model was also widely used to analyze the impacts of the design of subsurface drainage system on subsurface drainage and nitrate leaching gowda et al 2012 using this model davis et al 2000 analyzed the effect of subsurface drainage system design and n application on n losses from drains in upper midwestern usa and found that the rate of n loss was higher at decreased n application rates than at increased in drain spacing or decreased in drain depth drainmod and adapt lack mechanistic crop growth model and are thus unable to simulate the detailed crop growth and development to solve this problem negm et al 2014 fully integrated drainmod drainmod nii and dssat into a new drainmod dssat model the newly developed model successfully used in evaluating the effects of controlled drainage on water balance water quality and crop yield in a corn soybean cropping system in central iowa negm et al 2017 however in the drainmod drainmod nii and drainmod dssat models a water balance method is used to simulate soil water movement and thus the water flow interaction between the unsaturated and saturated layers of soil especially for the upward water flow from saturated layer is disregarded meanwhile some agricultural system models including rzwqm dssat apsim and daisy had been integrated in the subsurface drainage components in the recent studies saseendran et al 2007 malone et al 2007a mollerup et al 2014 however in these models the subsurface drainage module used in these models was not based on drainmod and the drainage flow was calculated by a steady state hooghoudt equation singh and kanwar 1995 pointed out that the method generally underestimates the magnitudes of peak drainage flows and overestimates total drainage flows this phenomenon was also observed by qi et al 2011 recently liang et al 2016a developed a process based water and n management model whcns this model can simulate water c and n dynamics and plant growth under various agricultural management practices the model is adopted to simulate soil water movement soil n transport and crop growth successfully in north china li et al 2015b liang et al 2016b however lack of a hydrological module of whcns prevents it from simulating subsurface drainage and its potential effects on crop growth and n losses in the present study a drainmod based subsurface drainage module was developed to enable the whcns model to simulate soil water movement c and n cycles and crop growth under tile drained conditions this new modelling tool will further expand the whcns to analyze the effect of various agricultural practices on crop production and environment in drained cropland thus in the present study we aim to i develop a subsurface drainage component for the whcns model by coupling it with the drainmod model ii test the capability of the coupled model to simulate subsurface drainage and n losses under short and long term subsurface drainage conditions and iii optimize n application rates for subsurface drained corn field to reduce the risk of downstream water eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development 2 1 1 whcns model the whcns model is an integrated soil crop system model consisting of the following modules soil water soil heat transfer n transport soil organic carbon turnover and crop growth modules whcns uses the grass based penman monteith method to estimate potential evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 water infiltration from rainfall or irrigation is computed by a modified green ampt approach hachum and alfaro 1980 water redistribution is simulated by the richards equation moreover soil evaporation and plant uptake are considered as upper boundary condition and sink in the richards equation respectively and runoff is calculated using the scs curve approach designed by the u s natural resource conservation service nrcs 2004 the soil heat transfer simulation follows the approach used in the hydrus 1d model by convection dispersion equation simunek et al 1998 soil c and n cycling concepts are drawn from the daisy model hansen et al 1990 the organic matter in soil is divided into three main pools namely added organic matter aom soil microbial biomass smb and dead native soil organic matter som each of which is divided into two subpools one subpool has a slow turnover rate e g aom1 smb1 and som1 whereas the other with a fast turnover rate e g aom2 smb2 and som2 the c flows between different pools were calculated by the first order kinetic equation and corresponding n flows were computed through the c n ratios of the pools which are assumed to be constant over time soil n transport was described by convection dispersion equation n transformations are considered as source sinks term in this equation including the processes of soil n mineralization n fixation urea hydrolysis ammonia volatilization nitrification and denitrification soil nitrification and n fixation were assumed to follow the michaelis menten kinetics urea hydrolysis ammonia volatilization and denitrification are described by the first order kinetic equation the impacts of environmental factors such as soil temperature soil moisture soil ph and soil clay content on c and n transformation rates were all considered in whcns liang et al 2016a the crop growth module is a simplification of the epic crop model williams et al 1989 which applies the concepts of phenological crop development based on daily accumulated heat units harvest index for partitioning grain yield monteith s approach for potential biomass monteith and moss 1977 and stress adjustments for water temperature and n availability in the root zone of the soil profile the water stress factor was derived by dividing the actual transpiration by the potential transpiration the n stress was calculated based on the simulation of the crop n demand actual soil n supply and crop n uptake the model ran on a daily time step and was driven by the variables of meteorological and crop biological data the model inputs included site latitude and elevation basic soil properties field management initial conditions and daily meteorological data a detailed model description is available in the literature liang et al 2016a 2 1 2 subsurface drainage component the subsurface drainage module of whcns was based on drainmod skaggs 1978 for a given water table depth hooghoudt s steady state equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 was selected to calculate drainage rate q mmh 1 1 q 8

effective lateral hydraulic conductivity mmh 1 m is the midpoint water table height above the drain mm q is the subsurface drainage flux mmh 1 r is the effective radius of the drainage pipe mm c is the empirical constant with a default setting of 1 0 and l is the distance between drains mm for ponded water at the soil surface the drainage flux can be quantified as kirkham 1957 3 q 4 π k s a t l

the maximum capacity of the drain pipe qc thus when the calculated value of q exceeds qc the variable q is given a value of qc the subsurface drainage module then estimates the seepage flux qs mm h 1 according to darcy s law 5 q s k r h 1 d r h r d r where dr is the thickness of the restrictive layer mm h1 is the water elevation above the restrictive layer mm hr is the hydraulic head in the

equation 6 α δ ω q d q s q where α is the aquifer specific yield and set to 0 2 in this study based on the literature of gehman et al 2009 qd is the water drainage flux at the bottom of unsaturated soil layer calculated by the whcns model mmh 1 and δw is the change of water table mmh 1 the value of qd was calculated using the darcy s law and used as bottom boundary conditions for the unsaturated richards equation nitrogen ammonia and nitrate transport through the soil profile was simulated using a convection dispersion equation with n losses from subsurface drain water serving as a second boundary condition cauchy type for the transport equation 2 1 3 framework of integrated model fig 1 shows the conceptual framework of the drainmod inspired subsurface drainage module how it is linked to the whcns model and how the integrated model gains the processes of subsurface drainage flux seepage and n leaching estimation which enables the simulation of water movement c and n dynamics and crop growth under tile drained conditions 2 2 field experiment and data collection the field study was conducted at the agricultural drainage water quality research and demonstration site adwq rds formerly the agricultural drainage well site near gilmore city pocahontas county north central iowa 43 0 n 92 5 w in the area the predominant soils are nicollet fine loamy mixed superactive and mesic aquic hapludoll webster fine loamy mixed superactive calcareous and mesic typic endoaquolls canisteo fine loamy mixed superactive calcareous and mesic typic endoaquolls and okoboji fine senectitic and mesic cumulic vertic endoaquolls usda 1985 the basic soil physical properties are shown in table 1 the site had a total of 78 identically laid out individually drained plots each of which was 38m in length and 15 2m in width plots were established after the installation of a corrugated plastic drain pipe through the center and along both boundaries parallel to the long dimension 7 6m spacing at a depth of 1 06m the two border drains which were installed to help prevent lateral flow between adjacent plots have outlets to the surface at a remote location the design of this drainage site and the layout of the plots were described in detail by lawlor et al 2008 initiated in the fall of 2004 a five year field experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design where 78 plots were assigned to blocks according to their long term drainage performance the following treatments were used in this study t1 corn in odd years and soybean in even years and t2 soybean in odd years and corn in even years starting in april 2006 weekly soil moisture content daily subsurface drainage flow volume and monthly nitrate n concentration in drainage flow were measured for all t1 and t2 treatment plots for each plot weekly measurements of gravimetric soil water content were made from disturbed soil samples collected from depths of 0 0 15m 0 15 0 30m and 0 30 0 60m with a jmc soil sampler clements associates inc newton ia usa observed soil volumetric moisture content was then obtained by multiplying the gravimetric moisture content by soil bulk density soil water storage sws was calculated by multiplying the depth with soil volumetric water content the aboveground biomass of corn and soybean were sampled at three week intervals during the growing seasons from 2006 to 2009 samples were dried at 60 c for a week and weighed total n content was analyzed using the combustion method to determine crop yield twelve of twenty rows of corn or soybean in each plot were harvested with a combine total grain yield was measured by weight and subsamples were taken to determine moisture details on measurements can be found elsewhere qi et al 2011 to validate the whcns model for long term hydrological simulation a distinct 16 year long term subsurface drainage dataset was employed the experiment was conducted at the same experiment site from 1989 to 2004 the subsurface drainage was observed from 1989 to 2004 in this site the detailed experimental design can be found in lawlor et al 2008 and qi et al 2012 2 3 optimizing n application rates nitrogen application rates had a significant effect on crop yield and n losses from drains davis et al 2000 saseendran et al 2007 negm et al 2014 to explore the relationship between n losses from subsurface drainage and n application rates for corn optimizing n fertilizer application to match crop requirements is crucial in this study the newly developed whcns model was used to optimize n application rates based on the results from 2006 to 2009 in the field experiments the timing of n application was fixed but the total n fertilizer inputs ranged from 0 to 240kgnha 1 in the increments of 20kgnha 1 i e 13 different n application rates resulting in 52 scenarios 13n application rates 4years 2 4 model input and calibration field data from the t1 and t2 treatments in 2006 and 2007 calibration phase were used to calibrate the model calibration was performed using a trial and error approach to adjust the n transformation parameters ksat l and crop parameters to achieve the best possible agreement between simulated and measured sws subsurface water drainage n losses from subsurface drainage crop dry matter dm and yield after calibration field data from the t1 and t2 treatments in 2008 and 2009 validation phase were used to validate the model the detailed input parameters include soil hydraulic parameters soil c and n transformation parameters and crop parameters 2 4 1 soil hydraulic parameters soil water retention θ h and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h functions were used in the van genuchten 1987 and mualem 1976 models respectively initial parameters in the functions are derived from measured data qi et al 2011 and then calibrated to achieve the closest possible match between simulated and measured soil moisture contents saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity ksat l a key parameter in predicting subsurface drainage flux in hooghout s and kirkham s equations was similarly adjusted to achieve the best match between the simulated and measured daily drainage fluxes inputs for bulk density particle size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat were obtained directly from the measurements table 1 2 4 2 soil carbon and nitrogen transformation parameters in the whcns model the scope of microbial activity in the soil on the basis of which simulations of soil n transformation processes mineralization immobilization nitrification and denitrification are made can be set according to soil depth in the present study the scope of soil microbial activity was set from 0 to 0 50m soil depth the initial parameters of n transformation were adopted from the default values of the daisy model hansen et al 1990 and then calibrated according to measured n loss data thorp et al 2007 simulated the effect of n application rate on n balances using rzwqm dssat in iowa and found that n gas emission was low in this area in this study the denitrification and volatilization parameters were set to low values to match with those of thorp et al 2007 the calibrated n transformation parameters are listed in table 2 as the long term dynamic simulation of som was not the main goal of this study parameters for som decomposition and decay rate were all drawn from previous studies as shown in table 2 hansen et al 1990 mueller et al 1998 similarly the initial c n ratio of residues and the distribution coefficient of the som pools were drawn from the literature jensen et al 2005 2 4 3 meteorological data meteorological data including daily precipitation solar radiation minimum and maximum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed at 2m above ground level were obtained from an automatic record weather station situated at the site these data were used to calculate et p and crop development stage missing daily rainfall data were obtained from the national climate data center weather station at humboldt iowa about 20km east of the site 2 4 4 crop parameters crop parameters for the epic crop module were initially drawn from literature cabelguenne et al 1999 whereas converting energy to biomass be maximum leaf area index laimax harvested index hi and maximum root depth r max were calibrated by a trial and error method to match simulated crop dm and yield with measured values the calibrated crop parameters are shown in table 3 2 5 model evaluation statistics four statistical indices were used to evaluate model performance root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse index of agreement ia willmott 1982 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 7 r m s e i 1 n m i s i 2 n 8 n r m s e 100

the i th measured value and si is the i th simulated value the rmse represents the mean difference between observed and predicted values whereas the nrmse shows the relative magnitude of the mean difference as a percentage of the measured mean willmott 1982 a number of studies describe nrmse 15 as good agreement 15 30 as moderate agreement and 30 as poor agreement li et al 2015a the index of agreement 0 ia 1 is intended to be a descriptive measure the closer the value of ia is to 1 the better is the model performance yang et al 2014 suggested that for soil moisture and mineral n drainage losses a value of ia 0 75 represents an accurate simulation for crop dry matter and yield simulation liu et al 2011 suggested that ia 0 9 indicates excellent agreement while 0 8 ia 0 9 represents a good agreement between measured and predicted values the nse ranges from to 1 this value is close to 1 which is better model performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water storage soil water storage in the 0 0 60m soil profile for t1 and t2 treatments from 2006 to 2009 is illustrated in fig 2 in both t1 and t2 rotations a good agreement existed between simulated and measured sws in the 0 0 60m depth soil profile during the calibration phase fig 2 as indicated by statistical indices 14 2mm rmse 17 3mm 7 6 nrmse 8 8 and 0 60 ia 0 80 table 4 similarly a good agreement existed for the validation phase 11 6mm rmse 18 3mm 5 8 nrmse 9 0 and 0 56 ia 0 86 fig 2 table 4 however the nse values were negative in most of years and ranged from 0 98 to 0 32 which are unsatisfactory for simulating sws using the same dataset qi et al 2011 also found that the nse values for rzwqm dssat that simulated sws were negative and ranged from 0 79 to 0 04 therefore the simulation of sws under subsurface drainage condition is needed to improve further for both whcns and rzwqm dssat models 3 2 crop growth and n uptake with the exception of corn dm in 2008 fig 3 g simulated and measured aboveground dm for soybean and corn agreed well fig 3 across all treatments deviations were within an acceptable range for both the calibration phase 289kgha 1 rmse 3134kgha 1 6 5 nrmse 28 4 0 94 ia 0 99 and 0 82 nse 0 98 and validation phase 559kgha 1 rmse 2151kgha 1 16 9 nrmse 25 9 ia 0 97 and nse 0 84 table 4 the linear correlation between simulated and measured crop yields table 5 showed an excellent agreement between modeled and observed yields with a value of r2 rmse nrmse ia and nse of 0 98 379 4kgha 1 6 9 0 99 and 0 98 respectively the indices of r2 rmse nrmse ia and nse of crop n uptake simulation were 0 751 23 6kgnha 1 12 5 0 87 and 0 87 respectively table 5 which showed a good agreement qi et al 2011 adopted rzwqm dssat model to simulated corn and soybean growth using the same dataset the results showed that the average nrmse value of total aboveground matter was 18 the values of nrmse of corn and soybean crop yield ranged from 10 to 21 the values of nrmse of crop n uptake ranged from 13 to 24 compared with the results simulated by the rzwqm dssat model the prediction accuracies of crop yield and crop n uptake by the new model were apparently improved therefore the integrated whcns model was capable of accurately simulating crop growth under subsurface drained conditions 3 3 subsurface drainage the daily drainage measurements were initiated on april 12 2006 but few drainage events occurred in 2006 thus only measured and simulated daily drainages for 2007 2008 and 2009 were used to evaluate the performance of the whcns model in simulating daily drainage the subsurface drainage data in 2007 were used for calibration and other two year data for validation for both crops and rotations given the exception of a single measured drainage peak missed by the simulation april 24 30 may 2009 figs 4 c and 4f simulated daily drainage values generally showed a fairly good match with measured drainage peaks fig 4 the ia r2 indices for the two phases of calibration and validation were 0 82 0 515 and 0 71 0 339 respectively annual rainfall in 2009 684 4mm was significantly less than in 2007 1049 8mm and 2008 926 3mm simulated results showed that given dry soil conditions the 40mm of rainfall received between april 24 and 30 2009 supplemented the soil water storage this discrepancy between simulated and measured drainages may also be attributable to the whcns model that ignored microclimate condition soil spatial variability and preferential flow strong correlations between measured and simulated drainages were found on a monthly r 2 0 84 and annual r 2 0 99 bases table 5 the accuracy of monthly drainage simulations was satisfactory rmse 31 7mm nrmse 37 9 ia 0 95 and nse 0 78 as those of annual drainage simulations rmse 18 4mm nrmse 5 8 ia 0 99 and nse 0 96 the relatively high nrmse for monthly drainage was mainly due to the drainage peak before june in 2009 that was missed by the model figs 4c and 4f excluding the missed drainage peak in 2009 the nrmse reduced to 22 3 this finding indicated that the model s subsurface drainage component of the model performed well in modelling daily monthly and annual subsurface drainages and the performance become better with the increase of time scale from daily to annual 3 4 nitrogen losses the coefficients of determination r2 for the linear relationship between simulated and measured monthly and annual n losses from subsurface drainage were 0 74 and 0 96 respectively along with an ia 0 90 and nse 0 85 table 5 respectively this result indicated a fairly good correspondence between simulated and measured values the nrmse value for the monthly simulation was relative high 63 0 because the drainage peak before june in 2009 was not captured by the model but for the value for the annual simulation was only 12 1 the simulated monthly and annual flow weighted n concentrations also showed a significant correlation with measured values and their values of r2 were 0 54 and 0 57 respectively the ranges of ia and nse for monthly and annual flow weighted n concentration simulations were 0 85 0 87 and 0 43 0 49 respectively this finding represents a satisfactory simulation however the nrmse value was 93 8 for monthly flow weighted n concentration simulation given that n transformations in the soil represent a very complex process several studies have shown a high nrmse values for this parameter yang et al 2007 dadfar et al 2007 the nse values of the simulated monthly drainage and n losses by drainmod dssat were 0 83 and 0 70 which reported by negm et al 2014 respectively using the drainmod n model to simulate n losses from subsurface drainage yang et al 2007 found the nrmse values ranging from 6 91 to 106 2 thus the simulation accuracy of monthly drainage and n losses can be considered as acceptable in the present case table 4 3 5 nitrogen balance simulations the proper quantification of n transformation processes is the basis of modelling n losses thorp et al 2007 qi et al 2011 negm et al 2014 negm et al 2014 table 6 summarized the simulated n balance for soybean and corn by the coupled model fertilizer n application n fixation by soybean and net mineralization are the three major components of n inputs for soybean corn cropping system the simulated annual n fixation anf by soybean ranged from 194 8 to 228 6kgnha 1 with the mean value of 209 5kgnha 1 in the four year simulation table 6 compared with anf the amount of annual net mineralization anm is smaller and varied from 71 2 to 119 2kgnha 1 table 6 negm et al 2014 adopted the drainmod dssat model to simulate n balance under different n application rates for soybean corn cropping system and reported that the ranges of anf and anm were 247 272kgnha 1 and 101 8 111 6kgnha 1 respectively the average value of anm simulated by rzwqm dssat for soybean corn cropping system was 131 4kgnha 1 as reported by thorp et al 2007 in this study the simulated anf and anm are within the ranges simulated by other models and are considered as acceptable for n consumptions crop n uptake and n leaching were validated using the measured values in section 3 2 and section 3 4 respectively in addition runoff can be ignored therefore only the amount of denitrification volatilization and n loss through seepage remained unclear previous simulations by rzwqm dssat in the study area showed that the amount of denitrification and volatilization was small and had a close relationship with n application rates thorp et al 2007 qi et al 2011 only n fertilizer applied for corn in this study led to larger ammonia volatilization for corn 11 2kgnha 1 compared with that of soybean 2 9kgnha 1 table 6 the simulated average amounts of denitrification and volatilization were 13 3 and 7 1kgnha 1 respectively this finding is similar to the results simulated by rzwqm dssat the n loss through seepage was not simulated in the study of qi et al 2011 however the results showed the relatively low values 3 1kgnha 1 in the literature of negm et al 2014 which were close to that in our study overall the simulated n balance by the newly developed model coincided with those of the previous studies and was considered reasonable soil n balance nbal represents the difference between soil n income and output table 6 the values of nbal were positive in soybean season and ranged from 108 6to 166 2kgnha 1 which indicated that soybean improved soil n supply by n fixation while the values of nbal were negative in corn season and ranged from 76 9kgnha 1 to 6 7kgnha 1 indicating that soil n consumption was bigger than n income in corn season in general the soil n was accumulated in the whole soybean corn rotation which suggested that there exists a great potential to optimize the n management practices in the study area 3 6 long term hydrological validation the subsurface drainage component model underestimated annual subsurface drainages in 1992 1996 and 2002 fig 5 the differences in rainfall distribution pattern were the main reason for example nearly 54 5 of the annual rainfall concentrated in the crop growing season in 1992 with compared to 37 8 in 1990 although the total amounts of rainfall in 1990 88 2cm and 1992 82 6cm were not significantly different similar rainfall pattern was also found in 1996 and 2002 therefore in 1992 1996 and 2002 more rainfall replenished the soil water budget during the period of crop growth due to root water uptake which was the reason for the lower simulated subsurface drainage in those two years in general the simulated values from 1989 to 2004 compared well with measured values fig 5 in terms of overall accuracy values for r 2 rmse nrmse ia and nse were 0 92 59mm 23 4 0 97 and 0 9 respectively this finding showed that the long term water drainage simulation had an acceptable accuracy table 5 as the experimental site was located in a rain fed agricultural region rainfall was the main factor leading to drainage thus estimated subsurface drainage had a close relationship with annual rainfall fig 5 annual measured rainfall and simulated subsurface drainage ranged between 506 and 966mm and 0 560mm respectively the minimum and maximum annual rainfall occurred in 1989 506mm and 1993 966mm respectively this finding corresponds to the years of minimum and maximum simulated subsurface drainages 0 and 560mm respectively this result also indicated that subsurface drainage was reasonably simulated under different rainfall conditions furthermore fig 5 illustrates that the simulated evapotranspiration eta was closely tied to rainfall i e the greater the rainfall is the greater is the eta the values of the simulated eta ranged from 372mm to 535mm using the same dataset to validate the capability of the rzwqm dssat model for long term hydrological simulation qi et al 2012 found that eta ranged from 426mm to 558mm similarly ma et al 2007 studied simulating the long term 26 years water balance for a soybean corn cropping system in northeast iowa and found a mean simulated eta of 546mm so the eta simulated in this study was within a reasonable range altogether overall the newly developed whcns model showed the capability to accurately simulate a long term water balance subsurface water drainage and eta making it a useful tool in evaluating the long term effects of a subsurface drainage system on water balance 3 7 optimizing n fertilization rate the relationship between simulated corn yield and n application rate from 2006 to 2009 fig 6 showed that the average annual corn yield over four years increased quickly with an increase in n application rate which reached a plateau at an n application rate of 100kgnha 1 above this amount increasing the amount of n fertilizer has no significant effect on crop yield corn yield was also affected by the weather condition and the sequence of corn yield from highest to lowest was 2008 2006 2009 and 2007 the lowest corn yield occurred in 2007 due to the early mature of corn the harvesting date in 2007 was about 20days earlier than those of the other three years the four year mean corn yield at n application rates of 100 and 240kgnha 1 were 8252 and 8598kgha 1 respectively the n losses from subsurface drainage were affected by n application rates the average quantity and concentration of nitrate losses from drainage were 24 1kgnha 1 and 8 6mgnl 1at an n application rate of 60kgha 1 fig 6b and c respectively above this application rate increasing the n application rate significantly increased the quantity of n losses to the deeper soil layers and being discharged through tile drains a great variation of nitrate losses occurred within those four years with the amount of nitrate losses in the order of 2007 2008 2009 2006 rainfall and root n uptake played important roles in impacting the nitrate losses and the largest nitrate losses occurred in 2007 with the highest rainfall and the lowest root n uptake the average nitrate concentration of drainage water was close to the who s drinking water standard of 10mgl 1 at an n application rate of 120kgnha 1 fig 6c the subsurface water drainage discharged into the mississippi river affects downstream water quality which taints a major source of drinking water for metropolitan residents based on modelling results n application rates from 100 to 120kgnha 1 are recommended to achieve high corn yield with relatively low nitrate n discharge in iowa malone et al 2007b used rzwqm model to quantify the effects of n application rate on subsurface drainage and corn yield in northeast iowa and founded that 100kgnha 1 was the critical n application to maintain corn yield and reduce the n losses from drains furthermore the n losses from drains increased as the quadratic function of n application when the n application rate increased from 100 to 200kgnha 1 our result was similar with this result meanwhile the optimal n application rate for iowa s large rain fed agriculture was relatively lower than those in the regions of intensive agricultural system with different field management practices and soils for example zhang et al 2015 found that the optimal n application rate for maize on the north china plain ranged from 150 to 240kgnha 1 this reduced nitrate losses below 18 4kgnha 1 while maintaining a yield of 9410kgha 1 furthermore fang et al 2008 recommended an optimal n application rate of 200kgnha 1 for a double cropping system which could reduce n leaching by about 60 without reducing crop yield compared with that of farming practice however the optimal n application was larger compared with those of studies conducted in northwest china where the large amount of mineral n accumulated in the soil profile hu et al 2010 reported that the n application of 75kgnha 1 sufficed the crop n requirement under high n cumulative soil studied in the same area liang et al 2016b also found that the n application rate had no significance on crop yield but increased soil nitrate leaching these findings indicated that n application rate should be optimized to eliminate environmental impacts and maximize the crop production based on the survey of soil fertility especially for exploring the regional n management using whcns model in the future however some limitations were encountered in this study for example several studies found that n application rate had an effect on n loss by ammonia volatilization and denitrification zhang et al 2004 the present study did not address this impact because of lack of measured data the timing of n application was fixed in this study therefore combing the timing of the n application with n application rate might be a way to further optimize n management in the future 4 conclusions the newly developed whcns model performed well in simulating soil water storage crop dm yield crop n uptake subsurface drainage and n losses under tile drained condition the mean nrmse for soil water storage crop dm yield and crop n uptake were 8 0 18 9 6 9 and 12 5 respectively the values of nrmse for the modelling of the annual and monthly subsurface drainages were 5 8 and 37 9 respectively while for n losses from subsurface drainage were 63 0 and 12 1 for 16 year long term annual drainage simulation validation phase the simulated values agreed well with measured values in most years with the overall values of 0 92 59mm 23 4 0 97 and 0 90 for r 2 rmse nrmse ia and nse respectively all these findings indicated that the integrated model demonstrated the potential to simulate water balance n losses and crop growth for subsurface drained crop production systems based on scenario analysis for iowa the optimal n application rate ranged from 100 to 120kgnha 1 this state could reduce nitrate concentration in drainage water to below the drinking water criterion of 10mgnl 1 and maintain corn yield over 8200kgha 1 in further applications the whcns model can serve as a tool to evaluate the short and long term effects of subsurface drainage on the water balance n loss and crop growth in different crop production systems acknowledgements the study was funded by the national key research

11623,wind drift and evaporation losses wdel play a significant role in the development of water conservation strategies in sprinkler irrigation in this study artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr models were developed by taking data collected from published studies on predicted wdel for several design operational and meteorological conditions of variables in sprinkler irrigation five combinations of input variables including riser height operating pressure main nozzle diameter auxiliary nozzle diameter da water discharge by main nozzle water discharge by auxiliary nozzles wind speed ws air temperature and relative humidity were used to create prediction models for wdel the ann and mlr models were trained and tested on 70 and 30 of the data points respectively the accuracy of the models was assessed by the coefficients of correlation r overall indices of model performance oi root mean square errors rmse and mean absolute errors mae statistical results showed that the ann and mlr models with all input variables had the best predicting capabilities when comparing the results of different ann and mlr models it was seen that the ann models had more success in predicting wdel the ann models gave higher r 0 843 0 956 and oi 0 794 0 909 values and lower rmse 2 662 4 886 and mae 2 197 3 729 values compared to the mlr models in the training

contribution analysis found that the design parameter da and the climatic parameter ws were considered to obtain the most robust estimation model it can be stated that the ann model is a more suitable

available around the world becomes increasingly scarce especially in arid and semi arid regions however little is known about its performance under field conditions smith et al 2002 the phenomenon of evaporation during sprinkler irrigation including its relationships to other soil plant atmospheric processes has not yet been completely understood de wrachien and lorenzini 2006 although it is important for the optimal design of irrigation and appropriate irrigation scheduling the performance of sprinkler irrigation depends on design and operational factors the most important design factors are the sprinkler type nozzle diameter and sprinkler spacing operational factors include operating pressure p the time of irrigation and meteorological conditions during irrigation especially wind speed ws keller and bliesner 1990 carrión et al 2001 playán et al 2006 a significant percentage of the water discharged by a sprinkler irrigation system does not reach the crop canopy this lost water is referred to as wind drift and evaporation losses wdel and is expressed as a percentage of the gross volume of irrigation water in the literature values of wdel have been reported ranging from 2 50 playán et al 2005 this variability is due to design operational and meteorological conditions at the experimental sites the wdel effect has been reported on in many research papers e g laboratory field tests and analytical studies among the design factors a large nozzle diameter produces large drop diameters which are more resistant to drift and present less area per unit of mass keller and bliesner 1990 therefore they are less affected by wdel increasing nozzle elevation over the soil surface riser height hr has been reported to increase wdel owing to longer drop trajectories and increased wind exposure however in operational factors an increase in p results in a decrease in the resulting drop diameters montero et al 2003 with an increase in wdel ws is a serious limiting meteorological factor disrupting the trajectory of droplets and induces droplet evaporation thereby increasing wdel in sprinkler irrigation faci and bercero 1991 seginer et al 1991 kincaid et al 1996 burt et al 1997 tarjuelo et al 1994 1999 dechmi et al 2003 playán et al 2005 2006 sanchez et al 2010a b zapata et al 2007 an experimental estimation of wdel is costly as well as time consuming but alternatively wdel can be estimated using soft computing techniques such as artificial neural networks anns anns are computational models inspired in the neural structures of intelligent organisms neurons and synapses which acquire knowledge through experience without any assumptions or knowledge about the underlying principles ann is an effective tool for modeling nonlinear processes as it requires few inputs and is able to precisely extract the generalized relationship between input and output data without any understanding of the physical process involved haykin 1999 sudheer et al 2003 the accuracy increases with increasing available data basheer and hajmeer 2000 jain et al 2004 anns have attracted considerable interest recently in a wide number of applications in various engineering fields rainfall runoff hsu et al 1995 fernando and jayawardena 1998 shrestha et al 2005 evapotranspiration kişi 2007 khoob 2008 ozkan et al 2011 yassin et al 2016a b suspended sediments

sprinkler distribution patterns sayyadi et al 2012 soil penetration resistance santos et al 2012 furrow irrigation infiltration mattar et al 2015 and the hydraulic performance of labyrinth channel emitters mattar and alamoud 2015 however the knowledge of ann in modeling wdel in sprinkler irrigation is limited therefore the objectives of study are to 1 explore the applicability of an ann approach for the estimation of wdel with various input combinations 2 develop multiple linear regression mlr models to predict wdel using ann training data 3 compare the predictive capabilities of ann with mlr models using statistical criteria and 4 perform a contribution analysis of the developed ann models to identify important factors affecting wdel 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental database the ann and mlr models were developed using experimental data from four published studies abo ghobar 1993 dechmi et al 2003 sanchez et al 2010b sanchez et al 2011 as presented in table 1 for the different locations under various design operational and meteorological conditions a total of 109 data points were collected in different locations the experiments were conducted using double nozzle sprinklers to determine wdel a more complete description of these experiments is presented below in the first experiment abo ghobar 1993 the wdel from sprinklers was studied under different combinations of climatic and operating conditions the tests were conducted at the educational farm in riyadh saudi arabia during the period april through july 1991 ten types of impact sprinklers with different nozzle sizes that are commonly used for field irrigation were selected the system was operated for one to two hours per run depending on the nozzle size in order to collect a sufficient quantity of water in the catch cans in the second experiment dechmi et al 2003 a solid set sprinkler system was evaluated against maize zea mays l yield the experiment was conducted at the experimental farm in zaragoza spain during the period may through august 2000 the nozzle diameters were 4 4mm main and 2 4mm auxiliary and were located at a height of 2 3m above the soil surface the nozzle operating pressure was kept constant at 300kpa during the season which resulted in a wetted radius of 11m in the third experiment sanchez et al 2010b wdel was assessed from the irrigation depth and collected into pluviometers above maize and alfalfa irrigated with the same sprinkler solid set system and under the same operational and technical conditions the experiment was performed in 2006 at the experimental farm in zaragoza spain the main nozzle included a jet straightening vane and was 4mm in diameter the auxiliary nozzle was 2 4mm in diameter in the fourth experiment sanchez et al 2011 the effects of pressure nozzle diameter and meteorological conditions on the performance of agricultural impact sprinklers were studied this experiment was also conducted at the experimental farm in zaragoza spain during the years 2003 and 2004 the diameter of the main nozzle was 4 4mm the sprinkler also included a spreader nozzle 2 4mm in diameter a wide range of p from 180 to 420kpa was tested all the tests were performed for 2h periods under low wind conditions for each test of the solid set experiment the water collected in catch cans and pluviometers after each irrigation event was recorded and averaged as irrigation depth id c the wdels are computed from the irrigation depth applied by the sprinkler system id d and the average id c i d c christiansen 1942 as follows 1 w d e l i d d i d c i d d 2 i d d q t s s s l where q is the sprinkler discharge rate t is the operating time and s s and s l are the spacing between laterals and between sprinklers along the lateral respectively the results of these experiments concluded that water was lost partially by evaporation but specifically through drift out of the irrigated area as highly variable ws makes reliable design and management of sprinkler irrigation system difficult the higher ws the farther the largest droplets can be transported by the wind while the smallest droplets influence wdel this means that wdel can be reduced by changing the sprinkler operating conditions to increase the sizes of water droplets or by irrigating when climatic conditions are favorable i e relative humidity rh is high and air temperature t and ws are low data sets for the development of the proposed models were prepared and included hr p the main nozzle diameter dm the auxiliary nozzle diameter da the water discharge by main nozzle qm the water discharge by the auxiliary nozzle qa ws t and rh as input variables and wdel as the output variable the combinations of input variables listed in table 2 formed the ann and mlr models five for each that were developed to estimate wdel the meteorological variables of ws t and rh were used as inputs in all of the proposed models the input set of variables for the first input combination ann 1 and mlr 1 included all variables and was developed to determine the effectiveness of each input variables on wdel the following three combinations second fourth were developed to evaluate the ability of the models to estimate wdel without the presence of certain of the design and operational variables the fifth combination ws t and rh represents the ann and mlr models used to investigate the effect of only meteorological variables on wdel table 3 presents the statistical parameters of the inputs and output used for training and testing the developed ann and mlr models where xm xa xn sx kx and csx denote the maximum mean minimum standard deviation kurtosis coefficient and skewness coefficient respectively the maximum values of the design and operational parameters hr p dm da qm and qa were similar for all processes as were the minimum values the maximum values of ws and rh were greater than 7ms 1 and 80 for both the training and testing processes respectively the da for kx and csx was the largest in all of the processes 2 2 artificial neural network an ann has an inherent ability to learn and recognize highly nonlinear and complex relationships by experience swingler 2001 anns contain three layers of neurons an input layer independent variables i a hidden layer j and an output layer dependent variables k to create the best ann structure the number of hidden layers neurons in each hidden layer learning algorithm and activation functions must be selected carefully dogan et al 2008 in this study the ann was trained with a hidden and an output layer using the back propagation learning algorithm back propagation is the most popular algorithm for training feed forward anns thirumalaiah and deo 1998 ciğizoğlu 2003 jain and srinivasulu 2004 fernando and shamseldin 2009 feed forward networks usually have one or more hidden layers which enables the network to model nonlinear and complex functions salehi and razavi 2012 the input layer comprises the original experimental data z o that are associated with the neurons of the input layer before exporting the data to the ann for training the network input and output were automatically normalized between 0 15 and 0 85 this normalization accelerates the training process and improves the network s generalization capabilities the following equation was used for normalization 3 z 0 85 0 15 z o z min z max z min 0 15 where z are normalized input output parameters z max is the maximum value of the input output parameters and z min is the minimum value of the input output parameters after input data are normalized they undergo unidirectional processing from the input layer through the hidden layer to the output layer anns include a parallel network of connecting neurons each neuron information processing unit n in the ann consists of input connection links a central processing unit and output connection links the connections have weights w to store information the connection strength between two neurons of adjacent layers izadifar 2010 that is processed in the central processing unit by adding bias threshold value b according to the following equation haykin 1999 for neurons in the hidden layer the neuron s value n j is 4 n j i 1 n i w 1 j i x i b 1 j where w 1 j i are the weights from the input layer to the hidden layer x i are normalized input parameters n i are the number of input neurons and b 1 j are the biases in the hidden layer then the output layer neuron n k is given by 5 n k j 1 n j w 2 k j h j b 2 k where w 2 k j are the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer n j are the number of output neurons and b 2 k are the biases in the output layer thereafter the activation transfer functions f in the processing unit of the hidden and output neurons were implemented the most common transfer functions in engineering applications include the hyperbolic tangent tanh function dawson and wilby 1998 zanetti et al 2007 tanh transfer functions of neuron activation in the hidden and output layers were considered in this study to train the neural network the general functional form of the tanh transfer function is 6 f x 1 exp 2 x 1 exp 2 x where x is either the value of n j or n k the differences error between the output values and target values were calculated at the end of each forward pass in the forward propagation stage if the error fell above a level considered acceptable weights layer by layer were adjusted back propagation stage if not the training stopped a trial and error procedure was used to find the optimum number of hidden neurons jain et al 2008 the trained ann is then tested on the unseen data set the developed ann can be used for prediction purposes the ann modeling approach is represented schematically in fig 1 in this study ann models were trained and tested by qnet2000 software for predicting wdel the data set was divided randomly into training and testing subsets in total 70 of these data were used for training and 30 for testing the training and testing sets had 76 and 33 data points respectively 2 3 multiple linear regression mlr has been widely used as a fundamental tool for modeling relationships between multiple variables linearly and has been used in several studies guisan et al 2002 the mlr establishes a quantitative relationship between the independent and dependent variables the mlr can be defined as follows 7 y b o i 1 m b i x i where y is the predicted or expected value of the dependent variable b o is the value of y when all of the independent variables are equal to zero x i i 1 m are the distinct independent or predictor variables and b i i 1 m are the estimated regression coefficients in this study the regression tool in microsoft excel was used to develop the mlr model the mlr model was developed with the same experimental data used in the ann model 70 of the data points randomly selected were used to fit the mlr model and the remaining 30 used to test the model alongside the estimated regression coefficients the regression standard error se t statistic t stat and probability of independent variables p values value were examined in order to judge whether the best fitting line does in fact fit the data to an adequate degree in multiple regression the variance inflation factor vif is used as an indicator of the amount of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables and is defined as 8 vif 1 1 r 2 where r 2 is the determination coefficient of the regression of the independent variable taken for a moment as the dependent variable related to the rest of the independent variables the following guidelines were used to interpret vif vif 1 not correlated 1 vif 5 moderately correlated and vif 5 10 highly correlated the vif provides a quick measure of how much a variable is contributing to the standard error in the regression montgomery et al 2001 montgomery and runger 2003 2 4 performance evaluation criteria four statistical criteria namely the coefficient of correlation r the overall index of model performance oi the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were calculated to assess the accuracy of the ann and mlr models they are defined by the following equations 9 r i 1 n e i e p i p i 1 n e i e 2 i 1 n p i p 2 10 o i 1 2 2 r m s e e m e n i 1 n e i p i 2 i 1 n e i e 2 11 r m s e i 1 n e i p i 2 n 12 m a e i 1 n e i p i n where e i is the experimental value p i is the predicted value n is the number of observations e m is the maximum experimental value e n is the minimum experimental value e is the average experimental value and p is the average predicted value r measures the degree of correlation between the experimental and predicted values with values close to 1 0 indicating good model performance oi ranges from to 1 an oi value of 1 denotes a perfect fit between the experimental and predicted values alazba et al 2012 rmse has the advantage of expressing the error in the same units as the variable thus providing more information about the efficiency of the model legates and mccabe 1999 the lower the rmse the more accurate the prediction is mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts without considering their direction mae ranges from 0 to and the lower the values the better willmott and matsuura 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of ann models the optimal architectures of ann models were selected through a trial and error procedure based on the statistical parameters using different input combinations to estimate the wdel as presented in table 4 the ann architectures improved markedly with more hidden neurons for the training process in ann 1 using all input variables the r oi rmse and mae values were initially 0 945 0 909 2 962 and 2 457 respectively with five neurons in the hidden layer increasing the number of hidden neurons from five to six gave a slight improvement in network performance the r and oi values were increased by 1 16 and 1 54 respectively and the rmse and mae values were decreased by 10 13 and 10 58 respectively increasing the number to greater than six led to degradation in the ann performance fig 2 depicts the most appropriate ann 1 architecture 9 6 1 after the training process and also contains a general description of the ann implementation as previously explained four ann models ann 2 through ann 5 with fewer input variables to predict wdel values were also developed table 4 the ann 2 model with three neurons in the hidden layer obtained the best network performance there was a clear improvement in the ann 3 model when the number of hidden neurons was increased from three to five where r and oi values were higher 7 75 and 11 44 respectively and rmse and mae were lower 14 45 and 19 62 respectively the statistical parameter values of ann 3 are impaired and become almost constant when increasing the number of hidden neurons to greater than five it was found that by increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer from three to seven in the ann 4 model the values of r and oi increased by 1 25 and 1 56 respectively while the rmse and mae values decreased by 4 53 and 4 05 respectively the best results for the ann 5 model were achieved with four neurons in the hidden layer which is reflected in the values of the statistical indicators bolded in table 4 no differences in the accuracy of the ann 4 and ann 5 models were found when increasing the number of hidden neurons assigned the developed ann models could be employed using a spreadsheet i e microsoft excel or in the visual basic programming language for the prediction of wdel the model for wdel could be displayed by mathematical formulations as presented in fig 2 for the ann 1 model as mentioned the best results of the ann 1 ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 and ann 5 models are 9 6 1 5 3 1 5 5 1 5 7 1 and 3 4 1 architectures for wdel prediction fig 3 shows the comparison between wdel values of ann models and the experimental values via scatter plots for the training dataset table 4 gives the statistical performance of the optimized ann models during the training and testing processes fig 3 shows that wdel values mostly follow a 1 1 line during the training process indicating a better match between the predicted and experimental data for the ann 1 model the full input set than those for the rest of the models the fit line equation for the ann 1 model s assuming that the equation is y αo x α1 slope αo is close to one and the intercept α1 reaches zero the αo values for ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 models decreased by 9 35 15 21 and 12 05 respectively compared to the ann 1 model and α1 increased by a factor of 1 9 2 43 and 2 15 respectively the largest r and oi values and smallest rmse and mae values were obtained by the ann 1 model as presented in table 4 the r and oi values were close to one and the corresponding rmse and mae values were close to zero the ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 models r values decreased by 5 44 8 37 and 6 69 respectively while the oi values decreased by 6 83 10 29 and 8 34 respectively when compared with those of the ann 1 model moreover for the ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 models the rmse increased by 45 34 64 54 and 54 24 while the mae increased by 36 91 48 07 and 42 33 respectively the absence or presence of some of the design and operational variables in the input sets significantly affected the ann models performances it was observed that when hr and p were incorporated with climate data as input parameters to the ann 2 model it performed better than the ann 3 and ann 4 models the wdel estimation accuracy was low when switching ann 4 s qm and qs to dm and da as seen in ann 3 thus hr and p are more effective than other design and operational variables for accurately modeling wdel the ann 5 model its inputs were the meteorological variables only showed the lowest αo 0 7035 and largest α1 4 7502 indicating appreciably less scatter from and more cluster around the 1 1 line fig 3 comparing the ann 5 model results with those of the other ann models table 4 shows that ann 1 model had larger r and oi increases 13 40 and 16 25 respectively and lower rmse and mae decreases 45 52 and 41 08 respectively than ann 5 the ann 2 model performed better than ann 5 model due to the inclusion of both hr and p and had a 7 24 and 8 31 increase in the r and oi respectively over the ann 5 model and rmse and mae values smaller by approximately 20 81 and 19 33 respectively the ann 3 model added dm and ds to the ann 5 model and performed better than the ann 5 model with a 3 91 and 4 28 increase in r and oi and a 10 36 and 12 76 decrease in rmse and mae respectively the ann 4 model setup by qm and qs being added to the ann 5 model produced better results than the ann 5 model with r and oi increasing by 5 81 and 6 55 respectively and rmse and mae decreasing by 15 96 and 16 14 respectively thus the ann 5 model gave slightly poorer estimates and the results indicate that dm and ds had only a slight effect on modeling wdel the ann 1 model ranked best in the training process this was expected as the ann 1 model considered all of the variables that have an influence on the wdel based on the testing data set results of table 5 the ann 1 model with r oi rmse and mae of 0 861 0 792 4 356 and 3 490 respectively can be selected as the best model for wdel estimation the ann 2 model also gave good results but was less accurate than the ann 1 model the ann model having dm and ds with climate data as input variables ann 3 model yielded the lowest r and oi and highest rmse and mae although there were no design or operational variables in the ann 5 model it outperformed the ann 3 model as r and oi increased by 8 and 9 50 and the rmse and mae decreased by 12 73 and 15 94 respectively the ann 2 model gave slightly better estimates than the ann 4 model adding either hr and p ann 2 model or qm and qs ann 4 model to ann 5 model improved the estimation accuracy 3 2 performances of mlr models we constructed five equations for the mlr model with different input combinations in order to confirm the capability of the proposed ann models to predict the wdel for this purpose the mlr models that were derived used the ann training dataset the final equations obtained from mlr are shown in table 6 for the five combinations the se t stat p value and vif for independent variables in the equations are presented in table 7 with 95 confidence the t stat values of the ws variable in all mlr models ranged from 7 89 9 23 which is greater than 1 99 this confirms the reliability of the coefficients ws the se of the ws coefficients average was 0 36 the p values of the ws in table 7 are too small ws is the most significant variable in the calculation of wdel dechmi et al 2003 keller and bliesner 1990 tarjuelo et al 2000 as can be seen in table 7 the t stat values of the da variable for the mlr 1 and mlr 3 models 3 61 and 2 67 respectively are greater than 1 99 the p values of the da are small in addition the qa variable of t stat and p value for the mlr 4 model are less than 1 99 and 0 05 respectively however the rest of the variables are not significant p 0 05 in the models with the low absolute values of t stat there is multicollinearity between dm qm and qa and the other variables in the mlr 1 model and vif is much greater than five the vifs of all variables are less than five in the other mlr models therefore these variables are meaningful inputs to the mlr models fig 3 shows the comparison of wdel values predicted by the mlr models versus the experimental values with training dataset via scatter plots the statistical criteria for each combination of training and testing datasets are presented in table 8 from fig 3 it can be observed from values of αo and α1 for the fitted line equations and visual inspection of the scatter plots that wdel estimates by the mlr 1 model are closer to the experimental values than those of the other mlr models the mlr 1 model i e the mlr model with all input variables provides better performance in estimating wdel than when using individual variables as is reflected in the values of the statistical parameters table 8 a comparison of statistical parameter values in the results of mlr models with two input design and operational variables together with climate variables shows that r and oi values of the mlr 3 model are higher and rmse and mae are lower than those that of mlr 2 and mlr 4 models during the training process and vice versa for the testing process the trend of the mlr 5 model results is the same as that of ann 5 model 3 3 comparison between ann and mlr models fig 3 depicts the comparison between the experimental and predicted wdel for ann and mlr models in the training process the results predicted by the ann models were more tightly distributed around the 1 1 line than the mlr models this is obviously reflected by the values of αo and α1 of the ann models which are closer to one and zero respectively than those of the mlr models the values of αo are between 0 7035 0 8985 for the ann models and 0 6305 0 747 for the mlr models the corresponding α1 values for the ann models are between 1 561 4 7502 while the mlr models are between 4 0276 5 882 the percentage of wdel values predicted by ann models with a discrepancy up to 2 is in the range of 35 53 47 37 and up to 5 is in the range of 73 68 94 74 for mlr models the percentage of wdel values predicted with a discrepancy up to 2 is in the range of 22 37 35 53 and up to 5 is in the range of 63 16 75 from tables 4 5 and 8 it is further proved that the statistical parameters r and oi have high values and rmse and mae have low values when wdel is calculated with the ann models using mlr with all the variables mlr 1 model to model wdel reduces the r and oi values by 9 62 and 11 59 respectively more than their values in the ann 1 model and increases the rmse and mae values by 71 37 and 59 90 respectively using the training dataset in the testing process the ann 1 model gives a better improvement as the value of r and oi increased from 0 674 to 0 861 and from 0 603 to 0 792 respectively while the value of rmse and mae decreased from 6 381 to 4 356 and from 5 007 to 3 490 respectively the ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 models had r values that were more accurate than those from the mlr 2 mlr 3 and mlr 4 models by approximately 11 06 5 80 and 8 65 respectively using the training data sets the oi values for these ann models are closer to one than in the corresponding of mlr models the rmse and mae values for these ann models are also close to zero the statistical parameters of the ann 5 model are superior to those of the mlr 5 model the trends of the results of these models in the testing process were the same as those of the training process this indicates that the wdel values predicted by the ann models correlated well with the corresponding experimental values the mlr models show a reduction in performance compared to the ann models therefore ann can be used successfully as a powerful tool to model wdel 3 4 contribution analysis neural networks were used to analyze the contribution of the design operational and meteorological variables used in modeling the wdel with different input combinations contribution ratios for each input variable i e hr p da dm qa qm ws rh and t were derived from the connection weights obtained from best network architecture in the modeling training process and used to compute the effect on the network s output response thus this procedure shows what the key inputs for the model are and which are not effective in formulating output predictions fig 4 shows contribution ratio values of each input variable used in the calculation of wdel for different input combinations i e ann 1 ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 and ann 5 models as can be seen a da of 17 50 and an hr of 16 30 were the most significant variables affecting the ann 1 model with qm and ws ranking 3rd and 4th with contribution ratios of 12 57 and 12 19 respectively in the rest of the models the input variable with the largest contribution in modeling wdel was ws which contributed approximately 32 88 32 26 29 33 and 53 41 for ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 and ann 5 respectively these values are similar to those determined using the statistical analysis of the data using mlr table 7 which showed a significant effect p 0 05 of ws this was consistent with the findings by bavi et al 2009 n et al 2004 2005 n et al 2004 2005 sanchez et al 2010b and sanchez et al 2011 who found that ws is likely to be an effective variable and the greatest relative contribution explaining wdel under different technical and operational conditions rh had a moderate effect on the modeling of wdel the values of the contribution ratios of rh were 18 66 19 10 and 16 02 in ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 respectively this result is consistent with the results of tarjuelo et al 2000 and playán et al 2005 the input variable with the smallest contribution is t which contributes approximately 8 40 8 68 and 7 79 to ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 respectively this is in agreement with playán et al 2005 but disagrees with the findings of tarjuelo 1995 and faci et al 2001 moreover the effect of p about 29 19 on wdel had a significant effect montero 1999 and tarjuelo et al 2000 in the ann 2 model 4 conclusion wind drift and evaporation losses wdel is the most important parameter required in farm sprinkler irrigation management and design two mathematical approaches one based on the technique of artificial neural networks anns and the other on multiple linear regression mlr were used to predict wdel ann and mlr models used design operational and meteorological parameters as inputs and gave wdel as the output the employed input variables were riser height operating pressure main nozzle diameter auxiliary nozzle diameter da water discharge by main nozzle water discharge by auxiliary nozzle wind speed ws air temperature and relative humidity five input data combinations were analyzed in both the ann and mlr approaches in addition to determining the input variables significantly affecting the wdel a feed forward back propagation algorithm was preferred as the ann training algorithm the coefficient of correlation r overall index of model performance oi root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to investigate the models performance during training and testing processes in the training stage the comparison between the experimental values of wdel and the models outcome showed that ann models had more similar results than mlr models the ann models in the testing stage gave fewer errors which further showed evidence of the accuracy of this model the r oi rmse and mae values for the ann 1 model which included all variables were better than the values when fewer input variables were used in ann furthermore the ann models showed that da and ws are the predominant variables affecting the wdel this is in agreement with the statistical analysis of the data using mlr which showed a significant effect p 0 05 of the two variables the study showed that ann is useful tool for predicting the wdel of sprinkler irrigation systems moreover the developed models can assist managers of sprinkler irrigation systems to minimize wdel by modifying field practices during the growing season this is to accommodate in advance crop water demand for future irrigation requirements

11623,wind drift and evaporation losses wdel play a significant role in the development of water conservation strategies in sprinkler irrigation in this study artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr models were developed by taking data collected from published studies on predicted wdel for several design operational and meteorological conditions of variables in sprinkler irrigation five combinations of input variables including riser height operating pressure main nozzle diameter auxiliary nozzle diameter da water discharge by main nozzle water discharge by auxiliary nozzles wind speed ws air temperature and relative humidity were used to create prediction models for wdel the ann and mlr models were trained and tested on 70 and 30 of the data points respectively the accuracy of the models was assessed by the coefficients of correlation r overall indices of model performance oi root mean square errors rmse and mean absolute errors mae statistical results showed that the ann and mlr models with all input variables had the best predicting capabilities when comparing the results of different ann and mlr models it was seen that the ann models had more success in predicting wdel the ann models gave higher r 0 843 0 956 and oi 0 794 0 909 values and lower rmse 2 662 4 886 and mae 2 197 3 729 values compared to the mlr models in the training stage the mlr models r values ranged from 0 794 to 0 864 oi values ranged from 0 747 to 0 816 rmse values ranged from 4 562 to 5 514 and mae values ranged from 3 513 to 4 414 furthermore a contribution analysis found that the design parameter da and the climatic parameter ws were considered to obtain the most robust estimation model it can be stated that the ann model is a more suitable

available around the world becomes increasingly scarce especially in arid and semi arid regions however little is known about its performance under field conditions smith et al 2002 the phenomenon of evaporation during sprinkler irrigation including its relationships to other soil plant atmospheric processes has not yet been completely understood de wrachien and lorenzini 2006 although it is important for the optimal design of irrigation and appropriate irrigation scheduling the performance of sprinkler irrigation depends on design and operational factors the most important design factors are the sprinkler type nozzle diameter and sprinkler spacing operational factors include operating pressure p the time of irrigation and meteorological conditions during irrigation especially wind speed ws keller and bliesner 1990 carrión et al 2001 playán et al 2006 a significant percentage of the water discharged by a sprinkler irrigation system does not reach the crop canopy this lost water is referred to as wind drift and evaporation losses wdel and is expressed as a percentage of the gross volume of irrigation water in the literature values of wdel have been reported ranging from 2 50 playán et al 2005 this variability is due to design operational and meteorological conditions at the experimental sites the wdel effect has been reported on in many research papers e g laboratory field tests and analytical studies among the design factors a large nozzle diameter produces large drop diameters which are more resistant to drift and present less area per unit of mass keller and bliesner 1990 therefore they are less affected by wdel increasing nozzle elevation over the soil surface riser height hr has been reported to increase wdel owing to longer drop trajectories and increased wind exposure however in operational factors an increase in p results in a decrease in the resulting drop diameters montero et al 2003 with an increase in wdel ws is a serious limiting meteorological factor disrupting the trajectory of droplets and induces droplet evaporation thereby increasing wdel in sprinkler irrigation faci and bercero 1991 seginer et al 1991 kincaid et al 1996 burt et al 1997 tarjuelo et al 1994 1999 dechmi et al 2003 playán et al 2005 2006 sanchez et al 2010a b zapata et al 2007 an experimental estimation of wdel is costly as well as time consuming but alternatively wdel can be estimated using soft computing techniques such as artificial neural networks anns anns are computational models inspired in the neural structures of intelligent organisms neurons and synapses which acquire knowledge through experience without any assumptions or knowledge about the underlying principles ann is an effective tool for modeling nonlinear processes as it requires few inputs and is able to precisely extract the generalized relationship between input and output data without any understanding of the physical process involved haykin 1999 sudheer et al 2003 the accuracy increases with increasing available data basheer and hajmeer 2000 jain et al 2004 anns have attracted considerable interest recently in a wide number of applications in various engineering fields rainfall runoff hsu et al 1995 fernando and jayawardena 1998 shrestha et al 2005 evapotranspiration kişi 2007 khoob 2008 ozkan et al 2011 yassin et al 2016a b suspended sediments

sprinkler distribution patterns sayyadi et al 2012 soil penetration resistance santos et al 2012 furrow irrigation infiltration mattar et al 2015 and the hydraulic performance of labyrinth channel emitters mattar and alamoud 2015 however the knowledge of ann in modeling wdel in sprinkler irrigation is limited therefore the objectives of study are to 1 explore the applicability of an ann approach for the estimation of wdel with various input combinations 2 develop multiple linear regression mlr models to predict wdel using ann training data 3 compare the predictive capabilities of ann with mlr models using statistical criteria and 4 perform a contribution analysis of the developed ann models to identify important factors affecting wdel 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental database the ann and mlr models were developed using experimental data from four published studies abo ghobar 1993 dechmi et al 2003 sanchez et al 2010b sanchez et al 2011 as presented in table 1 for the different locations under various design operational and meteorological conditions a total of 109 data points were collected in different locations the experiments were conducted using double nozzle sprinklers to determine wdel a more complete description of these experiments is presented below in the first experiment abo ghobar 1993 the wdel from sprinklers was studied under different combinations of climatic and operating conditions the tests were conducted at the educational farm in riyadh saudi arabia during the period april through july 1991 ten types of impact sprinklers with different nozzle sizes that are commonly used for field irrigation were selected the system was operated for one to two hours per run depending on the nozzle size in order to collect a sufficient quantity of water in the catch cans in the second experiment dechmi et al 2003 a solid set sprinkler system was evaluated against maize zea mays l yield the experiment was conducted at the experimental farm in zaragoza spain during the period may through august 2000 the nozzle diameters were 4 4mm main and 2 4mm auxiliary and were located at a height of 2 3m above the soil surface the nozzle operating pressure was kept constant at 300kpa during the season which resulted in a wetted radius of 11m in the third experiment sanchez et al 2010b wdel was assessed from the irrigation depth and collected into pluviometers above maize and alfalfa irrigated with the same sprinkler solid set system and under the same operational and technical conditions the experiment was performed in 2006 at the experimental farm in zaragoza spain the main nozzle included a jet straightening vane and was 4mm in diameter the auxiliary nozzle was 2 4mm in diameter in the fourth experiment sanchez et al 2011 the effects of pressure nozzle diameter and meteorological conditions on the performance of agricultural impact sprinklers were studied this experiment was also conducted at the experimental farm in zaragoza spain during the years 2003 and 2004 the diameter of the main nozzle was 4 4mm the sprinkler also included a spreader nozzle 2 4mm in diameter a wide range of p from 180 to 420kpa was tested all the tests were performed for 2h periods under low wind conditions for each test of the solid set experiment the water collected in catch cans and pluviometers after each irrigation event was recorded and averaged as irrigation depth id c the wdels are computed from the irrigation depth applied by the sprinkler system id d and the average id c i d c christiansen 1942 as follows 1 w d e l i d d i d c i d d 2 i d d q t s s s l where q is the sprinkler discharge rate t is the operating time and s s and s l are the spacing between laterals and between sprinklers along the lateral respectively the results of these experiments concluded that water was lost partially by evaporation but specifically through drift out of the irrigated area as highly variable ws makes reliable design and management of sprinkler irrigation system difficult the higher ws the farther the largest droplets can be transported by the wind while the smallest droplets influence wdel this means that wdel can be reduced by changing the sprinkler operating conditions to increase the sizes of water droplets or by irrigating when climatic conditions are favorable i e relative humidity rh is high and air temperature t and ws are low data sets for the development of the proposed models were prepared and included hr p the main nozzle diameter dm the auxiliary nozzle diameter da the water discharge by main nozzle qm the water discharge by the auxiliary nozzle qa ws t and rh as input variables and wdel as the output variable the combinations of input variables listed in table 2 formed the ann and mlr models five for each that were developed to estimate wdel the meteorological variables of ws t and rh were used as inputs in all of the proposed models the input set of variables for the first input combination ann 1 and mlr 1 included all variables and was developed to determine the effectiveness of each input variables on wdel the following three combinations second fourth were developed to evaluate the ability of the models to estimate wdel without the presence of certain of the design and operational variables the fifth combination ws t and rh represents the ann and mlr models used to investigate the effect of only meteorological variables on wdel table 3 presents the statistical parameters of the inputs and output used for training and testing the developed ann and mlr models where xm xa xn sx kx and csx denote the maximum mean minimum standard deviation kurtosis coefficient and skewness coefficient respectively the maximum values of the design and operational parameters hr p dm da qm and qa were similar for all processes as were the minimum values the maximum values of ws and rh were greater than 7ms 1 and 80 for both the training and testing processes respectively the da for kx and csx was the largest in all of the processes 2 2 artificial neural network an ann has an inherent ability to learn and recognize highly nonlinear and complex relationships by experience swingler 2001 anns contain three layers of neurons an input layer independent variables i a hidden layer j and an output layer dependent variables k to create the best ann structure the number of hidden layers neurons in each hidden layer learning algorithm and activation functions must be selected carefully dogan et al 2008 in this study the ann was trained with a hidden and an output layer using the back propagation learning algorithm back propagation is the most popular algorithm for training feed forward anns thirumalaiah and deo 1998 ciğizoğlu 2003 jain and srinivasulu 2004 fernando and shamseldin 2009 feed forward networks usually have one or more hidden layers which enables the network to model nonlinear and complex functions salehi and razavi 2012 the input layer comprises the original experimental data z o that are associated with the neurons of the input layer before exporting the data to the ann for training the network input and output were automatically normalized between 0 15 and 0 85 this normalization accelerates the training process and improves the network s generalization capabilities the following equation was used for normalization 3 z 0 85 0 15 z o z min z max z min 0 15 where z are normalized input output parameters z max is the maximum value of the input output parameters and z min is the minimum value of the input output parameters after input data are normalized they undergo unidirectional processing from the input layer through the hidden layer to the output layer anns include a parallel network of connecting neurons each neuron information processing unit n in the ann consists of input connection links a central processing unit and output connection links the connections have weights w to store information the connection strength between two neurons of adjacent layers izadifar 2010 that is processed in the central processing unit by adding bias threshold value b according to the following equation haykin 1999 for neurons in the hidden layer the neuron s value n j is 4 n j i 1 n i w 1 j i x i b 1 j where w 1 j i are the weights from the input layer to the hidden layer x i are normalized input parameters n i are the number of input neurons and b 1 j are the biases in the hidden layer then the output layer neuron n k is given by 5 n k j 1 n j w 2 k j h j b 2 k where w 2 k j are the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer n j are the number of output neurons and b 2 k are the biases in the output layer thereafter the activation transfer functions f in the processing unit of the hidden and output neurons were implemented the most common transfer functions in engineering applications include the hyperbolic tangent tanh function dawson and wilby 1998 zanetti et al 2007 tanh transfer functions of neuron activation in the hidden and output layers were considered in this study to train the neural network the general functional form of the tanh transfer function is 6 f x 1 exp 2 x 1 exp 2 x where x is either the value of n j or n k the differences error between the output values and target values were calculated at the end of each forward pass in the forward propagation stage if the error fell above a level considered acceptable weights layer by layer were adjusted back propagation stage if not the training stopped a trial and error procedure was used to find the optimum number of hidden neurons jain et al 2008 the trained ann is then tested on the unseen data set the developed ann can be used for prediction purposes the ann modeling approach is represented schematically in fig 1 in this study ann models were trained and tested by qnet2000 software for predicting wdel the data set was divided randomly into training and testing subsets in total 70 of these data were used for training and 30 for testing the training and testing sets had 76 and 33 data points respectively 2 3 multiple linear regression mlr has been widely used as a fundamental tool for modeling relationships between multiple variables linearly and has been used in several studies guisan et al 2002 the mlr establishes a quantitative relationship between the independent and dependent variables the mlr can be defined as follows 7 y b o i 1 m b i x i where y is the predicted or expected value of the dependent variable b o is the value of y when all of the independent variables are equal to zero x i i 1 m are the distinct independent or predictor variables and b i i 1 m are the estimated regression coefficients in this study the regression tool in microsoft excel was used to develop the mlr model the mlr model was developed with the same experimental data used in the ann model 70 of the data points randomly selected were used to fit the mlr model and the remaining 30 used to test the model alongside the estimated regression coefficients the regression standard error se t statistic t stat and probability of independent variables p values value were examined in order to judge whether the best fitting line does in fact fit the data to an adequate degree in multiple regression the variance inflation factor vif is used as an indicator of the amount of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables and is defined as 8 vif 1 1 r 2 where r 2 is the determination coefficient of the regression of the independent variable taken for a moment as the dependent variable related to the rest of the independent variables the following guidelines were used to interpret vif vif 1 not correlated 1 vif 5 moderately correlated and vif 5 10 highly correlated the vif provides a quick measure of how much a variable is contributing to the standard error in the regression montgomery et al 2001 montgomery and runger 2003 2 4 performance evaluation criteria four statistical criteria namely the coefficient of correlation r the overall index of model performance oi the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were calculated to assess the accuracy of the ann and mlr models they are defined by the following equations 9 r i 1 n e i e p i p i 1 n e i e 2 i 1 n p i p 2 10 o i 1 2 2 r m s e e m e n i 1 n e i p i 2 i 1 n e i e 2 11 r m s e i 1 n e i p i 2 n 12 m a e i 1 n e i p i n where e i is the experimental value p i is the predicted value n is the number of observations e m is the maximum experimental value e n is the minimum experimental value e is the average experimental value and p is the average predicted value r measures the degree of correlation between the experimental and predicted values with values close to 1 0 indicating good model performance oi ranges from to 1 an oi value of 1 denotes a perfect fit between the experimental and predicted values alazba et al 2012 rmse has the advantage of expressing the error in the same units as the variable thus providing more information about the efficiency of the model legates and mccabe 1999 the lower the rmse the more accurate the prediction is mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts without considering their direction mae ranges from 0 to and the lower the values the better willmott and matsuura 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of ann models the optimal architectures of ann models were selected through a trial and error procedure based on the statistical parameters using different input combinations to estimate the wdel as presented in table 4 the ann architectures improved markedly with more hidden neurons for the training process in ann 1 using all input variables the r oi rmse and mae values were initially 0 945 0 909 2 962 and 2 457 respectively with five neurons in the hidden layer increasing the number of hidden neurons from five to six gave a slight improvement in network performance the r and oi values were increased by 1 16 and 1 54 respectively and the rmse and mae values were decreased by 10 13 and 10 58 respectively increasing the number to greater than six led to degradation in the ann performance fig 2 depicts the most appropriate ann 1 architecture 9 6 1 after the training process and also contains a general description of the ann implementation as previously explained four ann models ann 2 through ann 5 with fewer input variables to predict wdel values were also developed table 4 the ann 2 model with three neurons in the hidden layer obtained the best network performance there was a clear improvement in the ann 3 model when the number of hidden neurons was increased from three to five where r and oi values were higher 7 75 and 11 44 respectively and rmse and mae were lower 14 45 and 19 62 respectively the statistical parameter values of ann 3 are impaired and become almost constant when increasing the number of hidden neurons to greater than five it was found that by increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer from three to seven in the ann 4 model the values of r and oi increased by 1 25 and 1 56 respectively while the rmse and mae values decreased by 4 53 and 4 05 respectively the best results for the ann 5 model were achieved with four neurons in the hidden layer which is reflected in the values of the statistical indicators bolded in table 4 no differences in the accuracy of the ann 4 and ann 5 models were found when increasing the number of hidden neurons assigned the developed ann models could be employed using a spreadsheet i e microsoft excel or in the visual basic programming language for the prediction of wdel the model for wdel could be displayed by mathematical formulations as presented in fig 2 for the ann 1 model as mentioned the best results of the ann 1 ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 and ann 5 models are 9 6 1 5 3 1 5 5 1 5 7 1 and 3 4 1 architectures for wdel prediction fig 3 shows the comparison between wdel values of ann models and the experimental values via scatter plots for the training dataset table 4 gives the statistical performance of the optimized ann models during the training and testing processes fig 3 shows that wdel values mostly follow a 1 1 line during the training process indicating a better match between the predicted and experimental data for the ann 1 model the full input set than those for the rest of the models the fit line equation for the ann 1 model s assuming that the equation is y αo x α1 slope αo is close to one and the intercept α1 reaches zero the αo values for ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 models decreased by 9 35 15 21 and 12 05 respectively compared to the ann 1 model and α1 increased by a factor of 1 9 2 43 and 2 15 respectively the largest r and oi values and smallest rmse and mae values were obtained by the ann 1 model as presented in table 4 the r and oi values were close to one and the corresponding rmse and mae values were close to zero the ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 models r values decreased by 5 44 8 37 and 6 69 respectively while the oi values decreased by 6 83 10 29 and 8 34 respectively when compared with those of the ann 1 model moreover for the ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 models the rmse increased by 45 34 64 54 and 54 24 while the mae increased by 36 91 48 07 and 42 33 respectively the absence or presence of some of the design and operational variables in the input sets significantly affected the ann models performances it was observed that when hr and p were incorporated with climate data as input parameters to the ann 2 model it performed better than the ann 3 and ann 4 models the wdel estimation accuracy was low when switching ann 4 s qm and qs to dm and da as seen in ann 3 thus hr and p are more effective than other design and operational variables for accurately modeling wdel the ann 5 model its inputs were the meteorological variables only showed the lowest αo 0 7035 and largest α1 4 7502 indicating appreciably less scatter from and more cluster around the 1 1 line fig 3 comparing the ann 5 model results with those of the other ann models table 4 shows that ann 1 model had larger r and oi increases 13 40 and 16 25 respectively and lower rmse and mae decreases 45 52 and 41 08 respectively than ann 5 the ann 2 model performed better than ann 5 model due to the inclusion of both hr and p and had a 7 24 and 8 31 increase in the r and oi respectively over the ann 5 model and rmse and mae values smaller by approximately 20 81 and 19 33 respectively the ann 3 model added dm and ds to the ann 5 model and performed better than the ann 5 model with a 3 91 and 4 28 increase in r and oi and a 10 36 and 12 76 decrease in rmse and mae respectively the ann 4 model setup by qm and qs being added to the ann 5 model produced better results than the ann 5 model with r and oi increasing by 5 81 and 6 55 respectively and rmse and mae decreasing by 15 96 and 16 14 respectively thus the ann 5 model gave slightly poorer estimates and the results indicate that dm and ds had only a slight effect on modeling wdel the ann 1 model ranked best in the training process this was expected as the ann 1 model considered all of the variables that have an influence on the wdel based on the testing data set results of table 5 the ann 1 model with r oi rmse and mae of 0 861 0 792 4 356 and 3 490 respectively can be selected as the best model for wdel estimation the ann 2 model also gave good results but was less accurate than the ann 1 model the ann model having dm and ds with climate data as input variables ann 3 model yielded the lowest r and oi and highest rmse and mae although there were no design or operational variables in the ann 5 model it outperformed the ann 3 model as r and oi increased by 8 and 9 50 and the rmse and mae decreased by 12 73 and 15 94 respectively the ann 2 model gave slightly better estimates than the ann 4 model adding either hr and p ann 2 model or qm and qs ann 4 model to ann 5 model improved the estimation accuracy 3 2 performances of mlr models we constructed five equations for the mlr model with different input combinations in order to confirm the capability of the proposed ann models to predict the wdel for this purpose the mlr models that were derived used the ann training dataset the final equations obtained from mlr are shown in table 6 for the five combinations the se t stat p value and vif for independent variables in the equations are presented in table 7 with 95 confidence the t stat values of the ws variable in all mlr models ranged from 7 89 9 23 which is greater than 1 99 this confirms the reliability of the coefficients ws the se of the ws coefficients average was 0 36 the p values of the ws in table 7 are too small ws is the most significant variable in the calculation of wdel dechmi et al 2003 keller and bliesner 1990 tarjuelo et al 2000 as can be seen in table 7 the t stat values of the da variable for the mlr 1 and mlr 3 models 3 61 and 2 67 respectively are greater than 1 99 the p values of the da are small in addition the qa variable of t stat and p value for the mlr 4 model are less than 1 99 and 0 05 respectively however the rest of the variables are not significant p 0 05 in the models with the low absolute values of t stat there is multicollinearity between dm qm and qa and the other variables in the mlr 1 model and vif is much greater than five the vifs of all variables are less than five in the other mlr models therefore these variables are meaningful inputs to the mlr models fig 3 shows the comparison of wdel values predicted by the mlr models versus the experimental values with training dataset via scatter plots the statistical criteria for each combination of training and testing datasets are presented in table 8 from fig 3 it can be observed from values of αo and α1 for the fitted line equations and visual inspection of the scatter plots that wdel estimates by the mlr 1 model are closer to the experimental values than those of the other mlr models the mlr 1 model i e the mlr model with all input variables provides better performance in estimating wdel than when using individual variables as is reflected in the values of the statistical parameters table 8 a comparison of statistical parameter values in the results of mlr models with two input design and operational variables together with climate variables shows that r and oi values of the mlr 3 model are higher and rmse and mae are lower than those that of mlr 2 and mlr 4 models during the training process and vice versa for the testing process the trend of the mlr 5 model results is the same as that of ann 5 model 3 3 comparison between ann and mlr models fig 3 depicts the comparison between the experimental and predicted wdel for ann and mlr models in the training process the results predicted by the ann models were more tightly distributed around the 1 1 line than the mlr models this is obviously reflected by the values of αo and α1 of the ann models which are closer to one and zero respectively than those of the mlr models the values of αo are between 0 7035 0 8985 for the ann models and 0 6305 0 747 for the mlr models the corresponding α1 values for the ann models are between 1 561 4 7502 while the mlr models are between 4 0276 5 882 the percentage of wdel values predicted by ann models with a discrepancy up to 2 is in the range of 35 53 47 37 and up to 5 is in the range of 73 68 94 74 for mlr models the percentage of wdel values predicted with a discrepancy up to 2 is in the range of 22 37 35 53 and up to 5 is in the range of 63 16 75 from tables 4 5 and 8 it is further proved that the statistical parameters r and oi have high values and rmse and mae have low values when wdel is calculated with the ann models using mlr with all the variables mlr 1 model to model wdel reduces the r and oi values by 9 62 and 11 59 respectively more than their values in the ann 1 model and increases the rmse and mae values by 71 37 and 59 90 respectively using the training dataset in the testing process the ann 1 model gives a better improvement as the value of r and oi increased from 0 674 to 0 861 and from 0 603 to 0 792 respectively while the value of rmse and mae decreased from 6 381 to 4 356 and from 5 007 to 3 490 respectively the ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 models had r values that were more accurate than those from the mlr 2 mlr 3 and mlr 4 models by approximately 11 06 5 80 and 8 65 respectively using the training data sets the oi values for these ann models are closer to one than in the corresponding of mlr models the rmse and mae values for these ann models are also close to zero the statistical parameters of the ann 5 model are superior to those of the mlr 5 model the trends of the results of these models in the testing process were the same as those of the training process this indicates that the wdel values predicted by the ann models correlated well with the corresponding experimental values the mlr models show a reduction in performance compared to the ann models therefore ann can be used successfully as a powerful tool to model wdel 3 4 contribution analysis neural networks were used to analyze the contribution of the design operational and meteorological variables used in modeling the wdel with different input combinations contribution ratios for each input variable i e hr p da dm qa qm ws rh and t were derived from the connection weights obtained from best network architecture in the modeling training process and used to compute the effect on the network s output response thus this procedure shows what the key inputs for the model are and which are not effective in formulating output predictions fig 4 shows contribution ratio values of each input variable used in the calculation of wdel for different input combinations i e ann 1 ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 and ann 5 models as can be seen a da of 17 50 and an hr of 16 30 were the most significant variables affecting the ann 1 model with qm and ws ranking 3rd and 4th with contribution ratios of 12 57 and 12 19 respectively in the rest of the models the input variable with the largest contribution in modeling wdel was ws which contributed approximately 32 88 32 26 29 33 and 53 41 for ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 and ann 5 respectively these values are similar to those determined using the statistical analysis of the data using mlr table 7 which showed a significant effect p 0 05 of ws this was consistent with the findings by bavi et al 2009 n et al 2004 2005 n et al 2004 2005 sanchez et al 2010b and sanchez et al 2011 who found that ws is likely to be an effective variable and the greatest relative contribution explaining wdel under different technical and operational conditions rh had a moderate effect on the modeling of wdel the values of the contribution ratios of rh were 18 66 19 10 and 16 02 in ann 2 ann 3 and ann 4 respectively this result is consistent with the results of tarjuelo et al 2000 and playán et al 2005 the input variable with the smallest contribution is t which contributes approximately 8 40 8 68 and 7 79 to ann 2 ann 3 ann 4 respectively this is in agreement with playán et al 2005 but disagrees with the findings of tarjuelo 1995 and faci et al 2001 moreover the effect of p about 29 19 on wdel had a significant effect montero 1999 and tarjuelo et al 2000 in the ann 2 model 4 conclusion wind drift and evaporation losses wdel is the most important parameter required in farm sprinkler irrigation management and design two mathematical approaches one based on the technique of artificial neural networks anns and the other on multiple linear regression mlr were used to predict wdel ann and mlr models used design operational and meteorological parameters as inputs and gave wdel as the output the employed input variables were riser height operating pressure main nozzle diameter auxiliary nozzle diameter da water discharge by main nozzle water discharge by auxiliary nozzle wind speed ws air temperature and relative humidity five input data combinations were analyzed in both the ann and mlr approaches in addition to determining the input variables significantly affecting the wdel a feed forward back propagation algorithm was preferred as the ann training algorithm the coefficient of correlation r overall index of model performance oi root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to investigate the models performance during training and testing processes in the training stage the comparison between the experimental values of wdel and the models outcome showed that ann models had more similar results than mlr models the ann models in the testing stage gave fewer errors which further showed evidence of the accuracy of this model the r oi rmse and mae values for the ann 1 model which included all variables were better than the values when fewer input variables were used in ann furthermore the ann models showed that da and ws are the predominant variables affecting the wdel this is in agreement with the statistical analysis of the data using mlr which showed a significant effect p 0 05 of the two variables the study showed that ann is useful tool for predicting the wdel of sprinkler irrigation systems moreover the developed models can assist managers of sprinkler irrigation systems to minimize wdel by modifying field practices during the growing season this is to accommodate in advance crop water demand for future irrigation requirements

11624,groundwater stress is a major global issue multiple factors affecting groundwater stress can cause confusion among policymakers to choose the most significant factor in coping with this issue thus this study aimed to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater stress by using five different multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods and seven scales it was found that the uncertainty due to the mcdm method and scale selection was minimum when using weighted sum method wsm and saaty scale for prioritization as compared to the other four mcdm methods and six scales respectively based on wsm and saaty scale it was noticed that groundwater withdrawal and groundwater availability are the two topmost factors affecting groundwater stress the policymakers of water management could be recommended to target the reduction in groundwater withdrawal on a priority basis to cope with the groundwater stress issue better management of groundwater resources and achieve sustainable development goal 6 4 it is also recommended that researchers could use the wsm method and saaty scale to minimize the uncertainty due to the mcdm method and scale selection graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater stress factors prioritization scale mcdm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is one of the main resources which plays a crucial role in development keeping in view the significance of water use the united nations considered water security as one of the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs goal 6 unsdsn 2013 surface water and groundwater make up the two primary categories of freshwater on earth margat and van der gun 2013 thirty percent of the world s freshwater exists underground as groundwater usgs 2018 shiklamonov 1993 globally total groundwater withdrawal was 959 km3 and the rate of withdrawal is increasing by 1 annually the entire volume of groundwater abstraction can be further breakdown into three main categories agricultural domestic and industry groundwater abstraction from agricultural domestic and industrial sectors are 69 22 and 9 respectively unesco 2022 hyper and dry regions where surface water is scarce and dependence on groundwater is greater heavily rely on groundwater supplies to support human activity bhakar and singh 2018 rijsberman 2006 malmir et al 2021 the over exploitation of groundwater is also caused by rapid economic growth and higher living standards which might result in the depletion of groundwater resources foster et al 2013 genxu et al 2005 malmir et al 2022 with the over exploitation of groundwater groundwater quality also degrades haritash et al 2016 the depletion of resources and groundwater quality degradation can lead to groundwater stress water stress deals with the ability of available water resources to meet human and ecological needs it considers other physical features of water resources viz water quantity quality and accessibility already 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress un 2019 schulte and morrison 2014 by 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas who 2022 to overcome groundwater stress issues and for sustainable groundwater use multiple solutions are available such as improving the groundwater recharge lowering groundwater withdrawal etc the involvement of multiple factors affecting groundwater stress can cause confusion for policymakers in prioritizing the factors to mitigate groundwater stress effectively to date no study has been conducted to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater stress groundwater resources are not as visible as surface water resources often making their evaluation difficult and uncertain as the situation is more uncertain in the case of groundwater as compared to the surface water for most of the groundwater management decisions multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods are usually applied to support policymaking decisions mcdm is one of the well recognized and non statistical methods to handle the problems of an ambiguous nature hartmann et al 2009 mcdm methods are useful for modeling complex systems with imprecise ambiguous or uncertain data polat 2016 zavadskas et al 2018 the mcdm methods have frequently been applied in decision making for the management of natural resources especially on the groundwater resources for more than two decades zardari et al 2015 furthermore mcdm is also used to address the problem related to the identification of major factors affecting groundwater change li et al 2014 in another study an mcdm method was used to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater recharge in the korba aquifer tunisia zghibi et al 2020a b zghibi et al 2020a b advanced the comprehension of hydrological dynamics within aquifers and identified critical factors influencing the recharge process somaratne 2019 also used one of the mcdm methods to estimate groundwater stress leading to valuable insights for the sustainable utilization and management of groundwater resources saqr et al 2021 studied the link between sdgs and groundwater over exploitation vulnerability by using multiple mcdm methods they emphasized on the broad range of applications and effectiveness of mcdm methods for evaluating and handling groundwater resources and also linked it with sdgs different methods have been developed even within the mcdm framework there is no single mcdm method that is superior to all other decision making methods guitouni and martel 1998 however different mcdm methods can be used for the same problem saqr et al 2021 and different methods can lead to different outcomes for the same problem zardari et al 2015 that is why the selection of an appropriate method to prioritize factors affecting groundwater stress is also very crucial in this study five mcdm methods frequently employed in the field of water resources were considered viz analytic hierarchy process ahp fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp weighted sum method wsm weighted product method wpm and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis zardari et al 2015 emovon and oghenenyerovwho 2020 to perform mcdm a survey needs to be conducted to get the expert opinion the expert opinion is obtained in the form of weights the scale is used in mcdm methods to convert verbal weights into numeric weights harker and vargas 1987 multiple scales such as the saaty scale index scale geometric scale etc are available in the literature the availability of several scales and the lack of clear guidelines for scale selection make the selection procedure more ambiguous goepel 2019 franek and kresta 2014 recommended that the saaty scale 1 9 is a favorable option after the comparison of nine different scales however zhang et al 2009 preferred the index scale over the saaty scale dong et al 2008 recommended that the geometrical scale is more suitable than the saaty scale and the ma zheng scale also known as the inverse linear scale in the ahp method different studies have provided different recommendations for scale selection in mcdm methods goepel 2019 the selection of an inappropriate scale may result in uncertain outcomes franek and kresta 2014 which makes it more difficult for the practitioner to select the suitable scale applied to mcdm methods thus this study used seven different scales i e saaty index square inverse geometric inverse linear and logarithmic in multiple mcdm methods rather than just relying on a single one to minimize the uncertainty in the final outcomes one suitable scale and mcdm method were identified by applying statistical techniques the findings of this study can guide practitioners in selecting an appropriate mcdm method and scale thus the main objectives of this work can be summarized as to identify a suitable mcdm method and scale to prioritize factors affecting groundwater stress based on a suitable mcdm method and scale moreover this research intended to answer the question what is the prioritization order of groundwater factors affecting groundwater stress this work was carried out to help the policymakers to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater stress to cope with the groundwater stress and achieve sdg 6 clean water and sanitation for all especially indicator 6 4 2 level of water stress of sdg 6 this work used multiple mcdm methods and scales to identify the suitable method and scale to reduce the uncertainty in the outcome 2 methodology the methodology of this study can be divided into three phases viz identification of main factors affecting groundwater stress applying the different mcdm methods and scales to prioritize the main influencing factors and minimizing the uncertainty by identifying the most appropriate mcdm method and scale 2 1 identification of the main factor affecting groundwater stress the factors affecting groundwater stress were identified through a literature review this study used the review of groundwater stress indices done by akbar et al 2022 to identify the factors affecting groundwater stress eight factors that are normally used in groundwater stress indices to estimate groundwater stress are listed in table 1 these eight factors were prioritized by using different mcdm methods as explained in the next section 2 2 multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods are most commonly used for prioritization of concerning factors indicators methods etc multiple mcdm methods are available and one method cannot be prioritized over another vassoney et al 2021 the choice among existing mcdm methods can be considered a multi criteria challenge each method possesses its own set of advantages and disadvantages making it impossible to assert that any single method is inherently superior to the rest for every case stojčić et al 2019 wątróbski et al 2019 moreover the prioritization of different alternatives may vary with the use of different methods leading to different decisions zardari et al 2015 therefore this study used five mcdm methods along with seven different types of scales to estimate the prioritization of factors affecting groundwater stress then one suitable mcdm method and one scale among five mcdm methods and seven scales were identified to minimize the uncertainty in the prioritization due to the method and scale selection the ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis methods were employed for prioritization a brief summary of the five different mcdm methods is given in table 2 the first step to apply the mcdm method is the collection of expert opinions the expert opinions were taken from the policymakers related to water resources a researcher from academia having expertise in hydrology and professionals working as a hydrologist in different organizations from different countries across the globe mentioned in the acknowledgment all the expert opinions were obtained in 2022 in a qualitative form during the survey it was asked to the respondent to give a level of importance of one factor over another corresponding to the groundwater stress for example the groundwater recharge and groundwater withdrawal are equally important if both contribute equally to groundwater stress etc the details of the level of importance are given in table 3 moreover to avoid uncertainty due to local or regional perceptions or judgments by the experts thirty three expert judgments were taken from six different countries in different regions of the world usa germany england china pakistan and thailand the second step was to convert the qualitative opinions into quantitative by using numeric scales multiple scales have been used in mcdm methods without explaining the reason for scale selection the selection of a suitable scale is very important because different scales can give different outcomes which can cause uncertainty franek and kresta 2014 harker and vargas 1987 for example harker and vargas 1987 applied five scales to solve a problem the saaty scale 1 9 developed by saaty 1980 was found to be a better option among the five scales however zhang et al 2009 compared the saaty scale with the index scale and they preferred the index scale over the saaty scale it is because the index scale has a sounder theoretical basis as compared to the saaty scale zhang et al 2009 there is no clear framework for scale selection in the mcdm method therefore this study used seven different scales in five different mcdm methods the details of each scale are given in table 3 moreover all the seven scales mentioned above were used in the form of a triangular fuzzy scale as well for the application of fahp a triangular fuzzy scale is considered better than conventional scales to minimize the uncertainty during the collection of expert opinions božanić et al 2015 the conversion of the saaty scale into the triangular fuzzy scale is given in table 4 all other scales were also converted into the triangular fuzzy scale in a similar fashion the third step is to construct a pairwise comparison matrix a based on the expert judgments as shown in equation 1 each diagonal value in the matrix should be equal to 1 additionally the multiplication of any element aij in a row i and column j by another element aji should be equal to 1 and this step is common in all mcdm methods 1 a a 11 a 1 n a n 1 a n n after the construction of the pairwise comparison matrix the next steps are different in the different methods furthermore to perform mcdm five different methods ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis were used these five methods are among the most commonly used in the literature triantaphyllou 2000 zardari et al 2015 ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis were explained comprehensively by saqr et al 2021 srdjevic and medeiros 2008 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 aminudin et al 2018 and hanine et al 2016 respectively in the last step of ahp there is a need to check the consistency ratio cr to assess the level of consistency of a matrix matrix a is considered to be sufficiently consistent if the cr of a decision matrix is below 0 1 baliatsas et al 2016 wijitkosum 2018 the cr is the ratio of the consistency index ci of a given evaluation matrix and the consistency of a random index ri as shown in equation 2 do and chen 2014 the ci can be calculated as shown in equation 3 this study also analyzed the effect of different scales on the value of the cr 2 c r c i r i 3 c i λ max n n 1 where λ max is the largest eigenvalue of matrix a and n represent the matrix size the ri of the matrices of order 1 10 is shown in table 5 2 3 selection of suitable mcdm method and scale to obtain final weights as mentioned above in each mcdm method seven different scales were used in this way thirty five sets of weights were obtained then the weights were aggregated i e weights obtained within ahp using the seven scales were aggregated to get the average weights for the ahp method used in this study the same approach was repeated for the fahp wsm wpm and topsis methods to obtain weights in the same fashion the aggregated weights were obtained to estimate the variations in the weights due to the different scales and then one suitable scale was identified to minimize the uncertainty the weights were aggregated i e weights of factors were obtained by using ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis methods with the help of only the saaty scale were aggregated to obtain the average weights for the saaty scale used in this study in the same way the aggregated weights were obtained for the six other scales used in this study in the same way weights were aggregated for each scale in the last step the deviation from the mean was calculated by using all aggregated weights for each scale the scale which showed minimum deviation from the mean was considered the most suitable similar to the scales five different outcomes were obtained for each mcdm method and then aggregated after the aggregation deviation from the mean is calculated the mcdm method which showed minimum deviation from the mean was considered the most suitable the most suitable mcdm method and scale were used to obtain weights to minimize the uncertainty in the weights due to the different methods and scales the complete framework of the methodology is shown in fig 1 the f test was applied to assess the significance of the disparity between the aggregated weights and individual weights of each mcdm method the f tests can be used to check the significance of the disparity between groups is significant or not kissell and poserina 2017 a 95 level of significance p 0 05 was utilized for significance testing in this study 3 results and discussion the factors which influence groundwater stress were prioritized by applying multiple scales and methods multiple mcdm methods and scales were used to check the variations in the weights and to minimize uncertainty in factors due to model uncertainty this section can be divided further into two parts the first section deals with the assessment of the variations in the weights due to the different methods and scales the second part is related to the prioritization of factors by using the most suitable mcdm method and scale 3 1 variation in weights of factors by using different scales and methods five different mcdm methods and seven different scales were used in this study and the variation in the results was assessed fig 2 a shows the weights of the factors corresponding to the ahp method and seven different scales slight variations were observed in the ranking order especially in the fourth fifth and sixth ranked factors in the case of inverse linear and logarithmic scales as compared to the use of the other five scales within the ahp method the factors ranking order based on the fahp and seven different scales also showed similar results as ahp except for the ranking order of water table level and groundwater contribution to the environmental flow which was inverted the prioritization order of the wsm with the help of seven different scales was also determined the wsm showed comparatively higher variations in the ranking order as compared to the other mcdm methods and scales used in this study in wsm the inverse linear and logarithmic scales showed groundwater recharge at second place in the prioritization order however groundwater availability ranked second instead of groundwater recharge based on the other scales used in this study within wsm moreover the variations in the fourth fifth and sixth ranking order were also different as compared to the other mcdm methods used in this study as shown in fig 2 c the ranking order of the factors affecting groundwater stress was determined by using wpm as well which showed very similar results to the ahp the variations in the ranking order based on the different scales within the wpm are shown in fig 2 d similarly the topsis method was used to establish the prioritization order of factors affecting groundwater stress the topsis showed the highest variations in the ranking order as compared to the other mcdm methods used in this study as shown in fig 2 e the variations in the weights of the factors were significant due to the use of different mcdm methods as well as different scales overall all five methods showed agreement for the first second and third most important factors affecting groundwater stress however the remaining five factors showed significant variation in the weights depending on mcdm methods the topsis method showed the maximum deviation in the weights as compared to the other mcdm methods moreover the higher deviation in the weights of the factors from the average weights was noticed due to the logarithmic inverse and inverse linear scales as compared to the other scales within the same mcdm method the topsis method showed the highest sensitivity for the different scales based on the results it can be summarized that both different methods and scales were almost equally contributing to the variation in the weights moreover topsis showed the maximum variation among mcdm methods on the hand logarithmic inverse and inverse linear scales exhibited higher variation as compared to the other scales used in this study 3 2 minimizing the uncertainty by selecting the suitable scale the selection of different scales also plays a vital role in the accurate assessment of the weights in the application of mcdm the deviation of the weights from the mean value due to the use of different scales in mcdm is shown in fig 3 it was observed that the saaty scale showed the minimum deviation of seven percent from the mean value and the geometric scale showed the maximum deviation the index scale is second best showing an 11 percent deviation from the mean moreover the logarithmic inverse inverse linear square and geometric scales showed 22 27 28 37 and 40 percent deviation from the mean respectively based on these findings it can be recommended that the saaty scale provides a more accurate outcome as compared to the other scales considered in this study based on the f test it was found the weights obtained by the geometric scale showed the most significant variability p value 0 011 as compared to the aggregated weights however the weights obtained by saaty scale showed the least significant variability p value 0 473 it shows that the saaty scale is more suitable than the other scales considered in this study 3 3 effect of scales on consistency ratio the consistency ratio was also found sensitive to the scale selection a massive change was noticed in the value of the cr due to the different scales the cr should be less than 0 1 as shown in fig 2 with the red horizontal line the cr of more than the permissible limit shows that the decision matrix is not consistent square and geometric scales showed a cr more than the threshold the threshold value of cr corresponding to the geometric scale was slightly higher than the acceptable limit the cr was 0 28 and 0 11 for the square and geometric scales respectively while other scales showed a cr within the threshold limit index scale and inverse linear scales showed better performance regarding the threshold value of cr as represented in fig 4 3 4 weights of factors by using different mcdm methods this section expresses the weights of the factors that were combined across various scales within each mcdm method to derive the mean weights for each method based on the aggregated results an agreement was noticed among all five mcdm methods regarding the first second and third most important parameters according to each method it was noticed that groundwater withdrawal groundwater availability and groundwater recharge are first second and third in priority respectively however a significant change in the weights of the lower order factors was noticed groundwater quality accessibility to groundwater precipitation groundwater contribution to the environmental flow and water table level were the factors that were prioritized differently in different mcdm methods for example groundwater quality the role of variation in precipitation and groundwater accessibility are at fourth fifth and sixth ranks respectively based on the ahp and fahp methods as shown in fig 5 a and b however the role of precipitation moved up from the sixth rank to the fourth however the groundwater quality moved down from the fourth to sixth rank the ranking of the factors based on the wsm is shown in fig 5 c the wpm showed prioritization similar to the ahp and fahp the ranking order based on the wpm is shown in fig 5 d but the topsis showed a significant variation in the prioritization of the factors especially the middle and lower order factors as compared to the all other methods used according to the topsis method groundwater quality groundwater contribution to the environment accessibility to the groundwater and water table level were at fourth fifth sixth and seventh ranks respectively as shown in fig 5 e it shows that the outcome of the topsis is very different as compared to the other methods used in this study based on the f test it was found the weights obtained by the topsis method showed the most significant variability p value 0 0152 as compared to the aggregated weights however the weights obtained by wsm showed the least significant variability p value 0 464 compared to the mean value it shows that the wsm method gives the value closest to the mean 3 5 minimizing the uncertainty by selecting the suitable mcdm method different mcdm methods showed variations in the outcome as discussed in section 3 4 which is why the deviation from the mean of weights of factors was analyzed according to the results of this study the wsm method showed better performance in terms of deviation from aggregated values of the weights as compared to the other methods the wsm method showed an eight percent deviation from the mean whereas ahp wpm fahp and topsis showed 12 15 15 and 42 percent deviation from the mean thus topsis showed the maximum deviation from aggregated values of the weights as shown in fig 6 based on these findings it can be recommended that the wsm method provides more accurate results as compared to the other four methods 3 6 minimizing the uncertainty by selecting the suitable scale and mcdm method the variation in weights of the factors due to different mcdm methods and scales was minimized by selecting the wsm as the mcdm method and the saaty scale as discussed in sections 3 5 and 3 2 respectively the weights of the factors by using the wsm and saaty scale were considered the most appropriate and relatively accurate according to the wsm method by using the saaty scale groundwater withdrawal groundwater availability and groundwater recharge are the three most important factors affecting groundwater stress the complete ranking of the factors affecting groundwater stress is given in table 6 3 7 discussion the results of this study can help the policymakers of water resources and water management to achieve sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation for all especially indicator 6 4 2 which deals with the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources the hierarchical order of the factors affecting the groundwater stress illustrated in table 6 that can help the policymaker to cope with groundwater stress by prioritizing their actions the higher order factors s should be focused on a priority basis for example minimizing groundwater withdrawal should be the first target to mitigate groundwater stress groundwater withdrawal can be minimized by giving some incentives or subsidies to the farmers for shifting from conventional irrigation to high efficiency irrigation systems especially in areas having intense groundwater stress issues the groundwater withdrawal can also be minimized by running social campaigns or adding a chapter in the school book regarding the shortage of water and the importance of saving water to create awareness among the upcoming generation another way to minimize groundwater stress is to maximize groundwater recharge it can be done by identifying artificial recharge sites and developing them for the injection of surplus surface water available in the wet season in the aquifer indirectly the results of this study may also help the policymakers to achieve sdgs 1 no poverty 2 zero hunger 8 decent work and economic growth and 12 responsible consumption and production by mitigating the groundwater stress water can be available in the dry months for irrigation the availability of water for irrigation in the dry months may help to improve agriculture yield which may help to achieve sdg 1 by improving the agriculture yield more food can be produced from the same area of land which can help to minimize the food security issue improving the agriculture yield and handling security issues can provide the pathways to achieve sdg 2 with the help of the improvement in poverty level and food security economic growth and employment generation can be improved which can lead to achieving sdg 8 by minimizing groundwater stress food security can be improved which can support sustainable consumption and production which can help to achieve sdg 12 the mcdm methods have been used to check the achievement of sdgs and the assessment of groundwater resources saqr et al 2021 conducted a comprehensive investigation focusing on the correlation between sdgs and the vulnerability of groundwater over exploitation by utilizing various mcdm methods the study provided a robust framework for understanding and addressing the intricate linkages between sdgs and groundwater management thereby offering valuable insights for policymaking and resource allocation decisions saqr et al 2021 collectively highlighted the versatility and efficacy of mcdm methods in assessing and managing groundwater resources in another investigation conducted by zghibi et al 2020a b the mcdm methods were effectively used to prioritize the various factors influencing groundwater recharge within the korba aquifer located in tunisia it enhanced the understanding of the aquifer s hydrological dynamics and identify the key elements impacting its recharge process furthermore somaratne 2019 employed one of the mcdm methods to estimate groundwater stress specifically employing a rating method that was adapted to suit the context of the study somaratne 2019 also provided insights into the sustainability and management of such resources moreover the mcdm method and scale selection are also multi criteria decision making problems goepel 2019 the selection of a suitable mcdm method and scale is very important to minimize the uncertainty in the results due to mcdm method and scale selection thus the results of this study provide the pathway for the researchers in the selection of suitable scale and mcdm methods for prioritization the variation in weights of factors was significant due to the application of different scales in the same mcdm method moreover the saaty scale and index scale showed the best and second best while the geometric scale showed the worst performance in terms of deviation from the mean among the seven scales under consideration furthermore a significant change was noticed in the cr value due to the application of different scales the index scale and inverse linear scales showed better performance for cr value among the seven different scales considering the results obtained it is recommended to utilize the saaty scale in order to minimize uncertainty effectively to address the consistency problem that may arise in the application of mcdm it is recommended to employ both the index scale and the inverse linear scales the saaty scale proves to be the most effective in reducing uncertainty in weight determination while the index scale is optimal for managing the issue of cr on the other hand the weights of the factors were significantly sensitive to the mcdm methods however topsis showed the highest variation from the mean weights as compared to the other methods and also showed a higher sensitivity to the different scales however ahp fahp and wpm showed almost identical results and showed deviation from the mean more than wsm and less than topsis the wsm showed minimum deviation in the weights from the mean values which indicates less uncertainty in the outcome thus it is recommended to use the wsm to minimize uncertainty in the prioritization the recommendation regarding the mcdm method and scale selection can also be used for prioritizing the factors affecting groundwater recharge groundwater quality groundwater storage etc moreover these recommendations are not only limited to the application of mcdm methods to groundwater resources but also applicable to other fields as well however the main limitation of this study is that the results rely on the judgment of the experts which can be biased based on their technical background and geographical origin 4 conclusion this study was conducted to assign the prioritization order for factors affecting groundwater stress for the policymakers to deal with the groundwater stress issue five different multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods each with seven different scaling systems were used based on the outcome of this study it can be concluded that by applying the different scales in the same mcdm method the ranking order can alter the saaty scale showed the minimum while the geometric scale showed the maximum deviation from the mean moreover among the scales used in this study the index scale showed the best performance with regard to the value of the consistency ratio while the square scale demonstrated the worst performance furthermore the flux in the weights of factors due to the application of different mcdm methods was also significant the weighted sum method wsm showed minimum deviation from the mean as compared to the other methods the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis method had the highest deviation from the mean thus the most suitable mcdm method i e wsm and scale i e saaty scale were considered to minimize the uncertainty due to the application of different scales and mcdm methods based on the results groundwater withdrawal and groundwater availability respectively are the most important and second most important factors affecting groundwater stress it can be recommended to the policymakers of the water resources department to firstly focus on groundwater withdrawal reduction to cope with the groundwater stress issue groundwater availability and groundwater recharge are also important factors affecting groundwater stress it can also be recommended to use the saaty scale and wsm method to reduce uncertainty in the estimation of the weight the index scale is recommended to improve the value of the consistency ratio in the ahp method moreover the role of variation in precipitation and groundwater accessibility is also important in assessing groundwater stress for future studies it is recommended to integrate the role of precipitation and groundwater accessibility in the new groundwater stress index for the comprehensive assessment of groundwater stress funding the authors would like to thank to express their

11624,groundwater stress is a major global issue multiple factors affecting groundwater stress can cause confusion among policymakers to choose the most significant factor in coping with this issue thus this study aimed to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater stress by using five different multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods and seven scales it was found that the uncertainty due to the mcdm method and scale selection was minimum when using weighted sum method wsm and saaty scale for prioritization as compared to the other four mcdm methods and six scales respectively based on wsm and saaty scale it was noticed that groundwater withdrawal and groundwater availability are the two topmost factors affecting groundwater stress the policymakers of water management could be recommended to target the reduction in groundwater withdrawal on a priority basis to cope with the groundwater stress issue better management of groundwater resources and achieve sustainable development goal 6 4 it is also recommended that researchers could use the wsm method and saaty scale to minimize the uncertainty due to the mcdm method and scale selection graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater stress factors prioritization scale mcdm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is one of the main resources which plays a crucial role in development keeping in view the significance of water use the united nations considered water security as one of the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs goal 6 unsdsn 2013 surface water and groundwater make up the two primary categories of freshwater on earth margat and van der gun 2013 thirty percent of the world s freshwater exists underground as groundwater usgs 2018 shiklamonov 1993 globally total groundwater withdrawal was 959 km3 and the rate of withdrawal is increasing by 1 annually the entire volume of groundwater abstraction can be further breakdown into three main categories agricultural domestic and industry groundwater abstraction from agricultural domestic and industrial sectors are 69 22 and 9 respectively unesco 2022 hyper and dry regions where surface water is scarce and dependence on groundwater is greater heavily rely on groundwater supplies to support human activity bhakar and singh 2018 rijsberman 2006 malmir et al 2021 the over exploitation of groundwater is also caused by rapid economic growth and higher living standards which might result in the depletion of groundwater resources foster et al 2013 genxu et al 2005 malmir et al 2022 with the over exploitation of groundwater groundwater quality also degrades haritash et al 2016 the depletion of resources and groundwater quality degradation can lead to groundwater stress water stress deals with the ability of available water resources to meet human and ecological needs it considers other physical features of water resources viz water quantity quality and accessibility already 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress un 2019 schulte and morrison 2014 by 2025 half of the world s population will be living in water stressed areas who 2022 to overcome groundwater stress issues and for sustainable groundwater use multiple solutions are available such as improving the groundwater recharge lowering groundwater withdrawal etc the involvement of multiple factors affecting groundwater stress can cause confusion for policymakers in prioritizing the factors to mitigate groundwater stress effectively to date no study has been conducted to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater stress groundwater resources are not as visible as surface water resources often making their evaluation difficult and uncertain as the situation is more uncertain in the case of groundwater as compared to the surface water for most of the groundwater management decisions multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods are usually applied to support policymaking decisions mcdm is one of the well recognized and non statistical methods to handle the problems of an ambiguous nature hartmann et al 2009 mcdm methods are useful for modeling complex systems with imprecise ambiguous or uncertain data polat 2016 zavadskas et al 2018 the mcdm methods have frequently been applied in decision making for the management of natural resources especially on the groundwater resources for more than two decades zardari et al 2015 furthermore mcdm is also used to address the problem related to the identification of major factors affecting groundwater change li et al 2014 in another study an mcdm method was used to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater recharge in the korba aquifer tunisia zghibi et al 2020a b zghibi et al 2020a b advanced the comprehension of hydrological dynamics within aquifers and identified critical factors influencing the recharge process somaratne 2019 also used one of the mcdm methods to estimate groundwater stress leading to valuable insights for the sustainable utilization and management of groundwater resources saqr et al 2021 studied the link between sdgs and groundwater over exploitation vulnerability by using multiple mcdm methods they emphasized on the broad range of applications and effectiveness of mcdm methods for evaluating and handling groundwater resources and also linked it with sdgs different methods have been developed even within the mcdm framework there is no single mcdm method that is superior to all other decision making methods guitouni and martel 1998 however different mcdm methods can be used for the same problem saqr et al 2021 and different methods can lead to different outcomes for the same problem zardari et al 2015 that is why the selection of an appropriate method to prioritize factors affecting groundwater stress is also very crucial in this study five mcdm methods frequently employed in the field of water resources were considered viz analytic hierarchy process ahp fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp weighted sum method wsm weighted product method wpm and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis zardari et al 2015 emovon and oghenenyerovwho 2020 to perform mcdm a survey needs to be conducted to get the expert opinion the expert opinion is obtained in the form of weights the scale is used in mcdm methods to convert verbal weights into numeric weights harker and vargas 1987 multiple scales such as the saaty scale index scale geometric scale etc are available in the literature the availability of several scales and the lack of clear guidelines for scale selection make the selection procedure more ambiguous goepel 2019 franek and kresta 2014 recommended that the saaty scale 1 9 is a favorable option after the comparison of nine different scales however zhang et al 2009 preferred the index scale over the saaty scale dong et al 2008 recommended that the geometrical scale is more suitable than the saaty scale and the ma zheng scale also known as the inverse linear scale in the ahp method different studies have provided different recommendations for scale selection in mcdm methods goepel 2019 the selection of an inappropriate scale may result in uncertain outcomes franek and kresta 2014 which makes it more difficult for the practitioner to select the suitable scale applied to mcdm methods thus this study used seven different scales i e saaty index square inverse geometric inverse linear and logarithmic in multiple mcdm methods rather than just relying on a single one to minimize the uncertainty in the final outcomes one suitable scale and mcdm method were identified by applying statistical techniques the findings of this study can guide practitioners in selecting an appropriate mcdm method and scale thus the main objectives of this work can be summarized as to identify a suitable mcdm method and scale to prioritize factors affecting groundwater stress based on a suitable mcdm method and scale moreover this research intended to answer the question what is the prioritization order of groundwater factors affecting groundwater stress this work was carried out to help the policymakers to prioritize the factors affecting groundwater stress to cope with the groundwater stress and achieve sdg 6 clean water and sanitation for all especially indicator 6 4 2 level of water stress of sdg 6 this work used multiple mcdm methods and scales to identify the suitable method and scale to reduce the uncertainty in the outcome 2 methodology the methodology of this study can be divided into three phases viz identification of main factors affecting groundwater stress applying the different mcdm methods and scales to prioritize the main influencing factors and minimizing the uncertainty by identifying the most appropriate mcdm method and scale 2 1 identification of the main factor affecting groundwater stress the factors affecting groundwater stress were identified through a literature review this study used the review of groundwater stress indices done by akbar et al 2022 to identify the factors affecting groundwater stress eight factors that are normally used in groundwater stress indices to estimate groundwater stress are listed in table 1 these eight factors were prioritized by using different mcdm methods as explained in the next section 2 2 multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods are most commonly used for prioritization of concerning factors indicators methods etc multiple mcdm methods are available and one method cannot be prioritized over another vassoney et al 2021 the choice among existing mcdm methods can be considered a multi criteria challenge each method possesses its own set of advantages and disadvantages making it impossible to assert that any single method is inherently superior to the rest for every case stojčić et al 2019 wątróbski et al 2019 moreover the prioritization of different alternatives may vary with the use of different methods leading to different decisions zardari et al 2015 therefore this study used five mcdm methods along with seven different types of scales to estimate the prioritization of factors affecting groundwater stress then one suitable mcdm method and one scale among five mcdm methods and seven scales were identified to minimize the uncertainty in the prioritization due to the method and scale selection the ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis methods were employed for prioritization a brief summary of the five different mcdm methods is given in table 2 the first step to apply the mcdm method is the collection of expert opinions the expert opinions were taken from the policymakers related to water resources a researcher from academia having expertise in hydrology and professionals working as a hydrologist in different organizations from different countries across the globe mentioned in the acknowledgment all the expert opinions were obtained in 2022 in a qualitative form during the survey it was asked to the respondent to give a level of importance of one factor over another corresponding to the groundwater stress for example the groundwater recharge and groundwater withdrawal are equally important if both contribute equally to groundwater stress etc the details of the level of importance are given in table 3 moreover to avoid uncertainty due to local or regional perceptions or judgments by the experts thirty three expert judgments were taken from six different countries in different regions of the world usa germany england china pakistan and thailand the second step was to convert the qualitative opinions into quantitative by using numeric scales multiple scales have been used in mcdm methods without explaining the reason for scale selection the selection of a suitable scale is very important because different scales can give different outcomes which can cause uncertainty franek and kresta 2014 harker and vargas 1987 for example harker and vargas 1987 applied five scales to solve a problem the saaty scale 1 9 developed by saaty 1980 was found to be a better option among the five scales however zhang et al 2009 compared the saaty scale with the index scale and they preferred the index scale over the saaty scale it is because the index scale has a sounder theoretical basis as compared to the saaty scale zhang et al 2009 there is no clear framework for scale selection in the mcdm method therefore this study used seven different scales in five different mcdm methods the details of each scale are given in table 3 moreover all the seven scales mentioned above were used in the form of a triangular fuzzy scale as well for the application of fahp a triangular fuzzy scale is considered better than conventional scales to minimize the uncertainty during the collection of expert opinions božanić et al 2015 the conversion of the saaty scale into the triangular fuzzy scale is given in table 4 all other scales were also converted into the triangular fuzzy scale in a similar fashion the third step is to construct a pairwise comparison matrix a based on the expert judgments as shown in equation 1 each diagonal value in the matrix should be equal to 1 additionally the multiplication of any element aij in a row i and column j by another element aji should be equal to 1 and this step is common in all mcdm methods 1 a a 11 a 1 n a n 1 a n n after the construction of the pairwise comparison matrix the next steps are different in the different methods furthermore to perform mcdm five different methods ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis were used these five methods are among the most commonly used in the literature triantaphyllou 2000 zardari et al 2015 ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis were explained comprehensively by saqr et al 2021 srdjevic and medeiros 2008 hajkowicz and higgins 2008 aminudin et al 2018 and hanine et al 2016 respectively in the last step of ahp there is a need to check the consistency ratio cr to assess the level of consistency of a matrix matrix a is considered to be sufficiently consistent if the cr of a decision matrix is below 0 1 baliatsas et al 2016 wijitkosum 2018 the cr is the ratio of the consistency index ci of a given evaluation matrix and the consistency of a random index ri as shown in equation 2 do and chen 2014 the ci can be calculated as shown in equation 3 this study also analyzed the effect of different scales on the value of the cr 2 c r c i r i 3 c i λ max n n 1 where λ max is the largest eigenvalue of matrix a and n represent the matrix size the ri of the matrices of order 1 10 is shown in table 5 2 3 selection of suitable mcdm method and scale to obtain final weights as mentioned above in each mcdm method seven different scales were used in this way thirty five sets of weights were obtained then the weights were aggregated i e weights obtained within ahp using the seven scales were aggregated to get the average weights for the ahp method used in this study the same approach was repeated for the fahp wsm wpm and topsis methods to obtain weights in the same fashion the aggregated weights were obtained to estimate the variations in the weights due to the different scales and then one suitable scale was identified to minimize the uncertainty the weights were aggregated i e weights of factors were obtained by using ahp fahp wsm wpm and topsis methods with the help of only the saaty scale were aggregated to obtain the average weights for the saaty scale used in this study in the same way the aggregated weights were obtained for the six other scales used in this study in the same way weights were aggregated for each scale in the last step the deviation from the mean was calculated by using all aggregated weights for each scale the scale which showed minimum deviation from the mean was considered the most suitable similar to the scales five different outcomes were obtained for each mcdm method and then aggregated after the aggregation deviation from the mean is calculated the mcdm method which showed minimum deviation from the mean was considered the most suitable the most suitable mcdm method and scale were used to obtain weights to minimize the uncertainty in the weights due to the different methods and scales the complete framework of the methodology is shown in fig 1 the f test was applied to assess the significance of the disparity between the aggregated weights and individual weights of each mcdm method the f tests can be used to check the significance of the disparity between groups is significant or not kissell and poserina 2017 a 95 level of significance p 0 05 was utilized for significance testing in this study 3 results and discussion the factors which influence groundwater stress were prioritized by applying multiple scales and methods multiple mcdm methods and scales were used to check the variations in the weights and to minimize uncertainty in factors due to model uncertainty this section can be divided further into two parts the first section deals with the assessment of the variations in the weights due to the different methods and scales the second part is related to the prioritization of factors by using the most suitable mcdm method and scale 3 1 variation in weights of factors by using different scales and methods five different mcdm methods and seven different scales were used in this study and the variation in the results was assessed fig 2 a shows the weights of the factors corresponding to the ahp method and seven different scales slight variations were observed in the ranking order especially in the fourth fifth and sixth ranked factors in the case of inverse linear and logarithmic scales as compared to the use of the other five scales within the ahp method the factors ranking order based on the fahp and seven different scales also showed similar results as ahp except for the ranking order of water table level and groundwater contribution to the environmental flow which was inverted the prioritization order of the wsm with the help of seven different scales was also determined the wsm showed comparatively higher variations in the ranking order as compared to the other mcdm methods and scales used in this study in wsm the inverse linear and logarithmic scales showed groundwater recharge at second place in the prioritization order however groundwater availability ranked second instead of groundwater recharge based on the other scales used in this study within wsm moreover the variations in the fourth fifth and sixth ranking order were also different as compared to the other mcdm methods used in this study as shown in fig 2 c the ranking order of the factors affecting groundwater stress was determined by using wpm as well which showed very similar results to the ahp the variations in the ranking order based on the different scales within the wpm are shown in fig 2 d similarly the topsis method was used to establish the prioritization order of factors affecting groundwater stress the topsis showed the highest variations in the ranking order as compared to the other mcdm methods used in this study as shown in fig 2 e the variations in the weights of the factors were significant due to the use of different mcdm methods as well as different scales overall all five methods showed agreement for the first second and third most important factors affecting groundwater stress however the remaining five factors showed significant variation in the weights depending on mcdm methods the topsis method showed the maximum deviation in the weights as compared to the other mcdm methods moreover the higher deviation in the weights of the factors from the average weights was noticed due to the logarithmic inverse and inverse linear scales as compared to the other scales within the same mcdm method the topsis method showed the highest sensitivity for the different scales based on the results it can be summarized that both different methods and scales were almost equally contributing to the variation in the weights moreover topsis showed the maximum variation among mcdm methods on the hand logarithmic inverse and inverse linear scales exhibited higher variation as compared to the other scales used in this study 3 2 minimizing the uncertainty by selecting the suitable scale the selection of different scales also plays a vital role in the accurate assessment of the weights in the application of mcdm the deviation of the weights from the mean value due to the use of different scales in mcdm is shown in fig 3 it was observed that the saaty scale showed the minimum deviation of seven percent from the mean value and the geometric scale showed the maximum deviation the index scale is second best showing an 11 percent deviation from the mean moreover the logarithmic inverse inverse linear square and geometric scales showed 22 27 28 37 and 40 percent deviation from the mean respectively based on these findings it can be recommended that the saaty scale provides a more accurate outcome as compared to the other scales considered in this study based on the f test it was found the weights obtained by the geometric scale showed the most significant variability p value 0 011 as compared to the aggregated weights however the weights obtained by saaty scale showed the least significant variability p value 0 473 it shows that the saaty scale is more suitable than the other scales considered in this study 3 3 effect of scales on consistency ratio the consistency ratio was also found sensitive to the scale selection a massive change was noticed in the value of the cr due to the different scales the cr should be less than 0 1 as shown in fig 2 with the red horizontal line the cr of more than the permissible limit shows that the decision matrix is not consistent square and geometric scales showed a cr more than the threshold the threshold value of cr corresponding to the geometric scale was slightly higher than the acceptable limit the cr was 0 28 and 0 11 for the square and geometric scales respectively while other scales showed a cr within the threshold limit index scale and inverse linear scales showed better performance regarding the threshold value of cr as represented in fig 4 3 4 weights of factors by using different mcdm methods this section expresses the weights of the factors that were combined across various scales within each mcdm method to derive the mean weights for each method based on the aggregated results an agreement was noticed among all five mcdm methods regarding the first second and third most important parameters according to each method it was noticed that groundwater withdrawal groundwater availability and groundwater recharge are first second and third in priority respectively however a significant change in the weights of the lower order factors was noticed groundwater quality accessibility to groundwater precipitation groundwater contribution to the environmental flow and water table level were the factors that were prioritized differently in different mcdm methods for example groundwater quality the role of variation in precipitation and groundwater accessibility are at fourth fifth and sixth ranks respectively based on the ahp and fahp methods as shown in fig 5 a and b however the role of precipitation moved up from the sixth rank to the fourth however the groundwater quality moved down from the fourth to sixth rank the ranking of the factors based on the wsm is shown in fig 5 c the wpm showed prioritization similar to the ahp and fahp the ranking order based on the wpm is shown in fig 5 d but the topsis showed a significant variation in the prioritization of the factors especially the middle and lower order factors as compared to the all other methods used according to the topsis method groundwater quality groundwater contribution to the environment accessibility to the groundwater and water table level were at fourth fifth sixth and seventh ranks respectively as shown in fig 5 e it shows that the outcome of the topsis is very different as compared to the other methods used in this study based on the f test it was found the weights obtained by the topsis method showed the most significant variability p value 0 0152 as compared to the aggregated weights however the weights obtained by wsm showed the least significant variability p value 0 464 compared to the mean value it shows that the wsm method gives the value closest to the mean 3 5 minimizing the uncertainty by selecting the suitable mcdm method different mcdm methods showed variations in the outcome as discussed in section 3 4 which is why the deviation from the mean of weights of factors was analyzed according to the results of this study the wsm method showed better performance in terms of deviation from aggregated values of the weights as compared to the other methods the wsm method showed an eight percent deviation from the mean whereas ahp wpm fahp and topsis showed 12 15 15 and 42 percent deviation from the mean thus topsis showed the maximum deviation from aggregated values of the weights as shown in fig 6 based on these findings it can be recommended that the wsm method provides more accurate results as compared to the other four methods 3 6 minimizing the uncertainty by selecting the suitable scale and mcdm method the variation in weights of the factors due to different mcdm methods and scales was minimized by selecting the wsm as the mcdm method and the saaty scale as discussed in sections 3 5 and 3 2 respectively the weights of the factors by using the wsm and saaty scale were considered the most appropriate and relatively accurate according to the wsm method by using the saaty scale groundwater withdrawal groundwater availability and groundwater recharge are the three most important factors affecting groundwater stress the complete ranking of the factors affecting groundwater stress is given in table 6 3 7 discussion the results of this study can help the policymakers of water resources and water management to achieve sustainable development goal 6 clean water and sanitation for all especially indicator 6 4 2 which deals with the level of water stress freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources the hierarchical order of the factors affecting the groundwater stress illustrated in table 6 that can help the policymaker to cope with groundwater stress by prioritizing their actions the higher order factors s should be focused on a priority basis for example minimizing groundwater withdrawal should be the first target to mitigate groundwater stress groundwater withdrawal can be minimized by giving some incentives or subsidies to the farmers for shifting from conventional irrigation to high efficiency irrigation systems especially in areas having intense groundwater stress issues the groundwater withdrawal can also be minimized by running social campaigns or adding a chapter in the school book regarding the shortage of water and the importance of saving water to create awareness among the upcoming generation another way to minimize groundwater stress is to maximize groundwater recharge it can be done by identifying artificial recharge sites and developing them for the injection of surplus surface water available in the wet season in the aquifer indirectly the results of this study may also help the policymakers to achieve sdgs 1 no poverty 2 zero hunger 8 decent work and economic growth and 12 responsible consumption and production by mitigating the groundwater stress water can be available in the dry months for irrigation the availability of water for irrigation in the dry months may help to improve agriculture yield which may help to achieve sdg 1 by improving the agriculture yield more food can be produced from the same area of land which can help to minimize the food security issue improving the agriculture yield and handling security issues can provide the pathways to achieve sdg 2 with the help of the improvement in poverty level and food security economic growth and employment generation can be improved which can lead to achieving sdg 8 by minimizing groundwater stress food security can be improved which can support sustainable consumption and production which can help to achieve sdg 12 the mcdm methods have been used to check the achievement of sdgs and the assessment of groundwater resources saqr et al 2021 conducted a comprehensive investigation focusing on the correlation between sdgs and the vulnerability of groundwater over exploitation by utilizing various mcdm methods the study provided a robust framework for understanding and addressing the intricate linkages between sdgs and groundwater management thereby offering valuable insights for policymaking and resource allocation decisions saqr et al 2021 collectively highlighted the versatility and efficacy of mcdm methods in assessing and managing groundwater resources in another investigation conducted by zghibi et al 2020a b the mcdm methods were effectively used to prioritize the various factors influencing groundwater recharge within the korba aquifer located in tunisia it enhanced the understanding of the aquifer s hydrological dynamics and identify the key elements impacting its recharge process furthermore somaratne 2019 employed one of the mcdm methods to estimate groundwater stress specifically employing a rating method that was adapted to suit the context of the study somaratne 2019 also provided insights into the sustainability and management of such resources moreover the mcdm method and scale selection are also multi criteria decision making problems goepel 2019 the selection of a suitable mcdm method and scale is very important to minimize the uncertainty in the results due to mcdm method and scale selection thus the results of this study provide the pathway for the researchers in the selection of suitable scale and mcdm methods for prioritization the variation in weights of factors was significant due to the application of different scales in the same mcdm method moreover the saaty scale and index scale showed the best and second best while the geometric scale showed the worst performance in terms of deviation from the mean among the seven scales under consideration furthermore a significant change was noticed in the cr value due to the application of different scales the index scale and inverse linear scales showed better performance for cr value among the seven different scales considering the results obtained it is recommended to utilize the saaty scale in order to minimize uncertainty effectively to address the consistency problem that may arise in the application of mcdm it is recommended to employ both the index scale and the inverse linear scales the saaty scale proves to be the most effective in reducing uncertainty in weight determination while the index scale is optimal for managing the issue of cr on the other hand the weights of the factors were significantly sensitive to the mcdm methods however topsis showed the highest variation from the mean weights as compared to the other methods and also showed a higher sensitivity to the different scales however ahp fahp and wpm showed almost identical results and showed deviation from the mean more than wsm and less than topsis the wsm showed minimum deviation in the weights from the mean values which indicates less uncertainty in the outcome thus it is recommended to use the wsm to minimize uncertainty in the prioritization the recommendation regarding the mcdm method and scale selection can also be used for prioritizing the factors affecting groundwater recharge groundwater quality groundwater storage etc moreover these recommendations are not only limited to the application of mcdm methods to groundwater resources but also applicable to other fields as well however the main limitation of this study is that the results rely on the judgment of the experts which can be biased based on their technical background and geographical origin 4 conclusion this study was conducted to assign the prioritization order for factors affecting groundwater stress for the policymakers to deal with the groundwater stress issue five different multiple criteria decision making mcdm methods each with seven different scaling systems were used based on the outcome of this study it can be concluded that by applying the different scales in the same mcdm method the ranking order can alter the saaty scale showed the minimum while the geometric scale showed the maximum deviation from the mean moreover among the scales used in this study the index scale showed the best performance with regard to the value of the consistency ratio while the square scale demonstrated the worst performance furthermore the flux in the weights of factors due to the application of different mcdm methods was also significant the weighted sum method wsm showed minimum deviation from the mean as compared to the other methods the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis method had the highest deviation from the mean thus the most suitable mcdm method i e wsm and scale i e saaty scale were considered to minimize the uncertainty due to the application of different scales and mcdm methods based on the results groundwater withdrawal and groundwater availability respectively are the most important and second most important factors affecting groundwater stress it can be recommended to the policymakers of the water resources department to firstly focus on groundwater withdrawal reduction to cope with the groundwater stress issue groundwater availability and groundwater recharge are also important factors affecting groundwater stress it can also be recommended to use the saaty scale and wsm method to reduce uncertainty in the estimation of the weight the index scale is recommended to improve the value of the consistency ratio in the ahp method moreover the role of variation in precipitation and groundwater accessibility is also important in assessing groundwater stress for future studies it is recommended to integrate the role of precipitation and groundwater accessibility in the new groundwater stress index for the comprehensive assessment of groundwater stress funding the authors would like to thank to express their
