25350,a methodology based on emergy analysis for the calculation of the biophysical value of the stocked biomass natural capital was applied to the marine protected areas mpas of portofino pf and cinque terre ct the resources exploited on a yearly base to maintain the natural capital itself alive environmental flows were accounted too emergy analysis is an accounting method useful to identify and convert in a single unit of measure all resources feeding a system this allows the implementation of a system overall assessment and then the conversion of the obtained value in money terms the studied mpas are located in the northwestern part of italy are both tourism oriented and subdivided in zones with different protection degree the habitats occupying both the mpas bottoms have been identified together with the biomass stored on their surface identifying units named fbha fishes and benthos habitat assemblage the calculation of biomass stocked in the benthic organisms and in the fishes associated to each fbha represents the basis for the assessment of mpa natural capital value and of environmental flows from these values the trophic network of each habitat was modeled allowing calculating the inputs to emergy analysis the value of pf natural capital expressed as resources employed through space and time to store the existing biomass is equal to over 10 million euros while the ct natural capital amounts to over 30 million the high value habitats where biomass is concentrated and stored represent hot spots that are restricted in a limited surface and that can be maintained only if the resources they need are provided by adjacent lower value habitats through the applied methodology a balance is performed to understand if an mpa is self sufficient or dependent on external areas therefore if an mpa is correctly planned as ct is the wider low value areas are able to provide resources to the deficit fbhas and even to export resources to other systems in this case the mpa lies in a surplus condition on the contrary the mpa is not able to maintain itself and depends on external systems not subjected to protection and then potentially posed at risk if information about natural capital flows and balance is synthesized in a geographical information system it represents an effective tool to mpas managers to measure the efficacy of protection

benefits such as high productivity beaumont et al 2007 moberg and folke 1999 townsend et al 2011 commercial and not commercial fisheries muntadas et al 2015 and sink and stabilization of sediments duarte et al 2005 ohde and van woesik 1999 orth et al 2006 however the intense urban industrial and tourist development in coastal areas coupled with a scarce sensitivity about the link between ecosystem health and human well being is threatening marine ecosystems worldwide unep 2006 the consequences of anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems are proved by the dramatic extent loss of habitats such as mangroves coral reefs and seagrass meadows ferreira et al 2017 fortes 1988 ilman et al 2016 montefalcone et al 2015 parravicini et al 2013 pauly et al 1998 short and wyllie echeverria 1996 waycott et al 2009 in this background the marine protected areas mpas have become one of the most important marine ecosystem management and conservation strategies campbell and hewitt 2006 aiming to halt or reverse the ecosystem s degradation conserving the biodiversity and maintaining or enhancing living resources nrc 2001 pita et al 2011 mpas proper design together with the monitoring of the achievement of conservation goals are crucial to effectively protect the ecosystems and to generate benefits which can positively impact on local and regional economies angulo valdes and hatcher 2010 badalamenti et al 2000 boncoeur et al 2002 hoskin et al 2011 sanchirico et al 2002 to avoid the so called paper parks lindenmayer and likens 2010 it is urgent to provide management tools able to assess the mpas efficacy the capacity of ecosystems to produce benefits lays on the maintenance of the natural capital defined as the stock of natural resources supporting ecosystem goods and services costanza and daly 1992 therefore any kind of effective ecosystem management will lay on a correct natural capital evaluation de groot et al 2002 2012 in this context the emergy accounting odum 1996 represents a fundamental tool to synthesize the ecological complexity and to ascribe a value to the natural capital as it quantifies the work of biosphere in terms of direct and indirect solar energy embodied in generating natural resources accordingly emergy provides a measure of natural capital value in terms of biophysical resources consumption required to support the generation the extraction and the fruition of goods and services franzese et al 2015 paoli et al 2016a recently emergy as tool for natural capital and ecosystem services valuation has been applied in specific study cases campbell and hewitt 2006 campbell and brown 2012 vassallo et al 2013 berrios et al 2017 franzese et al 2017 the evaluation of mpas natural capital requires taking into account that a mpa contains a variety of habitats providing different types and amounts of ecosystem services subjected to different pressures and responding differently to the stresses this habitats heterogeneity makes fundamental to know the location of each habitat to assess adequate conservation targets and manage human pressures consequently the seabed habitat mapping has become an effective tool not only to implement mpas decisions but also to synthesize spatial information essential for the monitoring and further management of the mpas cogan et al 2009 ehler and douvere 2009 this research therefore aims at estimating the value of the natural capital within two different mpas estimating the value of environmental annual flows that maintain natural capital highlighting differences in terms of value among different habitats and the associated biocenosis that compose mpas providing an mpa management tool based on biophysical measures and monetary evaluation of natural stocks and fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the methodology described by vassallo et al 2017 was applied to the portofino mpa and the cinque terre mpa liguria region nw italy respectively pf and ct hereinafter fig 1 the pf mpa was established in 1999 and occupies a total surface of 363ha while the ct mpa was instituted in 1997 and occupies a surface of 4865ha pf is distant 69km from ct the pf mpa s borders include the totality of portofino municipality coast and a fraction of santa margherita ligure coast and camogli coast fig 1 ct mpa involves the coast of four municipalities including five villages that from east to west are riomaggiore manarola part of riomaggiore municipality corniglia part of vernazza municipality vernazza monterosso al mare and partly levanto fig 1 both mpas are tourism oriented areas widely recognized for their high natural value worldwide known for their emerged and submerged landscape as well as for the rich biodiversity they host with endemisms and endangered species the mpas contain areas protected within the framework of the so called habitats directive hsd 92 43 eec eec 1992 sci it1332674 fondali monte di portofino it1344270 fondali punta mesco riomaggiore the habitat directive is a european community legislative instrument in the field of nature conservation that establishes a common framework for the conservation of wild animal and plant species and natural habitats of community importance both mpas include the endemic posidonia oceanica habitat and the biogenic formation named coralligenous designated as mediterranean priority habitats by the directive moreover since 2005 the pf mpa created within a national ministry decree in 1999 is a spami specially protected area of mediterranean interest according to the decision of the rac spa regional activity centre for specially protected areas office http www rac spa org unep 2005 within the mpas many activities such as diving fishing and recreational boating are regulated cattaneo vietti et al 2015 with different protection levels from more severe in the a zone to less severe in the c zone table 1 since in pf the c zone is physically split in two subareas separated by the a and the b zones the c east ce and the c west cw zones have been considered within this study analogously in ct the a and the b zones are separated in the eastern and the western part hereinafter named ae and aw and be and bw respectively despite the protection regimes tourism oriented activities are very common and pressure on local environment can be very high in pf the recreational boating reaches the maximum in august with about 200 units per days and the diving activities count more than 30 000 annual dives venturini et al 2016 in ct the recreational boating pressure can reach maximum values in august equal to over 80 units per days and over 2700 annual dives conidi 2010 the pressure from bathing users is exerted only in some segments of the mpas since a large part of the mpas coastline is occupied by rocky and steep tracts not accessible in pf the available surface for bathing users is equal to 9162m2 frequented by a precautionary estimate of over 100 000 users per summer the ct s available space for bathing users is around 42 800m2 mainly located in monterosso 93 and frequented by a raw and precautionary estimate of around 500 000 users per summer 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 the emergy accounting method emergy is an environmental accounting method based on thermodynamics introduced in the 80s by howard odum emergy is a technique of quantitative analysis converting the amounts of resources with and without an economic value services and commodities in a sole common unit brown and herendeen 1996 this makes emergy a very versatile technique that can be applied to both natural and human dominated ecosystems in particular the free environmental inputs e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flows to a system are taken into account as well as the human driven flows all inputs are accounted together with indirect environmental support embodied in human labour and services brown and ulgiati 2004 the emergy theory is defined by two key concepts the solar emergy and the solar transformity the solar emergy is defined by the quantity of solar energy required directly or not to provide a given flow or storage of energy or matter odum 1996 the emergy is expressed in solar emergy joule sej and it is usually calculated on an annual scale the solar transformity measures the input of emergy per unit output and it is calculated as the ratio of the emergy necessary to produce a flow or storage to the actual energy of that flow or storage ulgiati and brown 2002 the transformity is expressed in solar emergy joule per joule of output flow sejj 1 for certain products or flows easily quantifiable in units of mass or money a conversion value expressed in sejg 1 or sej 1 can be used odum 1996 these coefficients are respectively named specific emergy and emergy per unit money the solar transformity the specific emergy and the emergy per unit money can be gathered under the term unit emergy value uev hereinafter paoli et al 2013 from the inventory of the resources feeding the analyzed system an emergy table is built where all inputs raw data expressed with different units of measure are translated in emergy equivalents through the use of uevs the sum of emergy values provides an estimate of total resources amount required by the eco system and it represents a biophysical estimate of the cost that nature invests to generate all the resources exploited vassallo et al 2017 moreover emergy allows translating the biophysical measures of natural capital in monetary equivalents facilitating the inclusion of natural capital value in environmental management decisions the monetary units are calculated through a ratio named emergy money ratio an index that links emergy to economy and that is calculated as ratio of the total emergy flow to a nation to its gross domestic product it is expressed in sejcurrency 1 sej 1 in our case and it represents the emergy purchasing power since it values how much emergy corresponds on average to one unit of money produced by the national economy odum 1996 2 2 2 emergy accounting of natural systems in marine protected areas the emergy accounting for mpas claims for specific calculation procedures that have been described by vassallo et al 2017 the methodology is a biophysical accounting model of the mpas benthic system it is based on the trophodynamic and on the calculation of primary production that maintains a considered marine system and it allows the calculation of both stocked natural capital and environmental flows supporting its maintenance in particular natural capital is assessed as the resources required through space and time to allow the generation of the stock of biomass within the mpa environmental flows are the resources generated and consumed by the mpa annually instead the assessment of this primary production requires the accurate accounting of input resources the applied calculation is then based on the donor side perspective of the emergy method through which the value is associated to the environmental cost required to generate natural capital stocks therefore the greater is the investment of nature in the generation of the capital the greater its value in particular at first a trophodynamic analysis is needed to assess the primary production used to build up and maintain natural capital stocks furthermore it is necessary to assess the area on which the primary production was generated supporting area hereinafter input flows of resources associated to this area i e nutrients and other natural flows such as sun or rain that generated and maintained natural capital stocks through time are then calculated here below it is reported a brief summary of the procedure while deeper details are reported in vassallo et al 2017 the model for the natural capital assessment is articulated in three main steps 1 trophodynamic analysis providing an estimate of the primary productivity used to support the benthic trophic web within the study area 2 biophysical accounting providing an estimate of the biophysical value of natural capital and environmental flows by means of emergy accounting 3 monetary conversion expressing the biophysical value of natural capital and environmental flows into monetary units 2 2 3 data collection and tropho dynamic analysis the assessment of natural capital is based on the identification of the main benthic habitats included within the boundaries of the mpas their surface is assessed through the analysis of the bionomic maps of mpa afterwards the main taxonomic groups e g fish molluscs algae microphytobenthos among others included in each habitat are identified and a database of biomass per unit area for each group is created vassallo et al 2017 in the specific case the atlas of marine habitats diviacco and coppo 2006 was chosen in particular the 2012 updated version of the atlas integrated with new data obtained through surveys realized from 2006 to 2012 and provided by regional authority was taken into consideration being the most recent and complete cartography about habitats distribution in liguria according to the last guidelines of the italian military geographic institute imgi istituto geografico militare 2014 https www igmi org en the national cartographic authority producing the official state cartography the official italian spatial reference system srs to be adopted for cartography is etrs89 or rdn2008 cima et al 2014 the maps provided by the mpas were produced with dissimilar srs thus were re projected in a common srs etrs89 was chosen being the more widespread and implemented in all geographic information system software in a consolidated manner etr89 utm32 epsg 25832 to minimize the re projection errors we used the igm official tools verto online http www igmi org vol conversion php to convert all the maps correctly and get to final maps and data directly comparable the biomasses stocked in the two mpas have been retrieved from the literature agostini et al 2003 albertelli et al 1978 albertelli et al 1981a 1981b albertelli and d ambrosio 1986 albertelli and rossi 1986 antoniadou et al 2005 ballesteros 2006

sanchez lisazo 1993 sánchez jerez et al 1999 true 1970 willsie 1983 or from field samplings when only the benthos abundances were available the associated biomass was calculated using individual weights from goren 1980 and brey 1990 the communities of demersal fishes associated to each habitat were identified by direct or previous samplings for the two considered mpas only visual census data were used the visual census is a widely adopted technique for the study of the littoral fish communities particularly in protected habitats such as the mpas are due to its minimal impact harmelin vivien et al 1985 guidetti 2002 azzurro et al 2007 in mpas the visual census studies are frequently performed to assess the efficacy of protection strategies in terms of increase in density and size of fishes guidetti et al 2008 in italy visual census campaigns have been performed in the mpas within the afrodite programme a programme lasting three years 2001 2004 encompassing a number of coordinated activities and aimed at the creation of a mpas national system greco et al 2004 nowadays the italian mpas perform yearly the visual census campaigns as standard monitoring method the utilization of the visual census data allows then the access to historical and recent information and it makes the evaluations comparable since original data are collected with the same protocol in particular for pf data from guidetti et al 2011 were considered while for ct data collected within the medpan north project were used http www medpan org en mnp the biomass is then obtained through length weight relationships froese 1998 www fishbase com the biomass data of each fishes and benthos habitat assemblage fbha hereinafter is the basic information needed for the calculation of primary productivity required to generate and support the natural capital stocks primary biomass the assessment of the natural capital foresees the evaluation of the autotrophic and heterotrophic stocks in the mpa s fbhas the total autotrophic biomass density ba gcm 2 of each fbha is calculated as the sum of the biomass of all the primary producers the biomass of heterotrophic groups b gcm 2 is converted into the primary biomass required for its formation according to the following equation derived from pauly and christensen 1995 1 bei bi 7 tli 1 i 1 2 3 n where bei is the autotrophic biomass supporting the i th heterotrophic group bi is the biomass and tli is the trophic level of the i th group the total primary biomass required to support the formation of all the heterotrophic groups in each habitat is then obtained as sum of all bei once ba and be are obtained the trophic levels are calculated by means of simulation of the trophic web paoli et al 2016b or found in literature for fishes www fishbase com the environmental flows assessment aimed at the estimate of the fluxes of natural resources that annually support natural capital is also based on the biomass matrix of considered taxonomic groups previously used for natural capital assessment data on primary biomass density for each autotrophic group are converted to annual primary production pa density by using appropriate p b ratios cattaneo vietti et al 2015 similarly the annual consumption by the heterotrophic group ci is calculated through the identification of appropriate q b ratios ait alla et al 2006 ambrogi 1990 bănaru et al 2013 bayle sempere et al 2013 christensen and pauly 1993 coll et al 2006a 2006b 2007 2008 2009 corrales et al 2015 daas et al 2011 de souzal and borzone 2007 diaz lopez et al 2008 gillet 1993 heymans et al 2009 hotchkiss 2007 lassalle et al 2011 lercari et al 2007 liu et al 2009 ménard et al 1989 okey et al 2004a 2004b opitz 1996 ortiz et al 2013 kroon et al 1993 palomares et al 2005 pedersen et al 2008 pinnegar and polunin 2004 pinkerton et al 2008 piroddi et al 2010 prado et al 2013 rouhi et al 2008 selleslagh et al 2012 tecchio et al 2013 torres et al 2013 vetter 1996 wolff and wolff 1977 and the application of eq 1 once the productivity needed to maintain the biomass stocks in the habitats is assessed the area where this productivity is generated supporting area is estimated this is based on a balance between the annual primary production pa and the consumption pe in each habitat and for the whole mpa to recognize a if each habitat is capable to generate the amount of primary biomass necessary to support its internal consumption and b if the whole mpa is self sufficient two cases are possible when pa pe the fbha sustains its internal consumption and even a surplus of primary production is exported to other habitats internal or external to the mpa as a consequence the supporting area of the habitat is considered smaller than its physical area when pa pe the fbha does not sustain its internal consumption and it requires additional primary production this additional contribution is imported from out the fbha and the supporting area of the habitat is considered larger than its physical area furthermore once the annual consumed carbon flow is calculated the annual flows of nutrients n and p assimilated in organic matter are estimated 2 2 4 biophysical accounting from previous calculations the total primary biomass btot expressed in carbon units is obtained as sum of ba and be and in turn the nitrogen and the phosphorous fixed in the primary biomass are assessed the natural flows solar radiation wind rain geothermal flow currents tides and runoff that support the biomass production in the mpa are calculated according to odum 1996 and accounted for the time of stocks formation table 2 the time of stocks formation is calculated as primary biomass be divided by the average productivity of the surrounding benthic systems here the average rate of 650gcm 2 y 1 provided by charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 has been employed all the inputs i e nutrients and natural flows are then converted into emergy units by using specific uevs odum 1996 the used uev are reported in table 3 according to the emergy algebra only the maximum among co products is chosen and included in the sum to avoid double counting in particular the nutrients are considered as a different set of co products and then compared with sun rain wind and current representing another co product set being these two groups generated on a different spatial and temporal scale according to literature tides geothermal heat and runoff are considered as split since they are generated by different processes at global scale brown et al 1991 campbell et al 2005 the emergy inputs are summed to assess the emergy density value of the natural capital for the different habitats sejm 2 these values are multiplied by the areas of the habitats to estimate the total value of the natural capital stock for each fbha sej finally the total emergy value of the natural capital is calculated as the sum of all fbhas natural capital values within the mpa in the environmental flow assessment the natural flows solar radiation wind kinetic energy rain geopotential flow geothermal flow currents tides and runoff supporting the annual biomass production in each fbha are estimated in relation to calculated supporting areas vassallo et al 2017 and according to formulas reported in table 2 as for the natural capital assessment the nutrients and the natural flows are converted into emergy units and then they are summed according to the emergy algebra to assess the total annual emergy flow sejyr 1 that maintains the natural capital in each fbha and in the whole mpa 2 2 5 monetary conversion when the emergy amount of the natural capital and the environmental flows are calculated the corresponding economic value is obtained applying the so called emergy to money ratio emr the emr is calculated as ratio of the emergy flow to a nation to its gross domestic product it is expressed in sejcurrency 1 sej 1 in our case and represents the emergy purchasing power since it values how much emergy corresponds on average to one unit of money produced by the national economy odum 1996 the ratio between the emergy amount and the emr gives an estimate of the economic value of the natural capital stocked in each fbha of the mpa and as sum of the entire mpa analogously the economic value of the flows can be calculated here the 9 60e 11 sej ratio is employed pereira et al 2013 monetary equivalents of biophysical values are expressed in emergy euros em currently a debate on the use of the emr has arisen among emergy scientists about the merging of biophysical and economic values campbell and tilley 2014 here the em value is used to allow an easier understanding of the ecological value of natural capital in decision making processes however this operation does not change the biophysical feature of the proposed method but instead it represents a tool that facilitates the communication in socio economic and policy contexts vassallo et al 2017 3 results 3 1 assessment of the natural capital as first elaboration fbhas that occupy pf and ct mpas have been identified through the analysis of the bionomic maps pf mpa consists of 17 fbhas that occupy a surface equal to 363ha while ct mpa contains 14 fbhas in 4865ha fig 2 moreover total mpas surfaces were allocated considering protection levels and fbhas table 4 and fig 3 benthic autotrophic and heterotrophic biomasses per unit surface in different fbhas were calculated as well as the fishes biomass per unit surface figs 4 and 5 from these values the trophic network of each fbha was modelled and the values of primary biomass required for the heterotrophic be and the autotrophic ba stocks formation were calculated detailed data are reported in supplementary materials table s2 the sum of be and ba namely btot is the basis for emergy analysis according to table 2 and leads to emergy and money evaluation of the fbhas natural capital in the mpas table 5 the inputs to emergy tables are reported in supplementary materials table s3 while the emergy values of single input for the autotrophic and the heterotrophic components are reported in table s4 the ratio among the value and the corresponding surface of each fbha gives the value per unit area shown in fig 6 3 2 assessment of the environmental flows fig 7 shows the balance per unit area between the generated pa and the required pe productivities within each fbha pa pe posidonia oceanica on sand on rocks and even when mixed with dead matte cymodocea nodosa only present in ct muds and sands proved to be in a surplus condition in both pf and ct being thus able to export resources to other fbhas analogously coralligenous algae fbhas photophilous and sciaphilous infralittoral algae detritic costal and muddy fbhas and stones and pebbles are always in a deficit condition not being able to self sustain their requirements with internal productivity if the balance is realized at mpa level as sum of surplus and deficit of different fbhas pf resulted to be in a deficit condition total deficit equal to 6 58e 07 gc this means that the mpa is maintained also by primary productivity yielded out the mpa s boundaries ct on the contrary is in a surplus condition 5 42e 08 gc and then it does not require support from areas out from its limits ct has also an 8 surface able to export resources to other systems basing on the calculation of primary productivity equivalents pe and of the supporting surfaces the emergy and money amounts associated to each fbha were calculated for environmental flows table 6 flows per unit area expressed in monetary units required to maintain the different fbhas in the ct and pf mpas are depicted in fig 8 4 discussions the emergy and monetary value of the natural capital is dominated by few fbhas with a share greater than 10 in both considered mpas mainly three communities make the natural capital value in pf infralittoral algae photophilous and sciaphilous coralligenous and posidonia oceanica that contributes to a third of the entire amount fig 9 photophilous algae compose a relevant extent of the value also in ct value but in this case the other major contributions are provided by muds and sands the larger contributions can be ascribed to 1 a huge surface share occupied by the fbha within the mpa or 2 a high value per unit area of the fbha from the comparison between values per unit area of natural capital fig 6 and the surfaces distribution fig 2 it can be noted that contributions of infralittoral algae coralligenous and p oceanica in pf are mainly ascribable to the great value per unit area owned by these fbhas in particular of coralligenous if ct is considered the greatest value per unit area is ascribed again to the coralligenous but this fbha contributes to the overall value for only up to 2 share the sands and the muds that together contribute to the 47 of total value own the two lowest values per unit area proving that their high contribution to overall value is given by the remarkable share of surface for the muds even the 66 they occupy the coralligenous is the sole fbha in both mpas exceeding the 10em m2 value per unit area in both cases it is followed by the caves and p oceanica both around the 7em m2 value the two fbhas that deserve a special protection at eu level are then confirmed as high value habitats the coralligenous shows in both mpas the greatest values not only in capital terms but also if the environmental flows are considered p oceanica on the contrary matches high capital values with moderate values of flows being the flows lower than the infralittoral algae and the coastal detritic these results are due to the difference among the typology of capital stocked in these two fbhas the coralligenous mainly hosts a heterotrophic biomass 92 in pf and 96 in ct respectively in value terms while in p oceanica natural capital value is predominantly composed by primary producers 22 in pf and 28 in ct for p oceanica on sands and 25 and 27 for p oceanica on rocks since the heterotrophic organisms are higher in the trophic network hierarchy a greater quantity of resources is required to maintain their biomass this is confirmed even more in coralligenous where a great functional and quantitative complexity is built with high amounts of biomass stored and an efficient network of exchanges established paoli et al 2016b moreover since coralligenous is not self sufficient fig 7 requiring resources flows from outside its boundaries this amount of resources must be conveyed from elsewhere with an effort spent by the nature to generate them on other surfaces but seized by the coralligenous p oceanica on the contrary is recognized as a high value but also as a high productive ecosystem where a structural and qualitative complexity is maintained here a stable and specialized system is assembled in particular in pf the 56 of p oceanica on sand and the 53 on rocks is devoted to other fbhas maintenance and contributes to their value while in ct these values are equal to 54 and 61 respectively these two fbhas can be then considered of great value and worthy of special protection for reasons even additional to their high value per unit area the coralligenous requires special attention due to its vulnerability that also impose the protection of other surrounding habitats providing supporting resources for its sustenance while p oceanica needs to be safeguarded also for its key role in the wider system it should be also considered that calculated values of natural capital probably represent an underestimate of real value of fbhas since at present only data obtained through visual census campaigns are available the presence of some species as for example cryptic ones is difficult to assess through visual census as a consequence it should be appropriate to employ several sampling methods in pool to obtain a deeper knowledge about fish aggregations tessier et al 2005 4 1 mpas system assessment and management perspectives as further elaboration the results have been mapped matching each fbha patch with the corresponding value figs 10 and 11 this representation allows the formulation of some key evaluations for the management of the investigated mpas in pf fbhas with value higher than 6em m2 occupy the 19 of the surface but compose the 51 of the value in particular the fbhas in the top value range 9 18em m2 namely the coralligenous and the caves represent hot spots in the a and b zones were the protection level is higher specifically in the very coastal strip 25m these fbhas constitute the 5 of the mpa s surface but embody the 20 of the value nonetheless while the importance of the coralligenous can be detected in the results about total pf value fig 9 the contribution of the caves disappears in the total budget since they occupy a very scarce percentage of the surface fbhas in the 6 9em m2 range p oceanica on soft bottom and on rocks occupy the 14 of the surface mainly in the c shallow zone but enclose the 31 of pf mpa s value in the c zone limits imposed to users activities are lower table 1 this means that a high value high productive and export area is at present only partially defended by human pressures this condition generates a risk also for precious fbhas in the a and b zones the 66 of the pf surface namely detritics dead matte muds sands and sands and gravels fbhas hosts low value fbhas 2em m2 composing the 22 of the overall mpa s value if ct is analyzed the fbhas with value higher than 6 em m2 occupy the 3 of the mpa s surface and compose the 29 of the value coralligenous caves and p oceanica confirm to be high value fbhas but in ct the photophilous algae result to be relevant too the photophilous algae originate a high value strip all along the coastline within the 25m bathymetry and located in the c zone the 94 of the mpa surface hosts low value fbhas muds sands stones and pebbles 2em m2 composing overall the 54 of the mpa value the high value fbhas are then surrounded by wide buffers and low value surfaces that feed and protect them thanks to the protection regime these appraisals for both mpas are confirmed if the natural capital values per each protection zone are considered the total and per unit area value of each protection zone has been calculated from figs 10 and 11 maps generated through a geographic information system gis may represent a useful tool that can facilitate managers to obtain information about spatial subsystems within the mpa and to monitor variations of natural capital and environmental flows over time in pf the capital is mainly stocked if the total values are considered in the b zone and in the cw zones the natural capital concentrates in these zones since the fbhas that own the higher value per unit area and greater surfaces in comparison with the other zones are located in the b and cw zones nonetheless the greatest values per unit area are recorded in the a and c zone where the fbhas with high value concentrate as previously highlighted an enlargement of pf could be taken into account together with a more severe protection exerted on those posidonia oceanica meadows at present only partly safeguarded fig 12 in ct over the 80 of the value is concentrated in the c zone due to the huge surface that this zone occupies 94 table 4 but the value per unit area decreases according to protection strictness in addition to the maps of natural capital value also the balance maps for the flows were produced figs 13 and 14 the fbhas in surplus are depicted in green while the deficit ones filled by other habitats comprised in the mpa in yellow and fbhas whose deficit is filled by surfaces out mpa s boundaries in red high value fbhas are mainly deficit areas since they concentrate biomass and require great productivity flows fbhas with seagrass may represent an exception due to the huge production they generate areas with a high value are concentrated in a limited surface but their sustenance is assured by the presence of wider and low value surfaces and by surplus areas located in the surroundings that feed these hot spots as a consequence if an mpa is correctly planned as ct is the wider low value areas are able to provide resources to the fbhas in deficit to even export resources to other systems and the mpa lies in a surplus condition on the contrary the mpa is not able to maintain itself and depends on external systems not subjected to protection and then posed at risk this latter is the condition characterizing pf 5 conclusion emergy accounting was applied in order to estimate the biophysical value of the natural capital of two mpas portofino pf and cinque terre ct located in the north western part of italy liguria region the calculated values were also expressed in monetary equivalents terms to be easily communicated to policy makers the applied methodology allowed analyzing the mpas with a systems perspective where fbhas represent system s components the role played by each fbha in the wider mpa system has been investigated and analyzed coralligenous caves and p oceanica emerged as the most valuable habitats these high value fbhas often in a deficit condition occupy small surfaces and are surrounded by wider and lower emergy areas therefore it can be inferred that the presence of a trophic hotspot like high value fbhas requires surplus buffer areas to be maintained and to mitigate at system level resources requirement these results make then clear that an effective protection of mpas should be pursued with a systems approach moreover an effective conservation strategy should consider the protection of surrounding environments sometimes larger than the area that has to be protected acting as buffer and feeding areas these remarks should be taken into account in a management perspective also considering that the load imposed by human activities on fbhas can affect their ability to generate resources for trophic network maintenance moreover the proposed methodology can be used for the correct planning of a mpa that should consider the presence of wider low value areas able to provide resources for the deficit fbhas and even to export resources to other systems finally if the information about natural capital flows and balance is synthesized in a gis it can represents a useful tool allowing managers to obtain information about different spatial subsystems within the mpa and to monitor variations in natural capital stocks and environmental flows these variations can reflect the efficacy of alternative nature conservation strategies appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at

25350,a methodology based on emergy analysis for the calculation of the biophysical value of the stocked biomass natural capital was applied to the marine protected areas mpas of portofino pf and cinque terre ct the resources exploited on a yearly base to maintain the natural capital itself alive environmental flows were accounted too emergy analysis is an accounting method useful to identify and convert in a single unit of measure all resources feeding a system this allows the implementation of a system overall assessment and then the conversion of the obtained value in money terms the studied mpas are located in the northwestern part of italy are both tourism oriented and subdivided in zones with different protection degree the habitats occupying both the mpas bottoms have been identified together with the biomass stored on their surface identifying units named fbha fishes and benthos habitat assemblage the calculation of biomass stocked in the benthic organisms and in the fishes associated to each fbha represents the basis for the assessment of mpa natural capital value and of environmental flows from these values the trophic network of each habitat was modeled allowing calculating the inputs to emergy analysis the value of pf natural capital expressed as resources employed through space and time to store the existing biomass is equal to over 10 million euros while the ct natural capital amounts to over 30 million the high value habitats where biomass is concentrated and stored represent hot spots that are restricted in a limited surface and that can be maintained only if the resources they need are provided by adjacent lower value habitats through the applied methodology a balance is performed to understand if an mpa is self sufficient or dependent on external areas therefore if an mpa is correctly planned as ct is the wider low value areas are able to provide resources to the deficit fbhas and even to export resources to other systems in this case the mpa lies in a surplus condition on the contrary the mpa is not able to maintain itself and depends on external systems not subjected to protection and then potentially posed at risk if information about natural capital flows and balance is synthesized in a geographical information system it represents an effective tool to mpas managers to measure the efficacy of protection

benefits such as high productivity beaumont et al 2007 moberg and folke 1999 townsend et al 2011 commercial and not commercial fisheries muntadas et al 2015 and sink and stabilization of sediments duarte et al 2005 ohde and van woesik 1999 orth et al 2006 however the intense urban industrial and tourist development in coastal areas coupled with a scarce sensitivity about the link between ecosystem health and human well being is threatening marine ecosystems worldwide unep 2006 the consequences of anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems are proved by the dramatic extent loss of habitats such as mangroves coral reefs and seagrass meadows ferreira et al 2017 fortes 1988 ilman et al 2016 montefalcone et al 2015 parravicini et al 2013 pauly et al 1998 short and wyllie echeverria 1996 waycott et al 2009 in this background the marine protected areas mpas have become one of the most important marine ecosystem management and conservation strategies campbell and hewitt 2006 aiming to halt or reverse the ecosystem s degradation conserving the biodiversity and maintaining or enhancing living resources nrc 2001 pita et al 2011 mpas proper design together with the monitoring of the achievement of conservation goals are crucial to effectively protect the ecosystems and to generate benefits which can positively impact on local and regional economies angulo valdes and hatcher 2010 badalamenti et al 2000 boncoeur et al 2002 hoskin et al 2011 sanchirico et al 2002 to avoid the so called paper parks lindenmayer and likens 2010 it is urgent to provide management tools able to assess the mpas efficacy the capacity of ecosystems to produce benefits lays on the maintenance of the natural capital defined as the stock of natural resources supporting ecosystem goods and services costanza and daly 1992 therefore any kind of effective ecosystem management will lay on a correct natural capital evaluation de groot et al 2002 2012 in this context the emergy accounting odum 1996 represents a fundamental tool to synthesize the ecological complexity and to ascribe a value to the natural capital as it quantifies the work of biosphere in terms of direct and indirect solar energy embodied in generating natural resources accordingly emergy provides a measure of natural capital value in terms of biophysical resources consumption required to support the generation the extraction and the fruition of goods and services franzese et al 2015 paoli et al 2016a recently emergy as tool for natural capital and ecosystem services valuation has been applied in specific study cases campbell and hewitt 2006 campbell and brown 2012 vassallo et al 2013 berrios et al 2017 franzese et al 2017 the evaluation of mpas natural capital requires taking into account that a mpa contains a variety of habitats providing different types and amounts of ecosystem services subjected to different pressures and responding differently to the stresses this habitats heterogeneity makes fundamental to know the location of each habitat to assess adequate conservation targets and manage human pressures consequently the seabed habitat mapping has become an effective tool not only to implement mpas decisions but also to synthesize spatial information essential for the monitoring and further management of the mpas cogan et al 2009 ehler and douvere 2009 this research therefore aims at estimating the value of the natural capital within two different mpas estimating the value of environmental annual flows that maintain natural capital highlighting differences in terms of value among different habitats and the associated biocenosis that compose mpas providing an mpa management tool based on biophysical measures and monetary evaluation of natural stocks and fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the methodology described by vassallo et al 2017 was applied to the portofino mpa and the cinque terre mpa liguria region nw italy respectively pf and ct hereinafter fig 1 the pf mpa was established in 1999 and occupies a total surface of 363ha while the ct mpa was instituted in 1997 and occupies a surface of 4865ha pf is distant 69km from ct the pf mpa s borders include the totality of portofino municipality coast and a fraction of santa margherita ligure coast and camogli coast fig 1 ct mpa involves the coast of four municipalities including five villages that from east to west are riomaggiore manarola part of riomaggiore municipality corniglia part of vernazza municipality vernazza monterosso al mare and partly levanto fig 1 both mpas are tourism oriented areas widely recognized for their high natural value worldwide known for their emerged and submerged landscape as well as for the rich biodiversity they host with endemisms and endangered species the mpas contain areas protected within the framework of the so called habitats directive hsd 92 43 eec eec 1992 sci it1332674 fondali monte di portofino it1344270 fondali punta mesco riomaggiore the habitat directive is a european community legislative instrument in the field of nature conservation that establishes a common framework for the conservation of wild animal and plant species and natural habitats of community importance both mpas include the endemic posidonia oceanica habitat and the biogenic formation named coralligenous designated as mediterranean priority habitats by the directive moreover since 2005 the pf mpa created within a national ministry decree in 1999 is a spami specially protected area of mediterranean interest according to the decision of the rac spa regional activity centre for specially protected areas office http www rac spa org unep 2005 within the mpas many activities such as diving fishing and recreational boating are regulated cattaneo vietti et al 2015 with different protection levels from more severe in the a zone to less severe in the c zone table 1 since in pf the c zone is physically split in two subareas separated by the a and the b zones the c east ce and the c west cw zones have been considered within this study analogously in ct the a and the b zones are separated in the eastern and the western part hereinafter named ae and aw and be and bw respectively despite the protection regimes tourism oriented activities are very common and pressure on local environment can be very high in pf the recreational boating reaches the maximum in august with about 200 units per days and the diving activities count more than 30 000 annual dives venturini et al 2016 in ct the recreational boating pressure can reach maximum values in august equal to over 80 units per days and over 2700 annual dives conidi 2010 the pressure from bathing users is exerted only in some segments of the mpas since a large part of the mpas coastline is occupied by rocky and steep tracts not accessible in pf the available surface for bathing users is equal to 9162m2 frequented by a precautionary estimate of over 100 000 users per summer the ct s available space for bathing users is around 42 800m2 mainly located in monterosso 93 and frequented by a raw and precautionary estimate of around 500 000 users per summer 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 the emergy accounting method emergy is an environmental accounting method based on thermodynamics introduced in the 80s by howard odum emergy is a technique of quantitative analysis converting the amounts of resources with and without an economic value services and commodities in a sole common unit brown and herendeen 1996 this makes emergy a very versatile technique that can be applied to both natural and human dominated ecosystems in particular the free environmental inputs e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flows to a system are taken into account as well as the human driven flows all inputs are accounted together with indirect environmental support embodied in human labour and services brown and ulgiati 2004 the emergy theory is defined by two key concepts the solar emergy and the solar transformity the solar emergy is defined by the quantity of solar energy required directly or not to provide a given flow or storage of energy or matter odum 1996 the emergy is expressed in solar emergy joule sej and it is usually calculated on an annual scale the solar transformity measures the input of emergy per unit output and it is calculated as the ratio of the emergy necessary to produce a flow or storage to the actual energy of that flow or storage ulgiati and brown 2002 the transformity is expressed in solar emergy joule per joule of output flow sejj 1 for certain products or flows easily quantifiable in units of mass or money a conversion value expressed in sejg 1 or sej 1 can be used odum 1996 these coefficients are respectively named specific emergy and emergy per unit money the solar transformity the specific emergy and the emergy per unit money can be gathered under the term unit emergy value uev hereinafter paoli et al 2013 from the inventory of the resources feeding the analyzed system an emergy table is built where all inputs raw data expressed with different units of measure are translated in emergy equivalents through the use of uevs the sum of emergy values provides an estimate of total resources amount required by the eco system and it represents a biophysical estimate of the cost that nature invests to generate all the resources exploited vassallo et al 2017 moreover emergy allows translating the biophysical measures of natural capital in monetary equivalents facilitating the inclusion of natural capital value in environmental management decisions the monetary units are calculated through a ratio named emergy money ratio an index that links emergy to economy and that is calculated as ratio of the total emergy flow to a nation to its gross domestic product it is expressed in sejcurrency 1 sej 1 in our case and it represents the emergy purchasing power since it values how much emergy corresponds on average to one unit of money produced by the national economy odum 1996 2 2 2 emergy accounting of natural systems in marine protected areas the emergy accounting for mpas claims for specific calculation procedures that have been described by vassallo et al 2017 the methodology is a biophysical accounting model of the mpas benthic system it is based on the trophodynamic and on the calculation of primary production that maintains a considered marine system and it allows the calculation of both stocked natural capital and environmental flows supporting its maintenance in particular natural capital is assessed as the resources required through space and time to allow the generation of the stock of biomass within the mpa environmental flows are the resources generated and consumed by the mpa annually instead the assessment of this primary production requires the accurate accounting of input resources the applied calculation is then based on the donor side perspective of the emergy method through which the value is associated to the environmental cost required to generate natural capital stocks therefore the greater is the investment of nature in the generation of the capital the greater its value in particular at first a trophodynamic analysis is needed to assess the primary production used to build up and maintain natural capital stocks furthermore it is necessary to assess the area on which the primary production was generated supporting area hereinafter input flows of resources associated to this area i e nutrients and other natural flows such as sun or rain that generated and maintained natural capital stocks through time are then calculated here below it is reported a brief summary of the procedure while deeper details are reported in vassallo et al 2017 the model for the natural capital assessment is articulated in three main steps 1 trophodynamic analysis providing an estimate of the primary productivity used to support the benthic trophic web within the study area 2 biophysical accounting providing an estimate of the biophysical value of natural capital and environmental flows by means of emergy accounting 3 monetary conversion expressing the biophysical value of natural capital and environmental flows into monetary units 2 2 3 data collection and tropho dynamic analysis the assessment of natural capital is based on the identification of the main benthic habitats included within the boundaries of the mpas their surface is assessed through the analysis of the bionomic maps of mpa afterwards the main taxonomic groups e g fish molluscs algae microphytobenthos among others included in each habitat are identified and a database of biomass per unit area for each group is created vassallo et al 2017 in the specific case the atlas of marine habitats diviacco and coppo 2006 was chosen in particular the 2012 updated version of the atlas integrated with new data obtained through surveys realized from 2006 to 2012 and provided by regional authority was taken into consideration being the most recent and complete cartography about habitats distribution in liguria according to the last guidelines of the italian military geographic institute imgi istituto geografico militare 2014 https www igmi org en the national cartographic authority producing the official state cartography the official italian spatial reference system srs to be adopted for cartography is etrs89 or rdn2008 cima et al 2014 the maps provided by the mpas were produced with dissimilar srs thus were re projected in a common srs etrs89 was chosen being the more widespread and implemented in all geographic information system software in a consolidated manner etr89 utm32 epsg 25832 to minimize the re projection errors we used the igm official tools verto online http www igmi org vol conversion php to convert all the maps correctly and get to final maps and data directly comparable the biomasses stocked in the two mpas have been retrieved from the literature agostini et al 2003 albertelli et al 1978 albertelli et al 1981a 1981b albertelli and d ambrosio 1986 albertelli and rossi 1986 antoniadou et al 2005 ballesteros 2006

sanchez lisazo 1993 sánchez jerez et al 1999 true 1970 willsie 1983 or from field samplings when only the benthos abundances were available the associated biomass was calculated using individual weights from goren 1980 and brey 1990 the communities of demersal fishes associated to each habitat were identified by direct or previous samplings for the two considered mpas only visual census data were used the visual census is a widely adopted technique for the study of the littoral fish communities particularly in protected habitats such as the mpas are due to its minimal impact harmelin vivien et al 1985 guidetti 2002 azzurro et al 2007 in mpas the visual census studies are frequently performed to assess the efficacy of protection strategies in terms of increase in density and size of fishes guidetti et al 2008 in italy visual census campaigns have been performed in the mpas within the afrodite programme a programme lasting three years 2001 2004 encompassing a number of coordinated activities and aimed at the creation of a mpas national system greco et al 2004 nowadays the italian mpas perform yearly the visual census campaigns as standard monitoring method the utilization of the visual census data allows then the access to historical and recent information and it makes the evaluations comparable since original data are collected with the same protocol in particular for pf data from guidetti et al 2011 were considered while for ct data collected within the medpan north project were used http www medpan org en mnp the biomass is then obtained through length weight relationships froese 1998 www fishbase com the biomass data of each fishes and benthos habitat assemblage fbha hereinafter is the basic information needed for the calculation of primary productivity required to generate and support the natural capital stocks primary biomass the assessment of the natural capital foresees the evaluation of the autotrophic and heterotrophic stocks in the mpa s fbhas the total autotrophic biomass density ba gcm 2 of each fbha is calculated as the sum of the biomass of all the primary producers the biomass of heterotrophic groups b gcm 2 is converted into the primary biomass required for its formation according to the following equation derived from pauly and christensen 1995 1 bei bi 7 tli 1 i 1 2 3 n where bei is the autotrophic biomass supporting the i th heterotrophic group bi is the biomass and tli is the trophic level of the i th group the total primary biomass required to support the formation of all the heterotrophic groups in each habitat is then obtained as sum of all bei once ba and be are obtained the trophic levels are calculated by means of simulation of the trophic web paoli et al 2016b or found in literature for fishes www fishbase com the environmental flows assessment aimed at the estimate of the fluxes of natural resources that annually support natural capital is also based on the biomass matrix of considered taxonomic groups previously used for natural capital assessment data on primary biomass density for each autotrophic group are converted to annual primary production pa density by using appropriate p b ratios cattaneo vietti et al 2015 similarly the annual consumption by the heterotrophic group ci is calculated through the identification of appropriate q b ratios ait alla et al 2006 ambrogi 1990 bănaru et al 2013 bayle sempere et al 2013 christensen and pauly 1993 coll et al 2006a 2006b 2007 2008 2009 corrales et al 2015 daas et al 2011 de souzal and borzone 2007 diaz lopez et al 2008 gillet 1993 heymans et al 2009 hotchkiss 2007 lassalle et al 2011 lercari et al 2007 liu et al 2009 ménard et al 1989 okey et al 2004a 2004b opitz 1996 ortiz et al 2013 kroon et al 1993 palomares et al 2005 pedersen et al 2008 pinnegar and polunin 2004 pinkerton et al 2008 piroddi et al 2010 prado et al 2013 rouhi et al 2008 selleslagh et al 2012 tecchio et al 2013 torres et al 2013 vetter 1996 wolff and wolff 1977 and the application of eq 1 once the productivity needed to maintain the biomass stocks in the habitats is assessed the area where this productivity is generated supporting area is estimated this is based on a balance between the annual primary production pa and the consumption pe in each habitat and for the whole mpa to recognize a if each habitat is capable to generate the amount of primary biomass necessary to support its internal consumption and b if the whole mpa is self sufficient two cases are possible when pa pe the fbha sustains its internal consumption and even a surplus of primary production is exported to other habitats internal or external to the mpa as a consequence the supporting area of the habitat is considered smaller than its physical area when pa pe the fbha does not sustain its internal consumption and it requires additional primary production this additional contribution is imported from out the fbha and the supporting area of the habitat is considered larger than its physical area furthermore once the annual consumed carbon flow is calculated the annual flows of nutrients n and p assimilated in organic matter are estimated 2 2 4 biophysical accounting from previous calculations the total primary biomass btot expressed in carbon units is obtained as sum of ba and be and in turn the nitrogen and the phosphorous fixed in the primary biomass are assessed the natural flows solar radiation wind rain geothermal flow currents tides and runoff that support the biomass production in the mpa are calculated according to odum 1996 and accounted for the time of stocks formation table 2 the time of stocks formation is calculated as primary biomass be divided by the average productivity of the surrounding benthic systems here the average rate of 650gcm 2 y 1 provided by charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 has been employed all the inputs i e nutrients and natural flows are then converted into emergy units by using specific uevs odum 1996 the used uev are reported in table 3 according to the emergy algebra only the maximum among co products is chosen and included in the sum to avoid double counting in particular the nutrients are considered as a different set of co products and then compared with sun rain wind and current representing another co product set being these two groups generated on a different spatial and temporal scale according to literature tides geothermal heat and runoff are considered as split since they are generated by different processes at global scale brown et al 1991 campbell et al 2005 the emergy inputs are summed to assess the emergy density value of the natural capital for the different habitats sejm 2 these values are multiplied by the areas of the habitats to estimate the total value of the natural capital stock for each fbha sej finally the total emergy value of the natural capital is calculated as the sum of all fbhas natural capital values within the mpa in the environmental flow assessment the natural flows solar radiation wind kinetic energy rain geopotential flow geothermal flow currents tides and runoff supporting the annual biomass production in each fbha are estimated in relation to calculated supporting areas vassallo et al 2017 and according to formulas reported in table 2 as for the natural capital assessment the nutrients and the natural flows are converted into emergy units and then they are summed according to the emergy algebra to assess the total annual emergy flow sejyr 1 that maintains the natural capital in each fbha and in the whole mpa 2 2 5 monetary conversion when the emergy amount of the natural capital and the environmental flows are calculated the corresponding economic value is obtained applying the so called emergy to money ratio emr the emr is calculated as ratio of the emergy flow to a nation to its gross domestic product it is expressed in sejcurrency 1 sej 1 in our case and represents the emergy purchasing power since it values how much emergy corresponds on average to one unit of money produced by the national economy odum 1996 the ratio between the emergy amount and the emr gives an estimate of the economic value of the natural capital stocked in each fbha of the mpa and as sum of the entire mpa analogously the economic value of the flows can be calculated here the 9 60e 11 sej ratio is employed pereira et al 2013 monetary equivalents of biophysical values are expressed in emergy euros em currently a debate on the use of the emr has arisen among emergy scientists about the merging of biophysical and economic values campbell and tilley 2014 here the em value is used to allow an easier understanding of the ecological value of natural capital in decision making processes however this operation does not change the biophysical feature of the proposed method but instead it represents a tool that facilitates the communication in socio economic and policy contexts vassallo et al 2017 3 results 3 1 assessment of the natural capital as first elaboration fbhas that occupy pf and ct mpas have been identified through the analysis of the bionomic maps pf mpa consists of 17 fbhas that occupy a surface equal to 363ha while ct mpa contains 14 fbhas in 4865ha fig 2 moreover total mpas surfaces were allocated considering protection levels and fbhas table 4 and fig 3 benthic autotrophic and heterotrophic biomasses per unit surface in different fbhas were calculated as well as the fishes biomass per unit surface figs 4 and 5 from these values the trophic network of each fbha was modelled and the values of primary biomass required for the heterotrophic be and the autotrophic ba stocks formation were calculated detailed data are reported in supplementary materials table s2 the sum of be and ba namely btot is the basis for emergy analysis according to table 2 and leads to emergy and money evaluation of the fbhas natural capital in the mpas table 5 the inputs to emergy tables are reported in supplementary materials table s3 while the emergy values of single input for the autotrophic and the heterotrophic components are reported in table s4 the ratio among the value and the corresponding surface of each fbha gives the value per unit area shown in fig 6 3 2 assessment of the environmental flows fig 7 shows the balance per unit area between the generated pa and the required pe productivities within each fbha pa pe posidonia oceanica on sand on rocks and even when mixed with dead matte cymodocea nodosa only present in ct muds and sands proved to be in a surplus condition in both pf and ct being thus able to export resources to other fbhas analogously coralligenous algae fbhas photophilous and sciaphilous infralittoral algae detritic costal and muddy fbhas and stones and pebbles are always in a deficit condition not being able to self sustain their requirements with internal productivity if the balance is realized at mpa level as sum of surplus and deficit of different fbhas pf resulted to be in a deficit condition total deficit equal to 6 58e 07 gc this means that the mpa is maintained also by primary productivity yielded out the mpa s boundaries ct on the contrary is in a surplus condition 5 42e 08 gc and then it does not require support from areas out from its limits ct has also an 8 surface able to export resources to other systems basing on the calculation of primary productivity equivalents pe and of the supporting surfaces the emergy and money amounts associated to each fbha were calculated for environmental flows table 6 flows per unit area expressed in monetary units required to maintain the different fbhas in the ct and pf mpas are depicted in fig 8 4 discussions the emergy and monetary value of the natural capital is dominated by few fbhas with a share greater than 10 in both considered mpas mainly three communities make the natural capital value in pf infralittoral algae photophilous and sciaphilous coralligenous and posidonia oceanica that contributes to a third of the entire amount fig 9 photophilous algae compose a relevant extent of the value also in ct value but in this case the other major contributions are provided by muds and sands the larger contributions can be ascribed to 1 a huge surface share occupied by the fbha within the mpa or 2 a high value per unit area of the fbha from the comparison between values per unit area of natural capital fig 6 and the surfaces distribution fig 2 it can be noted that contributions of infralittoral algae coralligenous and p oceanica in pf are mainly ascribable to the great value per unit area owned by these fbhas in particular of coralligenous if ct is considered the greatest value per unit area is ascribed again to the coralligenous but this fbha contributes to the overall value for only up to 2 share the sands and the muds that together contribute to the 47 of total value own the two lowest values per unit area proving that their high contribution to overall value is given by the remarkable share of surface for the muds even the 66 they occupy the coralligenous is the sole fbha in both mpas exceeding the 10em m2 value per unit area in both cases it is followed by the caves and p oceanica both around the 7em m2 value the two fbhas that deserve a special protection at eu level are then confirmed as high value habitats the coralligenous shows in both mpas the greatest values not only in capital terms but also if the environmental flows are considered p oceanica on the contrary matches high capital values with moderate values of flows being the flows lower than the infralittoral algae and the coastal detritic these results are due to the difference among the typology of capital stocked in these two fbhas the coralligenous mainly hosts a heterotrophic biomass 92 in pf and 96 in ct respectively in value terms while in p oceanica natural capital value is predominantly composed by primary producers 22 in pf and 28 in ct for p oceanica on sands and 25 and 27 for p oceanica on rocks since the heterotrophic organisms are higher in the trophic network hierarchy a greater quantity of resources is required to maintain their biomass this is confirmed even more in coralligenous where a great functional and quantitative complexity is built with high amounts of biomass stored and an efficient network of exchanges established paoli et al 2016b moreover since coralligenous is not self sufficient fig 7 requiring resources flows from outside its boundaries this amount of resources must be conveyed from elsewhere with an effort spent by the nature to generate them on other surfaces but seized by the coralligenous p oceanica on the contrary is recognized as a high value but also as a high productive ecosystem where a structural and qualitative complexity is maintained here a stable and specialized system is assembled in particular in pf the 56 of p oceanica on sand and the 53 on rocks is devoted to other fbhas maintenance and contributes to their value while in ct these values are equal to 54 and 61 respectively these two fbhas can be then considered of great value and worthy of special protection for reasons even additional to their high value per unit area the coralligenous requires special attention due to its vulnerability that also impose the protection of other surrounding habitats providing supporting resources for its sustenance while p oceanica needs to be safeguarded also for its key role in the wider system it should be also considered that calculated values of natural capital probably represent an underestimate of real value of fbhas since at present only data obtained through visual census campaigns are available the presence of some species as for example cryptic ones is difficult to assess through visual census as a consequence it should be appropriate to employ several sampling methods in pool to obtain a deeper knowledge about fish aggregations tessier et al 2005 4 1 mpas system assessment and management perspectives as further elaboration the results have been mapped matching each fbha patch with the corresponding value figs 10 and 11 this representation allows the formulation of some key evaluations for the management of the investigated mpas in pf fbhas with value higher than 6em m2 occupy the 19 of the surface but compose the 51 of the value in particular the fbhas in the top value range 9 18em m2 namely the coralligenous and the caves represent hot spots in the a and b zones were the protection level is higher specifically in the very coastal strip 25m these fbhas constitute the 5 of the mpa s surface but embody the 20 of the value nonetheless while the importance of the coralligenous can be detected in the results about total pf value fig 9 the contribution of the caves disappears in the total budget since they occupy a very scarce percentage of the surface fbhas in the 6 9em m2 range p oceanica on soft bottom and on rocks occupy the 14 of the surface mainly in the c shallow zone but enclose the 31 of pf mpa s value in the c zone limits imposed to users activities are lower table 1 this means that a high value high productive and export area is at present only partially defended by human pressures this condition generates a risk also for precious fbhas in the a and b zones the 66 of the pf surface namely detritics dead matte muds sands and sands and gravels fbhas hosts low value fbhas 2em m2 composing the 22 of the overall mpa s value if ct is analyzed the fbhas with value higher than 6 em m2 occupy the 3 of the mpa s surface and compose the 29 of the value coralligenous caves and p oceanica confirm to be high value fbhas but in ct the photophilous algae result to be relevant too the photophilous algae originate a high value strip all along the coastline within the 25m bathymetry and located in the c zone the 94 of the mpa surface hosts low value fbhas muds sands stones and pebbles 2em m2 composing overall the 54 of the mpa value the high value fbhas are then surrounded by wide buffers and low value surfaces that feed and protect them thanks to the protection regime these appraisals for both mpas are confirmed if the natural capital values per each protection zone are considered the total and per unit area value of each protection zone has been calculated from figs 10 and 11 maps generated through a geographic information system gis may represent a useful tool that can facilitate managers to obtain information about spatial subsystems within the mpa and to monitor variations of natural capital and environmental flows over time in pf the capital is mainly stocked if the total values are considered in the b zone and in the cw zones the natural capital concentrates in these zones since the fbhas that own the higher value per unit area and greater surfaces in comparison with the other zones are located in the b and cw zones nonetheless the greatest values per unit area are recorded in the a and c zone where the fbhas with high value concentrate as previously highlighted an enlargement of pf could be taken into account together with a more severe protection exerted on those posidonia oceanica meadows at present only partly safeguarded fig 12 in ct over the 80 of the value is concentrated in the c zone due to the huge surface that this zone occupies 94 table 4 but the value per unit area decreases according to protection strictness in addition to the maps of natural capital value also the balance maps for the flows were produced figs 13 and 14 the fbhas in surplus are depicted in green while the deficit ones filled by other habitats comprised in the mpa in yellow and fbhas whose deficit is filled by surfaces out mpa s boundaries in red high value fbhas are mainly deficit areas since they concentrate biomass and require great productivity flows fbhas with seagrass may represent an exception due to the huge production they generate areas with a high value are concentrated in a limited surface but their sustenance is assured by the presence of wider and low value surfaces and by surplus areas located in the surroundings that feed these hot spots as a consequence if an mpa is correctly planned as ct is the wider low value areas are able to provide resources to the fbhas in deficit to even export resources to other systems and the mpa lies in a surplus condition on the contrary the mpa is not able to maintain itself and depends on external systems not subjected to protection and then posed at risk this latter is the condition characterizing pf 5 conclusion emergy accounting was applied in order to estimate the biophysical value of the natural capital of two mpas portofino pf and cinque terre ct located in the north western part of italy liguria region the calculated values were also expressed in monetary equivalents terms to be easily communicated to policy makers the applied methodology allowed analyzing the mpas with a systems perspective where fbhas represent system s components the role played by each fbha in the wider mpa system has been investigated and analyzed coralligenous caves and p oceanica emerged as the most valuable habitats these high value fbhas often in a deficit condition occupy small surfaces and are surrounded by wider and lower emergy areas therefore it can be inferred that the presence of a trophic hotspot like high value fbhas requires surplus buffer areas to be maintained and to mitigate at system level resources requirement these results make then clear that an effective protection of mpas should be pursued with a systems approach moreover an effective conservation strategy should consider the protection of surrounding environments sometimes larger than the area that has to be protected acting as buffer and feeding areas these remarks should be taken into account in a management perspective also considering that the load imposed by human activities on fbhas can affect their ability to generate resources for trophic network maintenance moreover the proposed methodology can be used for the correct planning of a mpa that should consider the presence of wider low value areas able to provide resources for the deficit fbhas and even to export resources to other systems finally if the information about natural capital flows and balance is synthesized in a gis it can represents a useful tool allowing managers to obtain information about different spatial subsystems within the mpa and to monitor variations in natural capital stocks and environmental flows these variations can reflect the efficacy of alternative nature conservation strategies appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at

25351,ecological dynamics often exhibit significant temporal variability and sudden shifts that characterize their non equilibrium and nonlinear nature challenging our ability to understand and predict their trajectories among a set of ecological time series originating from the long term monitoring of three large and deep lakes nonlinear forecasting methods simplex projection and s map indicated that most of the time series exhibited hallmarks of complex dynamics in the form of nonlinear behaviors convergent cross mapping ccm was used to estimate the causal relationships among these time series by considering different time lags the significant causal relationships were then used to construct causal networks from which nodes were characterized using pagerank and cheirank for the three lakes the dominance of bottom up control was revealed and was mostly indirect i e nutrient forcing zooplankton this result likely evidences the transitivity of the causal relationships obtained by ccm as well as the mixed phytoplankton diet of zooplankton species limiting the identification of causal relationships among these two ecological components complementarily the consistence of causal relationships for the different time lags may highlight a temporal transitivity by which the instantaneous causal signal was transmitted over time the dual representation of both pagerank and cheirank provided a straightforward classification of each node and enabled their thorough implications in the information flow within the causal networks the complementary use of ccm and network metrics constituted an efficient way to delineate ecological causation using a high resolution time series for which linear methods performed poorly and provided insights into the dynamic hierarchy of the different ecological variables in aquatic ecosystems keywords nonlinear dynamics convergent cross mapping causality ecological interaction network bottom up control 1 introduction the relative implication of bottom up and top down controls in driving ecological dynamics is of central interest in ecology the early investigations highlighting a strong influence of nutrients on algal dynamics i e bottom up control schindler 1978 have been challenged by the evidenced role of trophic cascade on ecosystem processes i e top down control paine 1980 carpenter and kitchell 1985 since then a large number of studies have been conducted on lakes carpenter et al 1995 currie et al 1999 jeppesen et al 1997 mesocosms sinistro 2009 or using paleolimnological reconstructions perga et al 2010 to decipher their relative implications on food web dynamics nonetheless the quantification of the direction and strength of ecological links in food webs remains a spurious task because of their diversity e g direct and indirect and variation over time berlow et al 2004 wootton and emmerson 2005 deyle et al 2016 lynam et al 2017 additionally when extensive datasets are available ecological dynamics i e time series can often seem erratic possibly punctuated by sudden episodic bursts seemingly unrelated to any other putative causal variables this particular feature lies in their nonlinearity which is characterized by state dependent behavior the effect of one variable on another is dependent on the states of other variables in the system dixon et al 1999 anderson et al 2008 deyle et al 2013 glaser et al 2013 in this context ecological dynamics can appear correlated or not despite their causal association remaining constant a phenomenon called mirage correlation sugihara et al 2012 as a consequence conventional correlation analyses can appear unsuitable for identifying the causal ecological links used to infer the relative role of bottom up and top down controls an alternative view to correlative approaches one that allows the assumptions of equilibrium stability and stationarity to be relaxed can be found in a flexible nonparametric class of nonlinear forecasting models sugihara 1994 sugihara and may 1990 that are based on state space reconstructions these models have shown impressive performance for forecasting complex ecological dynamics dixon et al 1999 glaser et al 2013 recently an extension of these models called convergent cross mapping ccm has been developed to identify causal relationships in weakly coupled nonlinear systems sugihara et al 2012 ccm relies on takens theorem takens 1981 which states that a shadow attractor reconstruction from the lags of a single one dimensional variable conserves the mathematical properties of the original attractor of the full dynamical system sugihara et al 2012 takens 1981 deyle and sugihara 2011 as a consequence if two variables belong to the same dynamical system meaning that they are causally coupled their respective dynamics could be mutually predicted based on the local neighborhoods of their shadow attractors sugihara et al 2012 additionally the accuracy of the forecasts i e the cross mapping between the two shadow attractors would increase along with the length of the time series i e library length thus exhibiting convergence as long as the shadow attractors became progressively denser and fulfill the historical dynamics due to this convergence property ccm can further identify directional coupling the higher a forcing dynamically constrains a subordinate variable the more the amount of information about the forcing variable i e causal imprint will be encoded in the constrained variable sugihara et al 2012 complementarily because causation is transitive the causal imprint of a forcing can expand beyond its directly constrained variables to be encoded in other indirectly interacting variables sugihara et al 2012 although the extent of the causal imprint decreases as the causal coupling becomes more indirect ye et al 2015b recent valuable examples of the use of ccm can be found in tsonis et al 2015 which addressed the causal influence of cosmic rays on the earth s global temperature variability and in van nes et al 2015 which identified bi directional causal relationships associated with lagged responses between the global earth s temperature and greenhouse gases in this study we aim to couple ccm and network analyses to reveal causal links among the ecological components i e nutrient temperature phytoplankton and zooplankton of the three largest french lakes using time series obtained from long term monitoring this approach was designed to account for direct and indirect causal links therefore possibly evidencing the relative implication of bottom up and top down controls considering the pelagic zones of these three large lakes was expected to be especially suitable for delineating the relative controls driving the ecological dynamics because the implication of littoral and terrestrial environments have been shown to impact negligibly the pelagic zones of such large systems perga and gerdeaux 2004 vadeboncoeur et al 2008 we expected that because of the relatively low nutrient levels and the large size of the lakes the ecological dynamics would be mostly constrained by bottom up control as suggested by jeppesen et al 1997 though never tested using the present methodology complementarily the bottom up control may be strong enough to be transmitted up to the highest food web level considered in this study i e zooplankton characterizing indirect bottom up relationships different time lags in the causal interactions were accounted for to test the robustness of the causal relationships over time we hypothesized a conservative structure of the causal network over time signifying both a lag in ecological response to a driver as well as a transmission of the instantaneous causal relationship over time prior to performing ccm the dynamic features i e dimensionality and nonlinearity of the time series were analyzed providing insights about their complexity and nonlinear behavior justifying the need for nonlinear methods to correctly model and predict their dynamics 2 methods 2 1 study sites and ecological time series lakes annecy geneva and bourget are three large and deep lakes lying on the western border of the french alps they lie in a similar climatic i e mean annual temperature of 11 c and geologic i e carbonate bed rocks context and their main environmental features are provided in table 1 they share a common eutrophication history yet to different extents during the middle of the 20th century before remediation programs led to efficient re oligotrophication by the end of the last century that has persisted to the present berthon et al 2013 despite the availability of data since the first half of the 20th century observatory on alpine lakes www6 inra fr soere ola most environmental and ecological variables have not been continuously monitored prior to the implementation of rigorous monitoring for management at different time periods for the three lakes in the 1970s for lake geneva 41 years since 2003 for lake bourget 12 years and since 2004 for lake annecy 11 years data source soere ola is inra thonon les bains cipel sila cisalb date of download 20 10 2015 developed by inra eco informatics for each lake samples were collected at a single site located at the deepest part of the lake although biological and chemical variables can exhibit spatial variability ongoing spatial analyses no shown suggest that the sampling sites were representative the actual status of the studied variables at a lake level the parts of the time series for which nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton data were available but at sampling frequencies varying from weekly to monthly were considered among the numerous species of phytoplankton and zooplankton identified over the monitored period those whose occurrence was 50 were excluded from the datasets time series were standardized and then interpolated using a monotonic hermite spline so that they exhibited identical and regularly spaced numbers of observations see appendix 1 in supplementary material for the number of initial and interpolated data fig 1 the possible effect of such an interpolation method on the nonlinear signal and the identification of causal relationships was assessed using a random and nonlinear time series by randomly deleting a variable number of time points i e 1 2 5 10 15 and 20 as inputs to the spline appendix 2 in supplementary material these preliminary investigations suggested that the methods used were robust to the extent of interpolation using the monotonic hermite spline considered in this study the datasets for the three lakes were then represented as follows 761 observations for lake geneva time interval 19 7days 227 observations for lake bourget time interval 17 6days and 183 observations for lake annecy time interval 23 8days the difference in time intervals between lakes originates from the differences in sampling frequencies of their regular monitoring we chose not to reduce them to a common time interval to preserve the highest time frequency for each lake keeping in mind that differences in the lengths of the time series may influence their dynamical characteristics as well as the identification of causal relationships these were especially long compared to other studies e g glaser et al 2013 liu et al 2014 consequently providing a limited bias of their dynamical properties 2 2 characterizing time series dynamics two different metrics e and θ were considered to characterize the time series dynamics i e their complexity using simplex projection and the extent of their non linearity using s maps respectively fig 1 the complexity of each time series was assessed by estimating their embedding dimension e which represents the minimum number of lagged variables needed to unfold the attractor so that the trajectories do not overlap from an ecological perspective e characterizes its dimensionality according to the whitney embedding theorem whitney 1936 and allows an estimate of the number of key variables involved in the dynamic i e having a causal influence the e value that best characterizes the time series was identified using simplex projection sugihara and may 1990 which tests the ability of a process to predict its own dynamic by generating a state space the state space is constructed using multiple lagged observations of the single process that leads to a multivariate coordinate space and the forecasts are estimated by weight averaging the observed dynamics i e nearest neighbor vectors at nearby points in the reconstructed state space forecast accuracy varies according to the number of lagged observations used to produce the state space therefore as a function of e the best e was retained to maximize the forecast skill rho which is the predictive forecasting power deyle et al 2013 with a maximum value of 6 to prevent over fitting clark et al 2015 the extent of the nonlinearity of the time series that is the state dependence of the system dynamics was quantified regarding the nonlinear tuning parameter i e theta θ from the s map model sugihara 1994 θ attributes a weight to the variable of the library vectors used to produce the forecast for θ 0 all library vectors are given equal weight and as a consequence the model is linear and can be regarded as an autoregressive model of order e as θ increases the library vectors nearest the prediction vector are increasingly weighted therefore the system exhibits a greater state dependence as θ increases and the nearby points in the state space become more important for forecasting a series of s map models were conducted using different θ ranging from 0 to 10 the θ retained to characterize the time series was the one that maximizes the forecast skill e is also an input to the s map model for which we used the best e values previously estimated by simplex projection more detailed descriptions of simplex projection and the s map model can be found in dixon et al 1999 deyle et al 2013 and landini et al 2002 the simplex and s map functions of the r package redm ye et al 2016 were used to estimate the best e and θ using leave one out cross validation i e removing one observation from the time series and using the rest of the time series to forecast its dynamics 2 3 convergent cross mapping ccm ccm seeks causation between two time series x and y by looking at the correspondence of their shadow attractors i e mx and my respectively built using lagged coordinates of these time series that equals e if x causes y then it should be possible to estimate x from y and ccm assesses to what extent y can estimate the states of x that are cross mapping x using my i e x my in practice a number of nearest neighbors is defined in my for each time point t i e the closest time points in my for each time point t allowing an estimation for each time point t of x from my i e x ˆ t my a pearson coefficient correlation rho is then calculated between x t and x ˆ t my the number of nearest neighbors also called the library length is used to generate x ˆ t my ranges from e to the maximal length of the time series if x causes y ccm should indicate convergence meaning that as the number of nearest neighbors used in the library increases the predictive skill assessed by rho should also increase differences in the extent of convergence are then considered to be a practical metric for estimating the extent of the causal relationships the value of rho ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 and quantifies the deterministic signal in the data i e a measure of prediction accuracy that can be compared between datasets however negative values of rho could not be significant otherwise indicating errors in computing or an incomplete embedding to estimate the statistical significance of this causal signal a nonparametric bootstrapping routine using 1000 iterations was conducted using the multispatialccm r package clark et al 2015 fig 1 this approach has been shown to detect effective causal relationships even in the presence of process noise and observation error clark et al 2015 the best e obtained from simplex projection was retained to conduct ccm the significant decrease of predictive skill significantly along with the length of time prediction was assessed using a simple linear model i e function ssr check signal from the multispatialccm package this is required although insufficient condition for determining nonlinearity sugihara 1994 all of the time series that did not fulfill this condition were not considered for this analysis sugihara 1994 clark et al 2015 in some cases where an external forcing overwhelmingly influences the system variables ccm might conclude causal relationships that do not exist sugihara et al 2012 such synchrony may confound ccm analysis therefore the occurrence of cyclic patterns in time series was estimated using an ornstein uhlenbeck state space model that accounts for non negligible long term correlations over time which are often found in ecological time series using the peacots r package louca and doebeli 2015 for any combination implying two significantly cyclical time series the surrogate method was used to test the null hypothesis that the time series are dynamically unrelated clark et al 2015 briefly this method was used to compute one thousand mean annual trends which are similar to annually cyclical data for which the residuals were shuffled because the ecological time series were especially long the threshold to reject this null expectation was set at 0 001 ecological interactions are not always dynamically expressed instantaneously and their consequences can lag over different timescales for instance the observable effect of temperature or nutrient on a phytoplankton species could be lagged i e from days to months because of the biological time needed for the species to accomplish reproduction or multiplication similarly the response of a zooplankton species to an increase of food source e g phytoplankton can be numerically visible once it produced offspring a process that takes a few weeks to a few months aberle et al 2012 to account for possible lagged causal relationships among ecological time series ccm was also performed for two consecutive time lags for each time series hereafter called time lag1 tl1 and time lag2 tl2 the ecological interactions therefore ranged from instantaneous i e time lag0 tl0 to 39 4days for lake geneva 35 2days for lake bourget and 47 6days for lake annecy i e time lag2 tl2 2 time intervals between consecutive measurements for ccm of all pairs of ecological variables the time delay was set at 1 for the state space reconstructions in all the analyses differences in the accuracy of environmental and ecological quantifications due to differences in sampling methods may have biased the identification of causal relationships by affecting the cross mapping results nonetheless among the few studies that used ccm to seek causal relationships pairs of variables could be especially diverse e g cosmic rays vs earth global temperature tsonis et al 2015 temperature reconstructed from the vostok ice core vs insolation van nes et al 2015 as a consequence the different sampling methods used in this study were not expected to induce artifact ccm outputs 2 4 network metrics causal networks were produced from significant causal relationships identified using ccm a hierarchical structure based on conventional trophic levels i e the trophic level 0 for nutrients temperature 1 for phytoplankton and 2 for zooplankton was retained to ease the graphical representation fig 1 five different ecological interaction metrics were retained to characterize the causal relationships indirect bottom up i e nutrients force zooplankton bottom up i e nutrients force phytoplankton competition i e phytoplankton force phytoplankton or zooplankton force zooplankton indirect top down i e zooplankton force nutrients and top down i e zooplankton force phytoplankton different metrics were used to characterize network topology and the status of ecological variables within the causal networks the network topology metrics were the total number of links the linkage density which is the number of links i e causal interactions l divided by the number of nodes i e ecological variables n and the connectance expressed as l n n 1 because self connections are not considered i e a variable cannot cause its own dynamic complementarily the pagerank page 1998 and the cheirank i e pagerank computed using inverted direction were used to characterize the implication of the ecological variables in information flow within the causal networks historical development and a thorough mathematical description of the pagerank can be found in franceschet 2010 and langville and meyer 2006 respectively briefly three distinct characteristics of a node determine its pagerank the number of ingoing links the number of outgoing links of the linked nodes and the pagerank of the linked nodes computation of pagerank accounts for a damping parameter i e α describing the probability 1 α for a random surfer to jump to any node of the directed network the more time spent by the random surfer on a node the higher the pagerank of the node will be by convention α was set at 0 85 a 2 dimensional representation of pagerank and cheirank for the different nodes of the directed networks was conducted similar to ermann et al 2012 to classify the ecological variables summarizing their tendency to be dynamic constrained variable i e pagerank and dynamic forcing variable i e cheirank all networks and the associated metrics were produced using the igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 and network butts 2015 packages in r the abbreviations of the variables used in the causal networks were 1 for zooplankton daphnia sp daphn cyclops sp cyclp

provided in supplementary data to conduct the analyses considering lake annecy as an example 3 results the ecological time series for the three lakes were characterized by different dynamical features according to the e and θ values fig 2 appendix 1 in supplementary material for single time series metrics specifically e significantly differed among lakes kruskal wallis test χ2 7 88 p 0 02 and tended to increase from lake annecy to lake geneva but not among ecological components kruskal wallis test χ2 4 63 p 0 1 this pattern suggests an increase in the dimensionality of the time series according to lake size see table 1 for lake size as well as appendix 3 in supplementary material among all time series 60 exhibited e values lower than 6 indicating that the number of variables governing their dynamics would be relatively restricted an overwhelming proportion of the ecological time series analyzed exhibited nonlinear behavior with 79 of the time series with θ 0 5 fig 2 θ differed among both lakes and ecological components kruskal wallis tests p 0 01 fig 2 appendix 3 in supplementary material θ values were higher for lake geneva compared to lake annecy and lake bourget and were also higher for nutrient temperature than for phytoplankton while zooplankton had intermediate θ values that did not differ from the two other ecological components fig 2 appendix 3 in supplementary material there was no relationship between θ and e linear model f 0 005 p 0 93 suggesting that in these lakes the nonlinear behavior of the time series of interest may not be driven by the number of interacting variables the nonlinearity of the ecological time series suggests that ccm could be suitable for identifying causal relationships a large proportion of the time series exhibited significant annual cycles i e 36 47 and 79 of the time series for lakes annecy bourget and geneva respectively with maximal values occurring at different months of the year fig 3 most of these time series were also characterized by a significant decrease in forecast skill with time prediction i e 60 69 and 57 of the time series for lakes annecy bourget and geneva respectively making them suitable for subsequent analyses the number of significant causal relationships identified by ccm was highly variable between the three lakes while being rather stable for the different time lags fig 4 table 2 and six pairs of cyclic time series were deleted because their causal relationships were possibly due to external forcing table 3 lake annecy had the lowest number of significant causal relationships while the relationships were similar for lake bourget and lake geneva the average number of links per node was higher in lake geneva compared to lake bourget due to the different numbers of nodes table 2 as a consequence the connectance of the networks increased progressively from lake annecy to lake bourget and lake geneva table 2 the functional interactions detected dominance in the bottom up interactions either indirect i e lake annecy direct i e lake bourget or both i e lake geneva fig 5 this pattern was especially conservative among the different time lags and the other functional interactions i e competition and top down control appeared marginal there were no significant differences in the extent of the causal relationships i e rho among the time lags kruskal wallis tests p 0 25 indicating that causal relationships would expand over time lake annecy represents a simple case in which phytoplankton was not involved in any causal relationship consequently the pagerank identified zooplankton as the main forced ecological component while the cheirank highlighted nutrients as forcing on zooplankton fig 6 pagerank and cheirank significantly differed among ecological components kruskal wallis tests p 0 01 with zooplankton exhibiting higher pageranks followed by phytoplankton and nutrients temperature while the opposite pattern was found using cheirank fig 6 note that varying the damping parameter α had a very weak influence on the calculated indices indicating the robustness of the indices to α appendix 4 in supplementary material the 2 dimensional representation of pagerank and cheirank in lake annecy revealed orthophosphate followed by temperature as the main driving variables while the zooplankton species appeared to be constrained variables fig 7 for lake bourget and lake geneva temperature was the most forcing variable within the causal networks according to the cheiranks of the different time lags in lake bourget orthophosphate appeared to be both a forcing and a subordinate variable as indicated by its intermediate cheirank and high pagerank most of the other nutrients had both low pageranks and cheiranks indicating that they were poorly connected to the other variables within the networks in contrast several phytoplankton species as well as daphnia sp exhibited high pageranks highlighting their subordination to the other variables considered especially temperature and phosphorus fig 7 among the zooplankton species most of the causal relationships were indirect bottom up associated with several direct and indirect top down causal relationships leading to intermediate values for both pagerank and cheirank fig 7 4 discussion complex and nonlinear dynamics can be identified from high frequency records in contrast to data averaging which smooths intrinsic dynamical variability sugihara et al 1999 hsieh and ohman 2006 therefore the long term i e several decades high temporal resolution i e weekly to monthly data considered in this study appeared especially suitable to the search for possible nonlinear dynamics and weak causal links sugihara et al 2012 mccann et al 1998 complementarily the time lags considered i e up to two months were retained to match the lifespans of a large number of phytoplankton and zooplankton species e g most copepod species complete their life cycles within two months to account for the lags in ecological responses following causal interactions among ecological components 4 1 complexity of the ecological time series almost all of the analyzed time series for the three lakes exhibited θ values greater than zero indicating nonlinear dynamics although the origin of the nonlinearity cannot be directly identified using the current methods the relevant implications of this result lie in the fact that most of the ecological variables analyzed can intrinsically exhibit sudden variations and threshold responses due to their state dependence behaviors when interacting with other variables this specific feature could not currently be accounted for by classic linear approaches justifying the use of the nonlinear models interestingly nutrient temperature exhibited greater non linearity compared to phytoplankton and zooplankton perhaps due to the control of both physical and biological processes over nutrient temperature dynamics for instance concentrations of orthophosphate can be replenished in the water column following turnover or flood events over short time scales jeppesen et al 2009 minor et al 2014 while the release of phosphorus from the sediment into the water column will be caused by the onset of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion wetzel 2001 which can occur and disappear following turnover at variable times over the year a pattern characterized by increasing nonlinearity with lake size was also observed among phytoplankton species therefore phytoplankton species tend to exhibit an increasing variability and successions of bursts and collapses as the lake size increases such a pattern may partly be due to hydrodynamic forcing characterized by a turbulent regime etemad shahidi and imberger 2001 exhibiting intrinsic nonlinearity turbulent hydrodynamics are expected to increase with lake size rohweder et al 2008 wüest and lorke 2003 and are especially active in lake geneva bouffard and lemmin 2013 during the stratified period lake geneva is prone to internal kelvin and poincaré wave activities bouffard and lemmin 2013 these waves are present in all aquatic system large enough to have internal flow deviated by the coriolis force and are not present on lakes bourget and annecy bouffard comm pers the dynamics of theses waves leads to a different spatial and temporal kinetic energy transfer than standard internal seiches not affected by coriolis forces which may support the high nonlinearity of phytoplankton time series in lake geneva compared to the other two lakes in contrast to zooplankton which exhibits active swimming haupt et al 2009 ringelberg 2010 and may compensate for hydrodynamic constraints phytoplankton species could be more sensitive to turbulence which may explain the increasing nonlinearity with lake size for this ecological component interestingly the embedding dimensions did not differ among the different ecological components and were relatively low i e mean e 4 suggesting that the nonlinearity of the time series may be driven by a restricted number of forcing variables that are likely different for the different ecological components as previously discussed the overall increase in e with lake size could be a consequence of an increase in hydrodynamic constraints with lake size the lack of a relationship between e and θ may indicate that the extent of the nonlinear behavior of the time series could be not directly related to the number of variables acting on the dynamic but rather to the intrinsic responses of the ecological variable to the interacting forcings the association of the nonlinear signal the relatively low dimensionality and the significant decay of predictive skill with time i e a prerequisite considered in the analysis see methods provided the hallmarks of complex and chaotic dynamics for the analyzed time series according to sugihara and may 1990 hence nonlinear methods are expected to be more suitable for identifying the relationships among these time series compared to linear approaches even considering different time lags see appendix 5 in supplementary material for a comparison of the performance of ccm relative to linear additive and cross correlation models using up to 10 time lags 4 2 ecological interactions within causal networks the average number of links per node and the connectance of the networks were low suggesting either that the causal relationships were too weak to be detected using ccm or that a large number of possible interactions were not realized the first hypothesis seems to be more likely because highly resolved empirical food webs are characterized by a large number of weak links emmerson and yearsley 2004 neutel et al 2007 which may limit ccm s ability to detect ecological causation both top down and bottom up interactions were identified among the three lakes our results were similar to those of liu et al 2014 who found coexistence between these two directional controls in georges bank an american continental shelf ecosystem however in the present study the networks highlighted the dominance of bottom up controls i e either direct or indirect in driving the dynamics of higher ecological components i e phytoplankton and zooplankton confirming our initial hypothesis this finding is consistent with those of previous studies indicating that bottom up control is an important forcing in large and deep lakes moss et al 1994 anneville and pelletier 2000 wetzel 2001 alric et al 2013 this bottom up control may originate from the relatively low phosphorus content of the lakes over the studied period i e 100μgl 1 fostering the nutrient limitation constraint for phytoplankton growth similar results were obtained by bai et al 2015 who determined that bottom up processes mediated by temperature control the trophic structure of the east china sea interestingly the large amount of indirect bottom up causal relationships likely highlights transitivity in causation sugihara et al 2012 ye et al 2015b evidencing that nutrient temperature control can be readily transmitted through the ecological networks up to several trophic levels this result may be explained by the fact that the zooplankton fed on a large number of phytoplankton species many of which were not considered in the networks e g picophytoplankton zhong et al 2013 because phytoplankton will be forced by nutrients the amount of nutrient information encoded in the phytoplankton dynamics may be cumulatively transmitted to the zooplankton i e the sum of the nutrient information transferred to the zooplankton could be roughly equal to that of the sum of the phytoplankton prey fostering the detection of significant causal relationships between nutrient and zooplankton the different time lags provided very similar results suggesting that the causal relationships remained consistent from instantaneous to medium time scales i e tl2 month scale this result supports our initial expectation and could indicate that although ecological interactions operate instantaneously e g the uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton their dynamical consequences may propagate over time this feature may be interpreted as a temporal transitivity of causal relationships from tl0 to tl1 and tl2 for instance the uptake of nutrients by algae can lead to an increase in abundance with a time lag of several weeks biggs and close 1989 and several physiological features such as luxury nutrient uptake sterner and elser 2002 can delay the effects of nutrients on phytoplankton dynamics 4 3 network metrics a large number of network metrics have been developed and are routinely used to quantify network structure deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 however many of these metrics do not account for the link directionality e g node degree or clustering coefficient which was of central concern in the present study pagerank and cheirank have been specifically designed to account for link directionality and therefore appeared to be especially informative indeed they accounted for both the direction and the amount of causal relationships for the studied node and the associated linked nodes this complementarity enabled a straightforward classification of each node reinforcing the global bottom up control in the three lakes interestingly a general inverse relationship seemed to emerge from the dual representation of these two metrics suggesting that there may be a global organization in which the ecological components are either drivers or subordinates but rarely both a similar pervasive pattern has recently been shown by ermann et al 2012 for different large networks this pattern could provide a representation of the global directional causality within ecological networks however a few phytoplankton species and some nutrients did not conform to this pattern for instance in lake bourget chlorella sp at time lag2 i e chlrl2 and monoraphidium sp at time lag2 i e mnrph2 had high cheiranks because the cheirank of a node tends to increase when the sum of the cheirank of the outgoing links are high 4 4 limitations and future prospects the ability to detect weak causal relationships increases with the length of a time series as a consequence of the progressive fulfilling of the reconstructed attractor that supports ccm however even the shortest time series length i e lake annecy 183 time points was much longer than the minimal time series length suggested as necessary to identify causation between two variables i e 25 time points clark et al 2015 additionally the average number of links per node was similar between lake annecy and lake geneva although the time series differed 227 time points for the former and 871 time points for the latter as a result it is unlikely that the network structures obtained for the three lakes and the different time lags were due to the length of the time series furthermore it can be noticed that the grouping of links among ecological interactions represented as relative proportions would also limit the possible bias related to different time series lengths highlighting the consistent dominance of bottom up interactions among the three lakes a potential issue associated with these long term time series lies in the changes to the environmental variables over the last decades indeed because the three lakes have been re oligotrophicated during this period the causal relationships among the ecological variables could have varied as well for instance phosphorus may have become more limiting as its concentration has decreased possibly leading to greater control over phytoplankton and thus a stronger causal relationship although understanding these possible temporal variations in causation among the ecological components of the lakes is beyond the scope of this study the analyses conducted here could be performed separately for different decades one of the goals of the present study was analyzing the causal relationships between ecological variables at a fine taxonomic scale i e species or family but adequate ccm has several prerequisites e g species abundances greater than zero for most of the time series and the decay of forecast skill with time see clark et al 2015 for detailed criteria unfortunately most of the phytoplankton and zooplankton species monitored during the survey of the lakes did not meet these criteria and could not be considered in the analysis these constraints potentially limited the implications of the causal networks obtained in this study to the depiction of the ecological causations for these lakes a possible approach to preventing this issue could be pooling the different species into functional groups deyle et al 2016 finally a promising approach would be to conduct empirical dynamic modeling after ccm to determine the relationships among different ecological variables ye et al 2015a and to identify the variations in ecological

25351,ecological dynamics often exhibit significant temporal variability and sudden shifts that characterize their non equilibrium and nonlinear nature challenging our ability to understand and predict their trajectories among a set of ecological time series originating from the long term monitoring of three large and deep lakes nonlinear forecasting methods simplex projection and s map indicated that most of the time series exhibited hallmarks of complex dynamics in the form of nonlinear behaviors convergent cross mapping ccm was used to estimate the causal relationships among these time series by considering different time lags the significant causal relationships were then used to construct causal networks from which nodes were characterized using pagerank and cheirank for the three lakes the dominance of bottom up control was revealed and was mostly indirect i e nutrient forcing zooplankton this result likely evidences the transitivity of the causal relationships obtained by ccm as well as the mixed phytoplankton diet of zooplankton species limiting the identification of causal relationships among these two ecological components complementarily the consistence of causal relationships for the different time lags may highlight a temporal transitivity by which the instantaneous causal signal was transmitted over time the dual representation of both pagerank and cheirank provided a straightforward classification of each node and enabled their thorough implications in the information flow within the causal networks the complementary use of ccm and network metrics constituted an efficient way to delineate ecological causation using a high resolution time series for which linear methods performed poorly and provided insights into the dynamic hierarchy of the different ecological variables in aquatic ecosystems keywords nonlinear dynamics convergent cross mapping causality ecological interaction network bottom up control 1 introduction the relative implication of bottom up and top down controls in driving ecological dynamics is of central interest in ecology the early investigations highlighting a strong influence of nutrients on algal dynamics i e bottom up control schindler 1978 have been challenged by the evidenced role of trophic cascade on ecosystem processes i e top down control paine 1980 carpenter and kitchell 1985 since then a large number of studies have been conducted on lakes carpenter et al 1995 currie et al 1999 jeppesen et al 1997 mesocosms sinistro 2009 or using paleolimnological reconstructions perga et al 2010 to decipher their relative implications on food web dynamics nonetheless the quantification of the direction and strength of ecological links in food webs remains a spurious task because of their diversity e g direct and indirect and variation over time berlow et al 2004 wootton and emmerson 2005 deyle et al 2016 lynam et al 2017 additionally when extensive datasets are available ecological dynamics i e time series can often seem erratic possibly punctuated by sudden episodic bursts seemingly unrelated to any other putative causal variables this particular feature lies in their nonlinearity which is characterized by state dependent behavior the effect of one variable on another is dependent on the states of other variables in the system dixon et al 1999 anderson et al 2008 deyle et al 2013 glaser et al 2013 in this context ecological dynamics can appear correlated or not despite their causal association remaining constant a phenomenon called mirage correlation sugihara et al 2012 as a consequence conventional correlation analyses can appear unsuitable for identifying the causal ecological links used to infer the relative role of bottom up and top down controls an alternative view to correlative approaches one that allows the assumptions of equilibrium stability and stationarity to be relaxed can be found in a flexible nonparametric class of nonlinear forecasting models sugihara 1994 sugihara and may 1990 that are based on state space reconstructions these models have shown impressive performance for forecasting complex ecological dynamics dixon et al 1999 glaser et al 2013 recently an extension of these models called convergent cross mapping ccm has been developed to identify causal relationships in weakly coupled nonlinear systems sugihara et al 2012 ccm relies on takens theorem takens 1981 which states that a shadow attractor reconstruction from the lags of a single one dimensional variable conserves the mathematical properties of the original attractor of the full dynamical system sugihara et al 2012 takens 1981 deyle and sugihara 2011 as a consequence if two variables belong to the same dynamical system meaning that they are causally coupled their respective dynamics could be mutually predicted based on the local neighborhoods of their shadow attractors sugihara et al 2012 additionally the accuracy of the forecasts i e the cross mapping between the two shadow attractors would increase along with the length of the time series i e library length thus exhibiting convergence as long as the shadow attractors became progressively denser and fulfill the historical dynamics due to this convergence property ccm can further identify directional coupling the higher a forcing dynamically constrains a subordinate variable the more the amount of information about the forcing variable i e causal imprint will be encoded in the constrained variable sugihara et al 2012 complementarily because causation is transitive the causal imprint of a forcing can expand beyond its directly constrained variables to be encoded in other indirectly interacting variables sugihara et al 2012 although the extent of the causal imprint decreases as the causal coupling becomes more indirect ye et al 2015b recent valuable examples of the use of ccm can be found in tsonis et al 2015 which addressed the causal influence of cosmic rays on the earth s global temperature variability and in van nes et al 2015 which identified bi directional causal relationships associated with lagged responses between the global earth s temperature and greenhouse gases in this study we aim to couple ccm and network analyses to reveal causal links among the ecological components i e nutrient temperature phytoplankton and zooplankton of the three largest french lakes using time series obtained from long term monitoring this approach was designed to account for direct and indirect causal links therefore possibly evidencing the relative implication of bottom up and top down controls considering the pelagic zones of these three large lakes was expected to be especially suitable for delineating the relative controls driving the ecological dynamics because the implication of littoral and terrestrial environments have been shown to impact negligibly the pelagic zones of such large systems perga and gerdeaux 2004 vadeboncoeur et al 2008 we expected that because of the relatively low nutrient levels and the large size of the lakes the ecological dynamics would be mostly constrained by bottom up control as suggested by jeppesen et al 1997 though never tested using the present methodology complementarily the bottom up control may be strong enough to be transmitted up to the highest food web level considered in this study i e zooplankton characterizing indirect bottom up relationships different time lags in the causal interactions were accounted for to test the robustness of the causal relationships over time we hypothesized a conservative structure of the causal network over time signifying both a lag in ecological response to a driver as well as a transmission of the instantaneous causal relationship over time prior to performing ccm the dynamic features i e dimensionality and nonlinearity of the time series were analyzed providing insights about their complexity and nonlinear behavior justifying the need for nonlinear methods to correctly model and predict their dynamics 2 methods 2 1 study sites and ecological time series lakes annecy geneva and bourget are three large and deep lakes lying on the western border of the french alps they lie in a similar climatic i e mean annual temperature of 11 c and geologic i e carbonate bed rocks context and their main environmental features are provided in table 1 they share a common eutrophication history yet to different extents during the middle of the 20th century before remediation programs led to efficient re oligotrophication by the end of the last century that has persisted to the present berthon et al 2013 despite the availability of data since the first half of the 20th century observatory on alpine lakes www6 inra fr soere ola most environmental and ecological variables have not been continuously monitored prior to the implementation of rigorous monitoring for management at different time periods for the three lakes in the 1970s for lake geneva 41 years since 2003 for lake bourget 12 years and since 2004 for lake annecy 11 years data source soere ola is inra thonon les bains cipel sila cisalb date of download 20 10 2015 developed by inra eco informatics for each lake samples were collected at a single site located at the deepest part of the lake although biological and chemical variables can exhibit spatial variability ongoing spatial analyses no shown suggest that the sampling sites were representative the actual status of the studied variables at a lake level the parts of the time series for which nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton data were available but at sampling frequencies varying from weekly to monthly were considered among the numerous species of phytoplankton and zooplankton identified over the monitored period those whose occurrence was 50 were excluded from the datasets time series were standardized and then interpolated using a monotonic hermite spline so that they exhibited identical and regularly spaced numbers of observations see appendix 1 in supplementary material for the number of initial and interpolated data fig 1 the possible effect of such an interpolation method on the nonlinear signal and the identification of causal relationships was assessed using a random and nonlinear time series by randomly deleting a variable number of time points i e 1 2 5 10 15 and 20 as inputs to the spline appendix 2 in supplementary material these preliminary investigations suggested that the methods used were robust to the extent of interpolation using the monotonic hermite spline considered in this study the datasets for the three lakes were then represented as follows 761 observations for lake geneva time interval 19 7days 227 observations for lake bourget time interval 17 6days and 183 observations for lake annecy time interval 23 8days the difference in time intervals between lakes originates from the differences in sampling frequencies of their regular monitoring we chose not to reduce them to a common time interval to preserve the highest time frequency for each lake keeping in mind that differences in the lengths of the time series may influence their dynamical characteristics as well as the identification of causal relationships these were especially long compared to other studies e g glaser et al 2013 liu et al 2014 consequently providing a limited bias of their dynamical properties 2 2 characterizing time series dynamics two different metrics e and θ were considered to characterize the time series dynamics i e their complexity using simplex projection and the extent of their non linearity using s maps respectively fig 1 the complexity of each time series was assessed by estimating their embedding dimension e which represents the minimum number of lagged variables needed to unfold the attractor so that the trajectories do not overlap from an ecological perspective e characterizes its dimensionality according to the whitney embedding theorem whitney 1936 and allows an estimate of the number of key variables involved in the dynamic i e having a causal influence the e value that best characterizes the time series was identified using simplex projection sugihara and may 1990 which tests the ability of a process to predict its own dynamic by generating a state space the state space is constructed using multiple lagged observations of the single process that leads to a multivariate coordinate space and the forecasts are estimated by weight averaging the observed dynamics i e nearest neighbor vectors at nearby points in the reconstructed state space forecast accuracy varies according to the number of lagged observations used to produce the state space therefore as a function of e the best e was retained to maximize the forecast skill rho which is the predictive forecasting power deyle et al 2013 with a maximum value of 6 to prevent over fitting clark et al 2015 the extent of the nonlinearity of the time series that is the state dependence of the system dynamics was quantified regarding the nonlinear tuning parameter i e theta θ from the s map model sugihara 1994 θ attributes a weight to the variable of the library vectors used to produce the forecast for θ 0 all library vectors are given equal weight and as a consequence the model is linear and can be regarded as an autoregressive model of order e as θ increases the library vectors nearest the prediction vector are increasingly weighted therefore the system exhibits a greater state dependence as θ increases and the nearby points in the state space become more important for forecasting a series of s map models were conducted using different θ ranging from 0 to 10 the θ retained to characterize the time series was the one that maximizes the forecast skill e is also an input to the s map model for which we used the best e values previously estimated by simplex projection more detailed descriptions of simplex projection and the s map model can be found in dixon et al 1999 deyle et al 2013 and landini et al 2002 the simplex and s map functions of the r package redm ye et al 2016 were used to estimate the best e and θ using leave one out cross validation i e removing one observation from the time series and using the rest of the time series to forecast its dynamics 2 3 convergent cross mapping ccm ccm seeks causation between two time series x and y by looking at the correspondence of their shadow attractors i e mx and my respectively built using lagged coordinates of these time series that equals e if x causes y then it should be possible to estimate x from y and ccm assesses to what extent y can estimate the states of x that are cross mapping x using my i e x my in practice a number of nearest neighbors is defined in my for each time point t i e the closest time points in my for each time point t allowing an estimation for each time point t of x from my i e x ˆ t my a pearson coefficient correlation rho is then calculated between x t and x ˆ t my the number of nearest neighbors also called the library length is used to generate x ˆ t my ranges from e to the maximal length of the time series if x causes y ccm should indicate convergence meaning that as the number of nearest neighbors used in the library increases the predictive skill assessed by rho should also increase differences in the extent of convergence are then considered to be a practical metric for estimating the extent of the causal relationships the value of rho ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 and quantifies the deterministic signal in the data i e a measure of prediction accuracy that can be compared between datasets however negative values of rho could not be significant otherwise indicating errors in computing or an incomplete embedding to estimate the statistical significance of this causal signal a nonparametric bootstrapping routine using 1000 iterations was conducted using the multispatialccm r package clark et al 2015 fig 1 this approach has been shown to detect effective causal relationships even in the presence of process noise and observation error clark et al 2015 the best e obtained from simplex projection was retained to conduct ccm the significant decrease of predictive skill significantly along with the length of time prediction was assessed using a simple linear model i e function ssr check signal from the multispatialccm package this is required although insufficient condition for determining nonlinearity sugihara 1994 all of the time series that did not fulfill this condition were not considered for this analysis sugihara 1994 clark et al 2015 in some cases where an external forcing overwhelmingly influences the system variables ccm might conclude causal relationships that do not exist sugihara et al 2012 such synchrony may confound ccm analysis therefore the occurrence of cyclic patterns in time series was estimated using an ornstein uhlenbeck state space model that accounts for non negligible long term correlations over time which are often found in ecological time series using the peacots r package louca and doebeli 2015 for any combination implying two significantly cyclical time series the surrogate method was used to test the null hypothesis that the time series are dynamically unrelated clark et al 2015 briefly this method was used to compute one thousand mean annual trends which are similar to annually cyclical data for which the residuals were shuffled because the ecological time series were especially long the threshold to reject this null expectation was set at 0 001 ecological interactions are not always dynamically expressed instantaneously and their consequences can lag over different timescales for instance the observable effect of temperature or nutrient on a phytoplankton species could be lagged i e from days to months because of the biological time needed for the species to accomplish reproduction or multiplication similarly the response of a zooplankton species to an increase of food source e g phytoplankton can be numerically visible once it produced offspring a process that takes a few weeks to a few months aberle et al 2012 to account for possible lagged causal relationships among ecological time series ccm was also performed for two consecutive time lags for each time series hereafter called time lag1 tl1 and time lag2 tl2 the ecological interactions therefore ranged from instantaneous i e time lag0 tl0 to 39 4days for lake geneva 35 2days for lake bourget and 47 6days for lake annecy i e time lag2 tl2 2 time intervals between consecutive measurements for ccm of all pairs of ecological variables the time delay was set at 1 for the state space reconstructions in all the analyses differences in the accuracy of environmental and ecological quantifications due to differences in sampling methods may have biased the identification of causal relationships by affecting the cross mapping results nonetheless among the few studies that used ccm to seek causal relationships pairs of variables could be especially diverse e g cosmic rays vs earth global temperature tsonis et al 2015 temperature reconstructed from the vostok ice core vs insolation van nes et al 2015 as a consequence the different sampling methods used in this study were not expected to induce artifact ccm outputs 2 4 network metrics causal networks were produced from significant causal relationships identified using ccm a hierarchical structure based on conventional trophic levels i e the trophic level 0 for nutrients temperature 1 for phytoplankton and 2 for zooplankton was retained to ease the graphical representation fig 1 five different ecological interaction metrics were retained to characterize the causal relationships indirect bottom up i e nutrients force zooplankton bottom up i e nutrients force phytoplankton competition i e phytoplankton force phytoplankton or zooplankton force zooplankton indirect top down i e zooplankton force nutrients and top down i e zooplankton force phytoplankton different metrics were used to characterize network topology and the status of ecological variables within the causal networks the network topology metrics were the total number of links the linkage density which is the number of links i e causal interactions l divided by the number of nodes i e ecological variables n and the connectance expressed as l n n 1 because self connections are not considered i e a variable cannot cause its own dynamic complementarily the pagerank page 1998 and the cheirank i e pagerank computed using inverted direction were used to characterize the implication of the ecological variables in information flow within the causal networks historical development and a thorough mathematical description of the pagerank can be found in franceschet 2010 and langville and meyer 2006 respectively briefly three distinct characteristics of a node determine its pagerank the number of ingoing links the number of outgoing links of the linked nodes and the pagerank of the linked nodes computation of pagerank accounts for a damping parameter i e α describing the probability 1 α for a random surfer to jump to any node of the directed network the more time spent by the random surfer on a node the higher the pagerank of the node will be by convention α was set at 0 85 a 2 dimensional representation of pagerank and cheirank for the different nodes of the directed networks was conducted similar to ermann et al 2012 to classify the ecological variables summarizing their tendency to be dynamic constrained variable i e pagerank and dynamic forcing variable i e cheirank all networks and the associated metrics were produced using

provided in supplementary data to conduct the analyses considering lake annecy as an example 3 results the ecological time series for the three lakes were characterized by different dynamical features according to the e and θ values fig 2 appendix 1 in supplementary material for single time series metrics specifically e significantly differed among lakes kruskal wallis test χ2 7 88 p 0 02 and tended to increase from lake annecy to lake geneva but not among ecological components kruskal wallis test χ2 4 63 p 0 1 this pattern suggests an increase in the dimensionality of the time series according to lake size see table 1 for lake size as well as appendix 3 in supplementary material among all time series 60 exhibited e values lower than 6 indicating that the number of variables governing their dynamics would be relatively restricted an overwhelming proportion of the ecological time series analyzed exhibited nonlinear behavior with 79 of the time series with θ 0 5 fig 2 θ differed among both lakes and ecological components kruskal wallis tests p 0 01 fig 2 appendix 3 in supplementary material θ values were higher for lake geneva compared to lake annecy and lake bourget and were also higher for nutrient temperature than for phytoplankton while zooplankton had intermediate θ values that did not differ from the two other ecological components fig 2 appendix 3 in supplementary material there was no relationship between θ and e linear model f 0 005 p 0 93 suggesting that in these lakes the nonlinear behavior of the time series of interest may not be driven by the number of interacting variables the nonlinearity of the ecological time series suggests that ccm could be suitable for identifying causal relationships a large proportion of the time series exhibited significant annual cycles i e 36 47 and 79 of the time series for lakes annecy bourget and geneva respectively with maximal values occurring at different months of the year fig 3 most of these time series were also characterized by a significant decrease in forecast skill with time prediction i e 60 69 and 57 of the time series for lakes annecy bourget and geneva respectively making them suitable for subsequent analyses the number of significant causal relationships identified by ccm was highly variable between the three lakes while being rather stable for the different time lags fig 4 table 2 and six pairs of cyclic time series were deleted because their causal relationships were possibly due to external forcing table 3 lake annecy had the lowest number of significant causal relationships while the relationships were similar for lake bourget and lake geneva the average number of links per node was higher in lake geneva compared to lake bourget due to the different numbers of nodes table 2 as a consequence the connectance of the networks increased progressively from lake annecy to lake bourget and lake geneva table 2 the functional interactions detected dominance in the bottom up interactions either indirect i e lake annecy direct i e lake bourget or both i e lake geneva fig 5 this pattern was especially conservative among the different time lags and the other functional interactions i e competition and top down control appeared marginal there were no significant differences in the extent of the causal relationships i e rho among the time lags kruskal wallis tests p 0 25 indicating that causal relationships would expand over time lake annecy represents a simple case in which phytoplankton was not involved in any causal relationship consequently the pagerank identified zooplankton as the main forced ecological component while the cheirank highlighted nutrients as forcing on zooplankton fig 6 pagerank and cheirank significantly differed among ecological components kruskal wallis tests p 0 01 with zooplankton exhibiting higher pageranks followed by phytoplankton and nutrients temperature while the opposite pattern was found using cheirank fig 6 note that varying the damping parameter α had a very weak influence on the calculated indices indicating the robustness of the indices to α appendix 4 in supplementary material the 2 dimensional representation of pagerank and cheirank in lake annecy revealed orthophosphate followed by temperature as the main driving variables while the zooplankton species appeared to be constrained variables fig 7 for lake bourget and lake geneva temperature was the most forcing variable within the causal networks according to the cheiranks of the different time lags in lake bourget orthophosphate appeared to be both a forcing and a subordinate variable as indicated by its intermediate cheirank and high pagerank most of the other nutrients had both low pageranks and cheiranks indicating that they were poorly connected to the other variables within the networks in contrast several phytoplankton species as well as daphnia sp exhibited high pageranks highlighting their subordination to the other variables considered especially temperature and phosphorus fig 7 among the zooplankton species most of the causal relationships were indirect bottom up associated with several direct and indirect top down causal relationships leading to intermediate values for both pagerank and cheirank fig 7 4 discussion complex and nonlinear dynamics can be identified from high frequency records in contrast to data averaging which smooths intrinsic dynamical variability sugihara et al 1999 hsieh and ohman 2006 therefore the long term i e several decades high temporal resolution i e weekly to monthly data considered in this study appeared especially suitable to the search for possible nonlinear dynamics and weak causal links sugihara et al 2012 mccann et al 1998 complementarily the time lags considered i e up to two months were retained to match the lifespans of a large number of phytoplankton and zooplankton species e g most copepod species complete their life cycles within two months to account for the lags in ecological responses following causal interactions among ecological components 4 1 complexity of the ecological time series almost all of the analyzed time series for the three lakes exhibited θ values greater than zero indicating nonlinear dynamics although the origin of the nonlinearity cannot be directly identified using the current methods the relevant implications of this result lie in the fact that most of the ecological variables analyzed can intrinsically exhibit sudden variations and threshold responses due to their state dependence behaviors when interacting with other variables this specific feature could not currently be accounted for by classic linear approaches justifying the use of the nonlinear models interestingly nutrient temperature exhibited greater non linearity compared to phytoplankton and zooplankton perhaps due to the control of both physical and biological processes over nutrient temperature dynamics for instance concentrations of orthophosphate can be replenished in the water column following turnover or flood events over short time scales jeppesen et al 2009 minor et al 2014 while the release of phosphorus from the sediment into the water column will be caused by the onset of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion wetzel 2001 which can occur and disappear following turnover at variable times over the year a pattern characterized by increasing nonlinearity with lake size was also observed among phytoplankton species therefore phytoplankton species tend to exhibit an increasing variability and successions of bursts and collapses as the lake size increases such a pattern may partly be due to hydrodynamic forcing characterized by a turbulent regime etemad shahidi and imberger 2001 exhibiting intrinsic nonlinearity turbulent hydrodynamics are expected to increase with lake size rohweder et al 2008 wüest and lorke 2003 and are especially active in lake geneva bouffard and lemmin 2013 during the stratified period lake geneva is prone to internal kelvin and poincaré wave activities bouffard and lemmin 2013 these waves are present in all aquatic system large enough to have internal flow deviated by the coriolis force and are not present on lakes bourget and annecy bouffard comm pers the dynamics of theses waves leads to a different spatial and temporal kinetic energy transfer than standard internal seiches not affected by coriolis forces which may support the high nonlinearity of phytoplankton time series in lake geneva compared to the other two lakes in contrast to zooplankton which exhibits active swimming haupt et al 2009 ringelberg 2010 and may compensate for hydrodynamic constraints phytoplankton species could be more sensitive to turbulence which may explain the increasing nonlinearity with lake size for this ecological component interestingly the embedding dimensions did not differ among the different ecological components and were relatively low i e mean e 4 suggesting that the nonlinearity of the time series may be driven by a restricted number of forcing variables that are likely different for the different ecological components as previously discussed the overall increase in e with lake size could be a consequence of an increase in hydrodynamic constraints with lake size the lack of a relationship between e and θ may indicate that the extent of the nonlinear behavior of the time series could be not directly related to the number of variables acting on the dynamic but rather to the intrinsic responses of the ecological variable to the interacting forcings the association of the nonlinear signal the relatively low dimensionality and the significant decay of predictive skill with time i e a prerequisite considered in the analysis see methods provided the hallmarks of complex and chaotic dynamics for the analyzed time series according to sugihara and may 1990 hence nonlinear methods are expected to be more suitable for identifying the relationships among these time series compared to linear approaches even considering different time lags see appendix 5 in supplementary material for a comparison of the performance of ccm relative to linear additive and cross correlation models using up to 10 time lags 4 2 ecological interactions within causal networks the average number of links per node and the connectance of the networks were low suggesting either that the causal relationships were too weak to be detected using ccm or that a large number of possible interactions were not realized the first hypothesis seems to be more likely because highly resolved empirical food webs are characterized by a large number of weak links emmerson and yearsley 2004 neutel et al 2007 which may limit ccm s ability to detect ecological causation both top down and bottom up interactions were identified among the three lakes our results were similar to those of liu et al 2014 who found coexistence between these two directional controls in georges bank an american continental shelf ecosystem however in the present study the networks highlighted the dominance of bottom up controls i e either direct or indirect in driving the dynamics of higher ecological components i e phytoplankton and zooplankton confirming our initial hypothesis this finding is consistent with those of previous studies indicating that bottom up control is an important forcing in large and deep lakes moss et al 1994 anneville and pelletier 2000 wetzel 2001 alric et al 2013 this bottom up control may originate from the relatively low phosphorus content of the lakes over the studied period i e 100μgl 1 fostering the nutrient limitation constraint for phytoplankton growth similar results were obtained by bai et al 2015 who determined that bottom up processes mediated by temperature control the trophic structure of the east china sea interestingly the large amount of indirect bottom up causal relationships likely highlights transitivity in causation sugihara et al 2012 ye et al 2015b evidencing that nutrient temperature control can be readily transmitted through the ecological networks up to several trophic levels this result may be explained by the fact that the zooplankton fed on a large number of phytoplankton species many of which were not considered in the networks e g picophytoplankton zhong et al 2013 because phytoplankton will be forced by nutrients the amount of nutrient information encoded in the phytoplankton dynamics may be cumulatively transmitted to the zooplankton i e the sum of the nutrient information transferred to the zooplankton could be roughly equal to that of the sum of the phytoplankton prey fostering the detection of significant causal relationships between nutrient and zooplankton the different time lags provided very similar results suggesting that the causal relationships remained consistent from instantaneous to medium time scales i e tl2 month scale this result supports our initial expectation and could indicate that although ecological interactions operate instantaneously e g the uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton their dynamical consequences may propagate over time this feature may be interpreted as a temporal transitivity of causal relationships from tl0 to tl1 and tl2 for instance the uptake of nutrients by algae can lead to an increase in abundance with a time lag of several weeks biggs and close 1989 and several physiological features such as luxury nutrient uptake sterner and elser 2002 can delay the effects of nutrients on phytoplankton dynamics 4 3 network metrics a large number of network metrics have been developed and are routinely used to quantify network structure deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 however many of these metrics do not account for the link directionality e g node degree or clustering coefficient which was of central concern in the present study pagerank and cheirank have been specifically designed to account for link directionality and therefore appeared to be especially informative indeed they accounted for both the direction and the amount of causal relationships for the studied node and the associated linked nodes this complementarity enabled a straightforward classification of each node reinforcing the global bottom up control in the three lakes interestingly a general inverse relationship seemed to emerge from the dual representation of these two metrics suggesting that there may be a global organization in which the ecological components are either drivers or subordinates but rarely both a similar pervasive pattern has recently been shown by ermann et al 2012 for different large networks this pattern could provide a representation of the global directional causality within ecological networks however a few phytoplankton species and some nutrients did not conform to this pattern for instance in lake bourget chlorella sp at time lag2 i e chlrl2 and monoraphidium sp at time lag2 i e mnrph2 had high cheiranks because the cheirank of a node tends to increase when the sum of the cheirank of the outgoing links are high 4 4 limitations and future prospects the ability to detect weak causal relationships increases with the length of a time series as a consequence of the progressive fulfilling of the reconstructed attractor that supports ccm however even the shortest time series length i e lake annecy 183 time points was much longer than the minimal time series length suggested as necessary to identify causation between two variables i e 25 time points clark et al 2015 additionally the average number of links per node was similar between lake annecy and lake geneva although the time series differed 227 time points for the former and 871 time points for the latter as a result it is unlikely that the network structures obtained for the three lakes and the different time lags were due to the length of the time series furthermore it can be noticed that the grouping of links among ecological interactions represented as relative proportions would also limit the possible bias related to different time series lengths highlighting the consistent dominance of bottom up interactions among the three lakes a potential issue associated with these long term time series lies in the changes to the environmental variables over the last decades indeed because the three lakes have been re oligotrophicated during this period the causal relationships among the ecological variables could have varied as well for instance phosphorus may have become more limiting as its concentration has decreased possibly leading to greater control over phytoplankton and thus a stronger causal relationship although understanding these possible temporal variations in causation among the ecological components of the lakes is beyond the scope of this study the analyses conducted here could be performed separately for different decades one of the goals of the present study was analyzing the causal relationships between ecological variables at a fine taxonomic scale i e species or family but adequate ccm has several prerequisites e g species abundances greater than zero for most of the time series and the decay of forecast skill with time see clark et al 2015 for detailed criteria unfortunately most of the phytoplankton and zooplankton species monitored during the survey of the lakes did not meet these criteria and could not be considered in the analysis these constraints potentially limited the implications of the causal networks obtained in this study to the depiction of the ecological causations for these lakes a possible approach to preventing this issue could be pooling the different species into functional groups deyle et al 2016 finally a promising approach would be to conduct empirical dynamic modeling after ccm to determine the relationships among different ecological variables ye et al 2015a and to identify the variations in ecological

25352,current methods of social network analysis need detailed data which are often unavailable for long periods of time e g decades the main objective of the present work is to develop and test a methodology that requires less detailed data and relies on user defined mathematical models this methodology is a three step procedure described as follows first long term population data is divided into n subsets based on the desired time unit e g months or years second a class of mathematical models are defined and fitted to each subset of data where growth migration and interaction parameters are estimated third time series of estimated parameter values are analyzed to detect trends periodic cycles and patterns of ecological dominance to examine the robustness of this method the annual competitive lotka volterra clv models were parametrized using the long term 1973 2003 population densities of five rodent species residing in kansas cotton rat cr prairie vole pv white footed mouse wfm deer mouse dm and western harvest mouse whm using the fourier series models fitted to the estimated parameter values we found that the periodic cycles of growth and competition rates were about 5 5 and 11 years for cr and about 2 6 3 8 years in all rodent species the linear regression models fitted to the estimated values indicate slight decreases in the growth rates of all species except pv the competing effects of pv on cr and wfm have decreased more than 11 4 whereas the competing effect of the dm on pv and wfm on dm and itself have increased by 15 4 25 8 and 14 9 respectively the estimated migration rates of dm and whm were mainly negative which indicates that these species were mainly migrating out of the study site all other three species had mainly positive migration rates the parametrized annual clv models were employed to analyze the formation of stable equilibria and to numerically investigate spatio temporal patterns of population densities we found that cr and pv were often dominant the present work is the first step towards employing user defined models compensating for the lack of long term detailed social network data keywords social network analysis lotka volterra model rodent species fourier series models 1 introduction social network analysis has been much appreciated for revealing causes and consequences of various interactions within and between wildlife communities bascompte 2009 krause et al 2009 wey et al 2008 this includes social network analysis of inter and intra specific competitions and their subsequent impacts on the population dynamics of interacting species araujo et al 2008 haulsee et al 2016 fisher et al 2016 despite being a promising tool there is currently no pertinent methodology for measuring long term changes in the social networks of interacting species this is mainly due to lack of long term e g decades detailed network data which is a major challenge in quantifying the long term network dynamics of interacting species in particular the current statistical methods allesina and levine 2011 bronstein 2009 dubowy 1988 fisher et al 2017 require detailed network data which are often unavailable for long periods of time unpacking wildlife social networks of species bascompte 2009 krause et al 2009 perkins et al 2009 shizuka and mcdonald 2012 wey et al 2008 has been mainly limited to short term study periods there is a critical need to develop a new methodology that requires less detailed data and it is capable of assessing the long term dynamics of social networks e g periodic cycles trends seasonality and ecological dominance for instance several long term trapping records of interacting species are available for a variety of interacting species these records can be used to obtain long term estimates of population densities as shown in the present work these estimates can serve as less detailed but available data the main objective of the present work is to develop and test a methodology that requires less detailed data for analyzing long term dynamics of wildlife social networks this methodology relies on user defined mathematical models which compensate for lack of detailed network data in particular if the type of interactions between and within species is known e g facilitation competition prey predator then details of the data related to that type of interaction in no longer necessary and the user can directly define them in the mathematical models therefore the user defined models can be fitted to the long term population estimates to quantify the dynamics of wildlife social networks the present work proposes a new methodology that can be utilized to obtain a deeper understanding of the ecology of interacting species a mathematical model is built based on certain assumptions related to the social network these assumptions play a key role in the model formulations if the assumptions are widely accepted then the model outcomes can detect and quantify several ecological phenomena present in the wildlife community a class of well studied mathematical models is known as lotka volterra lv models in particular a spatially homogeneous network of n interacting species with densities y i t is modeled by the following lv model 1 dy i t dt r i y i t 1 j 1 n α ij y i t k i where the positive constant r i is the population growth rate of species i k i is the carrying capacity of species i α ii 1 and α ij with i j 1 i j n is the interacting effect of species j on the population of species i model 1 has frequently been used by ecologists and analyzed by mathematicians for several decades geijzendorffer et al 2011 gyllenberg et al 2006 gyllenberg and yan 2009 knebel et al 2013 lian et al 2008 an n dimensional lv model represents the dynamics of n interacting species it is known that a two dimensional lv model cannot admit isolated periodic orbit hofbauer and sigmund 1998 that is if the system has periodic orbits then these orbits are non isolated the higher dimensions of the lv model exhibit rich dynamics in an lv model of n interacting species the user may define certain type of interaction e g facilitation commensalism or competition between each pair of species in the present study we consider the competitive lotka volterra clv model hofbauer and sigmund 1998 zeeman 1993 zhaoa et al 2009 which assumes that the social network structure of interacting species is based on the continuous competitions within and between the species the three dimensional clv model with no periodic orbits has been analyzed by van den driessche and zeeman 1998 specifically there will be no coexistence and one of the species will out compete the other two when each species resists invasion from the other two at carrying capacity on the contrary there will be a coexistence when none of the species can resist invasion from the others theoretical studies of the clv model includes the outstanding work of zeeman 1993 where she used geometric analysis of the surfaces to define a combinatorial equivalence relation by inequalities on the parameters of model 1 then a classification of 33 stable equivalence classes for the three dimensional clv model was deduced zeeman showed that 25 classes correspond to equilibrium solutions and the other 8 cases represent periodic solutions via hopf bifurcations for 27 of these classes the dynamical behaviors of the systems have been fully described van den driessche and zeeman 1998 zeeman 1993 classes 26 31 can possess isolated periodic orbits or limit cycles the question of how many limit cycles can appear in zeeman s six classes 26 31 is still open conditions for extinction of species have been established in theorem 2 1 of zeeman 1995 previous studies hofbauer and sigmund 1998 lu and luo 2003 gyllenberg et al 2006 gyllenberg and yan 2009 lian et al 2008 show that there is only a finite number of limit cycles where up to four limit cycles have been discovered however these limit cycles have not been numerically explored in details the above mentioned dynamics of model 1 indicate that the parameters of the model can measure and unpack the complex nature of social networks within and between species here the main objective is to develop and examine a methodology that employs model 1 to identify factors such as trends and periodic cycles in the growth rates migration and levels of interactions within and between the species these factors characterize the long term dynamics of social networks and govern the observed changes in the population densities of interacting species given the ecology and characteristics of certain species it is reasonable to assume that they compete for the same food resources available in the environment then using clv models to analyze the social interactions of these species seems rational as explained in the next section we used long term data of five competing rodent species to test the robustness of clv models and to quantify the long term annual changes in the rates of populations growth competitions and migrations these changes are characterized by times series analysis of the estimated parameter values of the annual clv models the time series analysis can provide explanations for extinction dominance trends and synchronized oscillations in the population densities although the primary focus of this paper is to develop a methodology and measure long term changes in the social networks of rodents the parametrized clv models can also be used to numerically investigate the spatial variations in the population densities of rodent species in particular by including a diffusion term into the clv models we numerically explored the coexistence dominance and spatio temporal patterns of population density occurring in the study area during the years 1973 2003 2 materials and methods the proposed methodology consists of three main steps i dividing the long term population data into n subsets of population data based on the desired time unit e g weeks months or years ii fitting the competitive lotka volterra clv models to each subset of data to extract the time series of estimated growth migration and competition rates iii using statistical models i e linear regression and fourier series models to analyze the time series of the estimated values and to measure periodic cycles trends and synchronized patterns of population variations occurring over long periods of time 2 1 study site and rodent data we used 31 years of monthly trapping records august 1973 july 2003 of rodents to estimate the proportional population densities of rodents residing in the study site these estimates were used to specify annual clv models and to identify long term patterns of inter and intra specific population interactions the five rodent species consist of hispid cotton rat sigmodon hispidus prairie vole microtus ochrogaster deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus white footed mouse peromyscus leucopus and western harvest mouse reithrodontomys megalotis for data collection the rodents were sampled using standard mark recapture techniques on a 2 5 ha grid at the nelson environmental study area located 14km ne of lawrence kansas usa the site is an old field habitat dominated by cool season grasses e g kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis and smooth brome bromus inermis and forbs such as common sunflower helianthus annuus and goldenrod solidago the grid consisted of 99 trap stations separated by 15m two sherman live traps were placed at each station traps were baited with scratch grain and checked at dawn for three consecutive days at approximately 4 week intervals captured rodents were identified to species their sex confirmed weighed and given individual marks before being released at the point of capture all field methods were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of kansas and followed guidelines of the animal care and use committee 1998 of the american society of mammalogists three species p leucopus p maniculatus and r megalotis were not individually marked until april 1989 therefore we used previously published regression equations brady and slade 2004 to estimate abundances of each species the correlation coefficients related to the proportional rodent data is presented in table 1 it can be seen that most of the rodent species are significantly inversely correlated with each other therefore the rodent species are competing and the use of clv seems reasonable for this study table 2 provides the statistics of the rodent data the prairie vole has the highest mean value range and standard deviation which indicates the large abundance and variations compared to the other four species in contrast the white footed mouse has the lowest mean range and standard deviation see fig 1 for time series of proportional data and visualization of the above mentioned factors as indicated in table 2 the prairie vole is the only species with negative skewness which shows that it has probability density function with the tail on the left hand side the percentage of data with zero values are shown in table 2 the column before the last the cotton rat and deer mouse have the highest percentage of zeros which suggests that they have been less frequent compared to other rodent species in contrast the prairie vole has the lowest percentage of zeros with the highest area under the interpolated curve see fig 1 and the last column of table 2 further details of the collected data can be found in abramsky et al 1979 and brady and slade 2004 2 2 specific lotka volterra models in model 1 by taking r i inside the parentheses and considering r i α ij k i as a single parameter the specific clv model of five competing rodents species i 1 5 is given by 2 dy i t dt y i t a i b i y 1 t c i y 2 t d i y 3 t e i y 4 t f i y 5 t where all parameters a i b i are positive constants for i 1 5 table 3 provides a summary of the parameters and variables of model 2 model 2 is based on the assumption that all five rodent species compete all the time in addition to the correlation analysis summarized in table 1 this assumption is justified by the similarities in the niches of these species particularly cotton rats and prairie voles have similar diets fleharty and olson 1969 as do the two species of peromyscus wolff 1985b i e deer mice and white footed mice competition has been demonstrated between the cotton rat and prairie vole glass and slade 1980 between deer mice and western harvest mice heske et al 1984 and between deer mice and white footed mice myers et al 2005 in the present study the clv models are fitted to the annual subsets of density data this is justified by analyzing the time series of the population densities which indicated the presence of annual cycles in all five species brady and slade 2004 reed and slade 2008 specifically fig 1 represents sum of sine models ssm fitted to the time series of rodent density data as indicated in the supplementary document sd1 all the fitted ssm showed that the data includes annual cycles of oscillations hence the annual clv models can be fitted to the data under the assumption that all species compete all the time the parameter values of the clv model 2 can be estimated by model fitting and therefore the parameter values of the original model 1 can be recovered by considering the migration of rodent species model 2 is extended to 3 dy i t dt y i t a i b i y 1 t c i y 2 t d i y 3 t e i y 4 t f i y 5 t k i where parameter k i 1 i 5 is a measure of the migration of species i from or to the study site when k i is negative or positive respectively parameter k i can be estimated after specifying all other annual parameter values another approach is to include the special movements of individuals in the clv model 1 by adding a diffusion term which changes model 2 into 4 y i x y t t d i 2 y i x y t x 2 2 y i x y t y 2 y i x y t a i b i y 1 x y t c i y 2 x y t d i y 3 x y t e i y 4 x y t f i y 5 x y t where d i 1 i 5 is the constant diffusion rate model 4 takes into account the random movements of rodents within the study site and it has been studied for i 1 2 murray 2003 in the present work we will explore the spatial changes to all 5 species using the numerical simulations of model 4 2 3 model fitting we used the matlab optimization toolbox to fit the annual clv models to the rodent data in addition to clv model fitting we employed a number of statistical models available in the matlab curve fitting toolbox to detect patterns of seasonality trends and possible periodic behaviors specifically logistic polynomials sum of sine models and spline curves were fitted to time series data of each rodent species in addition multivariance regression models were fitted to data of all five species the sum of sine models are in the form of 5 y t i 1 n a i sin b i t c i where a i b i and c i correspond to amplitude frequency and phase respectively using these models the statistically significant periodic cycles were identified in the population densities of each rodent species we also calculated the sensitivity of the estimated clv model parameters using the sensitivity functions and the hessian matrix of the systems turányi 1990 rabitz 1989 specifically the initial value problem associated with the clv model can be written as 6 dy t dt f y t p y 0 y 0 where y t y 1 t y 5 t p is the vector of parameters and f y t p is the right hand side of the clv model 2 the local sensitivity function s ij k is the solution of the initial value problem 7 d s dt js f s 0 0 where s t y i t p j is the local sensitivity matrix j f i y j is the jacobian matrix and f f i p j is the matrix of partial derivatives with respect to the parameters the sensitivity function s ij t measures the local efforts of small changes in the parameter values at time t hence the sensitivity matrix gives an indication of those parameters that are most significantly influencing the model solutions and it can be used to obtain the gradient and hessian matrix of the system to calculate the 95 confidence intervals related to each estimated parameter value specifically the 95 confidence intervals were calculated using 8 p p ˆ t h p p ˆ p p ˆ 25 2 n p f n p n d n p 0 05 where p and p ˆ are the initial and estimated vector of parameter values f is the probability function h 2 f i p i p j is the hessian matrix of f with respect to parameters n p and n d are the number of parameters and model variables respectively and s is the sample variance we used in matlab to calculate the confidence intervals 2 4 model analysis for each year we divided solutions of the fitted clv model into those that are near a stable equilibrium and those that are far from any stable equilibrium while various criteria can be employed to distinguish between near and far we considered the annual solution being near a stable equilibrium e e 1 e 5 if the solution y 1 t y 5 t remains within 5 of the components of the stable equilibrium during the year t a t b in particular the solution is near to the stable equilibrium if 9 y i t e i 0 05 for all t t a t b and i 1 5 otherwise it is far from a stable equilibrium the numerical simulations of model 2 and equilibrium analysis were carried out using matlab solver ode45 moreover to estimate the monthly constant migratory values k i we used the matlab optimization toolbox and the boundary value solver bvp5c finally comsol 5 2 was used to numerically solve the initial boundary value problem associated with partial differential equation pde model 4 using the zero flux boundary conditions and estimated parameter values a i f i for i 1 5 we obtained the diffusion rates d i from the previously published data related to each rodent species abramson et al 2006 agrell et al 1996 slade and russell 1998 sulok et al 2004 wolff 1985a specifically d 1 0 0044 d 2 0 0058 d 3 0 0068 d 4 0 0053 and d 5 0 005 3 results while fitted spline and logistic polynomials did not provide much information about underlying dynamics of the species the ssm revealed several periodic cycles also the ssm had lower residual errors and fitted well to the time series data see the supplementary document sd1 for the parameter values and goodness of model fits fig 1 represents the proportional rodent data and fitted sum of sine models table 4 represents the cycles of fitted ssm with 95 confidence intervals it can be seen that all rodent species exhibit cycles of about one year with small bands of confidence interval moreover cycles of about 2 8 3 0 years were present in all species except cotton rat while the ssm provide valuable information regarding the periodic cycles of rodent species they do not measure the long term changes in the social network variables e g long term changes in the competitive relationships between the rodent species to measure the strength of competitions between and within the species we used the annual clv model 2 fitted to the rodent data fig 2 represents the fitted annual clv model 2 and the population data it can be seen that there are good agreements between the data and the solution curves of the annual clv models appendix a includes the estimated parameter values and the 95 confidence intervals obtained through the local sensitivity analysis yue et al 2008 by fitting the statistical models to the time series of the estimated parameter values we identified the temporal patterns of changes in the social networks of the rodent species as explained later these patterns can demonstrate several unknown aspects of the rodent species the results of statistical models are summarized in tables 5 and 6 table 5 shows significant cycles of fourier series models fsm fitted to the coefficients of annual clv models see supplementary document sd2 for more details the fsm fitted to these time series revealed that the periodic cycles of the estimated parameter values are very similar to the cycles of rodent data listed in table 4 as shown in the first column of table 5 the periodic cycles of growth and competition are about 5 5 and 11 years for cotton rat these cycles are very close to the cycles presented in the first column of table 4 which indicates the direct influence of periodic growth and competition rates on population dynamics of cotton rat moreover cycles of 5 5 and 11 years are almost twice and four times bigger than the cycles of 2 6 3 8 years which are present in all other four rodent species see columns 3 6 of table 5 again these cycles are present in population densities of the rodents see columns 2 5 of table 4 indicating the direct influence of periodic cycles of growth and competition on population densities the temporal trends in the strength of inter and intra specific competitions and growth rates were measured using the regression lines fitted to the estimated parameter values of the annual clv models these trends provide an overall view of the changes in the social dynamics of the competing species during the study period 1973 2003 in particular table 6 is a summary of the intercepts and slopes of regression lines fitted to 31 years of data see the supplementary document sd4 for more details the first row shows that the growth rates of cotton rat have slightly decreased whereas the intra specific competition and competing effects of all species except the deer mouse have decreased reductions in the competition rates can be the reason for an overall increase in the population densities of cotton rat as shown in fig 2 the third row of table 6 shows the percent change pc values related to prairie vole which are all relatively small numbers except the competing effect of the deer mouse i e according to the fitted linear regression line parameter e 2 has increased 15 4 such a competing effect can be observed in fig 2 where the population densities of prairie vole and deer mouse are inversely synchronized i e the maximum values of deer mouse densities are frequently matching with the minimum values of prairie vole densities hence long term changes in the social network variables have directly influenced the population dynamics of the rodent species in the fifth row of table 6 the pc values of white footed mouse shows a substantial increase in the intra specific competition rates where d 3 has increased 14 9 white footed mouse has also increased its competing effect on deer mouse by 25 8 followed by 9 8 increase in the intra specific competition rates of deer mouse and 8 7 increase in the competing effects of western harvest mouse on deer mouse see seventh row of table 6 such increases have led the deer mouse population going nearly extinct see fig 2 in table 6 the row before the last indicates 2 6 decrease in the growth rates of western harvest mice and 6 4 increase in the intra specific competition rates which have been largely compensated with decreases in the inter specific competition rates of the other four rodent species these changes have been balanced out and resulted in survival of western harvest rodents for the annual clv models and ssm the goodness of fits are summarized in table 7 it can be seen that the clv models 2 are superior to the ssm formulated in eq 5 the number of equilibrium solutions of the annual clv was calculated using the binomial formula and it is equal to 32 nevertheless the solutions of the annual clv models were nearby only 5 of these equilibria in 8 different years in particular table 8 summarizes the equilibrium analysis of the annual clv models details of the equilibrium analysis can be found in the supplementary documents sd5 and sd6 the first column of table 8 represents the years at which the solution of clv reached near a stable equilibrium the second and third column represents the nature of stable equilibrium in each year it can be seen that in more than half of the years the cotton rat and prairie vole were dominant and nearly out competed the other three rodent species the ecological dominance of cotton rats and prairie voles has also been noted in other studies brady and slade 2001 howe and davlantes 2017 klattlowell and mcguire 2015 in 1996 and 1997 the prairie vole was dominant and nearly out competed all other species year 1976 is unique because cotton rat and prairie vole were nearly out competed the last four columns in table 8 represent the years at which the annual solutions were far from any stable equilibrium and certain species had low densities i e density below 5 of the entire rodent population it can be seen that deer mouse has been at low densities for many years this can also be confirmed directly from the observed data see figs 1 and 2 for all years that have not been mentioned in table 8 i e years 1980 1983 1986 1988 1989 the solutions of annual clv models were far from any stable equilibrium and none of the species had low densities the estimated parameter values of the annual clv models are available in the supplementary document sd3 and also details of fsm fitted to the estimated parameter values are provided in the supplementary document sd2 it should be noted that the estimated values are relative to each other and the baseline is equal to one due to the fact that the initial guess for all parameter values was equal to one fig 3 illustrates the solution curves of the fitted clv model 3 with migrating effects and the data see the supplementary document sd7 for the actual estimated k i values per observed data the mean k i values for cotton rat prairie vole white footed mouse and dear mouse are 0 0019 0 0005 0 0003 and 0 0008 respectively the white footed mouse was the only species with negative mean k 5 values analysis of the estimated k i values indicate that k 5 takes relatively large negative values during 1984 2003 which indicates that the population of white footed mouse was migrating out of the study site on smaller magnitudes k 4 values are also negative during the same time interval which indicates that the population of deer mouse was also migrating out of the study site but on a smaller scale hence in addition to increased competition rates see the pc values of deer mouse in table 6 the migration was also a contributing factor in low densities of deer mouse this becomes more evident when we notice that a large portion of the interval 1984 2003 is matching with the interval 1995 2003 i e the last 3000 days in fig 3 where the population densities of deer mouse is near to extinction for the other three species the k i values were mainly positive which indicates that they were experiencing migration into the study site the numerical simulations of the reaction diffusion clv model 4 were carried out using the software package comsol multiphysics 5 2 we employed the estimated annual parameter values of the clv model 2 and considered a rectangular domain resembling the study site with the zero flux boundary conditions such a boundary condition disregards the migratory effects and the model is only based on the random movements of rodents with in the study site the simulations reveal the convergence of the pde solution to the constant equilibrium solutions and transitions of pde solutions from one equilibrium to another focusing on the years 1976 1979 fig 4 shows that there is a continuous competition within and between the species in particular panels a and b show that the pde solution converges to constant equilibrium y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 0 415 0 0 0 0 485 around day 881 april 1978 which suggests that in the absence of migratory factors prairie vole and western harvest mouse could have out competed the other three species as shown in panels c d and e there is a transition between the solutions and population densities of these two species gradually decays whereas the population density of the cotton rat simultaneously increases panel f shows that the solution finally converges to the constant equilibrium y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 1 0 0 0 0 around day 2330 october 1979 which indicates that cotton rat would have out competed all other species if the movements were purely random the animations of pde solutions y i x y t i 1 5 are available in the supplementary documents see the file y1 gif for densities of cotton rat y2 gif for densities of prairie vole y3 gif for densities of white footed mouse y4 gif for densities of deer mouse and y5 gif for densities of western harvest mouse 4 discussion although social network analysis is a promising tool to study the structure and dynamics of wildlife communities the current methods require costly and detailed network data which often are not available over long time periods e g decades the present work is an attempt to resolve this issue by developing a methodology that requires much less detailed data and it relies on mathematical structure of clv models in a wildlife community of competing species the strength of intra and inter specific competitions can be measured based on the annual clv models fitted to the population data of interacting species by analyzing the time series of competition parameters long term temporal changes in population interactions can be investigated to examine this methodology we used the long term abundance data 1973 2003 of northeastern kansas rodents to quantify the changes in the magnitudes of their competitive behaviors as indicated in tables 5 and 6 the fitted clv models were capable of detecting various trends and periodic cycles in the growth and competition parameters the detected trends provide explanations for variations observed in the population densities an overall reduction in the competition rates affecting cotton rat gives reason for the increasing trend in the population densities of cotton rate as seen in fig 2 the population of deer mouse has been suppressed due increased values of competitions rates see fig 2 and pc values of deer mouse in table 6 moreover as shown in fig 2 the inverse correlation between the population densities of prairie vole and deer mouse is justified by the increased competing effects of the deer mouse on prairie vole the methodology developed in this study is not limited to the rodent species and it can be applied to a wide range of interacting species to quantify the long term changes in population interactions it also enables the researchers to better understand the long term variations e g trends seasonality and periodic cycles in the social networks of interacting species and to predict the subsequent outcomes e g survival extinction and establishment bani yaghoub et al 2015 several studies geijzendorffer et al 2011 guerra 2014 shih et al 2011 wu et al 2012 have used empirical data to estimate and monitor the temporal variations in the parameter values of model 1 nevertheless these studies employ indirect linear methods which can significantly impact the accuracy of model fitting for instance the grey lv modeling approach proposed in wu et al 2012 relies on a linear programming technique for parameter estimation and model selection also a multiple linear regression technique has been employed in geijzendorffer et al 2011 we tested the same method with our data which resulted in large residual errors between the model solutions and the observed data the present work provides a robust methodology that can detect and characterize the temporal population interactions using direct clv model specification a remarkable result of this study is the fact that periodic cycles of 2 8 3 0 years detected in the population data see table 4 are within the periodic cycles of 2 6 3 8 years detected in time series of the estimated parameter values see table 5 hence there seems to be a fair amount of agreement between what has been observed in the population data table 4 and what has been detected in the levels of competitive interactions this demonstrates the practical application of clv models to unpack the long term changes in the social networks of interacting species the first three columns of table 8 frequently predicts the stable equilibrium in which prairie vole and cotton rat dominate the social network of rodents there are also continuous efforts by the other three rodent species to escape from such an equilibrium which leads them to extinction when the population densities are far from any stable equilibrium it appears that deer mouse and western harvest mouse are still suffering from the competition and they experience low population densities for several years see the last four columns of table 8 given that the changes in population interactions could be both space and time dependent it is possible to extend the methodology to measure the spatio temporal changes in the social networks of species residing in the same geographical environment and develop a framework to study the possible impacts of climate change on social networks of interacting species kausrud et al 2008 namely the rodent trap data associated to a grid of 99 nodes and the climate data are both available for the period of 1973 2003 using the grid data 1973 2003 reed and slade 2008 the reaction diffusion clv model 4 can be further developed to investigate spatio temporal changes in the population interactions and their impacts on population demographics it should be noted that model 4 is based on several oversimplifying assumptions and therefore its numerical simulations may not necessarily resemble the real world situation first note that model 4 assumes that rodents are randomly moving in the study site throughout time obviously spatial movements of rodents are not entirely random secondly the migrating factors have been ignored by the imposed zero flux boundary conditions therefore model 4 and simulations presented in fig 4 can be substantially improved for instance the model can be further developed by including the maturation time delay and nonlocality bani yaghoub et al 2015 bani yaghoub and amundsen 2015 or considering population dispersal in symmetrical domains bani yaghoub et al 2014 then the impacts of the time and space varying interactions on the behavior of the traveling and stationary wave solutions bani yaghoub 2016 2015 bani yaghoub et al 2016 can be investigated owing to the increasing computational power and the flexibility of lv models the present work was the first step towards developing a methodology that uses less detailed but available data to measure the long term changes in the social networks of interacting species the proposed methodology is also applicable to other types of interactions e g facilitation commensalism amensalism in particular if the type of interaction is different then instead of clv models we can use a class of lotka volterra models corresponding to that type of interaction for instance to quantify long term interactions between oxpeckers and rhinos we may use symbiotic lv models moreover if we have limited knowledge about the type of interactions or anticipate temporal changes from one mode of interaction to another e g facilitation to competition due to variations in the quality of habitat or food resources then a procedure known as model selection aho et al 2014 burnham and anderson 2002 claeskens 2016 can be used which allows for changes in the types of lv models fitted to subsets of population data in particular the ecological results of this paper are based on the assumption that all of these rodent species are competing throughout the study period this assumption can be widened to include other possible modes interactions such as facilitation commensalism and amensalism or no interactions for certain years by considering all possible pairwise combinations there will be 3 488 109 candidate annual lv models to specify where for each year the best model among the candidate models is selected using bayesian or akaike s information criterion aho et al 2014 burnham and anderson 2002 adjusted for small sample sizes then the inter annual variations in the magnitude of interaction between species and the subsequent outcomes of that interaction e g stable co existence extinction or competitive exclusion can be assessed by graphing annual estimates α ij k i and the predicted outcomes for each pair of species knebel et al 2013 in conclusion the present work initiates the application of user defined mathematical models

25352,current methods of social network analysis need detailed data which are often unavailable for long periods of time e g decades the main objective of the present work is to develop and test a methodology that requires less detailed data and relies on user defined mathematical models this methodology is a three step procedure described as follows first long term population data is divided into n subsets based on the desired time unit e g months or years second a class of mathematical models are defined and fitted to each subset of data where growth migration and interaction parameters are estimated third time series of estimated parameter values are analyzed to detect trends periodic cycles and patterns of ecological dominance to examine the robustness of this method the annual competitive lotka volterra clv models were parametrized using the long term 1973 2003 population densities of five rodent species residing in kansas cotton rat cr prairie vole pv white footed mouse wfm deer mouse dm and western harvest mouse whm using the fourier series models fitted to the estimated parameter values we found that the periodic cycles of growth and competition rates were about 5 5 and 11 years for cr and about 2 6 3 8 years in all rodent species the linear regression models fitted to the estimated values indicate slight decreases in the growth rates of all species except pv the competing effects of pv on cr and wfm have decreased more than 11 4 whereas the competing effect of the dm on pv and wfm on dm and itself have increased by 15 4 25 8 and 14 9 respectively the estimated migration rates of dm and whm were mainly negative which indicates that these species were mainly migrating out of the study site all other three species had mainly positive migration rates the parametrized annual clv models were employed to analyze the formation of stable equilibria and to numerically investigate spatio temporal patterns of population densities we found that cr and pv were often dominant the present work is the first step towards employing user defined models compensating for the lack of long term detailed social network data keywords social network analysis lotka volterra model rodent species fourier series models 1 introduction social network analysis has been much appreciated for revealing causes and consequences of various interactions within and between wildlife communities bascompte 2009 krause et al 2009 wey et al 2008 this includes social network analysis of inter and intra specific competitions and their subsequent impacts on the population dynamics of interacting species araujo et al 2008 haulsee et al 2016 fisher et al 2016 despite being a promising tool there is currently no pertinent methodology for measuring long term changes in the social networks of interacting species this is mainly due to lack of long term e g decades detailed network data which is a major challenge in quantifying the long term network dynamics of interacting species in particular the current statistical methods allesina and levine 2011 bronstein 2009 dubowy 1988 fisher et al 2017 require detailed network data which are often unavailable for long periods of time unpacking wildlife social networks of species bascompte 2009 krause et al 2009 perkins et al 2009 shizuka and mcdonald 2012 wey et al 2008 has been mainly limited to short term study periods there is a critical need to develop a new methodology that requires less detailed data and it is capable of assessing the long term dynamics of social networks e g periodic cycles trends seasonality and ecological dominance for instance several long term trapping records of interacting species are available for a variety of interacting species these records can be used to obtain long term estimates of population densities as shown in the present work these estimates can serve as less detailed but available data the main objective of the present work is to develop and test a methodology that requires less detailed data for analyzing long term dynamics of wildlife social networks this methodology relies on user defined mathematical models which compensate for lack of detailed network data in particular if the type of interactions between and within species is known e g facilitation competition prey predator then details of the data related to that type of interaction in no longer necessary and the user can directly define them in the mathematical models therefore the user defined models can be fitted to the long term population estimates to quantify the dynamics of wildlife social networks the present work proposes a new methodology that can be utilized to obtain a deeper understanding of the ecology of interacting species a mathematical model is built based on certain assumptions related to the social network these assumptions play a key role in the model formulations if the assumptions are widely accepted then the model outcomes can detect and quantify several ecological phenomena present in the wildlife community a class of well studied mathematical models is known as lotka volterra lv models in particular a spatially homogeneous network of n interacting species with densities y i t is modeled by the following lv model 1 dy i t dt r i y i t 1 j 1 n α ij y i t k i where the positive constant r i is the population growth rate of species i k i is the carrying capacity of species i α ii 1 and α ij with i j 1 i j n is the interacting effect of species j on the population of species i model 1 has frequently been used by ecologists and analyzed by mathematicians for several decades geijzendorffer et al 2011 gyllenberg et al 2006 gyllenberg and yan 2009 knebel et al 2013 lian et al 2008 an n dimensional lv model represents the dynamics of n interacting species it is known that a two dimensional lv model cannot admit isolated periodic orbit hofbauer and sigmund 1998 that is if the system has periodic orbits then these orbits are non isolated the higher dimensions of the lv model exhibit rich dynamics in an lv model of n interacting species the user may define certain type of interaction e g facilitation commensalism or competition between each pair of species in the present study we consider the competitive lotka volterra clv model hofbauer and sigmund 1998 zeeman 1993 zhaoa et al 2009 which assumes that the social network structure of interacting species is based on the continuous competitions within and between the species the three dimensional clv model with no periodic orbits has been analyzed by van den driessche and zeeman 1998 specifically there will be no coexistence and one of the species will out compete the other two when each species resists invasion from the other two at carrying capacity on the contrary there will be a coexistence when none of the species can resist invasion from the others theoretical studies of the clv model includes the outstanding work of zeeman 1993 where she used geometric analysis of the surfaces to define a combinatorial equivalence relation by inequalities on the parameters of model 1 then a classification of 33 stable equivalence classes for the three dimensional clv model was deduced zeeman showed that 25 classes correspond to equilibrium solutions and the other 8 cases represent periodic solutions via hopf bifurcations for 27 of these classes the dynamical behaviors of the systems have been fully described van den driessche and zeeman 1998 zeeman 1993 classes 26 31 can possess isolated periodic orbits or limit cycles the question of how many limit cycles can appear in zeeman s six classes 26 31 is still open conditions for extinction of species have been established in theorem 2 1 of zeeman 1995 previous studies hofbauer and sigmund 1998 lu and luo 2003 gyllenberg et al 2006 gyllenberg and yan 2009 lian et al 2008 show that there is only a finite number of limit cycles where up to four limit cycles have been discovered however these limit cycles have not been numerically explored in details the above mentioned dynamics of model 1 indicate that the parameters of the model can measure and unpack the complex nature of social networks within and between species here the main objective is to develop and examine a methodology that employs model 1 to identify factors such as trends and periodic cycles in the growth rates migration and levels of interactions within and between the species these factors characterize the long term dynamics of social networks and govern the observed changes in the population densities of interacting species given the ecology and characteristics of certain species it is reasonable to assume that they compete for the same food resources available in the environment then using clv models to analyze the social interactions of these species seems rational as explained in the next section we used long term data of five competing rodent species to test the robustness of clv models and to quantify the long term annual changes in the rates of populations growth competitions and migrations these changes are characterized by times series analysis of the estimated parameter values of the annual clv models the time series analysis can provide explanations for extinction dominance trends and synchronized oscillations in the population densities although the primary focus of this paper is to develop a methodology and measure long term changes in the social networks of rodents the parametrized clv models can also be used to numerically investigate the spatial variations in the population densities of rodent species in particular by including a diffusion term into the clv models we numerically explored the coexistence dominance and spatio temporal patterns of population density occurring in the study area during the years 1973 2003 2 materials and methods the proposed methodology consists of three main steps i dividing the long term population data into n subsets of population data based on the desired time unit e g weeks months or years ii fitting the competitive lotka volterra clv models to each subset of data to extract the time series of estimated growth migration and competition rates iii using statistical models i e linear regression and fourier series models to analyze the time series of the estimated values and to measure periodic cycles trends and synchronized patterns of population variations occurring over long periods of time 2 1 study site and rodent data we used 31 years of monthly trapping records august 1973 july 2003 of rodents to estimate the proportional population densities of rodents residing in the study site these estimates were used to specify annual clv models and to identify long term patterns of inter and intra specific population interactions the five rodent species consist of hispid cotton rat sigmodon hispidus prairie vole microtus ochrogaster deer mouse peromyscus maniculatus white footed mouse peromyscus leucopus and western harvest mouse reithrodontomys megalotis for data collection the rodents were sampled using standard mark recapture techniques on a 2 5 ha grid at the nelson environmental study area located 14km ne of lawrence kansas usa the site is an old field habitat dominated by cool season grasses e g kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis and smooth brome bromus inermis and forbs such as common sunflower helianthus annuus and goldenrod solidago the grid consisted of 99 trap stations separated by 15m two sherman live traps were placed at each station traps were baited with scratch grain and checked at dawn for three consecutive days at approximately 4 week intervals captured rodents were identified to species their sex confirmed weighed and given individual marks before being released at the point of capture all field methods were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of kansas and followed guidelines of the animal care and use committee 1998 of the american society of mammalogists three species p leucopus p maniculatus and r megalotis were not individually marked until april 1989 therefore we used previously published regression equations brady and slade 2004 to estimate abundances of each species the correlation coefficients related to the proportional rodent data is presented in table 1 it can be seen that most of the rodent species are significantly inversely correlated with each other therefore the rodent species are competing and the use of clv seems reasonable for this study table 2 provides the statistics of the rodent data the prairie vole has the highest mean value range and standard deviation which indicates the large abundance and variations compared to the other four species in contrast the white footed mouse has the lowest mean range and standard deviation see fig 1 for time series of proportional data and visualization of the above mentioned factors as indicated in table 2 the prairie vole is the only species with negative skewness which shows that it has probability density function with the tail on the left hand side the percentage of data with zero values are shown in table 2 the column before the last the cotton rat and deer mouse have the highest percentage of zeros which suggests that they have been less frequent compared to other rodent species in contrast the prairie vole has the lowest percentage of zeros with the highest area under the interpolated curve see fig 1 and the last column of table 2 further details of the collected data can be found in abramsky et al 1979 and brady and slade 2004 2 2 specific lotka volterra models in model 1 by taking r i inside the parentheses and considering r i α ij k i as a single parameter the specific clv model of five competing rodents species i 1 5 is given by 2 dy i t dt y i t a i b i y 1 t c i y 2 t d i y 3 t e i y 4 t f i y 5 t where all parameters a i b i are positive constants for i 1 5 table 3 provides a summary of the parameters and variables of model 2 model 2 is based on the assumption that all five rodent species compete all the time in addition to the correlation analysis summarized in table 1 this assumption is justified by the similarities in the niches of these species particularly cotton rats and prairie voles have similar diets fleharty and olson 1969 as do the two species of peromyscus wolff 1985b i e deer mice and white footed mice competition has been demonstrated between the cotton rat and prairie vole glass and slade 1980 between deer mice and western harvest mice heske et al 1984 and between deer mice and white footed mice myers et al 2005 in the present study the clv models are fitted to the annual subsets of density data this is justified by analyzing the time series of the population densities which indicated the presence of annual cycles in all five species brady and slade 2004 reed and slade 2008 specifically fig 1 represents sum of sine models ssm fitted to the time series of rodent density data as indicated in the supplementary document sd1 all the fitted ssm showed that the data includes annual cycles of oscillations hence the annual clv models can be fitted to the data under the assumption that all species compete all the time the parameter values of the clv model 2 can be estimated by model fitting and therefore the parameter values of the original model 1 can be recovered by considering the migration of rodent species model 2 is extended to 3 dy i t dt y i t a i b i y 1 t c i y 2 t d i y 3 t e i y 4 t f i y 5 t k i where parameter k i 1 i 5 is a measure of the migration of species i from or to the study site when k i is negative or positive respectively parameter k i can be estimated after specifying all other annual parameter values another approach is to include the special movements of individuals in the clv model 1 by adding a diffusion term which changes model 2 into 4 y i x y t t d i 2 y i x y t x 2 2 y i x y t y 2 y i x y t a i b i y 1 x y t c i y 2 x y t d i y 3 x y t e i y 4 x y t f i y 5 x y t where d i 1 i 5 is the constant diffusion rate model 4 takes into account the random movements of rodents within the study site and it has been studied for i 1 2 murray 2003 in the present work we will explore the spatial changes to all 5 species using the numerical simulations of model 4 2 3 model fitting we used the matlab optimization toolbox to fit the annual clv models to the rodent data in addition to clv model fitting we employed a number of statistical models available in the matlab curve fitting toolbox to detect patterns of seasonality trends and possible periodic behaviors specifically logistic polynomials sum of sine models and spline curves were fitted to time series data of each rodent species in addition multivariance regression models were fitted to data of all five species the sum of sine models are in the form of 5 y t i 1 n a i sin b i t c i where a i b i and c i correspond to amplitude frequency and phase respectively using these models the statistically significant periodic cycles were identified in the population densities of each rodent species we also calculated the sensitivity of the estimated clv model parameters using the sensitivity functions and the hessian matrix of the systems turányi 1990 rabitz 1989 specifically the initial value problem associated with the clv model can be written as 6 dy t dt f y t p y 0 y 0 where y t y 1 t y 5 t p is the vector of parameters and f y t p is the right hand side of the clv model 2 the local sensitivity function s ij k is the solution of the initial value problem 7 d s dt js f s 0 0 where s t y i t p j is the local sensitivity matrix j f i y j is the jacobian matrix and f f i p j is the matrix of partial derivatives with respect to the parameters the sensitivity function s ij t measures the local efforts of small changes in the parameter values at time t hence the sensitivity matrix gives an indication of those parameters that are most significantly influencing the model solutions and it can be used to obtain the gradient and hessian matrix of the system to calculate the 95 confidence intervals related to each estimated parameter value specifically the 95 confidence intervals were calculated using 8 p p ˆ t h p p ˆ p p ˆ 25 2 n p f n p n d n p 0 05 where p and p ˆ are the initial and estimated vector of parameter values f is the probability function h 2 f i p i p j is the hessian matrix of f with respect to parameters n p and n d are the number of parameters and model variables respectively and s is the sample variance we used in matlab to calculate the confidence intervals 2 4 model analysis for each year we divided solutions of the fitted clv model into those that are near a stable equilibrium and those that are far from any stable equilibrium while various criteria can be employed to distinguish between near and far we considered the annual solution being near a stable equilibrium e e 1 e 5 if the solution y 1 t y 5 t remains within 5 of the components of the stable equilibrium during the year t a t b in particular the solution is near to the stable equilibrium if 9 y i t e i 0 05 for all t t a t b and i 1 5 otherwise it is far from a stable equilibrium the numerical simulations of model 2 and equilibrium analysis were carried out using matlab solver ode45 moreover to estimate the monthly constant migratory values k i we used the matlab optimization toolbox and the boundary value solver bvp5c finally comsol 5 2 was used to numerically solve the initial boundary value problem associated with partial differential equation pde model 4 using the zero flux boundary conditions and estimated parameter values a i f i for i 1 5 we obtained the diffusion rates d i from the previously published data related to each rodent species abramson et al 2006 agrell et al 1996 slade and russell 1998 sulok et al 2004 wolff 1985a specifically d 1 0 0044 d 2 0 0058 d 3 0 0068 d 4 0 0053 and d 5 0 005 3 results while fitted spline and logistic polynomials did not provide much information about underlying dynamics of the species the ssm revealed several periodic cycles also the ssm had lower residual errors and fitted well to the time series data see the supplementary document sd1 for the parameter values and goodness of model fits fig 1 represents the proportional rodent data and fitted sum of sine models table 4 represents the cycles of fitted ssm with 95 confidence intervals it can be seen that all rodent species exhibit cycles of about one year with small bands of confidence interval moreover cycles of about 2 8 3 0 years were present in all species except cotton rat while the ssm provide valuable information regarding the periodic cycles of rodent species they do not measure the long term changes in the social network variables e g long term changes in the competitive relationships between the rodent species to measure the strength of competitions between and within the species we used the annual clv model 2 fitted to the rodent data fig 2 represents the fitted annual clv model 2 and the population data it can be seen that there are good agreements between the data and the solution curves of the annual clv models appendix a includes the estimated parameter values and the 95 confidence intervals obtained through the local sensitivity analysis yue et al 2008 by fitting the statistical models to the time series of the estimated parameter values we identified the temporal patterns of changes in the social networks of the rodent species as explained later these patterns can demonstrate several unknown aspects of the rodent species the results of statistical models are summarized in tables 5 and 6 table 5 shows significant cycles of fourier series models fsm fitted to the coefficients of annual clv models see supplementary document sd2 for more details the fsm fitted to these time series revealed that the periodic cycles of the estimated parameter values are very similar to the cycles of rodent data listed in table 4 as shown in the first column of table 5 the periodic cycles of growth and competition are about 5 5 and 11 years for cotton rat these cycles are very close to the cycles presented in the first column of table 4 which indicates the direct influence of periodic growth and competition rates on population dynamics of cotton rat moreover cycles of 5 5 and 11 years are almost twice and four times bigger than the cycles of 2 6 3 8 years which are present in all other four rodent species see columns 3 6 of table 5 again these cycles are present in population densities of the rodents see columns 2 5 of table 4 indicating the direct influence of periodic cycles of growth and competition on population densities the temporal trends in the strength of inter and intra specific competitions and growth rates were measured using the regression lines fitted to the estimated parameter values of the annual clv models these trends provide an overall view of the changes in the social dynamics of the competing species during the study period 1973 2003 in particular table 6 is a summary of the intercepts and slopes of regression lines fitted to 31 years of data see the supplementary document sd4 for more details the first row shows that the growth rates of cotton rat have slightly decreased whereas the intra specific competition and competing effects of all species except the deer mouse have decreased reductions in the competition rates can be the reason for an overall increase in the population densities of cotton rat as shown in fig 2 the third row of table 6 shows the percent change pc values related to prairie vole which are all relatively small numbers except the competing effect of the deer mouse i e according to the fitted linear regression line parameter e 2 has increased 15 4 such a competing effect can be observed in fig 2 where the population densities of prairie vole and deer mouse are inversely synchronized i e the maximum values of deer mouse densities are frequently matching with the minimum values of prairie vole densities hence long term changes in the social network variables have directly influenced the population dynamics of the rodent species in the fifth row of table 6 the pc values of white footed mouse shows a substantial increase in the intra specific competition rates where d 3 has increased 14 9 white footed mouse has also increased its competing effect on deer mouse by 25 8 followed by 9 8 increase in the intra specific competition rates of deer mouse and 8 7 increase in the competing effects of western harvest mouse on deer mouse see seventh row of table 6 such increases have led the deer mouse population going nearly extinct see fig 2 in table 6 the row before the last indicates 2 6 decrease in the growth rates of western harvest mice and 6 4 increase in the intra specific competition rates which have been largely compensated with decreases in the inter specific competition rates of the other four rodent species these changes have been balanced out and resulted in survival of western harvest rodents for the annual clv models and ssm the goodness of fits are summarized in table 7 it can be seen that the clv models 2 are superior to the ssm formulated in eq 5 the number of equilibrium solutions of the annual clv was calculated using the binomial formula and it is equal to 32 nevertheless the solutions of the annual clv models were nearby only 5 of these equilibria in 8 different years in particular table 8 summarizes the equilibrium analysis of the annual clv models details of the equilibrium analysis can be found in the supplementary documents sd5 and sd6 the first column of table 8 represents the years at which the solution of clv reached near a stable equilibrium the second and third column represents the nature of stable equilibrium in each year it can be seen that in more than half of the years the cotton rat and prairie vole were dominant and nearly out competed the other three rodent species the ecological dominance of cotton rats and prairie voles has also been noted in other studies brady and slade 2001 howe and davlantes 2017 klattlowell and mcguire 2015 in 1996 and 1997 the prairie vole was dominant and nearly out competed all other species year 1976 is unique because cotton rat and prairie vole were nearly out competed the last four columns in table 8 represent the years at which the annual solutions were far from any stable equilibrium and certain species had low densities i e density below 5 of the entire rodent population it can be seen that deer mouse has been at low densities for many years this can also be confirmed directly from the observed data see figs 1 and 2 for all years that have not been mentioned in table 8 i e years 1980 1983 1986 1988 1989 the solutions of annual clv models were far from any stable equilibrium and none of the species had low densities the estimated parameter values of the annual clv models are available in the supplementary document sd3 and also details of fsm fitted to the estimated parameter values are provided in the supplementary document sd2 it should be noted that the estimated values are relative to each other and the baseline is equal to one due to the fact that the initial guess for all parameter values was equal to one fig 3 illustrates the solution curves of the fitted clv model 3 with migrating effects and the data see the supplementary document sd7 for the actual estimated k i values per observed data the mean k i values for cotton rat prairie vole white footed mouse and dear mouse are 0 0019 0 0005 0 0003 and 0 0008 respectively the white footed mouse was the only species with negative mean k 5 values analysis of the estimated k i values indicate that k 5 takes relatively large negative values during 1984 2003 which indicates that the population of white footed mouse was migrating out of the study site on smaller magnitudes k 4 values are also negative during the same time interval which indicates that the population of deer mouse was also migrating out of the study site but on a smaller scale hence in addition to increased competition rates see the pc values of deer mouse in table 6 the migration was also a contributing factor in low densities of deer mouse this becomes more evident when we notice that a large portion of the interval 1984 2003 is matching with the interval 1995 2003 i e the last 3000 days in fig 3 where the population densities of deer mouse is near to extinction for the other three species the k i values were mainly positive which indicates that they were experiencing migration into the study site the numerical simulations of the reaction diffusion clv model 4 were carried out using the software package comsol multiphysics 5 2 we employed the estimated annual parameter values of the clv model 2 and considered a rectangular domain resembling the study site with the zero flux boundary conditions such a boundary condition disregards the migratory effects and the model is only based on the random movements of rodents with in the study site the simulations reveal the convergence of the pde solution to the constant equilibrium solutions and transitions of pde solutions from one equilibrium to another focusing on the years 1976 1979 fig 4 shows that there is a continuous competition within and between the species in particular panels a and b show that the pde solution converges to constant equilibrium y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 0 415 0 0 0 0 485 around day 881 april 1978 which suggests that in the absence of migratory factors prairie vole and western harvest mouse could have out competed the other three species as shown in panels c d and e there is a transition between the solutions and population densities of these two species gradually decays whereas the population density of the cotton rat simultaneously increases panel f shows that the solution finally converges to the constant equilibrium y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 1 0 0 0 0 around day 2330 october 1979 which indicates that cotton rat would have out competed all other species if the movements were purely random the animations of pde solutions y i x y t i 1 5 are available in the supplementary documents see the file y1 gif for densities of cotton rat y2 gif for densities of prairie vole y3 gif for densities of white footed mouse y4 gif for densities of deer mouse and y5 gif for densities of western harvest mouse 4 discussion although social network analysis is a promising tool to study the structure and dynamics of wildlife communities the current methods require costly and detailed network data which often are not available over long time periods e g decades the present work is an attempt to resolve this issue by developing a methodology that requires much less detailed data and it relies on mathematical structure of clv models in a wildlife community of competing species the strength of intra and inter specific competitions can be measured based on the annual clv models fitted to the population data of interacting species by analyzing the time series of competition parameters long term temporal changes in population interactions can be investigated to examine this methodology we used the long term abundance data 1973 2003 of northeastern kansas rodents to quantify the changes in the magnitudes of their competitive behaviors as indicated in tables 5 and 6 the fitted clv models were capable of detecting various trends and periodic cycles in the growth and competition parameters the detected trends provide explanations for variations observed in the population densities an overall reduction in the competition rates affecting cotton rat gives reason for the increasing trend in the population densities of cotton rate as seen in fig 2 the population of deer mouse has been suppressed due increased values of competitions rates see fig 2 and pc values of deer mouse in table 6 moreover as shown in fig 2 the inverse correlation between the population densities of prairie vole and deer mouse is justified by the increased competing effects of the deer mouse on prairie vole the methodology developed in this study is not limited to the rodent species and it can be applied to a wide range of interacting species to quantify the long term changes in population interactions it also enables the researchers to better understand the long term variations e g trends seasonality and periodic cycles in the social networks of interacting species and to predict the subsequent outcomes e g survival extinction and establishment bani yaghoub et al 2015 several studies geijzendorffer et al 2011 guerra 2014 shih et al 2011 wu et al 2012 have used empirical data to estimate and monitor the temporal variations in the parameter values of model 1 nevertheless these studies employ indirect linear methods which can significantly impact the accuracy of model fitting for instance the grey lv modeling approach proposed in wu et al 2012 relies on a linear programming technique for parameter estimation and model selection also a multiple linear regression technique has been employed in geijzendorffer et al 2011 we tested the same method with our data which resulted in large residual errors between the model solutions and the observed data the present work provides a robust methodology that can detect and characterize the temporal population interactions using direct clv model specification a remarkable result of this study is the fact that periodic cycles of 2 8 3 0 years detected in the population data see table 4 are within the periodic cycles of 2 6 3 8 years detected in time series of the estimated parameter values see table 5 hence there seems to be a fair amount of agreement between what has been observed in the population data table 4 and what has been detected in the levels of competitive interactions this demonstrates the practical application of clv models to unpack the long term changes in the social networks of interacting species the first three columns of table 8 frequently predicts the stable equilibrium in which prairie vole and cotton rat dominate the social network of rodents there are also continuous efforts by the other three rodent species to escape from such an equilibrium which leads them to extinction when the population densities are far from any stable equilibrium it appears that deer mouse and western harvest mouse are still suffering from the competition and they experience low population densities for several years see the last four columns of table 8 given that the changes in population interactions could be both space and time dependent it is possible to extend the methodology to measure the spatio temporal changes in the social networks of species residing in the same geographical environment and develop a framework to study the possible impacts of climate change on social networks of interacting species kausrud et al 2008 namely the rodent trap data associated to a grid of 99 nodes and the climate data are both available for the period of 1973 2003 using the grid data 1973 2003 reed and slade 2008 the reaction diffusion clv model 4 can be further developed to investigate spatio temporal changes in the population interactions and their impacts on population demographics it should be noted that model 4 is based on several oversimplifying assumptions and therefore its numerical simulations may not necessarily resemble the real world situation first note that model 4 assumes that rodents are randomly moving in the study site throughout time obviously spatial movements of rodents are not entirely random secondly the migrating factors have been ignored by the imposed zero flux boundary conditions therefore model 4 and simulations presented in fig 4 can be substantially improved for instance the model can be further developed by including the maturation time delay and nonlocality bani yaghoub et al 2015 bani yaghoub and amundsen 2015 or considering population dispersal in symmetrical domains bani yaghoub et al 2014 then the impacts of the time and space varying interactions on the behavior of the traveling and stationary wave solutions bani yaghoub 2016 2015 bani yaghoub et al 2016 can be investigated owing to the increasing computational power and the flexibility of lv models the present work was the first step towards developing a methodology that uses less detailed but available data to measure the long term changes in the social networks of interacting species the proposed methodology is also applicable to other types of interactions e g facilitation commensalism amensalism in particular if the type of interaction is different then instead of clv models we can use a class of lotka volterra models corresponding to that type of interaction for instance to quantify long term interactions between oxpeckers and rhinos we may use symbiotic lv models moreover if we have limited knowledge about the type of interactions or anticipate temporal changes from one mode of interaction to another e g facilitation to competition due to variations in the quality of habitat or food resources then a procedure known as model selection aho et al 2014 burnham and anderson 2002 claeskens 2016 can be used which allows for changes in the types of lv models fitted to subsets of population data in particular the ecological results of this paper are based on the assumption that all of these rodent species are competing throughout the study period this assumption can be widened to include other possible modes interactions such as facilitation commensalism and amensalism or no interactions for certain years by considering all possible pairwise combinations there will be 3 488 109 candidate annual lv models to specify where for each year the best model among the candidate models is selected using bayesian or akaike s information criterion aho et al 2014 burnham and anderson 2002 adjusted for small sample sizes then the inter annual variations in the magnitude of interaction between species and the subsequent outcomes of that interaction e g stable co existence extinction or competitive exclusion can be assessed by graphing annual estimates α ij k i and the predicted outcomes for each pair of species knebel et al 2013 in conclusion the present work initiates the application of user defined mathematical models

25353,life cycles of riparian vegetation are substantially impacted by river flow regime groundwater and morphodynamics the polygon based riparian vegetation simulation module rvsm was developed and integrated into hec ras one dimensional flow model to predict spatially explicit seed germination seedling establishment plant growth and mortality in response to fluvial processes the hec ras rvsm system was applied to the sacramento river reach to evaluate its capability in modeling temporal and spatial changes of riparian vegetation and the interactions between flow and riparian vegetation dynamics river hydraulics groundwater level and five vegetation types of the study reach were simulated for the eight year 1999 2007 period model results demonstrate that the hec ras rvsm system reproduced the coverage increase of cottonwood riparian shrub invasive species and grass as well as the coverage decrease in mixed forest over the eight year the rvsm was able to capture sites for cottonwood establishment observed on certain point bars the modeled variations of cottonwood coverage in response to dynamic flow regime facilitated determining and managing environmental flow for riparian vegetation restoration the height of capillary fringe and root growth rate were two key parameters influencing riparian vegetation distribution keywords hec ras hydraulics groundwater riparian vegetation simulation cottonwood sacramento river 1 introduction riparian zones are long strips of vegetation adjacent to streams rivers lakes reservoirs and other inland aquatic systems fischer and fischenich 2000 riparian zones range in width from a few to hundreds of meters riparian vegetation is diverse in species and varies from aquatic graminiod sedge wet meadows to extensive forests life cycles of the riparian vegetation species are directly and indirectly affected by flow regime tabacchi et al 1998 the flow regime is the main driver of channel morphology through its influence on sediment transport and channel structure flood and drought disturbances and the erosion and deposition of sediments all have major impacts on shaping the composition structure and abundance of riparian vegetation merritt et al 2010 riparian vegetation species have evolved specific traits to survive and reproduce in response to these disturbances naiman et al 2010 for instance seed release of the pioneer riparian trees like cottonwood and black willow often coincides with peak runoff or flood recession stella et al 2006 some riparian plants depend on flow dynamics to enable long distance seed dispersal johansson et al 1996 in addition groundwater level and soil moisture of floodplains influenced by river flow are also determinant environmental factors for seed germination and seedling establishment particularly in the riparian zones of arid and semiarid basins stromberg 2001 stromberg et al 1996 unfortunately alterations of flow regime worldwide due to dam operation and river regulation have highly modified and degraded the riparian vegetation community some of the negative effects of altered flow regimes on riparian vegetation may be alleviated through ecosystem management and restoration vegetation in riparian zones plays a significant role in controlling channel morphology maintaining a favorable habitat for aquatic organisms and improving river water quality tabacchi et al 1998 perucca et al 2007 riparian vegetation increases the bank resistance against erosion directly by root binding and indirectly by enhancing local deposition of organic material and fine sediment which increases the soil cohesion tal et al 2004 by trapping organic matter and sediment as well as assimilating excessive nutrients riparian vegetation has a strong ability to mitigate nutrients and contaminants contents of adjacent rivers dosskey et al 2010 thus vegetated riparian buffer zones established between agricultural fields and receiving waters have been widely used for water quality improvement comerford et al 1992 moreover as a result of widespread loss and degradation of global riparian habitat riparian vegetation rehabilitation has become an important component for many river restoration programs goodwin et al 1997 merritt et al 2010 rood et al 2005 stromberg 2001 to support the riparian ecosystem management and restoration there is a critical need for developing a physically based quantitative tool to predict riparian vegetation s response to fluvial processes and to evaluate alternative operations and management plans most of existing riparian vegetation models such as ecological dynamics simulation model edys and riparian ecosystem management model remm have not linked their vegetation simulation with river hydraulics and sediment transport coldren et al 2011 lowrance et al 2000 the complex interactions between flow dynamics and riparian vegetation cannot be quantified with these models the u s bureau of reclamation usbr has added a riparian vegetation simulation component into its srh 1d model called srh 1dv for modeling the interactions of flow and riparian vegetation the srh 1d is usbr s one dimensional 1 d hydraulics and sediment transport model the srh 1dv model has been applied to the sacramento river rio grande river and san joaquin river in support of water management decision making environmental planning and ecosystem restoration analysis fotherby et al 2012 greimann 2016 in this study the riparian vegetation simulation component within the srh 1dv model was improved and further developed as a polygon based riparian vegetation simulation module rvsm the rvsm simulates life cycles of vegetation species within the riparian zone using polygons instead of cross section points used in srh 1dv advantages of the polygon based riparian vegetation model are 1 to better represent the spatial distribution of real world riparian vegetation 2 to fit for coupling with both 1 d and two dimensional 2 d flow models 3 to directly overlay model results with a vegetation map for performing spatial analysis the rvsm has been integrated into the hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system 1 d flow model hec ras is used to simulate riverine hydraulics and performs mobile bed sediment transport both capabilities are critically important when simulating the effects of vegetation on hydraulic roughness and the life cycles of various vegetation species the hec ras model was chosen also because it has been continuously developed and supported by u s army corps of engineers usace and widely used in the u s and world most large river systems as well as many smaller rivers and streams in the u s have already been modeled with hec ras aim of this study was to apply the hec ras rvsm system to a reach of sacramento river in modeling spatial and temporal changes of riparian vegetation over eight year period and to evaluate its capability for predicting interactions between flow and riparian vegetation dynamics 2 hec ras riparian vegetation simulation module this section briefly describes the integrated hec ras rvsm system 2 1 hec ras model hec ras is a public domain river hydraulic model it contains five components brunner 2016 1 1 d steady flow water surface profile computations 2 1 d unsteady flow simulation 3 2 d unsteady flow simulation 4 movable boundary sediment transport computations and 5 water quality analysis through plug in water quality modules the latest version of hec ras model can be freely downloaded from the website http www hec usace army mil currently the rvsm was integrated into the 1 d unsteady flow engine in hec ras the hec ras model computes water surface elevation discharge average velocity energy slope of each cross section the mass and momentum equations that govern the 1 d unsteady flow are described by 1a a t q x q l 0 1b q t q v x g a z x s f 0 where q is inflow a is cross sectional flow area x is distance along channel t is time ql is lateral inflow per unit length of channel v is velocity z is water surface elevation sf is friction slope g is acceleration of gravity eqs 1a and 1b are commonly referred as the saint venant equations the unsteady flow engine solves these equations using implicit finite difference approximations and preissman s second order scheme brunner 2016 the required input data include channel network connectivity cross section geometry reach lengths energy loss coefficients etc boundary conditions are necessary to define discharge and water depth at the system endpoints i e upstream and downstream lateral inflows and a variety of hydraulic structures can be prescribed within the model domain 2 2 groundwater module groundwater model is necessary to provide groundwater table and capillary fringe information required in rvsm a simplified groundwater module is developed to compute the groundwater levels of cross sections within the model domain and coupled with rvsm the groundwater levels are estimated based on river water surface elevation soil hydraulic conductivity and groundwater boundary conditions the 1 d groundwater governing equation is given by 2 h t y h c h y where h is groundwater level hc is saturated hydraulic conductivity y is the length along cross section finite difference scheme is used to solve the governing equation it is assumed that the groundwater flow along the cross section is 1 d the left and right boundary conditions for each cross section are defined as h y 0 wherever the water surface intersects the river cross section their groundwater levels are set to the water surface elevation as internal boundaries 2 3 riparian vegetation simulation module 2 3 1 vegetation classification and representation vegetation species on the riparian zone are classified into certain types vegetation types simulated in the model can be a species an alliance of species or a land use designation multiple species that have similar life cycles may be also simulated as one type for example several grass species are often grouped into one type herbs in general a special vegetation type called no grow is defined to represent the agricultural industrial and urban land on floodplains this vegetation type just occupies the space and prevents the colonization of other vegetation types its life cycle is not simulated for each vegetation type plant organs such as root stem and leaves are quantified using following indicators plant height canopy height canopy width stem diameter number of stems and root depth the canopy height and width of herbaceous vegetation are often set to 0 these plant characteristics are simulated because they are either factors impacting hydraulic roughness or factors affecting plant survival and growth such as root depth fig 1 illustrates a typical plant represented in rvsm 2 3 2 vegetation distribution and computational polygons vegetation distribution in real world is described by vegetation map while in the model it is represented by the existence or absence of vegetation in the computational polygons vegetation computational polygons are the basic unit of vegetation simulation hydraulics groundwater and vegetation conditions within one polygon are treated as homogeneous vegetation computational polygons cover the entire riparian zone model domain fig 2 shows how typical vegetation computational polygons are created between two cross sections in hec ras firstly a middle line is interpolated to divide two adjacent cross sections a user defined number of slice polygons between two middle lines along the river are then created within the left and right boundaries of the riparian zones using vegetation polygons created with this approach the hec ras 1 d model and groundwater module automatically pass hydraulic and groundwater information of each polygon to the rvsm a vegetation map generated from aerial photographs orr et al 2009 forzieri et al 2010 is often used to set initial distribution of vegetation types in the model the vegetation map is usually delivered as a polygon shapefile by overlapping a vegetation map with computational polygons initial distribution of simulated vegetation types is set to computation polygons through a series of geo processing operations it is important to note that multiple vegetation types can co exist in one polygon but one vegetation type within one polygon has uniform characteristics such as age plant height and root depth in rvsm 2 3 3 vegetation life cycle simulation the rvsm simulates life cycle of vegetation including seed dispersal seedling establishment plant growth and mortality in response to dynamic physical conditions during seed dispersal season seeds are available to certain vegetation polygons in the model domain seedlings are only established within the vegetation polygons according to seed availability and suitability criteria a seed germinates in user defined germination seasons when groundwater capillary fringe reaches ground surface and no other vegetation types in the same polygon prevent its germination fotherby et al 2012 after the seed germination plant growth is simulated by tracking growth of individual organs root stem and canopy the growth of plant root and stem is computed according to user defined growth rates the growth rates are specified for each month and age group the root growth stops when reaching the maximum root depth or a user specified depth with respect to groundwater table the stem growth also stops when the maximum height is reached the canopy height width and stem diameter are computed from empirical relationships with plant height a power relationship given in eq 3 is used to quantify the relationship between the plant height and its stem diameter hulshof et al 2015 the canopy height and its width are assumed to be constant ratios of plant height given in eq 4 3 h p a d b 4 h c α h p w c β h p where hp is plant height hc is canopy height wc is canopy width d is stem diameter and a b α β are species specific empirical coefficients multiple mechanisms may result in plant mortality and be removed from the model domain fotherby et al 2012 the following mechanisms are included in rvsm 1 desiccation two methods are available to simulate desiccation death root depth method supposes desiccation death occurs if root tip is above capillary fringe for certain days cumulative stress method calculates water stress based on groundwater level decline rate this method is described in detail in the next paragraph 2 drowning when vegetation is submerged for certain days 3 scour once flow velocity is greater than the maximum velocity plant can stand 4 competition if other vegetation types within the same polygon outcompete this plant e g invasive species reaching certain age may displace or kill some native species 5 senescence if plant age exceeds the maximum allowable age the basic time step of the vegetation simulation is daily but it is adjustable desiccation can be a dominant method of mortality especially in the southwest of arid and semiarid basins the cumulative stress method provided by fotherby et al 2012 and greimann 2016 is an improved model of desiccation that moves beyond the riparian recruitment box model of mahoney and rood 1998 a unitless water stress parameter ψ is used to track if a plant experiences mortality through desiccation and when it exceeds some critical value ψ c mortality occurs fig 3 presents the relationship for the rate of change in ψ as a function of water table decline derived for fremont cottonwood populus fremontii the critical value of the water stress parameter ψ c is equal to 0 6 this graph shows cottonwood seedlings growing in the sand sediment take over 6days to die if the water table drops at 5cm d on gravel sediments the plants take 3days to die at the same rate of water table decline the sandy sediments have a greater water holding capacity in the root zone and a thicker capillary rise zone than the gravel sediments the greater root mass and higher water holding capacity in the sandy soils results in more water available for plant use within the root zone for water table decline rates of 2cm d and less the ability of the roots to grow deeper at a similar rate results in much less stress and little difference between the sediment types it is interesting to note that recovery rates e g where the water table decline rate is less than 0 are nearly identical for both sediment textures this is due to the similar rates of water table rise in both sediment types as the water table increases the advantage of the water stress parameter is that it is a measure of the cumulative stress that the plant has experienced and that it accounts for the possibility of prolonged water table decline causing mortality 2 3 4 vegetation parameters and outputs in rvsm vegetation life processes are simulated using dozens of user defined parameters seed germination season growth rates of plant root and stem species specific coefficients in eqs 3 4 inter specific competition relationship and maximum age can be obtained from field study fotherby et al 2012 the relationship between water stress and water level decline rate stella et al 2010 maximum inundation duration auchincloss et al 2012 and critical scour velocity kui et al 2014 kui and stella 2016 wilcox and shafroth 2013 for riparian vegetation are often determined through laboratory experiments or obtained from literatures these parameters are also adjusted during the model calibration the rvsm outputs include quantitative characteristics of modeled vegetation types at each time step e g survival status age height stem diameter root depth etc the physical characteristics of vegetation are essential to compute vegetation roughness and thus quantify riparian vegetation s impacts on flow dynamics and sediment transport the rvsm also generates statistical results such as total area with living plants or area of dead plants due to desiccation and drowning for each vegetation type the dynamic variations in vegetation coverage area during the simulation period are important for investigating the relationship between flow regime and riparian vegetation response spatial distribution of vegetation types at any given date can be created based on model outputs and used to overlay with given vegetation map 2 4 interactions between flow and vegetation dynamics the hec ras model provides the following hydraulic information for vegetation computation polygons bottom elevation original manning s roughness coefficient water depth water surface elevation velocity and energy slope using water level calculated from hec ras the groundwater module computes groundwater level and capillary fringe elevation for vegetation polygons the hydraulic and groundwater information is then passed to the rvsm manning s roughness coefficients within the riparian zone are computed based on vegetation characteristics and hydraulic conditions in rvsm the impacts of riparian vegetation on river hydraulics and sediment transport are fed back to hec ras through updating rvsm computed roughness coefficients the rvsm may be used to compute dynamic manning s roughness for the hec ras unsteady flow model and assist in the flow model calibration the overall flowchart of hec ras rvsm system is shown in fig 4 3 application and evaluation of hec ras rvsm 3 1 study site the hec ras rvsm system was applied to the sacramento river california between red bluff diversion dam river mile rm 250 and colusa rm 143 fig 5 shows the sacramento river reach and its location this area known as the ecological management zone has the largest network of pioneer and mature riparian forest stands remaining in california dufour et al 2015 it supports a diverse aquatic riparian and terrestrial system meanwhile it serves societal needs for water supply and crop cultivation since 1986 multiple restoration projects have been implemented to protect restore and enhance fisheries and riparian habitat of the sacramento river viers and hutchinson 2008 the usbr has developed a suite of models in analyzing the effect of alternative flow operations on the riparian corridor of the sacramento river usbr 2009 data sets compiled by usbr were used to develop a hec ras rvsm system model for the sacramento river reach and to evaluate its capability in predicting interactions between flow and riparian vegetation 3 2 model development and calibration 3 2 1 river hydraulic model the sacramento river hec ras flow model was originally developed and calibrated by the usace 2002 the model domain covered 107 miles and included 362 cross sections it was further refined and calibrated to support the riparian vegetation simulation the hec ras model domain were interpolated into total 1063 cross sections and updated to the latest hec ras version 5 0 3 the model was run for eight year period from 10 01 1999 to 10 01 2007 observed flow at usgs gauge no 11377100 on the sacramento river above bend bridge near red bluff ca fig 5 was used as model s upstream boundary condition a rating curve at colusa ca was used as model s downstream boundary condition no tributary was included in the hydraulic model in general the study reach has two major high flows annually the flow pulses in spring have larger flow magnitude and shorter duration compared to the summer high flows observed water surface elevations at rm192 5 and rm183 in 2005 were used to calibrate the hec ras model calibrated manning s roughness coefficients of the main channel vary between 0 02 and 0 04 while these of floodplains are in the range of 0 029 0 2 3 2 2 groundwater model measured groundwater level at rm192 from june to october in 2005 was used to calibrate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of groundwater model based on the study conducted by the usbr 2009 gravel is the primary bed material in the study reach although there are some sandy bars a uniform hydraulic conductivity for gravel 0 347m s was applied to the model domain the height of capillary fringe in the groundwater model was used to compute the capillary fringe elevation which affects seedling establishment mahoney and rood 1998 and meier and hauer 2010 suggest that the height of capillary fringe often extends 0 25 0 75m on gravel bed rivers in this study the height of capillary rise was set to 0 3m 3 2 3 riparian vegetation model in developing the sacramento river riparian vegetation model 100 vegetation polygons were created between two cross sections vegetation polygons in the main channel were much denser than these on floodplains because some riparian seedlings like cottonwood grow in narrow bands close to the water edge rood et al 1998 the average length of vegetation polygons is about 150m whereas the width varies in the range of 3 150m the total 106300 vegetation polygons were created for the sacramento river reach five major vegetation types were simulated from approximately 20 vegetation species of the sacramento river reach simulated vegetation types include fremont s cottonwood populus fremontii mixed forest riparian shrub invasive species and grass mixed forest is a combination of vally oak quercus lobata california sycamore platanus racemosa black walnut juglans nigra and box elder acer negundo riparian shrub was an alliance of mixed willows goodding s willow salix gooddingii riparian scrub and blackberry scrub rubus invasive species include giant reed arundo donax and tamarisk parameters of plant germination growth and mortality were specified for individual vegetation type simulated in rvsm additionally no grow was defined as a vegetation type to take account of the agricultural residential and industrial lands on floodplains the sacramento river hec ras rvsm system was developed to predict riparian vegetation change in response to flow regime particularly the spatial change of cottonwood distribution over the 8 year period vegetation map dated in 1999 was used to set initial conditions of the vegetation model the initial ages of cottonwood and mixed forest were set to 40 year old riparian shrub was set to 5 year old invasive species were set to 2 year old and grass was 1 year old first year cottonwood seedling density at two point bars of rm192 5 and rm183 monitored in 2005 and seedling elevation at two transections of rm192 monitored in 2006 were used to calibrate cottonwood seedling establishment two vegetation maps dated in 1999 and 2007 viers and hutchinson 2007 2008 were used to calibrate the establishment growth and survival of multiple vegetation types temporal changes in mapped vegetation coverage area between 1999 and 2007 were used to compare with the changes computed from hec ras rvsm the model was validated by comparing mapped variation of cottonwood locations between 1999 and 2007 with predicted variation of cottonwood locations for the same period additionally the relationship between flow regime and cottonwood coverage change over the 8 years was further investigated based on model outputs since cottonwood was the main focus in the past for the sacramento river reach most calibration efforts of this study also focused on cottonwood the primary calibration parameters for the sacramento river vegetation model are listed in table 1 3 3 model results 3 3 1 hydraulics and groundwater fig 6 shows the comparison between hec ras simulated and observed river stage at rm 192 5 and rm183 in 2005 simulated river stage at the two cross sections matches observed river stage very well the root mean square errors of simulated river stage at rm192 5 and rm183 are 0 085m and 0 082m fig 7 presents the simulated and observed groundwater level at approximately 300m from the water edge of cross section at rm192 observed water surface elevation at rm192 is also shown in fig 7 the root mean square error of simulated groundwater level is around 0 113m in addition the groundwater level at rm 192 is pretty close to water surface elevation which indicates groundwater level responds quickly to surface water variation 3 3 2 cottonwood seedling establishment simulated cottonwood seedling areas at rm192 5 and rm183 from may to september in 2005 are compared with measured cottonwood density data in fig 8 currently the rvsm does not directly compute plant density only tracks if a vegetation type survives in vegetation polygons so computed seedling area was used to compare with measured seedling density and to calibrate parameters affecting mortality and the root growth rate see table 1 in general the variation trend of seedling density is consistent with that of seedling area during the seed germination season as shown in fig 8 the temporal variations of simulated cottonwood seedling area at both rm192 5 and rm183 are in agreement with these of measured seedling density the two seedling peaks and two falls following each peak between april and august in 2005 were captured by the model the first seedling peak observed at rm192 5 occurred on april 27 while the predicted first seedling peak took place in early may only few days time lag the second observed seedling peak was in july but the predicted second peak appeared in middle june in the sacramento river vegetation model april 30 june 19 was defined as the seed germination season table 1 based on cottonwood seed release monitoring data provided by california department of water resources cdwr 2005 however the actual seed dispersal and germination in 2005 exceeded this period a large scale seed release persisted for july and resulted in the second seedling peak in july greimann and fotherby 2012 measured cottonwood seedling density at rm 192 5 declined significantly in middle may 2005 and the computed seedling area also reflected this pattern the declining trend was mainly caused by flood scour and the rapid water level decline following this flood see fig 6 the second decreases of cottonwood seedling density and area starting from august at rm192 5 and from july at rm183 were relatively slow due to the lower receding rates of surface water level and groundwater level in july and early august figs 6 and 7 river stage further declined from middle august and stayed at a low level afterward which caused the majority of cottonwood seedlings died at rm183 but a fraction of seedlings survived at rm192 5 although the changes in river stage and groundwater level were similar at rm183 and rm192 5 the changes in cottonwood seedling density and area behaved differently at the two sites the different seedling response behaviors may be caused by the gentler bank slope at rm192 5 than that of rm183 fig 9 shows the simulated and measured maximum and minimum elevation of cottonwood seedling above the low water on two adjacent bars in 2006 the elevations of cottonwood seedling in both gravel soil and sandy soil were observed to descend closely following the decrease of river stage the rvsm model also captured this pattern of temporal change furthermore the simulated seedling elevation on the gravel soil bar matches the observed elevation much better than that on the sandy soil bar the height of capillary fringe used in this study is 0 3m a typical value for gravel bar this value may be too low for sandy soil height of capillary fringe for sandy soil is usually higher than 0 3m according to harr 1991 the height of capillary fringe for fine sand is 0 35 0 7m as shown in fig 9 cottonwood seedling elevation on the sandy soil bar is higher and the difference between maximum and minimum seedling elevation is wider than these on the gravel soil bar the measured maximum seedling elevation above low water in sandy soil is approximately 0 3m higher than that elevation in gravel soil this implies that cottonwood seedling elevation is very sensitive to local soil s height of capillary fringe meier 2008 indicates that the height of capillary rise is highly variable at fine spatial scales which could result in fine scale vegetation patchiness therefore the height of capillary rise is an important parameter that should be given based on a soil map and calibrated with observed seedling elevation 3 3 3 temporal changes in acreage of major vegetation types the computed and mapped acreage changes of the five vegetation types between 1999 and 2007 are presented in table 2 the results indicate that sacramento river vegetation model was able to predict the increasing or decreasing trends of all major vegetation types over 8 years the five vegetation types except mixed forest have increased over the 8 years the computed acreage change ratio was smaller for cottonwood and was larger for mixed forest and invasive species than the mapped change ratios the computed change ratio for riparian shrub and grass was close to mapped values the computed acreage change of cottonwood was 14 increase over the 8 years lower than the mapped ratio the vegetation maps show that cottonwood area increased by 35 between 1999 and 2007 but 25 increase was converted from deciduous fruits nuts and field crops the riparian vegetation restoration implemented during the simulation period golet et al 2008 probably derived this type of land conversion in this study deciduous fruits nuts and field crops were simulated as nogrow vegetation type therefore no other vegetation types can grow in the space occupied by nogrow however the computed increase ratio is reasonably good when this type of land conversion was excluded the above model result indicates that the hec ras rvsm system can be used to predict relative changes of major vegetation types over a long term period the tool will be helpful for quantifying impacts of flow management alternatives and ecosystem restoration projects on riparian vegetation 3 3 4 spatial changes of cottonwood distribution the performance of the sacramento river vegetation model was validated through comparing the mapped and predicted spatial changes of cottonwood distribution between 1999 and 2007 the comparison indicates that the model was able to capture evident cottonwood coverage increase observed on certain point bars as an example for the reach between rm183 5 and rm186 the fig 10 a shows that the predicted spatial locations of cottonwood increase from 1999 to 2007 the red polygons are close to but not overlaid with the locations of cottonwood increase derived from vegetation maps the dark green area the prediction error is partially attributed to the sparse original cross sections currently used in the hec ras model a high resolution channel geometry is necessary to refine the model and increase the model predictability and accuracy the model overestimated cottonwood establishment around oxbow lakes or ponds fig 10b shows that the model predicted evident cottonwood increase occurred around two oxbow lakes the red polygons while only small cottonwood coverage increase tiny dark green polygons was detected from vegetation maps the hec ras model assumes that the water level of isolated water bodies is always the same as river stage of main channel for a cross section brunner 2016 when water is shallow and evaporation or infiltration is high water level decline in isolated water bodies may be faster than river stage decline in main channel this process potentially causes the areas around some isolated water bodies are not suitable for seedling survival and establishment the current hec ras model does not consider these water level changes in oxbow lakes or ponds and results in the overestimation of cottonwood establishment around these water bodies 3 3 5 relationship between cottonwood coverage change and flow regime vegetation maps and model results discussed previously both indicate that cottonwood area increased by approximately 10 between 1999 and 2007 excluding the impact of restoration practice it is worthwhile to further analyze the reason for the increase by examining the relationship between cottonwood area and flow regime based on rvsm outputs fig 11 presents the simulated change in total area of living cottonwood as well as river stage hydrograph at rm192 5 during the 8 year period the figure shows that the increase of cottonwood area mainly took place in 2000 and 2004 in the rest years cottonwood area did not increase at the end of growing season previous studies rood et al 1998 scott et al 1997 stella 2005 dixon et al 2015 found that cottonwood seedling establishment depended on the floods exceeding certain magnitude occurring in spring prior to seed release the floods created necessary bare and moist establishment sites at an elevation high enough to allow cottonwood survive subsequent floods the model reproduced this finding the large spring floods in 2000 2004 and 2006 enabled massive initial seedlings in contrast the small spring flood in 2001 2002 and 2007 led to particularly limited initial seedling areas the moderate flood in january 2003 occurred too early mid february to may before seed release thus did not trigger a massive seedling event however how many seedlings that can survive the first growing season are determined by the flow regime after germination mahoney and rood 1998 stella et al 2010 dixon et al 2015 the simulated areas of dead cottonwood due to desiccation drowning scour and competition are also shown in fig 11 it reveals that desiccation was the primary cause of cottonwood seedling death the sharp decline in river stage shortly after the start of seed germination season caused a large number of seedlings dead in 2000 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 among the three years with extensive initial seedlings the abrupt river stage decline rate of about 15cm d in late april and early may of 2006 was much greater than the rate of about 6cm d in the same period of 2000 and 2004 this resulted in few seedlings survival in 2006 the continuous river stage recession in the growing season from june to november imposed cumulative desiccation stress on seedlings and led to the gradual shrink of cottonwood area in most years in addition the high flow longer than 15days in germination and growing seasons induced evident inundation death in 2001 2002 2004 and 2007 therefore favorable flow regime in 2000 and 2004 that included large spring floods taking place not long before the start of germination and the gradual river stage recession during germination and growing seasons was predicted to contribute to the cottonwood area increase over the 8 years this finding can help environmental flow prescription for cottonwood restoration 3 4 sensitivity of two key vegetation parameters the height of capillary fringe and plant root growth rate are two critical vegetation input parameters identified from the sacramento river application so their sensitivities on vegetation coverage area were further investigated here the height of capillary fringe not only affects seedling elevation but also the spatial distribution and total area of riparian vegetation the higher capillary fringe means more soil water available for seed germination and seedling establishment to analyze the sensitivity of the height of capillary fringe this parameter was set within the range of 0 05m and 0 61m with the other vegetation parameters intact in the sacramento river vegetation model fig 12 shows model computed vegetation areas of the five major vegetation types after 8 years coverage area of most vegetation types expanded with the increased capillary fringe while only grass area shrank slightly the grass area decreased because the other vegetation types outcompeted grass and occupied a small fraction of space where grass colonized previously the sensitivity of height of capillary fringe on cottonwood population dynamics was also emphasized by harper et al 2011 therefore the value of capillary fringe height should be carefully calibrated in applying the rvsm the root growth rate plays a significant role in determining how many seedlings can survive the drought fig 13 illustrates that the model computed cottonwood area in 2007 increased gradually with root growth rate increasing from 1 to 10mm d in this study cottonwood root growth rate was set to 2mm d based on the experiment conducted from mid july through late october 2002 at the university of california lafayette ca stella 2005 the experiment observed that cottonwood seedling had a growth rate ranging from 1 1 2 2mm d lower than the values reported by mahoney and rood 1998 roberts et al 2002 and meier 2008 nevertheless the predicted cottonwood seedling area and elevation roughly agree with the seedling observation in 2005 and 2006 when root growth rate was set to 2mm d see figs 8 and 9 4 summary and conclusions the polygon based rvsm has been developed and integrated with the hec ras 1 d unsteady flow model to predicting the complex vegetation response to geomorphic conditions and dynamic flow regime the vegetation algorithms simulated in rvsm are highly empirical and use specific parameters to quantify the vegetation life cycle the hec ras rvsm system was applied to the sacramento river reach for evaluating its capability in predicting interactions between flow and riparian vegetation five riparian vegetation types with cottonwood mixed forest riparian shrub invasive species and grass were simulated from 1999 to 2007 flow river stage groundwater level cottonwood seedling density and elevation collected at rm192 5 and rm183 in 2005 and 2006 were used to calibrate the model the model result shows that the hec ras rvsm system reproduced the acreage change of the five major vegetation types over the 8 year period the rvsm was able to predict cottonwood establishment at certain point bars even though the predicted locations may not be exactly accurate the predicted variations of cottonwood coverage in response to dynamic flow regime facilitated the environmental flow prescription for riparian vegetation restoration height of capillary fringe and root growth rate were found to be two critical parameters influencing vegetation distribution the 1 d hydraulic model has the advantage of running fast over a long term simulation and the disadvantage of inability to simulate microscale flow velocity bed erosion and deposition therefore this tool is best used for quantifying impacts of flow management alternatives and ecosystem restoration projects on riparian vegetation instead of using as an absolute predictor to better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of riparian vegetation dense cross sections and fine vegetation polygons are necessary in applying hec ras rvsm the impact of precipitation evaporation infiltration on river stage and groundwater level will be taken into account in the future improvement and development the rvsm will be further developed to simulate plant density and feedback of vegetation cycle on river hydraulics geomorphology and water quality furthermore it will be integrated with hec ras 2 d flow model to simulate spatial and temporal changes of riparian vegetation in great detail acknowledgements the study was conducted as an activity of the u s army corps of engineers ecosystem management and restoration research program the authors thank mark jensen and steve piper for their support for integrating rvsm into hec ras the valuable and constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers are highly appreciated 
25353,life cycles of riparian vegetation are substantially impacted by river flow regime groundwater and morphodynamics the polygon based riparian vegetation simulation module rvsm was developed and integrated into hec ras one dimensional flow model to predict spatially explicit seed germination seedling establishment plant growth and mortality in response to fluvial processes the hec ras rvsm system was applied to the sacramento river reach to evaluate its capability in modeling temporal and spatial changes of riparian vegetation and the interactions between flow and riparian vegetation dynamics river hydraulics groundwater level and five vegetation types of the study reach were simulated for the eight year 1999 2007 period model results demonstrate that the hec ras rvsm system reproduced the coverage increase of cottonwood riparian shrub invasive species and grass as well as the coverage decrease in mixed forest over the eight year the rvsm was able to capture sites for cottonwood establishment observed on certain point bars the modeled variations of cottonwood coverage in response to dynamic flow regime facilitated determining and managing environmental flow for riparian vegetation restoration the height of capillary fringe and root growth rate were two key parameters influencing riparian vegetation distribution keywords hec ras hydraulics groundwater riparian vegetation simulation cottonwood sacramento river 1 introduction riparian zones are long strips of vegetation adjacent to streams rivers lakes reservoirs and other inland aquatic systems fischer and fischenich 2000 riparian zones range in width from a few to hundreds of meters riparian vegetation is diverse in species and varies from aquatic graminiod sedge wet meadows to extensive forests life cycles of the riparian vegetation species are directly and indirectly affected by flow regime tabacchi et al 1998 the flow regime is the main driver of channel morphology through its influence on sediment transport and channel structure flood and drought disturbances and the erosion and deposition of sediments all have major impacts on shaping the composition structure and abundance of riparian vegetation merritt et al 2010 riparian vegetation species have evolved specific traits to survive and reproduce in response to these disturbances naiman et al 2010 for instance seed release of the pioneer riparian trees like cottonwood and black willow often coincides with peak runoff or flood recession stella et al 2006 some riparian plants depend on flow dynamics to enable long distance seed dispersal johansson et al 1996 in addition groundwater level and soil moisture of floodplains influenced by river flow are also determinant environmental factors for seed germination and seedling establishment particularly in the riparian zones of arid and semiarid basins stromberg 2001 stromberg et al 1996 unfortunately alterations of flow regime worldwide due to dam operation and river regulation have highly modified and degraded the riparian vegetation community some of the negative effects of altered flow regimes on riparian vegetation may be alleviated through ecosystem management and restoration vegetation in riparian zones plays a significant role in controlling channel morphology maintaining a favorable habitat for aquatic organisms and improving river water quality tabacchi et al 1998 perucca et al 2007 riparian vegetation increases the bank resistance against erosion directly by root binding and indirectly by enhancing local deposition of organic material and fine sediment which increases the soil cohesion tal et al 2004 by trapping organic matter and sediment as well as assimilating excessive nutrients riparian vegetation has a strong ability to mitigate nutrients and contaminants contents of adjacent rivers dosskey et al 2010 thus vegetated riparian buffer zones established between agricultural fields and receiving waters have been widely used for water quality improvement comerford et al 1992 moreover as a result of widespread loss and degradation of global riparian habitat riparian vegetation rehabilitation has become an important component for many river restoration programs goodwin et al 1997 merritt et al 2010 rood et al 2005 stromberg 2001 to support the riparian ecosystem management and restoration there is a critical need for developing a physically based quantitative tool to predict riparian vegetation s response to fluvial processes and to evaluate alternative operations and management plans most of existing riparian vegetation models such as ecological dynamics simulation model edys and riparian ecosystem management model remm have not linked their vegetation simulation with river hydraulics and sediment transport coldren et al 2011 lowrance et al 2000 the complex interactions between flow dynamics and riparian vegetation cannot be quantified with these models the u s bureau of reclamation usbr has added a riparian vegetation simulation component into its srh 1d model called srh 1dv for modeling the interactions of flow and riparian vegetation the srh 1d is usbr s one dimensional 1 d hydraulics and sediment transport model the srh 1dv model has been applied to the sacramento river rio grande river and san joaquin river in support of water management decision making environmental planning and ecosystem restoration analysis fotherby et al 2012 greimann 2016 in this study the riparian vegetation simulation component within the srh 1dv model was improved and further developed as a polygon based riparian vegetation simulation module rvsm the rvsm simulates life cycles of vegetation species within the riparian zone using polygons instead of cross section points used in srh 1dv advantages of the polygon based riparian vegetation model are 1 to better represent the spatial distribution of real world riparian vegetation 2 to fit for coupling with both 1 d and two dimensional 2 d flow models 3 to directly overlay model results with a vegetation map for performing spatial analysis the rvsm has been integrated into the hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system 1 d flow model hec ras is used to simulate riverine hydraulics and performs mobile bed sediment transport both capabilities are critically important when simulating the effects of vegetation on hydraulic roughness and the life cycles of various vegetation species the hec ras model was chosen also because it has been continuously developed and supported by u s army corps of engineers usace and widely used in the u s and world most large river systems as well as many smaller rivers and streams in the u s have already been modeled with hec ras aim of this study was to apply the hec ras rvsm system to a reach of sacramento river in modeling spatial and temporal changes of riparian vegetation over eight year period and to evaluate its capability for predicting interactions between flow and riparian vegetation dynamics 2 hec ras riparian vegetation simulation module this section briefly describes the integrated hec ras rvsm system 2 1 hec ras model hec ras is a public domain river hydraulic model it contains five components brunner 2016 1 1 d steady flow water surface profile computations 2 1 d unsteady flow simulation 3 2 d unsteady flow simulation 4 movable boundary sediment transport computations and 5 water quality analysis through plug in water quality modules the latest version of hec ras model can be freely downloaded from the website http www hec usace army mil currently the rvsm was integrated into the 1 d unsteady flow engine in hec ras the hec ras model computes water surface elevation discharge average velocity energy slope of each cross section the mass and momentum equations that govern the 1 d unsteady flow are described by 1a a t q x q l 0 1b q t q v x g a z x s f 0 where q is inflow a is cross sectional flow area x is distance along channel t is time ql is lateral inflow per unit length of channel v is velocity z is water surface elevation sf is friction slope g is acceleration of gravity eqs 1a and 1b are commonly referred as the saint venant equations the unsteady flow engine solves these equations using implicit finite difference approximations and preissman s second order scheme brunner 2016 the required input data include channel network connectivity cross section geometry reach lengths energy loss coefficients etc boundary conditions are necessary to define discharge and water depth at the system endpoints i e upstream and downstream lateral inflows and a variety of hydraulic structures can be prescribed within the model domain 2 2 groundwater module groundwater model is necessary to provide groundwater table and capillary fringe information required in rvsm a simplified groundwater module is developed to compute the groundwater levels of cross sections within the model domain and coupled with rvsm the groundwater levels are estimated based on river water surface elevation soil hydraulic conductivity and groundwater boundary conditions the 1 d groundwater governing equation is given by 2 h t y h c h y where h is groundwater level hc is saturated hydraulic conductivity y is the length along cross section finite difference scheme is used to solve the governing equation it is assumed that the groundwater flow along the cross section is 1 d the left and right boundary conditions for each cross section are defined as h y 0 wherever the water surface intersects the river cross section their groundwater levels are set to the water surface elevation as internal boundaries 2 3 riparian vegetation simulation module 2 3 1 vegetation classification and representation vegetation species on the riparian zone are classified into certain types vegetation types simulated in the model can be a species an alliance of species or a land use designation multiple species that have similar life cycles may be also simulated as one type for example several grass species are often grouped into one type herbs in general a special vegetation type called no grow is defined to represent the agricultural industrial and urban land on floodplains this vegetation type just occupies the space and prevents the colonization of other vegetation types its life cycle is not simulated for each vegetation type plant organs such as root stem and leaves are quantified using following indicators plant height canopy height canopy width stem diameter number of stems and root depth the canopy height and width of herbaceous vegetation are often set to 0 these plant characteristics are simulated because they are either factors impacting hydraulic roughness or factors affecting plant survival and growth such as root depth fig 1 illustrates a typical plant represented in rvsm 2 3 2 vegetation distribution and computational polygons vegetation distribution in real world is described by vegetation map while in the model it is represented by the existence or absence of vegetation in the computational polygons vegetation computational polygons are the basic unit of vegetation simulation hydraulics groundwater and vegetation conditions within one polygon are treated as homogeneous vegetation computational polygons cover the entire riparian zone model domain fig 2 shows how typical vegetation computational polygons are created between two cross sections in hec ras firstly a middle line is interpolated to divide two adjacent cross sections a user defined number of slice polygons between two middle lines along the river are then created within the left and right boundaries of the riparian zones using vegetation polygons created with this approach the hec ras 1 d model and groundwater module automatically pass hydraulic and groundwater information of each polygon to the rvsm a vegetation map generated from aerial photographs orr et al 2009 forzieri et al 2010 is often used to set initial distribution of vegetation types in the model the vegetation map is usually delivered as a polygon shapefile by overlapping a vegetation map with computational polygons initial distribution of simulated vegetation types is set to computation polygons through a series of geo processing operations it is important to note that multiple vegetation types can co exist in one polygon but one vegetation type within one polygon has uniform characteristics such as age plant height and root depth in rvsm 2 3 3 vegetation life cycle simulation the rvsm simulates life cycle of vegetation including seed dispersal seedling establishment plant growth and mortality in response to dynamic physical conditions during seed dispersal season seeds are available to certain vegetation polygons in the model domain seedlings are only established within the vegetation polygons according to seed availability and suitability criteria a seed germinates in user defined germination seasons when groundwater capillary fringe reaches ground surface and no other vegetation types in the same polygon prevent its germination fotherby et al 2012 after the seed germination plant growth is simulated by tracking growth of individual organs root stem and canopy the growth of plant root and stem is computed according to user defined growth rates the growth rates are specified for each month and age group the root growth stops when reaching the maximum root depth or a user specified depth with respect to groundwater table the stem growth also stops when the maximum height is reached the canopy height width and stem diameter are computed from empirical relationships with plant height a power relationship given in eq 3 is used to quantify the relationship between the plant height and its stem diameter hulshof et al 2015 the canopy height and its width are assumed to be constant ratios of plant height given in eq 4 3 h p a d b 4 h c α h p w c β h p where hp is plant height hc is canopy height wc is canopy width d is stem diameter and a b α β are species specific empirical coefficients multiple mechanisms may result in plant mortality and be removed from the model domain fotherby et al 2012 the following mechanisms are included in rvsm 1 desiccation two methods are available to simulate desiccation death root depth method supposes desiccation death occurs if root tip is above capillary fringe for certain days cumulative stress method calculates water stress based on groundwater level decline rate this method is described in detail in the next paragraph 2 drowning when vegetation is submerged for certain days 3 scour once flow velocity is greater than the maximum velocity plant can stand 4 competition if other vegetation types within the same polygon outcompete this plant e g invasive species reaching certain age may displace or kill some native species 5 senescence if plant age exceeds the maximum allowable age the basic time step of the vegetation simulation is daily but it is adjustable desiccation can be a dominant method of mortality especially in the southwest of arid and semiarid basins the cumulative stress method provided by fotherby et al 2012 and greimann 2016 is an improved model of desiccation that moves beyond the riparian recruitment box model of mahoney and rood 1998 a unitless water stress parameter ψ is used to track if a plant experiences mortality through desiccation and when it exceeds some critical value ψ c mortality occurs fig 3 presents the relationship for the rate of change in ψ as a function of water table decline derived for fremont cottonwood populus fremontii the critical value of the water stress parameter ψ c is equal to 0 6 this graph shows cottonwood seedlings growing in the sand sediment take over 6days to die if the water table drops at 5cm d on gravel sediments the plants take 3days to die at the same rate of water table decline the sandy sediments have a greater water holding capacity in the root zone and a thicker capillary rise zone than the gravel sediments the greater root mass and higher water holding capacity in the sandy soils results in more water available for plant use within the root zone for water table decline rates of 2cm d and less the ability of the roots to grow deeper at a similar rate results in much less stress and little difference between the sediment types it is interesting to note that recovery rates e g where the water table decline rate is less than 0 are nearly identical for both sediment textures this is due to the similar rates of water table rise in both sediment types as the water table increases the advantage of the water stress parameter is that it is a measure of the cumulative stress that the plant has experienced and that it accounts for the possibility of prolonged water table decline causing mortality 2 3 4 vegetation parameters and outputs in rvsm vegetation life processes are simulated using dozens of user defined parameters seed germination season growth rates of plant root and stem species specific coefficients in eqs 3 4 inter specific competition relationship and maximum age can be obtained from field study fotherby et al 2012 the relationship between water stress and water level decline rate stella et al 2010 maximum inundation duration auchincloss et al 2012 and critical scour velocity kui et al 2014 kui and stella 2016 wilcox and shafroth 2013 for riparian vegetation are often determined through laboratory experiments or obtained from literatures these parameters are also adjusted during the model calibration the rvsm outputs include quantitative characteristics of modeled vegetation types at each time step e g survival status age height stem diameter root depth etc the physical characteristics of vegetation are essential to compute vegetation roughness and thus quantify riparian vegetation s impacts on flow dynamics and sediment transport the rvsm also generates statistical results such as total area with living plants or area of dead plants due to desiccation and drowning for each vegetation type the dynamic variations in vegetation coverage area during the simulation period are important for investigating the relationship between flow regime and riparian vegetation response spatial distribution of vegetation types at any given date can be created based on model outputs and used to overlay with given vegetation map 2 4 interactions between flow and vegetation dynamics the hec ras model provides the following hydraulic information for vegetation computation polygons bottom elevation original manning s roughness coefficient water depth water surface elevation velocity and energy slope using water level calculated from hec ras the groundwater module computes groundwater level and capillary fringe elevation for vegetation polygons the hydraulic and groundwater information is then passed to the rvsm manning s roughness coefficients within the riparian zone are computed based on vegetation characteristics and hydraulic conditions in rvsm the impacts of riparian vegetation on river hydraulics and sediment transport are fed back to hec ras through updating rvsm computed roughness coefficients the rvsm may be used to compute dynamic manning s roughness for the hec ras unsteady flow model and assist in the flow model calibration the overall flowchart of hec ras rvsm system is shown in fig 4 3 application and evaluation of hec ras rvsm 3 1 study site the hec ras rvsm system was applied to the sacramento river california between red bluff diversion dam river mile rm 250 and colusa rm 143 fig 5 shows the sacramento river reach and its location this area known as the ecological management zone has the largest network of pioneer and mature riparian forest stands remaining in california dufour et al 2015 it supports a diverse aquatic riparian and terrestrial system meanwhile it serves societal needs for water supply and crop cultivation since 1986 multiple restoration projects have been implemented to protect restore and enhance fisheries and riparian habitat of the sacramento river viers and hutchinson 2008 the usbr has developed a suite of models in analyzing the effect of alternative flow operations on the riparian corridor of the sacramento river usbr 2009 data sets compiled by usbr were used to develop a hec ras rvsm system model for the sacramento river reach and to evaluate its capability in predicting interactions between flow and riparian vegetation 3 2 model development and calibration 3 2 1 river hydraulic model the sacramento river hec ras flow model was originally developed and calibrated by the usace 2002 the model domain covered 107 miles and included 362 cross sections it was further refined and calibrated to support the riparian vegetation simulation the hec ras model domain were interpolated into total 1063 cross sections and updated to the latest hec ras version 5 0 3 the model was run for eight year period from 10 01 1999 to 10 01 2007 observed flow at usgs gauge no 11377100 on the sacramento river above bend bridge near red bluff ca fig 5 was used as model s upstream boundary condition a rating curve at colusa ca was used as model s downstream boundary condition no tributary was included in the hydraulic model in general the study reach has two major high flows annually the flow pulses in spring have larger flow magnitude and shorter duration compared to the summer high flows observed water surface elevations at rm192 5 and rm183 in 2005 were used to calibrate the hec ras model calibrated manning s roughness coefficients of the main channel vary between 0 02 and 0 04 while these of floodplains are in the range of 0 029 0 2 3 2 2 groundwater model measured groundwater level at rm192 from june to october in 2005 was used to calibrate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of groundwater model based on the study conducted by the usbr 2009 gravel is the primary bed material in the study reach although there are some sandy bars a uniform hydraulic conductivity for gravel 0 347m s was applied to the model domain the height of capillary fringe in the groundwater model was used to compute the capillary fringe elevation which affects seedling establishment mahoney and rood 1998 and meier and hauer 2010 suggest that the height of capillary fringe often extends 0 25 0 75m on gravel bed rivers in this study the height of capillary rise was set to 0 3m 3 2 3 riparian vegetation model in developing the sacramento river riparian vegetation model 100 vegetation polygons were created between two cross sections vegetation polygons in the main channel were much denser than these on floodplains because some riparian seedlings like cottonwood grow in narrow bands close to the water edge rood et al 1998 the average length of vegetation polygons is about 150m whereas the width varies in the range of 3 150m the total 106300 vegetation polygons were created for the sacramento river reach five major vegetation types were simulated from approximately 20 vegetation species of the sacramento river reach simulated vegetation types include fremont s cottonwood populus fremontii mixed forest riparian shrub invasive species and grass mixed forest is a combination of vally oak quercus lobata california sycamore platanus racemosa black walnut juglans nigra and box elder acer negundo riparian shrub was an alliance of mixed willows goodding s willow salix gooddingii riparian scrub and blackberry scrub rubus invasive species include giant reed arundo donax and tamarisk parameters of plant germination growth and mortality were specified for individual vegetation type simulated in rvsm additionally no grow was defined as a vegetation type to take account of the agricultural residential and industrial lands on floodplains the sacramento river hec ras rvsm system was developed to predict riparian vegetation change in response to flow regime particularly the spatial change of cottonwood distribution over the 8 year period vegetation map dated in 1999 was used to set initial conditions of the vegetation model the initial ages of cottonwood and mixed forest were set to 40 year old riparian shrub was set to 5 year old invasive species were set to 2 year old and grass was 1 year old first year cottonwood seedling density at two point bars of rm192 5 and rm183 monitored in 2005 and seedling elevation at two transections of rm192 monitored in 2006 were used to calibrate cottonwood seedling establishment two vegetation maps dated in 1999 and 2007 viers and hutchinson 2007 2008 were used to calibrate the establishment growth and survival of multiple vegetation types temporal changes in mapped vegetation coverage area between 1999 and 2007 were used to compare with the changes computed from hec ras rvsm the model was validated by comparing mapped variation of cottonwood locations between 1999 and 2007 with predicted variation of cottonwood locations for the same period additionally the relationship between flow regime and cottonwood coverage change over the 8 years was further investigated based on model outputs since cottonwood was the main focus in the past for the sacramento river reach most calibration efforts of this study also focused on cottonwood the primary calibration parameters for the sacramento river vegetation model are listed in table 1 3 3 model results 3 3 1 hydraulics and groundwater fig 6 shows the comparison between hec ras simulated and observed river stage at rm 192 5 and rm183 in 2005 simulated river stage at the two cross sections matches observed river stage very well the root mean square errors of simulated river stage at rm192 5 and rm183 are 0 085m and 0 082m fig 7 presents the simulated and observed groundwater level at approximately 300m from the water edge of cross section at rm192 observed water surface elevation at rm192 is also shown in fig 7 the root mean square error of simulated groundwater level is around 0 113m in addition the groundwater level at rm 192 is pretty close to water surface elevation which indicates groundwater level responds quickly to surface water variation 3 3 2 cottonwood seedling establishment simulated cottonwood seedling areas at rm192 5 and rm183 from may to september in 2005 are compared with measured cottonwood density data in fig 8 currently the rvsm does not directly compute plant density only tracks if a vegetation type survives in vegetation polygons so computed seedling area was used to compare with measured seedling density and to calibrate parameters affecting mortality and the root growth rate see table 1 in general the variation trend of seedling density is consistent with that of seedling area during the seed germination season as shown in fig 8 the temporal variations of simulated cottonwood seedling area at both rm192 5 and rm183 are in agreement with these of measured seedling density the two seedling peaks and two falls following each peak between april and august in 2005 were captured by the model the first seedling peak observed at rm192 5 occurred on april 27 while the predicted first seedling peak took place in early may only few days time lag the second observed seedling peak was in july but the predicted second peak appeared in middle june in the sacramento river vegetation model april 30 june 19 was defined as the seed germination season table 1 based on cottonwood seed release monitoring data provided by california department of water resources cdwr 2005 however the actual seed dispersal and germination in 2005 exceeded this period a large scale seed release persisted for july and resulted in the second seedling peak in july greimann and fotherby 2012 measured cottonwood seedling density at rm 192 5 declined significantly in middle may 2005 and the computed seedling area also reflected this pattern the declining trend was mainly caused by flood scour and the rapid water level decline following this flood see fig 6 the second decreases of cottonwood seedling density and area starting from august at rm192 5 and from july at rm183 were relatively slow due to the lower receding rates of surface water level and groundwater level in july and early august figs 6 and 7 river stage further declined from middle august and stayed at a low level afterward which caused the majority of cottonwood seedlings died at rm183 but a fraction of seedlings survived at rm192 5 although the changes in river stage and groundwater level were similar at rm183 and rm192 5 the changes in cottonwood seedling density and area behaved differently at the two sites the different seedling response behaviors may be caused by the gentler bank slope at rm192 5 than that of rm183 fig 9 shows the simulated and measured maximum and minimum elevation of cottonwood seedling above the low water on two adjacent bars in 2006 the elevations of cottonwood seedling in both gravel soil and sandy soil were observed to descend closely following the decrease of river stage the rvsm model also captured this pattern of temporal change furthermore the simulated seedling elevation on the gravel soil bar matches the observed elevation much better than that on the sandy soil bar the height of capillary fringe used in this study is 0 3m a typical value for gravel bar this value may be too low for sandy soil height of capillary fringe for sandy soil is usually higher than 0 3m according to harr 1991 the height of capillary fringe for fine sand is 0 35 0 7m as shown in fig 9 cottonwood seedling elevation on the sandy soil bar is higher and the difference between maximum and minimum seedling elevation is wider than these on the gravel soil bar the measured maximum seedling elevation above low water in sandy soil is approximately 0 3m higher than that elevation in gravel soil this implies that cottonwood seedling elevation is very sensitive to local soil s height of capillary fringe meier 2008 indicates that the height of capillary rise is highly variable at fine spatial scales which could result in fine scale vegetation patchiness therefore the height of capillary rise is an important parameter that should be given based on a soil map and calibrated with observed seedling elevation 3 3 3 temporal changes in acreage of major vegetation types the computed and mapped acreage changes of the five vegetation types between 1999 and 2007 are presented in table 2 the results indicate that sacramento river vegetation model was able to predict the increasing or decreasing trends of all major vegetation types over 8 years the five vegetation types except mixed forest have increased over the 8 years the computed acreage change ratio was smaller for cottonwood and was larger for mixed forest and invasive species than the mapped change ratios the computed change ratio for riparian shrub and grass was close to mapped values the computed acreage change of cottonwood was 14 increase over the 8 years lower than the mapped ratio the vegetation maps show that cottonwood area increased by 35 between 1999 and 2007 but 25 increase was converted from deciduous fruits nuts and field crops the riparian vegetation restoration implemented during the simulation period golet et al 2008 probably derived this type of land conversion in this study deciduous fruits nuts and field crops were simulated as nogrow vegetation type therefore no other vegetation types can grow in the space occupied by nogrow however the computed increase ratio is reasonably good when this type of land conversion was excluded the above model result indicates that the hec ras rvsm system can be used to predict relative changes of major vegetation types over a long term period the tool will be helpful for quantifying impacts of flow management alternatives and ecosystem restoration projects on riparian vegetation 3 3 4 spatial changes of cottonwood distribution the performance of the sacramento river vegetation model was validated through comparing the mapped and predicted spatial changes of cottonwood distribution between 1999 and 2007 the comparison indicates that the model was able to capture evident cottonwood coverage increase observed on certain point bars as an example for the reach between rm183 5 and rm186 the fig 10 a shows that the predicted spatial locations of cottonwood increase from 1999 to 2007 the red polygons are close to but not overlaid with the locations of cottonwood increase derived from vegetation maps the dark green area the prediction error is partially attributed to the sparse original cross sections currently used in the hec ras model a high resolution channel geometry is necessary to refine the model and increase the model predictability and accuracy the model overestimated cottonwood establishment around oxbow lakes or ponds fig 10b shows that the model predicted evident cottonwood increase occurred around two oxbow lakes the red polygons while only small cottonwood coverage increase tiny dark green polygons was detected from vegetation maps the hec ras model assumes that the water level of isolated water bodies is always the same as river stage of main channel for a cross section brunner 2016 when water is shallow and evaporation or infiltration is high water level decline in isolated water bodies may be faster than river stage decline in main channel this process potentially causes the areas around some isolated water bodies are not suitable for seedling survival and establishment the current hec ras model does not consider these water level changes in oxbow lakes or ponds and results in the overestimation of cottonwood establishment around these water bodies 3 3 5 relationship between cottonwood coverage change and flow regime vegetation maps and model results discussed previously both indicate that cottonwood area increased by approximately 10 between 1999 and 2007 excluding the impact of restoration practice it is worthwhile to further analyze the reason for the increase by examining the relationship between cottonwood area and flow regime based on rvsm outputs fig 11 presents the simulated change in total area of living cottonwood as well as river stage hydrograph at rm192 5 during the 8 year period the figure shows that the increase of cottonwood area mainly took place in 2000 and 2004 in the rest years cottonwood area did not increase at the end of growing season previous studies rood et al 1998 scott et al 1997 stella 2005 dixon et al 2015 found that cottonwood seedling establishment depended on the floods exceeding certain magnitude occurring in spring prior to seed release the floods created necessary bare and moist establishment sites at an elevation high enough to allow cottonwood survive subsequent floods the model reproduced this finding the large spring floods in 2000 2004 and 2006 enabled massive initial seedlings in contrast the small spring flood in 2001 2002 and 2007 led to particularly limited initial seedling areas the moderate flood in january 2003 occurred too early mid february to may before seed release thus did not trigger a massive seedling event however how many seedlings that can survive the first growing season are determined by the flow regime after germination mahoney and rood 1998 stella et al 2010 dixon et al 2015 the simulated areas of dead cottonwood due to desiccation drowning scour and competition are also shown in fig 11 it reveals that desiccation was the primary cause of cottonwood seedling death the sharp decline in river stage shortly after the start of seed germination season caused a large number of seedlings dead in 2000 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 among the three years with extensive initial seedlings the abrupt river stage decline rate of about 15cm d in late april and early may of 2006 was much greater than the rate of about 6cm d in the same period of 2000 and 2004 this resulted in few seedlings survival in 2006 the continuous river stage recession in the growing season from june to november imposed cumulative desiccation stress on seedlings and led to the gradual shrink of cottonwood area in most years in addition the high flow longer than 15days in germination and growing seasons induced evident inundation death in 2001 2002 2004 and 2007 therefore favorable flow regime in 2000 and 2004 that included large spring floods taking place not long before the start of germination and the gradual river stage recession during germination and growing seasons was predicted to contribute to the cottonwood area increase over the 8 years this finding can help environmental flow prescription for cottonwood restoration 3 4 sensitivity of two key vegetation parameters the height of capillary fringe and plant root growth rate are two critical vegetation input parameters identified from the sacramento river application so their sensitivities on vegetation coverage area were further investigated here the height of capillary fringe not only affects seedling elevation but also the spatial distribution and total area of riparian vegetation the higher capillary fringe means more soil water available for seed germination and seedling establishment to analyze the sensitivity of the height of capillary fringe this parameter was set within the range of 0 05m and 0 61m with the other vegetation parameters intact in the sacramento river vegetation model fig 12 shows model computed vegetation areas of the five major vegetation types after 8 years coverage area of most vegetation types expanded with the increased capillary fringe while only grass area shrank slightly the grass area decreased because the other vegetation types outcompeted grass and occupied a small fraction of space where grass colonized previously the sensitivity of height of capillary fringe on cottonwood population dynamics was also emphasized by harper et al 2011 therefore the value of capillary fringe height should be carefully calibrated in applying the rvsm the root growth rate plays a significant role in determining how many seedlings can survive the drought fig 13 illustrates that the model computed cottonwood area in 2007 increased gradually with root growth rate increasing from 1 to 10mm d in this study cottonwood root growth rate was set to 2mm d based on the experiment conducted from mid july through late october 2002 at the university of california lafayette ca stella 2005 the experiment observed that cottonwood seedling had a growth rate ranging from 1 1 2 2mm d lower than the values reported by mahoney and rood 1998 roberts et al 2002 and meier 2008 nevertheless the predicted cottonwood seedling area and elevation roughly agree with the seedling observation in 2005 and 2006 when root growth rate was set to 2mm d see figs 8 and 9 4 summary and conclusions the polygon based rvsm has been developed and integrated with the hec ras 1 d unsteady flow model to predicting the complex vegetation response to geomorphic conditions and dynamic flow regime the vegetation algorithms simulated in rvsm are highly empirical and use specific parameters to quantify the vegetation life cycle the hec ras rvsm system was applied to the sacramento river reach for evaluating its capability in predicting interactions between flow and riparian vegetation five riparian vegetation types with cottonwood mixed forest riparian shrub invasive species and grass were simulated from 1999 to 2007 flow river stage groundwater level cottonwood seedling density and elevation collected at rm192 5 and rm183 in 2005 and 2006 were used to calibrate the model the model result shows that the hec ras rvsm system reproduced the acreage change of the five major vegetation types over the 8 year period the rvsm was able to predict cottonwood establishment at certain point bars even though the predicted locations may not be exactly accurate the predicted variations of cottonwood coverage in response to dynamic flow regime facilitated the environmental flow prescription for riparian vegetation restoration height of capillary fringe and root growth rate were found to be two critical parameters influencing vegetation distribution the 1 d hydraulic model has the advantage of running fast over a long term simulation and the disadvantage of inability to simulate microscale flow velocity bed erosion and deposition therefore this tool is best used for quantifying impacts of flow management alternatives and ecosystem restoration projects on riparian vegetation instead of using as an absolute predictor to better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of riparian vegetation dense cross sections and fine vegetation polygons are necessary in applying hec ras rvsm the impact of precipitation evaporation infiltration on river stage and groundwater level will be taken into account in the future improvement and development the rvsm will be further developed to simulate plant density and feedback of vegetation cycle on river hydraulics geomorphology and water quality furthermore it will be integrated with hec ras 2 d flow model to simulate spatial and temporal changes of riparian vegetation in great detail acknowledgements the study was conducted as an activity of the u s army corps of engineers ecosystem management and restoration research program the authors thank mark jensen and steve piper for their support for integrating rvsm into hec ras the valuable and constructive comments from two anonymous reviewers are highly appreciated 
25354,the zooplankton components in biogeochemical models drive top down control of primary production and remineralisation and thereby exert a strong impact on model performance who eats whom in oceanic plankton ecosystem models is often largely determined by body size however zooplankton of similar size can have different prey size spectra thus models with solely size structured trophic interactions may not capture the full diversity of feeding interactions and miss important parts of zooplankton behavior we apply an optimality based plankton ecosystem model to analyse trophic interactions in a suite of mesocosm experiments in the peruvian upwelling region sensitivity analyses reveal a dominant role of trophic structure for model performance which cannot be compensated by parameter optimisation the single most important aspect governing model performance is the trophic linking between dinoflagellates and ciliates only with a bidirectional link i e both groups can prey on each other is the model able to reproduce the differential development of the microzooplankton communities in the mesocosms thus we conclude that a solely size based trophic structure may not be appropriate to represent the most important trophic interactions in plankton ecosystems the diversity of feeding interactions needs to be adequately represented to capture community dynamics keywords optimality based plankton model trophic interactions feeding diversity dinoflagellates ciliates predator prey size ratio 1 introduction biogeochemical models usually incorporate plankton communities by means of npzd type formulations to represent major functional groups of plankton ecosystems e g inorganic nutrients phytoplankton micro and mesozooplankton and detritus prowe et al 2012a aumont et al 2015 le quéré et al 2016 while zooplankton and related parameters clearly exert a strong impact on model performance e g fulton et al 2003a pahlow et al 2008 finding and constraining the most appropriate representation of zooplankton dynamics remains a major challenge håkanson 1995 fulton et al 2003b mesocosm experiments can help address this kind of questions as they allow frequent sampling of enclosed ecosystems providing more coherent observations than is possible with field surveys and allowing for more natural conditions than laboratory studies in the present study we examine the trophic roles of microzooplankton communities using data from two shipboard mesocosm experiments conducted in the coastal upwelling region off peru pu1 pu2 hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a b in this region surface waters are characterised by high nutrient concentrations with low n p ratios compared to the redfield n p ratio of 16 redfield 1934 due to denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox in the underlying oxygen minimum zone omz deutsch et al 2007 kalvelage et al 2013 su et al 2015 in order to investigate the influence of low n p ratios on the growth and community composition of plankton the mesocosms have been initialised with various din dip ratios distinctly different zooplankton communities developed in the pu1 and pu2 mesocosm experiments with pu1 dominated by dinoflagellates and pu2 by ciliates possibly related to the different nutritional quality of the phytoplankton communities franz et al 2012b hauss et al 2012 marine dinoflagellates can be autotrophic heterotrophic or mixotrophic stoecker et al 2017 heterotrophic and mixotrophic species feed on a wide range of prey including bacteria phytoplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates using a variety of feeding strategies strom 1991 hansen 1991 jeong et al 2010 hansen et al 2016 several dinophysis species feed on ciliates often larger than themselves hansen 1991 nishitani et al 2008 park et al 2010 dinophysis caudata accounted for up to 42 of the dinoflagellate community biomass in the pu1 and pu2 mesocosm experiments hauss et al 2012 planktonic ciliates are another important component of the microzooplankton community in the ocean they serve as food for larger organisms e g copepods and fish larvae ciliates can consume a wide spectrum of food types and sizes yasindi and taylor 2006 similarly to dinoflagellates ciliates can also prey on bacteria phytoplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates sherr and sherr 1987 dolan and coats 1991 jakobsen et al 1997 jeong et al 2013 tintinnid ciliates are heterotrophic and feed primarily on photosynthetic algae and bacteria stoecker 2012 montagnes 2013 whereas many oligotrich ciliates are mixotrophic dolan 1992 in plankton ecosystem modelling trophic relations among zooplankton compartments are often based on body size hansen et al 1994 which is generally considered a master trait for trophic interactions in plankton banas 2011 andersen et al 2016 however traits shaping feeding interactions are diverse and size relations between predators and prey can also result from foraging types and morphologies wirtz 2012 size ratios between predators and their prey are about 0 4 7 for dinoflagellates and 2 5 30 for ciliates hansen et al 1994 hence dinoflagellates can prey on particles larger than their own size whereas ciliates can only eat smaller prey jakobsen et al 1997 for analysing above mesocosm experiments marki and pahlow 2016 developed an optimality based model which also forms the foundation for our present study optimality based models rest on the assumption that evolution favours organisms with more efficient strategies in the continual competition for resources in our present model phytoplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates are represented by optimality based formulations pahlow and prowe 2010 pahlow et al 2013 these are mechanistically founded on trade offs among energy and resource requirements of plankton organisms and can describe the observed behaviour of a wide range of phyto and zooplankton species in laboratory experiments a major advantage of these models is the low number of parameters required to describe fairly complex behaviour for example only six tuneable parameters need be calibrated for simulating four variables c n p chl with the phytoplankton model of pahlow et al 2013 given the difficulties usually associated with constraining model parameters with limited observations schartau et al 2017 keeping the number of parameters low greatly facilitates not only model calibration but also the disentangling of parameter and structural uncertainties marki and pahlow 2016 use their model to explore how microzooplankton respond to the different food quality of phytoplankton in terms of elemental composition caused by the different nutrient enrichments in the mesocosms variations in phytoplankton c n p composition in response to ambient nutrient din dip stoichiometry in the peruvian upwelling region alone as described by the model of pahlow et al 2013 could not explain the differential development of the mesocosm plankton communities marki and pahlow 2016 highlight the importance of intraguild predation and find that some of the differences among the mesocosms might be explained by variations in the zooplankton stoichiometry pointing towards the importance of zooplankton flexible stoichiometry in marine ecological models marki and pahlow 2016 also examine a more complex model configuration with two separate compartments for dinoflagellates and ciliates with the larger ciliates feeding on the smaller dinoflagellates zooplankton but this size based modification did not improve model performance for the present study we relax two restrictions applied by marki and pahlow 2016 1 instead of using pre defined parameter sets for microzooplankton we identify and optimise sensitive model parameters in order to separate parameter and structural model uncertainty 2 we examine the effect of the size based restriction that ciliates feed on dinoflagellates but not vice versa by introducing a new model configuration with a bidirectional link i e dinoflagellates and ciliates can prey on each other we base our analysis on the configuration with separate microzooplankton compartments for dinoflagellates and ciliates this avoids a solely size based trophic structure and allows for a potentially greater diversity of trophic interactions we then compare the predictive skill of the configurations with and without the bidirectional link in order to assess the importance of microzooplankton trophic interactions for plankton ecosystem modelling 2 methods 2 1 data we use data from two mesocosm experiments pu1 and pu2 table 1 in the upwelling region of the eastern tropical south pacific off peru hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a b the influence of the stoichiometry of inorganic nutrient supply on growth and composition of plankton communities was investigated by monitoring mesocosms initialised with different nitrate and phosphate concentrations and ratios table 1 each of pu1 and pu2 consisted of 12 mesocosms with four replicates of three treatments n p ratios in pu1 and three replicates of four treatments in pu2 light intensity was reduced by 70 using shading nets intending to mimic conditions at a depth of 10 m all mesocosms were restocked with 5 μm filtered ambient surface seawater on days 3 and 5 of the experiments due to the large amounts of water required for sampling trace metal and silicate compounds were added to avoid trace metal and silicate limitation at the start of each experiment and also on day 5 in pu2 only samples were taken daily for measuring dissolved inorganic nutrients din dip and sio 3 2 chlorophyll chl particulate organic nitrogen pon particulate organic phosphorus pop and community composition hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a b to measure dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations samples were filtered through 5 μm cellulose acetate filters and immediately analysed on board according to hansen and koroleff 1999 using a hitachi u 2000 spectrophotometer chl concentration was measured using high pressure liquid chromatography hplc according to the modified method after barlow et al 1997 pon was measured with gas chromatography according to sharp 1974 after filtration treatment pop measurements were conducted with a modified method according to hansen and koroleff 1999 by incubating the defrosted filters in a household pressure cooker plankton community compositions were counted daily on board by counting lugol stained samples using an inverted microscope to obtain plankton concentrations in biomass μg c l 1 the biovolume was calculated after approximation to geometric shapes hillebrand et al 1999 and then converted to biomass with the carbon to volume relationships from menden deuer and lessard 2000 2 2 optimality based npz model our optimality based plankton ecosystem model comprises two inorganic nutrients din and dip one phytoplankton compartment with variable c n p chl composition and two zooplankton compartments dinoflagellates and ciliates representing the microzooplankton community fig 1 see eqs 1 8 in supplementary material the model equations are essentially the same as those in marki and pahlow 2016 and are provided in the supplementary material as in marki and pahlow 2016 both dinoflagellates and ciliates feed on phytoplankton and both are intraguild predators and ciliates also feed on dinoflagellates we set up two model configurations fig 1 1 the nnpdc two nutrients nn phytoplankton p dinoflagellates d ciliates c configuration which corresponds to the nnpzz o model configuration in marki and pahlow 2016 and 2 the nnpdrc configuration which introduces an additional trophic link with dinoflagellates feeding also on ciliates in contrast to marki and pahlow 2016 who used the pre calibrated parameter sets from pahlow and prowe 2010 and pahlow et al 2013 we optimise the parameters of our model configurations to achieve the best model performance compared with the observations as described in section 2 3 so that we can distinguish better between structural and parameter uncertainties the phytoplankton compartment is described by the optimality based chain model ocm of pahlow et al 2013 see eqs 9 16 in supplementary material briefly the ocm is based on the concept that phytoplankton elemental composition results from optimally allocating cellular n and energy among competing requirements for nutrient n p uptake light harvesting and growth carbon fixation so that the net growth rate is maximised requirements for n and p are defined via their physiological roles i e p is essential for membranes and nucleic acids and n is required for structural proteins and enzymes sterner and elser 2002 since p is a major constituent of ribosomes where proteins are synthesised the model defines n and p colimitation as a chain of limitations where p limits n assimilation and n limits all other biochemical processes ågren 2004 i e nutrient acquisition and photosynthesis since the temperatures in the two experiments were very similar the influence of temperature on phytoplankton growth is excluded from our analysis however we reduce the maximum rate parameter v 0 table 2 to account for the relatively low surface temperature in the upwelling region off peru the diurnal light cycle is included according to brock 1981 to represent the light conditions in the mesocosms hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a zooplankton is described by an optimality based model for zooplankton current feeding ocf developed by pahlow and prowe 2010 see eqs 17 24 in supplementary material the ocf optimises energy allocation between foraging activity and digestion according to trade offs among ingestion assimilation efficiency and respiration to maximise net growth rate the ocf assumes homeostasis i e a constant c n p ratio and thus excretes or respires excess c n or p in inorganic forms when ingesting food with different c n p ratios the two zooplankton functional groups dinoflagellates and ciliates are described by two different sets of parameters table 3 temperature dependence is not considered for zooplankton since the temperatures were similar in pu1 and pu2 and we optimise zooplankton parameters 2 3 model calibration and validation in order to reduce the influence of parameter uncertainty on our conclusions regarding the effect of different model structures we calibrate the model with the help of the fmincon function in matlab which optimises parameter values by minimising the model data discrepancies as quantified by a cost function the fmincon function finds the minimum of a constrained nonlinear multivariate function and optimises all parameters simultaneously we apply the interior point algorithm which can handle large sparse as well as small dense problems the algorithm satisfies bounds at all iterations and can recover from nan or inf results byrd et al 2010 the minimum change in variables for finite difference gradients diffminchange and the step size factor for finite differences findiffrelstep are 0 01 our cost function is the root mean squared error rmse normalised by the averages of the observed variables evans 2003 which is defined as the coefficient of variation cv of the rmse we first calculate cvs for individual variables cvk according to eq 1 and then obtain the actual cost function as the global average cv according to eq 2 1 cv k 1 t n j 1 t i 1 n m j k o i j k o j k 2 2 cv 1 v k 1 v cv k where m j k is the model value corresponding to observed data o i j k n is the number of replicates of each nutrient treatment t is the number of sampling days t 7 for both pu1 and pu2 and n 4 for pu1 and n 3 for pu2 v is the number of data types applied in the optimisation which are din dip phytoplankton cphy dinoflagellates cdino ciliates ccil and phytoplankton pon pop and chl c ratios nphy pphy and chl cphy o j k the mean of replicates within each treatment for every day is used as a weight for each data type k to obtain dimensionless cvk from data types with different units evans 2003 we use the cost function cv first to decide which parameters to optimise during the data assimilation according to the sensitivity of cv to varying the parameters assuming that the plankton communities should be adapted to their environment we then minimise cv with respect to the ambient treatments i e n p 3 4 for pu1 and n p 5 for pu2 for our parameter optimisation the same parameter optimisation approach is applied to both the nnpdc and nnpdrc configurations whence we compare the abilities of the two configurations to simulate the dynamics of the mesocosm experiments based on the optimised model results to analyse the predictive capacity of the optimality based ecosystem model for ecosystem dynamics the performance of the calibrated model is then validated with the data for different nutrient treatments from the other mesocosms i e those not used for calibration 2 4 sensitivity experiments since the additional trophic link in the nnpdrc configuration introduces another parameter and hence one degree of freedom the nnpdrc phy configuration is introduced to investigate the influence of the degrees of freedom on the performance of the nnpdrc configuration in nnpdrc phy all phytoplankton parameters are fixed as calibrated for the nnpdc configuration and the zooplankton parameters are optimised as described in section 2 3 marki and pahlow 2016 suggest that microzooplankton respond to changes in food quality via variations in their phosphorus to carbon p c ratio in order to unravel the influence of microzooplankton stoichiometric plasticity on model performance we analyse the sensitivity of our simulations to variations in the n c and p c ratios of microzooplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates the sensitivity experiments are conducted by reducing the microzooplankton p c ratio from 0 013 to 0 0065 keeping the other parameters unchanged in order to elucidate the reasons why the model can not represent the high n p treatments in pu1 20 sensitivity experiments are conducted by excluding the chl c ratio of phytoplankton from the cost function attempting to allow the model to reproduce the remaining data parameters for only phytoplankton dinoflagellates ciliates and both dinoflagellates and ciliates are tuned respectively in the pu1 phy pu1 dino pu1 cil and pu1 zoo experiments 3 results the optimised parameters are mainly constrained within the ranges suggested in pahlow and prowe 2010 and pahlow et al 2013 and the final estimates are shown in table 3 all other parameters are the same as in pahlow and prowe 2010 and pahlow et al 2013 except that v 0 is reduced to 4 d 1 to represent the low temperature in the peruvian upwelling region and higher ζ chl to obtain a better match for phytoplankton concentration table 2 the optimised parameters indicate higher growth rates of phytoplankton and also higher predation of dinoflagellates on phytoplankton in nnpdc than in nnpdrc table 3 this can also be seen in figs 2 and 3 showing that phytoplankton concentrations are lower in nnpdrc which is closer to the observations figs 2b f j and 3b f j n accordingly cvs for phytoplankton in nnpdc are much larger than those in nnpdrc fig 4 the nnpdrc configuration fits the observations better than nnpdc in the ambient treatments figs 2e h and 3i l in pu1 after including dinoflagellates preying on ciliates ciliate concentration decreases due to predation by dinoflagellates matching the observations phytoplankton concentrations decrease in both pu1 3 4 and pu2 5 which also represents the observations better fig 4 the cvs for ciliate concentrations in nnpdc and nnpdrc are 1 53 and 0 20 respectively red bars in fig 4 thus including predation by dinoflagellates on ciliates significantly improves model performance cvs are reduced by 4 2 41 8 58 7 and 16 1 respectively for din dip phytoplankton and dinoflagellate concentrations in nnpdrc compared with nnpdc there is no significant improvement for phytoplankon n p and chl c ratios red bars in fig 4 for the nnpdrc phy configuration all phytoplankton parameters are fixed as calibrated for the nnpdc configuration and we optimise only the zooplankton parameters table 3 the nnpdrc phy configuration still performs much better than nnpdc fig 4 while the cvs for din dip and phytoplankton of the nnpdrc phy configuration are similar to those for nnpdc the cvs for ciliates are very similar for nnpdrc and nnpdrc phy fig 4 we analyse the ability of the optimality based ecosystem model to simulate the mesocosm dynamics by applying the parameters calibrated for the ambient treatments to the mesocosms with different nutrient enrichments overall nnpdrc fits the observations better than nnpdc and the difference is much more pronounced in pu1 than in pu2 figs 2 3 and 4 the improvement in model performance is mostly due to the reduction in phytoplankton concentration in both pu1 and pu2 and the reduction in ciliate concentration in pu1 however the nnpdrc configuration also fails to reproduce the observations in pu1 20 because it produces too high phytoplankton and too low nutrient concentrations fig 2 which also results in high cost function values fig 4 reducing the microzooplankton p c ratio from 0 013 to 0 0065 as in marki and pahlow 2016 improves the model performance only slightly for the high n p treatments pu1 20 in fig a 1 and pu2 16 in fig a 2 where the dinoflagellates and ciliates increase only marginally in pu1 and pu2 respectively thus variations in zooplankton stoichiometry do not appear to explain the discrepancies in the high n p treatments the model can fit these data much better when tuning the parameters for only dinoflagellates or both dinoflagellates and ciliates pu1 dino and pu1 zoo respectively in fig 5 nutrients phytoplankton microzooplankton and phytoplankton n p ratio in the mesocosms are all well represented except that the increase in ciliate concentration at the end of the experiments can not be simulated fig 5g and o however model performance does not improve when only the parameters for phytoplankton and ciliates are optimised pu1 phy and pu1 cil in fig 5 fig 2 shows that the phytoplankton chl c ratio is too high for pu1 20 as long as din is available i e until day 3 according to the behaviour of the ocm in pahlow et al 2013 it appears unlikely that our plankton model could reconcile the high din and dip concentrations with the low phytoplankton chl c ratios observed throughout pu1 20 as expected the chl c ratios of phytoplankton in pu1 dino and pu1 zoo are also higher than in the observations fig 5h p 4 discussion with respect to the present study the most important differences between the plankton communities in the pu1 and pu2 experiments are that dinoflagellates dominated the microzooplankton community in pu1 whereas ciliates dominated in pu2 table 1 the most abundant dinoflagellates in pu1 were the mixotrophic prorocentrum triestinium and the heterotrophic dinophysis caudata ciliates in pu2 included heterotrophic oligotrich ciliates and strombidium sp the largest discrepancy between our model predictions and the observations for the pu1 and pu2 experiments occurs for ciliates in pu1 for the nnpdc configuration as indicated by the cv fig 4 including the predation by dinoflagellates on ciliates in our nnpdrc configuration brings ciliate concentrations significantly closer to the observations in pu1 fig 2 this does not happen in pu2 fig 3 where the cv of ciliates is already much lower than in pu1 for the nnpdc configuration owing to the large contribution of the ciliate cv in pu1 to the overall model data discrepancy the nnpdrc configuration thus performs significantly better than the nnpdc configuration the improved model performance could in principle be due to 1 a more realistic representation of trophic interactions or 2 the slight increase in model complexity in the nnpdrc configuration resulting from the additional flux from ciliates to dinoflagellates which requires an additional model parameter to be optimised a first hint that allowing for dinoflagellates preying on ciliates indeed adds realism to the model is found in the microscopic observations dinophysis caudata which can prey on morphologically larger ciliates hansen 1991 nishitani et al 2008 kim et al 2012 was abundant in pu1 but not in pu2 hauss et al 2012 another indication is obtained from the performance of the nnpdrc phy configuration which uses the same phytoplankton parameters as nnpdc hence the nnpdrc phy configuration has less degrees of freedom than nnpdc yet performs much better fig 4 the performance of din dip and phytoplankton remains similar to nnpdc but is much better for ciliates therefore we conclude that the improved performance of the nnpdrc configuration is indeed due to a more realistic representation of trophic interactions which indicates that the diversity of feeding interactions needs to be adequately represented to capture community dynamics the nnpdrc configuration represents the ecological dynamics better than nnpdc for all mesocosms fig 4 including those with different nutrient supply ratios nevertheless performance is worse for higher n p enrichment ratios especially for n p 20 in pu1 figs 2 3 and 4 a possible explanation for the failure to reproduce the data for n p 20 in pu1 may be the lack of representation of mixotrophs in the model flynn et al 2013 stoecker et al 2017 in fact several mixotrophic dinoflagellate species occurred in both pu1 and pu2 hauss et al 2012 which may not be represented adequately by the separate phytoplankton and zooplankton compartments in our model flynn et al 2013 larsen et al 2015 mixotrophy is increasingly seen as a widespread trophic strategy for protist plankton with implications not only for our understanding of community ecology but also for the biological pump and ocean change flynn et al 2013 mitra et al 2014b however few dynamic ecosystem models to date explicitly include mixotrophs e g flynn and mitra 2009 ward et al 2011 in order to account for the various types of mixotrophic strategies new model structures for pft type models mitra et al 2016 as well as for size based models chakraborty et al 2017 are being put forward marki and pahlow 2016 hypothesised that microzooplankton respond to changes in food quality in terms of n c ratios rather than n p ratios by varying their p c ratios with their more simplified model configuration marki and pahlow 2016 highlight the importance of microzooplankton stoichiometric plasticity in response to changes in elemental composition of their food e g that the p c ratio of microzooplankton could decrease with increasing n p in the food when decreasing the microzooplankton p c ratio in nnpdrc the model reproduces the observations slightly better figs a 1 and a 2 especially in mesocosms with high n p ratios n p 20 in pu1 however this improvement is much smaller than that by optimising all dinoflagellate parameters fig 5 which indicates that effects of microzooplankton stoichiometric plasticity may be easily obscured by uncertainties in other model parameters disregarding the chl cphy ratio we can mostly reproduce the n p 20 treatment of pu1 by optimising only zooplankton parameters fig 5m o however the impossibility to match simultaneously chl cphy and cphy indicates that the model does this for the wrong reasons the model predicts much higher phytoplankton chl c ratios than observed fig 5p hence phytoplankton growth rates are likely too high which is compensated by strong grazing as also reflected in the rather high estimates for i max dino 6 d 1 and ϕ phy dino 0 52 m 3 mmolc 1 here cf table 3 the failure of our model to reproduce the high n p treatment indicates a certain rigidity of the model behaviour probably related to the low number of parameters franks 2009 however we consider this failure an important aspect of the model as it clearly indicates a deficiency either in the model in the form of missing processes or in the experimental setup in the form of unintentional resource limitation phytoplankton growth may have been hampered in mesocosms with n p 20 preventing utilisation of all available din and dip several trace metals including iron have been added in sufficient quantities to prevent limitation by them h hauss pers comm nevertheless the most likely explanation might still be that the large amount of din added in this treatment could have induced limitation by some other trace element which might explain the high left over concentration of din in these mesocosms at this point this argument remains somewhat speculative but it may be an attractive hypothesis for reconciling the n p 20 treatment with the other treatments furthermore this mismatch points to the importance of including trace metal limitation in our model in future work our model study together with the work of marki and pahlow 2016 demonstrates how plankton ecosystem models can be employed to unravel how plankton community dynamics respond to changing environmental or ecological conditions which are difficult to quantify in the mesocosm studies themselves several other mesocosm studies have been analysed in a similar manner thingstad et al 2007 wirtz 2013 larsen et al 2015 larsen et al 2015 used the minimum microbial food web mmfw model of thingstad et al 2007 to interpret plankton dynamics in three mesocosm studies differing in nutrient and mesozooplankton predator manipulations in parallel to our study larsen et al 2015 needed an additional trophic link ciliates eating diatoms to reconcile the mmfw with observations however while this modification of the mmfw was specific for one mesocosm treatment the bidirectional link in our optimality based model improves model performance for all treatments in the pu1 and pu2 experiments fig 4 our bidirectional trophic link between dinoflagellates and ciliates can be viewed as an important element of intraguild predation within the microzooplankton community which has been estimated to account for as much as 79 of microzooplankton production being recycled within the microzooplankton thus dominating over mesozooplankton predation franzé and modigh 2013 very few biogeochemical models explicitly consider intraguild predation within the zooplankton e g ward et al 2014 in particular models describing trophic interactions based solely on body or cell size banas 2011 acevedo trejos et al 2016 may miss these trophic links entirely in addition to mixotrophy and intraguild predation other issues currently hinder a more realistic representation of zooplankton in ecosystem models the computational demand of global biogeochemical models strongly restricts the complexity of their ecosystem components fulton et al 2003b where zooplankton communities are usually represented by just one or very few functional groups mitra et al 2014a more complex representations of plankton communities remain restricted to local models d alelio et al 2016 or coarse resolution models with relatively short time scales follows et al 2007 the zooplankton compartments strongly influence model dynamics e g in terms of stability cropp et al 2017 or coexistence cropp and norbury 2012 prowe et al 2012b vallina et al 2014 but the parameterisation of zooplankton behaviour is fraught with a high degree of uncertainty fulton et al 2003a sailley et al 2013 together with the long standing dichotomy between complexity and explanatory power and the need for upscaling the behaviour of few known species to represent entire communities plankton modelling has reached a critical stage asking for new ways to capture community dynamics our optimality based formulation may help reduce the uncertainty with respect to the representation of zooplankton behaviour as it can reproduce observed feeding behaviour pahlow and prowe 2010 the low number of tuning parameters and the consequent rigidity of our model have facilitated the identification of the missing bidirectional trophic link in the original model thus trade off and optimality based models may constitute a promising avenue to reach a new level of zooplankton

25354,the zooplankton components in biogeochemical models drive top down control of primary production and remineralisation and thereby exert a strong impact on model performance who eats whom in oceanic plankton ecosystem models is often largely determined by body size however zooplankton of similar size can have different prey size spectra thus models with solely size structured trophic interactions may not capture the full diversity of feeding interactions and miss important parts of zooplankton behavior we apply an optimality based plankton ecosystem model to analyse trophic interactions in a suite of mesocosm experiments in the peruvian upwelling region sensitivity analyses reveal a dominant role of trophic structure for model performance which cannot be compensated by parameter optimisation the single most important aspect governing model performance is the trophic linking between dinoflagellates and ciliates only with a bidirectional link i e both groups can prey on each other is the model able to reproduce the differential development of the microzooplankton communities in the mesocosms thus we conclude that a solely size based trophic structure may not be appropriate to represent the most important trophic interactions in plankton ecosystems the diversity of feeding interactions needs to be adequately represented to capture community dynamics keywords optimality based plankton model trophic interactions feeding diversity dinoflagellates ciliates predator prey size ratio 1 introduction biogeochemical models usually incorporate plankton communities by means of npzd type formulations to represent major functional groups of plankton ecosystems e g inorganic nutrients phytoplankton micro and mesozooplankton and detritus prowe et al 2012a aumont et al 2015 le quéré et al 2016 while zooplankton and related parameters clearly exert a strong impact on model performance e g fulton et al 2003a pahlow et al 2008 finding and constraining the most appropriate representation of zooplankton dynamics remains a major challenge håkanson 1995 fulton et al 2003b mesocosm experiments can help address this kind of questions as they allow frequent sampling of enclosed ecosystems providing more coherent observations than is possible with field surveys and allowing for more natural conditions than laboratory studies in the present study we examine the trophic roles of microzooplankton communities using data from two shipboard mesocosm experiments conducted in the coastal upwelling region off peru pu1 pu2 hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a b in this region surface waters are characterised by high nutrient concentrations with low n p ratios compared to the redfield n p ratio of 16 redfield 1934 due to denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox in the underlying oxygen minimum zone omz deutsch et al 2007 kalvelage et al 2013 su et al 2015 in order to investigate the influence of low n p ratios on the growth and community composition of plankton the mesocosms have been initialised with various din dip ratios distinctly different zooplankton communities developed in the pu1 and pu2 mesocosm experiments with pu1 dominated by dinoflagellates and pu2 by ciliates possibly related to the different nutritional quality of the phytoplankton communities franz et al 2012b hauss et al 2012 marine dinoflagellates can be autotrophic heterotrophic or mixotrophic stoecker et al 2017 heterotrophic and mixotrophic species feed on a wide range of prey including bacteria phytoplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates using a variety of feeding strategies strom 1991 hansen 1991 jeong et al 2010 hansen et al 2016 several dinophysis species feed on ciliates often larger than themselves hansen 1991 nishitani et al 2008 park et al 2010 dinophysis caudata accounted for up to 42 of the dinoflagellate community biomass in the pu1 and pu2 mesocosm experiments hauss et al 2012 planktonic ciliates are another important component of the microzooplankton community in the ocean they serve as food for larger organisms e g copepods and fish larvae ciliates can consume a wide spectrum of food types and sizes yasindi and taylor 2006 similarly to dinoflagellates ciliates can also prey on bacteria phytoplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates sherr and sherr 1987 dolan and coats 1991 jakobsen et al 1997 jeong et al 2013 tintinnid ciliates are heterotrophic and feed primarily on photosynthetic algae and bacteria stoecker 2012 montagnes 2013 whereas many oligotrich ciliates are mixotrophic dolan 1992 in plankton ecosystem modelling trophic relations among zooplankton compartments are often based on body size hansen et al 1994 which is generally considered a master trait for trophic interactions in plankton banas 2011 andersen et al 2016 however traits shaping feeding interactions are diverse and size relations between predators and prey can also result from foraging types and morphologies wirtz 2012 size ratios between predators and their prey are about 0 4 7 for dinoflagellates and 2 5 30 for ciliates hansen et al 1994 hence dinoflagellates can prey on particles larger than their own size whereas ciliates can only eat smaller prey jakobsen et al 1997 for analysing above mesocosm experiments marki and pahlow 2016 developed an optimality based model which also forms the foundation for our present study optimality based models rest on the assumption that evolution favours organisms with more efficient strategies in the continual competition for resources in our present model phytoplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates are represented by optimality based formulations pahlow and prowe 2010 pahlow et al 2013 these are mechanistically founded on trade offs among energy and resource requirements of plankton organisms and can describe the observed behaviour of a wide range of phyto and zooplankton species in laboratory experiments a major advantage of these models is the low number of parameters required to describe fairly complex behaviour for example only six tuneable parameters need be calibrated for simulating four variables c n p chl with the phytoplankton model of pahlow et al 2013 given the difficulties usually associated with constraining model parameters with limited observations schartau et al 2017 keeping the number of parameters low greatly facilitates not only model calibration but also the disentangling of parameter and structural uncertainties marki and pahlow 2016 use their model to explore how microzooplankton respond to the different food quality of phytoplankton in terms of elemental composition caused by the different nutrient enrichments in the mesocosms variations in phytoplankton c n p composition in response to ambient nutrient din dip stoichiometry in the peruvian upwelling region alone as described by the model of pahlow et al 2013 could not explain the differential development of the mesocosm plankton communities marki and pahlow 2016 highlight the importance of intraguild predation and find that some of the differences among the mesocosms might be explained by variations in the zooplankton stoichiometry pointing towards the importance of zooplankton flexible stoichiometry in marine ecological models marki and pahlow 2016 also examine a more complex model configuration with two separate compartments for dinoflagellates and ciliates with the larger ciliates feeding on the smaller dinoflagellates zooplankton but this size based modification did not improve model performance for the present study we relax two restrictions applied by marki and pahlow 2016 1 instead of using pre defined parameter sets for microzooplankton we identify and optimise sensitive model parameters in order to separate parameter and structural model uncertainty 2 we examine the effect of the size based restriction that ciliates feed on dinoflagellates but not vice versa by introducing a new model configuration with a bidirectional link i e dinoflagellates and ciliates can prey on each other we base our analysis on the configuration with separate microzooplankton compartments for dinoflagellates and ciliates this avoids a solely size based trophic structure and allows for a potentially greater diversity of trophic interactions we then compare the predictive skill of the configurations with and without the bidirectional link in order to assess the importance of microzooplankton trophic interactions for plankton ecosystem modelling 2 methods 2 1 data we use data from two mesocosm experiments pu1 and pu2 table 1 in the upwelling region of the eastern tropical south pacific off peru hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a b the influence of the stoichiometry of inorganic nutrient supply on growth and composition of plankton communities was investigated by monitoring mesocosms initialised with different nitrate and phosphate concentrations and ratios table 1 each of pu1 and pu2 consisted of 12 mesocosms with four replicates of three treatments n p ratios in pu1 and three replicates of four treatments in pu2 light intensity was reduced by 70 using shading nets intending to mimic conditions at a depth of 10 m all mesocosms were restocked with 5 μm filtered ambient surface seawater on days 3 and 5 of the experiments due to the large amounts of water required for sampling trace metal and silicate compounds were added to avoid trace metal and silicate limitation at the start of each experiment and also on day 5 in pu2 only samples were taken daily for measuring dissolved inorganic nutrients din dip and sio 3 2 chlorophyll chl particulate organic nitrogen pon particulate organic phosphorus pop and community composition hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a b to measure dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations samples were filtered through 5 μm cellulose acetate filters and immediately analysed on board according to hansen and koroleff 1999 using a hitachi u 2000 spectrophotometer chl concentration was measured using high pressure liquid chromatography hplc according to the modified method after barlow et al 1997 pon was measured with gas chromatography according to sharp 1974 after filtration treatment pop measurements were conducted with a modified method according to hansen and koroleff 1999 by incubating the defrosted filters in a household pressure cooker plankton community compositions were counted daily on board by counting lugol stained samples using an inverted microscope to obtain plankton concentrations in biomass μg c l 1 the biovolume was calculated after approximation to geometric shapes hillebrand et al 1999 and then converted to biomass with the carbon to volume relationships from menden deuer and lessard 2000 2 2 optimality based npz model our optimality based plankton ecosystem model comprises two inorganic nutrients din and dip one phytoplankton compartment with variable c n p chl composition and two zooplankton compartments dinoflagellates and ciliates representing the microzooplankton community fig 1 see eqs 1 8 in supplementary material the model equations are essentially the same as those in marki and pahlow 2016 and are provided in the supplementary material as in marki and pahlow 2016 both dinoflagellates and ciliates feed on phytoplankton and both are intraguild predators and ciliates also feed on dinoflagellates we set up two model configurations fig 1 1 the nnpdc two nutrients nn phytoplankton p dinoflagellates d ciliates c configuration which corresponds to the nnpzz o model configuration in marki and pahlow 2016 and 2 the nnpdrc configuration which introduces an additional trophic link with dinoflagellates feeding also on ciliates in contrast to marki and pahlow 2016 who used the pre calibrated parameter sets from pahlow and prowe 2010 and pahlow et al 2013 we optimise the parameters of our model configurations to achieve the best model performance compared with the observations as described in section 2 3 so that we can distinguish better between structural and parameter uncertainties the phytoplankton compartment is described by the optimality based chain model ocm of pahlow et al 2013 see eqs 9 16 in supplementary material briefly the ocm is based on the concept that phytoplankton elemental composition results from optimally allocating cellular n and energy among competing requirements for nutrient n p uptake light harvesting and growth carbon fixation so that the net growth rate is maximised requirements for n and p are defined via their physiological roles i e p is essential for membranes and nucleic acids and n is required for structural proteins and enzymes sterner and elser 2002 since p is a major constituent of ribosomes where proteins are synthesised the model defines n and p colimitation as a chain of limitations where p limits n assimilation and n limits all other biochemical processes ågren 2004 i e nutrient acquisition and photosynthesis since the temperatures in the two experiments were very similar the influence of temperature on phytoplankton growth is excluded from our analysis however we reduce the maximum rate parameter v 0 table 2 to account for the relatively low surface temperature in the upwelling region off peru the diurnal light cycle is included according to brock 1981 to represent the light conditions in the mesocosms hauss et al 2012 franz et al 2012a zooplankton is described by an optimality based model for zooplankton current feeding ocf developed by pahlow and prowe 2010 see eqs 17 24 in supplementary material the ocf optimises energy allocation between foraging activity and digestion according to trade offs among ingestion assimilation efficiency and respiration to maximise net growth rate the ocf assumes homeostasis i e a constant c n p ratio and thus excretes or respires excess c n or p in inorganic forms when ingesting food with different c n p ratios the two zooplankton functional groups dinoflagellates and ciliates are described by two different sets of parameters table 3 temperature dependence is not considered for zooplankton since the temperatures were similar in pu1 and pu2 and we optimise zooplankton parameters 2 3 model calibration and validation in order to reduce the influence of parameter uncertainty on our conclusions regarding the effect of different model structures we calibrate the model with the help of the fmincon function in matlab which optimises parameter values by minimising the model data discrepancies as quantified by a cost function the fmincon function finds the minimum of a constrained nonlinear multivariate function and optimises all parameters simultaneously we apply the interior point algorithm which can handle large sparse as well as small dense problems the algorithm satisfies bounds at all iterations and can recover from nan or inf results byrd et al 2010 the minimum change in variables for finite difference gradients diffminchange and the step size factor for finite differences findiffrelstep are 0 01 our cost function is the root mean squared error rmse normalised by the averages of the observed variables evans 2003 which is defined as the coefficient of variation cv of the rmse we first calculate cvs for individual variables cvk according to eq 1 and then obtain the actual cost function as the global average cv according to eq 2 1 cv k 1 t n j 1 t i 1 n m j k o i j k o j k 2 2 cv 1 v k 1 v cv k where m j k is the model value corresponding to observed data o i j k n is the number of replicates of each nutrient treatment t is the number of sampling days t 7 for both pu1 and pu2 and n 4 for pu1 and n 3 for pu2 v is the number of data types applied in the optimisation which are din dip phytoplankton cphy dinoflagellates cdino ciliates ccil and phytoplankton pon pop and chl c ratios nphy pphy and chl cphy o j k the mean of replicates within each treatment for every day is used as a weight for each data type k to obtain dimensionless cvk from data types with different units evans 2003 we use the cost function cv first to decide which parameters to optimise during the data assimilation according to the sensitivity of cv to varying the parameters assuming that the plankton communities should be adapted to their environment we then minimise cv with respect to the ambient treatments i e n p 3 4 for pu1 and n p 5 for pu2 for our parameter optimisation the same parameter optimisation approach is applied to both the nnpdc and nnpdrc configurations whence we compare the abilities of the two configurations to simulate the dynamics of the mesocosm experiments based on the optimised model results to analyse the predictive capacity of the optimality based ecosystem model for ecosystem dynamics the performance of the calibrated model is then validated with the data for different nutrient treatments from the other mesocosms i e those not used for calibration 2 4 sensitivity experiments since the additional trophic link in the nnpdrc configuration introduces another parameter and hence one degree of freedom the nnpdrc phy configuration is introduced to investigate the influence of the degrees of freedom on the performance of the nnpdrc configuration in nnpdrc phy all phytoplankton parameters are fixed as calibrated for the nnpdc configuration and the zooplankton parameters are optimised as described in section 2 3 marki and pahlow 2016 suggest that microzooplankton respond to changes in food quality via variations in their phosphorus to carbon p c ratio in order to unravel the influence of microzooplankton stoichiometric plasticity on model performance we analyse the sensitivity of our simulations to variations in the n c and p c ratios of microzooplankton dinoflagellates and ciliates the sensitivity experiments are conducted by reducing the microzooplankton p c ratio from 0 013 to 0 0065 keeping the other parameters unchanged in order to elucidate the reasons why the model can not represent the high n p treatments in pu1 20 sensitivity experiments are conducted by excluding the chl c ratio of phytoplankton from the cost function attempting to allow the model to reproduce the remaining data parameters for only phytoplankton dinoflagellates ciliates and both dinoflagellates and ciliates are tuned respectively in the pu1 phy pu1 dino pu1 cil and pu1 zoo experiments 3 results the optimised parameters are mainly constrained within the ranges suggested in pahlow and prowe 2010 and pahlow et al 2013 and the final estimates are shown in table 3 all other parameters are the same as in pahlow and prowe 2010 and pahlow et al 2013 except that v 0 is reduced to 4 d 1 to represent the low temperature in the peruvian upwelling region and higher ζ chl to obtain a better match for phytoplankton concentration table 2 the optimised parameters indicate higher growth rates of phytoplankton and also higher predation of dinoflagellates on phytoplankton in nnpdc than in nnpdrc table 3 this can also be seen in figs 2 and 3 showing that phytoplankton concentrations are lower in nnpdrc which is closer to the observations figs 2b f j and 3b f j n accordingly cvs for phytoplankton in nnpdc are much larger than those in nnpdrc fig 4 the nnpdrc configuration fits the observations better than nnpdc in the ambient treatments figs 2e h and 3i l in pu1 after including dinoflagellates preying on ciliates ciliate concentration decreases due to predation by dinoflagellates matching the observations phytoplankton concentrations decrease in both pu1 3 4 and pu2 5 which also represents the observations better fig 4 the cvs for ciliate concentrations in nnpdc and nnpdrc are 1 53 and 0 20 respectively red bars in fig 4 thus including predation by dinoflagellates on ciliates significantly improves model performance cvs are reduced by 4 2 41 8 58 7 and 16 1 respectively for din dip phytoplankton and dinoflagellate concentrations in nnpdrc compared with nnpdc there is no significant improvement for phytoplankon n p and chl c ratios red bars in fig 4 for the nnpdrc phy configuration all phytoplankton parameters are fixed as calibrated for the nnpdc configuration and we optimise only the zooplankton parameters table 3 the nnpdrc phy configuration still performs much better than nnpdc fig 4 while the cvs for din dip and phytoplankton of the nnpdrc phy configuration are similar to those for nnpdc the cvs for ciliates are very similar for nnpdrc and nnpdrc phy fig 4 we analyse the ability of the optimality based ecosystem model to simulate the mesocosm dynamics by applying the parameters calibrated for the ambient treatments to the mesocosms with different nutrient enrichments overall nnpdrc fits the observations better than nnpdc and the difference is much more pronounced in pu1 than in pu2 figs 2 3 and 4 the improvement in model performance is mostly due to the reduction in phytoplankton concentration in both pu1 and pu2 and the reduction in ciliate concentration in pu1 however the nnpdrc configuration also fails to reproduce the observations in pu1 20 because it produces too high phytoplankton and too low nutrient concentrations fig 2 which also results in high cost function values fig 4 reducing the microzooplankton p c ratio from 0 013 to 0 0065 as in marki and pahlow 2016 improves the model performance only slightly for the high n p treatments pu1 20 in fig a 1 and pu2 16 in fig a 2 where the dinoflagellates and ciliates increase only marginally in pu1 and pu2 respectively thus variations in zooplankton stoichiometry do not appear to explain the discrepancies in the high n p treatments the model can fit these data much better when tuning the parameters for only dinoflagellates or both dinoflagellates and ciliates pu1 dino and pu1 zoo respectively in fig 5 nutrients phytoplankton microzooplankton and phytoplankton n p ratio in the mesocosms are all well represented except that the increase in ciliate concentration at the end of the experiments can not be simulated fig 5g and o however model performance does not improve when only the parameters for phytoplankton and ciliates are optimised pu1 phy and pu1 cil in fig 5 fig 2 shows that the phytoplankton chl c ratio is too high for pu1 20 as long as din is available i e until day 3 according to the behaviour of the ocm in pahlow et al 2013 it appears unlikely that our plankton model could reconcile the high din and dip concentrations with the low phytoplankton chl c ratios observed throughout pu1 20 as expected the chl c ratios of phytoplankton in pu1 dino and pu1 zoo are also higher than in the observations fig 5h p 4 discussion with respect to the present study the most important differences between the plankton communities in the pu1 and pu2 experiments are that dinoflagellates dominated the microzooplankton community in pu1 whereas ciliates dominated in pu2 table 1 the most abundant dinoflagellates in pu1 were the mixotrophic prorocentrum triestinium and the heterotrophic dinophysis caudata ciliates in pu2 included heterotrophic oligotrich ciliates and strombidium sp the largest discrepancy between our model predictions and the observations for the pu1 and pu2 experiments occurs for ciliates in pu1 for the nnpdc configuration as indicated by the cv fig 4 including the predation by dinoflagellates on ciliates in our nnpdrc configuration brings ciliate concentrations significantly closer to the observations in pu1 fig 2 this does not happen in pu2 fig 3 where the cv of ciliates is already much lower than in pu1 for the nnpdc configuration owing to the large contribution of the ciliate cv in pu1 to the overall model data discrepancy the nnpdrc configuration thus performs significantly better than the nnpdc configuration the improved model performance could in principle be due to 1 a more realistic representation of trophic interactions or 2 the slight increase in model complexity in the nnpdrc configuration resulting from the additional flux from ciliates to dinoflagellates which requires an additional model parameter to be optimised a first hint that allowing for dinoflagellates preying on ciliates indeed adds realism to the model is found in the microscopic observations dinophysis caudata which can prey on morphologically larger ciliates hansen 1991 nishitani et al 2008 kim et al 2012 was abundant in pu1 but not in pu2 hauss et al 2012 another indication is obtained from the performance of the nnpdrc phy configuration which uses the same phytoplankton parameters as nnpdc hence the nnpdrc phy configuration has less degrees of freedom than nnpdc yet performs much better fig 4 the performance of din dip and phytoplankton remains similar to nnpdc but is much better for ciliates therefore we conclude that the improved performance of the nnpdrc configuration is indeed due to a more realistic representation of trophic interactions which indicates that the diversity of feeding interactions needs to be adequately represented to capture community dynamics the nnpdrc configuration represents the ecological dynamics better than nnpdc for all mesocosms fig 4 including those with different nutrient supply ratios nevertheless performance is worse for higher n p enrichment ratios especially for n p 20 in pu1 figs 2 3 and 4 a possible explanation for the failure to reproduce the data for n p 20 in pu1 may be the lack of representation of mixotrophs in the model flynn et al 2013 stoecker et al 2017 in fact several mixotrophic dinoflagellate species occurred in both pu1 and pu2 hauss et al 2012 which may not be represented adequately by the separate phytoplankton and zooplankton compartments in our model flynn et al 2013 larsen et al 2015 mixotrophy is increasingly seen as a widespread trophic strategy for protist plankton with implications not only for our understanding of community ecology but also for the biological pump and ocean change flynn et al 2013 mitra et al 2014b however few dynamic ecosystem models to date explicitly include mixotrophs e g flynn and mitra 2009 ward et al 2011 in order to account for the various types of mixotrophic strategies new model structures for pft type models mitra et al 2016 as well as for size based models chakraborty et al 2017 are being put forward marki and pahlow 2016 hypothesised that microzooplankton respond to changes in food quality in terms of n c ratios rather than n p ratios by varying their p c ratios with their more simplified model configuration marki and pahlow 2016 highlight the importance of microzooplankton stoichiometric plasticity in response to changes in elemental composition of their food e g that the p c ratio of microzooplankton could decrease with increasing n p in the food when decreasing the microzooplankton p c ratio in nnpdrc the model reproduces the observations slightly better figs a 1 and a 2 especially in mesocosms with high n p ratios n p 20 in pu1 however this improvement is much smaller than that by optimising all dinoflagellate parameters fig 5 which indicates that effects of microzooplankton stoichiometric plasticity may be easily obscured by uncertainties in other model parameters disregarding the chl cphy ratio we can mostly reproduce the n p 20 treatment of pu1 by optimising only zooplankton parameters fig 5m o however the impossibility to match simultaneously chl cphy and cphy indicates that the model does this for the wrong reasons the model predicts much higher phytoplankton chl c ratios than observed fig 5p hence phytoplankton growth rates are likely too high which is compensated by strong grazing as also reflected in the rather high estimates for i max dino 6 d 1 and ϕ phy dino 0 52 m 3 mmolc 1 here cf table 3 the failure of our model to reproduce the high n p treatment indicates a certain rigidity of the model behaviour probably related to the low number of parameters franks 2009 however we consider this failure an important aspect of the model as it clearly indicates a deficiency either in the model in the form of missing processes or in the experimental setup in the form of unintentional resource limitation phytoplankton growth may have been hampered in mesocosms with n p 20 preventing utilisation of all available din and dip several trace metals including iron have been added in sufficient quantities to prevent limitation by them h hauss pers comm nevertheless the most likely explanation might still be that the large amount of din added in this treatment could have induced limitation by some other trace element which might explain the high left over concentration of din in these mesocosms at this point this argument remains somewhat speculative but it may be an attractive hypothesis for reconciling the n p 20 treatment with the other treatments furthermore this mismatch points to the importance of including trace metal limitation in our model in future work our model study together with the work of marki and pahlow 2016 demonstrates how plankton ecosystem models can be employed to unravel how plankton community dynamics respond to changing environmental or ecological conditions which are difficult to quantify in the mesocosm studies themselves several other mesocosm studies have been analysed in a similar manner thingstad et al 2007 wirtz 2013 larsen et al 2015 larsen et al 2015 used the minimum microbial food web mmfw model of thingstad et al 2007 to interpret plankton dynamics in three mesocosm studies differing in nutrient and mesozooplankton predator manipulations in parallel to our study larsen et al 2015 needed an additional trophic link ciliates eating diatoms to reconcile the mmfw with observations however while this modification of the mmfw was specific for one mesocosm treatment the bidirectional link in our optimality based model improves model performance for all treatments in the pu1 and pu2 experiments fig 4 our bidirectional trophic link between dinoflagellates and ciliates can be viewed as an important element of intraguild predation within the microzooplankton community which has been estimated to account for as much as 79 of microzooplankton production being recycled within the microzooplankton thus dominating over mesozooplankton predation franzé and modigh 2013 very few biogeochemical models explicitly consider intraguild predation within the zooplankton e g ward et al 2014 in particular models describing trophic interactions based solely on body or cell size banas 2011 acevedo trejos et al 2016 may miss these trophic links entirely in addition to mixotrophy and intraguild predation other issues currently hinder a more realistic representation of zooplankton in ecosystem models the computational demand of global biogeochemical models strongly restricts the complexity of their ecosystem components fulton et al 2003b where zooplankton communities are usually represented by just one or very few functional groups mitra et al 2014a more complex representations of plankton communities remain restricted to local models d alelio et al 2016 or coarse resolution models with relatively short time scales follows et al 2007 the zooplankton compartments strongly influence model dynamics e g in terms of stability cropp et al 2017 or coexistence cropp and norbury 2012 prowe et al 2012b vallina et al 2014 but the parameterisation of zooplankton behaviour is fraught with a high degree of uncertainty fulton et al 2003a sailley et al 2013 together with the long standing dichotomy between complexity and explanatory power and the need for upscaling the behaviour of few known species to represent entire communities plankton modelling has reached a critical stage asking for new ways to capture community dynamics our optimality based formulation may help reduce the uncertainty with respect to the representation of zooplankton behaviour as it can reproduce observed feeding behaviour pahlow and prowe 2010 the low number of tuning parameters and the consequent rigidity of our model have facilitated the identification of the missing bidirectional trophic link in the original model thus trade off and optimality based models may constitute a promising avenue to reach a new level of zooplankton
