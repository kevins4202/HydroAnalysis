21920,the assessment of mesh resistance to opening is a key factor when coming to fishing gear design to study or optimize the fishing selectivity process different authors proposed methodologies to achieve twine flexural rigidity identification and mesh opening angle at rest their experimental protocols could rely on complex installations and instrumentation and identification needs dedicated models or software with possible important set up time sometimes different flexural rigidity and rest angle values for a given netting type were proposed depending on identification or experimental conditions leading to difficulties to choose a value for implementation in netting structures simulation software the new methodology proposed in this article is based on a simplified experimental protocol taking plasticity into account and an identification method derived from an end user dedicated software to determine mechanical and dimensional characteristics of common netting materials identified flexural rigidity and rest angle values fall inside the interval provided by authors using similar methods identified parameters have been used to predict the geometry of two t90 netting cylinders with errors lower than 3 keywords fishing net mechanics twine flexural rigidity numerical simulation selectivity fishing 1 introduction the reform of the european common fisheries policy cfp of 2013 has increased the pressure on fishers compelling them to reduce the catch of untargeted species a technical way to avoid fishing untargeted species is to improve the selection capability of the fishing gear for fishing gear like trawls made of nettings mechanical properties of braided twines have a strong influence on net meshes opening herrmann et al 2013 and consequently on the selectivity properties especially in the terminal part of the fishing gear the codend is pulled into a bulb shape as it is loaded by fish which provides more open meshes in the front part of the bulb which enables the fish to escape robertson and stewart 1988 the mesh opening mechanism is complex and involves the twine bending stiffness a direct measurement of bending stiffness is not possible and needs an inverse identification process where a set of mesh characteristics including bending stiffness is adjusted till the model best reproduces a series of experiments experimental protocols and numerical modeling are involved in this process several experimental protocols have been tested by different authors to assess the value of the bending stiffness of twine composing fishing nets sala et al 2007 developed a complex and expensive experimental system to measure the forces needed to uniformly deform a sample of netting bending stiffness could be deduced using the beam theory priour and cognard 2011 proposed to measure the deformation of a vertical netting sample under different loads and the flexion of a netting sample as a cantilever under its own weight de la prada and gonzález 2016 proposed a way to establish a relation between the height of a netting sample and the force applied in its lower part in a vertically suspended and uniaxial configuration using a tensile test bench morvan et al 2016 used a similar configuration where each lower node of the netting sample had its own weight to simulate a force with no need of a tensile test bench the sample heights were measured for the different loads but the sample width was not considered to identify the bending stiffness de la prada and gonzález 2016 state that axial rigidity ea for common netting twines ranges between 500n and 3000n and that its effect on netting deformation is negligible compared to flexural deformations except for deformations that hardly happen in real marine applications in parallel the theory used by o neill 2002 does not involve axial elasticity and value of axial rigidity are not provided by morvan et al 2016 mechanical and geometrical properties of netting samples can be identified by the optimization of a set of parameters used in a physical oriented approach model priour 2001 priour and cognard 2011 modelled the flexural rigidity with a torque located at the physical knot supposing that the twines remain straight de la prada and gonzález 2016 used two different approaches 1 asymptotic development of a model of the twine as a bi dimensional double clamped beam developed by o neill this model was based on the beam bending equations under several hypothesis i the bending moment is proportional to the twine curvature and ii no axial elasticity 2 a finite element model allows the assessment of the force displacement response then fitting techniques have been used to set bi dimensional dimensionless models that compare accurately spline model and reasonably accurately polynomial model 5 10 of deviation with the exact solution previously given by o neil these models express the reaction force as an explicit function of the twine deformation and can be used to solve large deformations of the net these models assume uniform deformations and are not applicable to 3 dimensional problems a finite element model in abaqus for a small number of meshes have been developed by morvan et al mesh sides are assumed to behave like timoshenko beams taking into account the mesh resistance to the net s opening allowing the simulation of non uniform deformation again the optimization does not consider the relation between the sample width and the load the length of the physical knots is not considered these models are specifically designed to identify netting mechanical properties thus the identification of netting mechanical parameters by the final user of the netting modelling software can be difficult in this context this work proposes to apply identification results to larger structures simulation by comparing the numerical and experimental results nettings used in fishing gear can be loaded with high forces able to generate permanent plastic deformations in twines and knots de la prada 2014 plasticity has been taken into consideration in de la prada and gonzalez 2015 in a single load unload cycle for each load the operator waited until the sample length becomes stable moreover the maximum force leading to stretch the sample to 80 of its maximum stretched length was applied during 1 h after the last load increment and before the first unload increment the relations between sample height and forces for the load and the unload phases were then analyzed separately plasticity was not taken into consideration by morvan et al 2016 in the present work we attempt to establish a practical methodology to estimate the mechanical and geometrical properties of netting materials the proposed method is original as it is based on the use of artificially intelligent algorithms applied to the algorithm used in netting structure simulation in marine environment this netting structure simulation algorithm is implemented in a widely used commercial software dynamit specialized in trawl simulation presented by nguyen et al 2015 nguyen and winger 2016 and thus does not rely on any other theory nor software moreover it is proposed to overcome some of the drawbacks of previous methods 1 the present method considers eventual flexural forces and deformations normal to the two normalized netting directions n and t fig 1 2 the simple experimental protocol proposed by de la prada and gonzalez 2015 was slightly simplified to enable the end users to identify by themselves the properties of nettings without the need of laboratory facilities 3 the plasticity is taken into account in a more realistic way 4 identified parameters for some common nettings are applied to larger netting structures simulation and compared to experimental results finally an original metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on artificial intelligence is used to identify the constitutive parameters of the fishing net model 2 fishing net mechanical modelling 2 1 modelling of meshes in the present work netting is modelled by using the work of bessonneau and marichal 1998 and le bris and marichal 1999 where an axial elasticity model has been added for the present work net meshes are considered as twines and nodes each twine or mesh side can be split into two or more rigid bars to model its suppleness thus a mesh is broken down in a set of mass nodes linked by rigid bars supporting a tension additional forces are added to model gravity forces or any external force fig 1 2 2 dynamical equilibrium of netting elements let s consider a system constituted by n nodes and m rigid bars the mass of a bar is concentrated at each end nodes forces applied on bars weights and internal forces for instance are located at end nodes bessonneau and marichal proposed a method to solve the dynamic equilibrium of this system using the second law of newton applied to each node in a galilean frame if we consider the bar j linked to the node i then half the mass of the bar j and half the external forces applied on bar j are assumed to be applied directly on node i thus n equations can be written as follows 1 m i γ i n e i g b o u r b a r s j t i j h i j i 1 n where m i is the pseudo mass of node i taking into account half masses of bars j γ i is its acceleration t i j is the tension applied by neighbor bars j on node i and h i j is half an external force applied to bar j the so called length condition is imposed by solving the following equation where ℓ k l is the length of the bar limited by nodes k and l 2 ℓ k l 2 x k x l 2 where x k is the position of node k in a galilean frame using a simple semi implicit first order euler scheme for velocity to express the velocity of node k at time n 1 using the know time step h it follows 3 h v k n 1 x k n 1 x k n we get an explicit expression for velocity from eq 2 4 v k n 1 v l n 1 x k n x l n 1 2 h ℓ k l 0 2 1 2 h x k n x l n 2 using again an euler scheme for acceleration in eq 1 and substituting velocities in eq 4 we get a linear equation for each structure bar where bar tensions are the unknown variables to be solved 5 x k n x l n 2 h 2 v k n v l n 2 2 h x k n x l n v k n v l n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m k p n b k t j p n 1 x p n x k n ℓ j n h k p n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m l p n b l t l p n 1 x p n x l n ℓ i n h l p n ℓ k l 2 where nb k is the set of neighbor bars of the node k ℓ k p is the length of bar b k p the matrix equation for t is symmetrical and is efficiently solved with gauss method for law rank matrix lower than 1000 unknown variables and by considering conjugate gradient methods for higher ranks bessonneau and marichal and later lebris have used the following algorithm to solve this system of stiff equations in the time domain from initial positions and velocities verifying the length conditions external forces are calculated tensions are solved from the linear equation 5 acceleration velocities and positions are calculated at the time step n 1 this iteration is repeated until a convergence criterion is reached this algorithm has been used in this work to solve internal forces and positions of the netting twine and nodes 2 3 external forces the application considered in this study only requires weight forces due to the material specific weight and punctual weights applied in some structure nodes damping force due to hydrodynamic load is not considered 2 3 1 wt twine weight forming mesh bars and netting knots is applied to calculation nodes weights attached to the lower part of the netting model are applied to the lower nodes of the model 2 4 internal forces 2 4 1 axial elasticity in order to have a more realistic modeling and to increase the diagonal dominance of the matrix equation a linear axial elasticity term has been added in equation 2 6 ℓ k l ℓ 0 k l 1 k k l t k l where k k l is the inverse of the bar axial stiffness and the length of bar free of load ℓ 0 k l these length conditions are linearized assuming kt 1 which means that relative axial elongation of a mesh side is low which is verified in most cases of practical use of fishing nets application length condition at time n 1 becomes 2b ℓ k l n 1 2 ℓ 0 k l 2 1 2 k k l t k l n 1 x k n 1 x l n 1 2 we get a new explicit expression for velocity from eq 6 8 v k n 1 v l n 1 x k n x l n 1 2 h 1 2 k k l t k l n 1 ℓ k l 0 2 1 2 h x k n x l n 2 this leads to a new set of matrix equations 9 x k n x l n 2 h 2 v k n v l n 2 2 h x k n x l n v k n v l n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m k p n b k t j p n 1 x p n x k n ℓ j n h k p n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m l p n b l t l p n 1 x p n x l n ℓ i n h l p n 1 2 k k l t k l n 1 ℓ k l 2 where the dominance of the diagonal is increased with elasticity terms making it easier to solve coefficient k can be elongation dependent depending on the material constituting the netting other authors chose to neglect the axial rigidity or concluded that this parameter has negligible effects for standard marine applications to feed the proposed model with this parameter the knot deformation when loading a mesh side is then taken into account the assumption is made that the knot behavior is not depending on the twine wanchana et al 2002 has established a linear load elongation curve resulting from breaking strength tests by considering the english knot for pe twines the relative knot strength is 65 of the tensile breaking strength and the elongation at breaking is 22 8 a first approximation of the k coefficient in equation 2b is thus k 0 228 0 65 b s where bs is the tensile breaking strength in newton the breaking load of the 3 mm twine used in this work is 120 kgw which leads to 1 k 3356 n the breaking load of 4 mm pe twine is 180 kgw which leads to 1 k 5034 n 2 4 2 flexural forces the connected structure made of bars as described above is not a representative model of an actual net as it does not take into account the twines flexural resistance according to elementary beam theory the relationship between the applied bending moment m and the resulting curvature of the center line of the beam is given by e i ρ m where ρ is the radius of curvature e is the elastic modulus i is the inertia of the beam s section the expression of the bending moment is valid under the assumption of a symmetrical beam and if its transverse sections remain normal to the bended centerline thus the bending moment is assumed to be proportional to the curvature of the twine at each location of the twine the bending stiffness is ei also known as the flexural rigidity for present work and like authors cited in this work the same assumptions are made leading to good results flexural rigidity of twines is taken into account to model its resistance to bending in these two situations 1 to model the suppleness of the twine and 2 when the twine is embedded into a netting node 2 4 2 1 curvature radius to model the suppleness of a twine in fig 2 the green line is supposed to be a bended netting twine the bar b k i defined by its two ends nodes n k n i and the bar b i j defined by n i n j are two adjacent bars discretizing the bended twine element the rotation angle of the discrete bar n i n j from its non bended position is α i the radius of curvature ρ is assumed to be the radius of the osculating circle to the local twine shape the circle is the circumcircle to the triangle ni nj nk thus its center is located at the intersection of the bisectors to ni nj and nj nk consequently α i is also the angle between the bisectors thus it follows sin α i k ℓ i k 2 ρ and sin α i j ℓ i j 2 ρ by using α i α i k α i j and the common relation sin α 1 sin α 2 2 sin α 1 α 2 2 cos α 1 α 2 2 it comes ρ ℓ i j ℓ i k 4 sin α i 2 and m i e i 4 sin α i 2 ℓ i j ℓ i k a general expression using triangle points co ordinates to calculate the radius of the circumcircle of a triangle could also be used 2 4 2 2 curvature radius to model a twine embedded in a netting knot the observation of a piece of netting shows that knots cannot be considered as punctual objects fig 3 they have an extension in the netting normal direction consequently it is proposed to model netting knots with a bar as shown in fig 5 observation also show that twines are not embedded in knots with a null angle between two adjacent twines in order to define the angle of twine free of load we define a local referential linked to the knot fig 4 the local orthonormal referential is defined by vectors n and t n is aligned with the so called normal direction of the netting which defines the orientation of netting nodes n is simply defined by the bar b i j and is normalized vector t is first approximately defined with t n o r m a l i s e d b 2 b 3 b 1 b 4 where b i is the vector oriented from the central node to the other end of bar b i and the normalization function is defined by n o r m a l i s e d u u u all b i have the same length in this application vector t is a unit vector close to t but that does not ensure orthogonality with n using n t λ n defining a unit vector normal to the average mesh plan t n λ n can be calculated which is normal to n thus n t defines a local orthonormal system to the node and is used to define the rest position of bars linked to this node vectors r i denote the rest orientation of bar i assuming the rest angle α r is known and a knot and its 4 bars are symmetrical at rest r i is simply calculated as follows r 1 sin α r t cos α r n r 2 sin α r t cos α r n r 3 r 1 r 4 r 2 the shape of the bended twine embedded in knot b i j is supposed to be approached by the circle tangent to r k at the node n i and passing through the node n k fig 5 we obtain the following expression of the radius of curvature ρ ℓ i k 2 sin α i and m i e i 2 sin α i ℓ i k we assume that angles and moments are positive when turning counterclockwise on fig 2 figs 4 and 6 then m i j 0 is the moment applied on b k i by b i j and m i j 0 is the moment applied on b i j by b k i 2 4 3 tridimensional implementation explanations given from figs 3 6 are valid for a 2d sketch when considering 3d models bending moments are applied on each bar by the mean of forces normal to the plan defined by the 2 bars fig 6 for instance the bending moment m applied by bar b k i on bar b i j is m f i j ℓ i j where ℓ i j is the length of bar b i j force f i j m ℓ i j is applied on node n j and f i j is applied on node n i to keep the resultant of forces applied on the bar b i j constant forces applied on b i j and on b k i have then to be calculated these forces are coplanar to b k i b i j as no torsion moment is assumed we need to calculate a unit vector having the same direction and orientation of the force let s call u i j the unit vector normal to b i j coplanar to b k i b i j being oriented so that n k n i u i j 0 and u k i is the unit vector normal to b k i coplanar to b k i b i j being oriented so that n j n i u k i 0 the unit vector normal to b k i b i j is defined as follows m i j k n j n i λ n k n i n j n i λ n k n i if n j n i and n k n i are collinear the bending moment is zero the unit vectors supporting the forces applied on b k i and b i j can be calculated with u i j m i j k λ n j n i n j n i and u i k m i j k λ n k n i n k n i forces applied to model the bending torque are calculated from the moment m d λ f where d is the so called moment arm using the relation of the double cross product u λ v λ w u w v u v w we get f d λ m d ² consequently forces to implement are m i e i 4 sin α i 2 ℓ i j ℓ i k m i j k for modelling twine bending force which leads to f i e i 4 sin α i 2 ℓ ℓ i j ℓ i k u i j m i e i 2 sin α i ℓ i k m i j k for modelling embedded twine bending which leads to f i e i 2 sin α i ℓ ℓ i k u i j with ℓ is denoting the bar length where the force torque is applied 3 determination of the physical properties of the netting model by inverse identification 3 1 particle swarm optimization algorithm in the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 reynolds 1987 particles are defined that represent each a potential solution to the optimization problem to be solved these particles are defined in the solution domain by a position noted x and their speed 1 1 called the speed in the literature v is actually a displacement noted v they are then flying smartly through the solution domain by following each other to finally converge together to the global minimum of the considered objective function the speed and the position of particle i are then re calculated at each iteration t 1 of the optimization process as follows v i t 1 ω v i t c 1 r 1 p i b e s t t x i t c 2 r 2 g b e s t t x i t x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where p i b e s t t is the personal best position of particle i found so far given in terms of a position in the solution domain g b e s t t is the global best position found so far by the swarm ω is an inertia that is the influence of the previous speed on the calculation of the new one c 1 and c 2 are confident parameters weighing the influence of the entire swarm versus the personal memory of the particle r 1 and r 2 are random parameters defined in 0 1 ω is balancing the abilities of the algorithm to i explore the solution domain with a high value of ω ii exploit promising areas of the solution domain with a lower value then c 1 and c 2 have to be chosen carefully to optimize the capabilities of the algorithm to converge to the global minimum of the objective function moreover the positions and speeds of the particles have to be constrained for the calculation to converge the speed is then defined in v m a x v m a x where v m a x is defined as a function of the solution domain to be given in the same order of magnitude such as v m a x x m a x x m i n 2 where x m a x and x m i n are the extremal values defining the solution domain as it has been demonstrated in di cesare et al 2015 the pso particles can be seen as a markov chain and the transition probabilities can be seen as the influence of the particles on each other the transition probability matrix can then be recalculated at each iteration of the optimization process by considering the particles respective performance regarding the best one as the steady state of the markov chain to be fitted in a previous work di cesare et al 2015 this inverse pagerank pso algorithm has been proposed using the pagerank an artificial intelligence algorithm used by the world famous search engine google to redefine the influences of all the particles on all the others at every iteration of the optimization process the pso equations are then modified in the following way v i t 1 ω v i t c 1 r 1 p i b e s t t x i t c 2 r 2 j 1 n c i j p j b e s t t x i t x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where c is the transition probability matrix defined by the inverse pagerank algorithm and defining the influence of all the particles on the others the inverse pagerank pso algorithm has been used in this work to identify the constitutive parameters of the flexural rigidity model of the fishing net 3 2 choice of variables to optimize the numerical model described in previous sections is driven by a set of variables representing the mechanical and dimensional properties of the tested netting material axial rigidity k flexural rigidity ei length of the bar used to model the physical knot mesh side length and rest angle half mesh angle when the mesh is free of load twine weight and the amount of twines contained in a knot some of these variables have been determined by simple measurements or approximations this choice reduces the complexity of the optimization step and avoids potentially negative angles or distance de la prada and gonzalez 2015 sala et al 2007 mesh side length has been measured as the distance between the centers of two adjacent knots an averaging process is described in the experimental protocol linear axial rigidity can be measured through a stress strain experiment alternatively the approximation proposed in section 2 4 1 has been used in the present work twine linear weight is a known characteristic supplied by the net maker known as the twine runnage it has been weighed as detailed in the experimental protocol the amount of twine contained in a knot is needed to calculate the weight of a netting piece we have used the netting braiding factor approximately equal to 1 8 d c where d is the twine diameter and c in the mesh side prado and dremière 1988 other variables have been identified the length of the bar used to model the physical knot could be set to 3 times the twine diameter prado and dremière 1988 however physical knots are not symmetrical their shape depends on twine angle thus this variable has been identified through the optimization process morvan has measured the rest angle of a piece of netting put on a horizontal vibrating table to ensure that friction forces have a negligible effect taking into account the plasticity effects we assume that the rest angle cannot have a constant value and cannot be measured at rest before deformation cycles as a traction experiment will definitely modify the shape of the netting model thus the rest angle has been identified by the optimization process ei has also been identified the flexural rigidity the length of the bar used to model the physical knot and the rest angle are defined as the design variables to be identified through the optimization process 3 3 numerical test case and effects of discretization 3 3 1 size of the test case the test problem is chosen to be easily reproduced by a physical experiment by knowing the possible variation of dimensional characteristics of netting material the test case used has 3 meshes in the normal direction and 6 meshed in the transverse direction de la prada and gonzalez 2015 used a netting section of 3 x 8 meshes and morvan et al 2016 used a section of 5 x 10 meshes in section 4 1 it is shown that experimental results are reproducible with different netting sections taken on the same netting panel or sell unit in order to simulate the physical netting model the 3x6 virtual meshes model is suspended vertically to a horizontal support where the 3 upper nodes are free to move only in the support direction with no friction fig 9 different vertical forces are applied to the 3 lower nodes to model the effect of calibrated weights that will stretch the net during the experiment the length of the model is defined by the average distance between upper nodes and lower nodes and its width is defined by the average distance between left nodes and right nodes see fig 8 3 3 2 discretization effects the choice for the sample model discretization is a compromise between accuracy of equations resolution particularly the calculation of twines curvature radius and the complexity of the calculation six different mesh discretization are compared for pe4x40 samples 3 4 6 8 12 and 20 bars per mesh side calculated values of heights hi and widths wi for weight i see table 2 are shown on fig 7 one can observe a rapid convergence to a nearly constant value for discretization finer than 6 bars for each discretization table 1 shows the sample width and height relative differences with the finest discretization values compared to the finest discretization the 6 bars discretization leads to a maximum difference of 4 34 width and 2 5 height which seems a reasonable compromise consequently the discretization level has been set to 6 bars and the all presented results are obtained with this mesh side discretization 3 4 experimental protocol the netting samples dimensional characteristics were measured with a sliding caliper and a mm scale twelve twines 6 meshes in the t direction were set together side by side on a plane and the average diameter was measured as the sample thickness this measurement was repeated 6 times per sample for the 3 meshes in the n direction thus each twine of the sample was taken into account notice that the measured diameter is not used in the calculations average mesh length was calculated from the measurement of 6 aligned mesh sides between 2 knot centers 6 measurements per sample of 3 x 6 meshes uncertainties were deduced from min and max values the experimental setup fig 9 was made of a netting sample with 3 meshes set horizontally and 6 meshes set vertically normal netting direction was horizontal and transverse direction was vertical the 3 upper meshes were linked to 3 hooks that were manually moved on the horizontal support to set them vertically this prevents the induction of transversal force components to the netting sample the netting sample was stretch using lead weights in order to apply uniform loads on the lower 3 knots each weight was eventually adjusted by removing some lead with a small diameter drill the weights were checked using a calibrated balance pe6000 mettler toledo the maximum uncertainty of weights value is 0 4 gr six different charges were set to the 3 lower knots to stretch the netting sample the mass in grams of the weights are shown in table 2 the maximum weight value has been determined so as to produce the maximum stretch of the netting section due to flexural deformation larger weights lead to axial elongation and the model width does not decrease significantly no pre loading stage is processed except the one applied during the netting manufacturing process two samples of each netting type were tested their characteristics are detailed in table 3 plasticity effects were studied through a series of charge and discharge cycles for each cycle the following operations were performed on the experimental setup for each of the 6 loads w1 to w6 and then for the 5 loads from w5 to w1 as follows 1 set the charge at the 3 lower knots 2 move the hooks to ensure that there is no transversal load on the upper knots 3 wait 50 min and periodically check hooks are still vertical otherwise move them accordingly 4 measure the 3 distances between the upper and lower knots 2 by 2 and calculate the average height 5 measure the 6 distances between the left and right knots 2 by 2 and calculate the average width 6 go to step 1 using next charge case or go to next cycle if unload is finished distances were measured with a mm precision ruler the estimated measurement uncertainty is 1 mm the duration of 50 min has been chosen to ensure that the sample reached an almost constant height so that the plastic deformation is taken into account the criterion used was the height increased decreased by less than 1 in a 10 min interval cycles were repeated until the experimental protocol produces repeatable height and width measurements with a maximum relative difference of 3 on the height following this criterion we observed that the cycles 3 and 4 were reproducible heights widths are then averaged for the cycles 3 and 4 for each weight the lengths measured in the load process are averaged with the lengths measured in the unload process finally for each load measured deformations for the 2 samples are averaged to be used in optimization process in the objective of suppling the end user with averaged nettings characteristics 4 results 4 1 experimental results three different netting types have been studied table 3 measured heights and widths for the 4 load unload cycles are presented on fig 9 for pe4 40 graphics for other nettings and detailed values are presented in the supplementary material the maximum relative height difference between cycles 3 and 4 is 2 16 for pe4x40 sample 4 2 inverse identification results heights and widths presented in fig 10 are used to identify ei the rest angle and the length of the virtual knot for pe4 40 netting the quality of the identification is tested through the standard determination coefficient r2 and the mean absolute percentage error mape r ² 1 n y i y i ² y i y ² m a p e 100 n y i y i y i where y i are the experimental points the objectives of the optimization and y i are the simulated points y is the average objective during the optimization process mape was used to calculate the error function the parameters of inverse pagerank pso are the following c 1 c 2 2 and ω is linearly decreasing from 0 8 to 0 4 as the iterations are going the boundaries of the design domain are defined separately for each design variable as given in table 4 and the extremal particles displacements are defined as 20 of these design domains table 5 shows the identified values for the 3 parameters for the different tested nettings and fig 11 shows the simulation results with identified parameters compared to experimental results 4 3 comparison with other author s results the current methodology was applied to identify parameters from experimental results established by morvan et al 2016 with a different experimental protocol the author measured the vertical elongation of netting sample made of different materials table 6 the two main differences between the experimental protocols used by morvan and the one used in the present work are 1 the measurement of the rest angle on the sample at rest on a vibrating table to remove friction effects vs the identification of the rest angle in present work and 2 no particular care to take into account plasticity effects vs the use of the last repeatable cycles after several load unload cycles in the present work this last difference can be the cause of differences between parameters identified in the present work experiments and morvan s experiments moreover 10 samples of each material where tested by the author an important modeling difference comes from the node length it is not taken into account by morvan there is no virtual knot while it is taken into account in the present work the 3 variables ei angle at rest and node length have been identified with a 6 bars model from the average elongation of all samples for each load measured average samples and calculated elongations with the optimized parameter are shown in fig 12 table 7 summarizes the results and shows the values of identified parameters roughly we can observe ei values are smaller for present methodology as expected de la prada and gonzalez 2015 have studied different netting materials one sample of 4x8 meshes for each netting it cannot be stated that fibers constituting twines are the same than the one used in present work measured heights and widths are not detailed thus identification using present method cannot be undertaken from her measurements moreover she has presented different results derived from different modelling with or without optimization parameters constraints and the parameters were identified separately for the load and unload processes de la prada results with min max constrain on all parameters and present work results are compared in table 8 4 4 sensitivity analysis the value of each of the three variables flexural rigidity mesh angle at rest knot length is separately increased by 10 from its optimal value to assess the effect on the calculated sample width and height for each load this can be interpreted as assessing the error on geometry parameters samples width and height resulting from an identification error of a driving parameter ei the rest angle and the node length are increased by 10 from their respective optimal values errors on height and width and maximum errors observed are given in table 9 4 5 application to the simulation of netting tubes shape two tubes were built from pe4 40 and pe3 40 netting each tube has 29 meshes in circumference and is 35 meshes high so as to ensure the circular shape continuity knots of each sides were welded together two by two each tube was attached to a horizontal rigid 65 cm diameter circular frame with regular spacing between knots the protocol used to assess the load geometry relation was similar to the one described in 0 the total load among 0n 8 84n 20 15n 30 03 n 41 91n was attached to the lower knots after a period of 50 min the following characteristics were measured with a mm ruller average height minimum diameter at the neck of the tube distance from the upper part of the position of the minimum diameter average diameter of the lower part of the tube heights and diameters were measured 3 times at 120 and averaged the first cycles were ignored until repeatable geometrical characteristics could be measured the simulations were achieved with the 6 bars model fig 13 shows the measurement and simulation results with identified parameters for each netting see fig 14 results provided by the model are in reasonably good agreement with measures for height and diameters large relative errors were sometimes found for the position of the tube neck it must be noticed that the cylinders are not perfectly symmetrical due to the welding process and inhomogeneous netting this brings to measurement uncertainties moreover this result can be explained by the difficulty to accurately measure the neck position 5 discussion this article presents a new method to identify flexural rigidity rest angle knot length and enables the simulation of large deformation of nettings constructions including 3d flexural rigidity the two dimensional flexural rigidity ei has already been addressed in previous studies de la prada 2014 de la prada and gonzalez 2015 de la prada and gonzález 2016 morvan et al 2016 as well as the mesh angle at rest de la prada and gonzalez 2015 de la prada and gonzález 2016 the length of the physical knots has been added taking into account plasticity effects present method was applied to the set of experimental data of morvan et al 2016 where the netting knots length is null and identification results were compared the stretch mesh length being the same in both approaches mesh sides excluding the knot length are then slightly shorter when modeling a virtual node in the present work consequently we could anticipate over estimated ei values for morvan his mesh sides being longer higher ei values leads to the sample height for a given load this assumption is verified for each netting type morvan s ei values are roughly 2 times greater than values identified by present method on his experimental values rest angle has been measured with no load vs identified in present work but values are not significantly different table 7 as expected rest angle value for same netting types are greater for the present work 33 5 vs 7 for pe4x40 and 40 21 vs 6 32 taking plasticity effect into consideration identified ei value for pe4x40 and pe4x60 using present experimental protocol respectively 8 66e 05 and 8 84e 5 n m2 are expected to be smaller than morvan s values indeed the sample heights for load unload cycles 3 and 4 are greater than for a single cycle morvan s protocol this assumption is also verified identified parameters for pe3x40 and pe4x40 were compared to de la prada and gonzalez 2015 results the comparison is easier as the methodologies are closer the two methods differ by a separate identification for load and unload and by different constrained unconstrained parameters optimization approaches results are quite comparable ei and mesh angle at rest for the present work are inside the extrema depending on the modeling method used by the author averaged de la prada ei load and unload min max constrain for pe3x40 is 3 35e 05 n m2 vs 4 30e 05 and 6 22e 05 n m2 for pe4x40 vs 8 66e 05 average angle at rest is 29 vs 33 5 for pe3x40 and 32 vs 32 4 for pe4x40 ei values for different mesh sides with same twine diameter should be close in the case of 4 mm diameter netting this assumption is verified in present work 8 66e 05 8 84e 5 n m2 2 difference but is not verified for morvan s 4 mm samples 8 07e 05 3 22e 04 3 88e 04 1 30e 04 n m2 furthermore inertia varies with the 4th power of the diameter the ratio between ei 4 mm and ei 3 mm is around 2 in present work and for averaged de la prada values but is expected to be around 3 2 around 3 3 when considering measured diameters possible characteristic dispersion of the fibers constituting the different twines twine diameter reduction when load increases could explain this result the number of samples 2 samples in present work compared to 1 sample studied by de la prada and 10 or 5 double twine samples studied by morvan and the size of each sample 3x6 meshes for each netting vs 4x8 meshes for de la prada and 4x10 or 5x25 double twine meshes for morvan does not seem to have a major influence on ei results less than 5 variation for the 10 samples of morvan it confirms our choice for sample number and size it also confirms our choice to consider the average height and width values for each sample pair moreover identified values applied to larger netting structures cylinders made of 29 meshes in circumference and is 35 meshes height lead to calculated cylinder heights that compare with experimental values with mape errors of 2 98 for 4x40 cylinder and 1 92 for 3x40 cylinder nevertheless the identified node length 5 34 5 02 and 8 86 mm respectively for pe3x40 pe4x40 and pe4x60 differ from expected values about 3 times the diameter de la prada and gonzalez 2015 prado and dremière 1988 this can be interpreted as an attempt to optimize driving parameters so as to compensate imperfect mechanical model for instance plasticity which is not modelled the capacity of the developed model to reproduce experimental data is not perfect r2 0 999 mape 2 especially with larger loads this can be explained by 1 modeling hypothesis the twines diameter is supposed to be constant but it decreases when tension increases friction among fibers constituting twines is not taken into account thus ei is not constant as it has been shown by morvan et al 2016 ei varies by less than 6 for single twine pe and less than 10 for other materials with larger variations for lowest loads 2 the model does not take into account plasticity effects and consequently cannot not reproduce them thus when averaging load and unload cycles the resulting optimization objectives become more difficult to fit in the same way the number of objectives has been increased with the measured sample width which reduces the possibility to perfectly fit them however the precision observed for cylinder models mape 3 makes this methodology a good candidate for fisheries applications by taking into consideration the uncertainties of nettings and fishing gear characteristics a rapid sensitivity study has shown that the more sensitive variable is the mesh angle at rest but however with no amplification effect the output model uncertainty remains lower than the angle uncertainty in the meantime there is a lack of unified methodology among different authors to identify the mesh rest angle future work should consider the plasticity in the modeling and a more realistic model for the netting knot the way twines are embedded in an actual knot is different for the 4 twines knots are not symmetrical and their shape change with the mesh load this could lead to improve of the experimental protocol studying artificially aged netting materials could be complementary to the plasticity study taking into account twine torsion effects are also potential improvements for better understanding and implementation

21920,the assessment of mesh resistance to opening is a key factor when coming to fishing gear design to study or optimize the fishing selectivity process different authors proposed methodologies to achieve twine flexural rigidity identification and mesh opening angle at rest their experimental protocols could rely on complex installations and instrumentation and identification needs dedicated models or software with possible important set up time sometimes different flexural rigidity and rest angle values for a given netting type were proposed depending on identification or experimental conditions leading to difficulties to choose a value for implementation in netting structures simulation software the new methodology proposed in this article is based on a simplified experimental protocol taking plasticity into account and an identification method derived from an end user dedicated software to determine mechanical and dimensional characteristics of common netting materials identified flexural rigidity and rest angle values fall inside the interval provided by authors using similar methods identified parameters have been used to predict the geometry of two t90 netting cylinders with errors lower than 3 keywords fishing net mechanics twine flexural rigidity numerical simulation selectivity fishing 1 introduction the reform of the european common fisheries policy cfp of 2013 has increased the pressure on fishers compelling them to reduce the catch of untargeted species a technical way to avoid fishing untargeted species is to improve the selection capability of the fishing gear for fishing gear like trawls made of nettings mechanical properties of braided twines have a strong influence on net meshes opening herrmann et al 2013 and consequently on the selectivity properties especially in the terminal part of the fishing gear the codend is pulled into a bulb shape as it is loaded by fish which provides more open meshes in the front part of the bulb which enables the fish to escape robertson and stewart 1988 the mesh opening mechanism is complex and involves the twine bending stiffness a direct measurement of bending stiffness is not possible and needs an inverse identification process where a set of mesh characteristics including bending stiffness is adjusted till the model best reproduces a series of experiments experimental protocols and numerical modeling are involved in this process several experimental protocols have been tested by different authors to assess the value of the bending stiffness of twine composing fishing nets sala et al 2007 developed a complex and expensive experimental system to measure the forces needed to uniformly deform a sample of netting bending stiffness could be deduced using the beam theory priour and cognard 2011 proposed to measure the deformation of a vertical netting sample under different loads and the flexion of a netting sample as a cantilever under its own weight de la prada and gonzález 2016 proposed a way to establish a relation between the height of a netting sample and the force applied in its lower part in a vertically suspended and uniaxial configuration using a tensile test bench morvan et al 2016 used a similar configuration where each lower node of the netting sample had its own weight to simulate a force with no need of a tensile test bench the sample heights were measured for the different loads but the sample width was not considered to identify the bending stiffness de la prada and gonzález 2016 state that axial rigidity ea for common netting twines ranges between 500n and 3000n and that its effect on netting deformation is negligible compared to flexural deformations except for deformations that hardly happen in real marine applications in parallel the theory used by o neill 2002 does not involve axial elasticity and value of axial rigidity are not provided by morvan et al 2016 mechanical and geometrical properties of netting samples can be identified by the optimization of a set of parameters used in a physical oriented approach model priour 2001 priour and cognard 2011 modelled the flexural rigidity with a torque located at the physical knot supposing that the twines remain straight de la prada and gonzález 2016 used two different approaches 1 asymptotic development of a model of the twine as a bi dimensional double clamped beam developed by o neill this model was based on the beam bending equations under several hypothesis i the bending moment is proportional to the twine curvature and ii no axial elasticity 2 a finite element model allows the assessment of the force displacement response then fitting techniques have been used to set bi dimensional dimensionless models that compare accurately spline model and reasonably accurately polynomial model 5 10 of deviation with the exact solution previously given by o neil these models express the reaction force as an explicit function of the twine deformation and can be used to solve large deformations of the net these models assume uniform deformations and are not applicable to 3 dimensional problems a finite element model in abaqus for a small number of meshes have been developed by morvan et al mesh sides are assumed to behave like timoshenko beams taking into account the mesh resistance to the net s opening allowing the simulation of non uniform deformation again the optimization does not consider the relation between the sample width and the load the length of the physical knots is not considered these models are specifically designed to identify netting mechanical properties thus the identification of netting mechanical parameters by the final user of the netting modelling software can be difficult in this context this work proposes to apply identification results to larger structures simulation by comparing the numerical and experimental results nettings used in fishing gear can be loaded with high forces able to generate permanent plastic deformations in twines and knots de la prada 2014 plasticity has been taken into consideration in de la prada and gonzalez 2015 in a single load unload cycle for each load the operator waited until the sample length becomes stable moreover the maximum force leading to stretch the sample to 80 of its maximum stretched length was applied during 1 h after the last load increment and before the first unload increment the relations between sample height and forces for the load and the unload phases were then analyzed separately plasticity was not taken into consideration by morvan et al 2016 in the present work we attempt to establish a practical methodology to estimate the mechanical and geometrical properties of netting materials the proposed method is original as it is based on the use of artificially intelligent algorithms applied to the algorithm used in netting structure simulation in marine environment this netting structure simulation algorithm is implemented in a widely used commercial software dynamit specialized in trawl simulation presented by nguyen et al 2015 nguyen and winger 2016 and thus does not rely on any other theory nor software moreover it is proposed to overcome some of the drawbacks of previous methods 1 the present method considers eventual flexural forces and deformations normal to the two normalized netting directions n and t fig 1 2 the simple experimental protocol proposed by de la prada and gonzalez 2015 was slightly simplified to enable the end users to identify by themselves the properties of nettings without the need of laboratory facilities 3 the plasticity is taken into account in a more realistic way 4 identified parameters for some common nettings are applied to larger netting structures simulation and compared to experimental results finally an original metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on artificial intelligence is used to identify the constitutive parameters of the fishing net model 2 fishing net mechanical modelling 2 1 modelling of meshes in the present work netting is modelled by using the work of bessonneau and marichal 1998 and le bris and marichal 1999 where an axial elasticity model has been added for the present work net meshes are considered as twines and nodes each twine or mesh side can be split into two or more rigid bars to model its suppleness thus a mesh is broken down in a set of mass nodes linked by rigid bars supporting a tension additional forces are added to model gravity forces or any external force fig 1 2 2 dynamical equilibrium of netting elements let s consider a system constituted by n nodes and m rigid bars the mass of a bar is concentrated at each end nodes forces applied on bars weights and internal forces for instance are located at end nodes bessonneau and marichal proposed a method to solve the dynamic equilibrium of this system using the second law of newton applied to each node in a galilean frame if we consider the bar j linked to the node i then half the mass of the bar j and half the external forces applied on bar j are assumed to be applied directly on node i thus n equations can be written as follows 1 m i γ i n e i g b o u r b a r s j t i j h i j i 1 n where m i is the pseudo mass of node i taking into account half masses of bars j γ i is its acceleration t i j is the tension applied by neighbor bars j on node i and h i j is half an external force applied to bar j the so called length condition is imposed by solving the following equation where ℓ k l is the length of the bar limited by nodes k and l 2 ℓ k l 2 x k x l 2 where x k is the position of node k in a galilean frame using a simple semi implicit first order euler scheme for velocity to express the velocity of node k at time n 1 using the know time step h it follows 3 h v k n 1 x k n 1 x k n we get an explicit expression for velocity from eq 2 4 v k n 1 v l n 1 x k n x l n 1 2 h ℓ k l 0 2 1 2 h x k n x l n 2 using again an euler scheme for acceleration in eq 1 and substituting velocities in eq 4 we get a linear equation for each structure bar where bar tensions are the unknown variables to be solved 5 x k n x l n 2 h 2 v k n v l n 2 2 h x k n x l n v k n v l n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m k p n b k t j p n 1 x p n x k n ℓ j n h k p n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m l p n b l t l p n 1 x p n x l n ℓ i n h l p n ℓ k l 2 where nb k is the set of neighbor bars of the node k ℓ k p is the length of bar b k p the matrix equation for t is symmetrical and is efficiently solved with gauss method for law rank matrix lower than 1000 unknown variables and by considering conjugate gradient methods for higher ranks bessonneau and marichal and later lebris have used the following algorithm to solve this system of stiff equations in the time domain from initial positions and velocities verifying the length conditions external forces are calculated tensions are solved from the linear equation 5 acceleration velocities and positions are calculated at the time step n 1 this iteration is repeated until a convergence criterion is reached this algorithm has been used in this work to solve internal forces and positions of the netting twine and nodes 2 3 external forces the application considered in this study only requires weight forces due to the material specific weight and punctual weights applied in some structure nodes damping force due to hydrodynamic load is not considered 2 3 1 wt twine weight forming mesh bars and netting knots is applied to calculation nodes weights attached to the lower part of the netting model are applied to the lower nodes of the model 2 4 internal forces 2 4 1 axial elasticity in order to have a more realistic modeling and to increase the diagonal dominance of the matrix equation a linear axial elasticity term has been added in equation 2 6 ℓ k l ℓ 0 k l 1 k k l t k l where k k l is the inverse of the bar axial stiffness and the length of bar free of load ℓ 0 k l these length conditions are linearized assuming kt 1 which means that relative axial elongation of a mesh side is low which is verified in most cases of practical use of fishing nets application length condition at time n 1 becomes 2b ℓ k l n 1 2 ℓ 0 k l 2 1 2 k k l t k l n 1 x k n 1 x l n 1 2 we get a new explicit expression for velocity from eq 6 8 v k n 1 v l n 1 x k n x l n 1 2 h 1 2 k k l t k l n 1 ℓ k l 0 2 1 2 h x k n x l n 2 this leads to a new set of matrix equations 9 x k n x l n 2 h 2 v k n v l n 2 2 h x k n x l n v k n v l n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m k p n b k t j p n 1 x p n x k n ℓ j n h k p n 2 h 2 x k n x l n 1 m l p n b l t l p n 1 x p n x l n ℓ i n h l p n 1 2 k k l t k l n 1 ℓ k l 2 where the dominance of the diagonal is increased with elasticity terms making it easier to solve coefficient k can be elongation dependent depending on the material constituting the netting other authors chose to neglect the axial rigidity or concluded that this parameter has negligible effects for standard marine applications to feed the proposed model with this parameter the knot deformation when loading a mesh side is then taken into account the assumption is made that the knot behavior is not depending on the twine wanchana et al 2002 has established a linear load elongation curve resulting from breaking strength tests by considering the english knot for pe twines the relative knot strength is 65 of the tensile breaking strength and the elongation at breaking is 22 8 a first approximation of the k coefficient in equation 2b is thus k 0 228 0 65 b s where bs is the tensile breaking strength in newton the breaking load of the 3 mm twine used in this work is 120 kgw which leads to 1 k 3356 n the breaking load of 4 mm pe twine is 180 kgw which leads to 1 k 5034 n 2 4 2 flexural forces the connected structure made of bars as described above is not a representative model of an actual net as it does not take into account the twines flexural resistance according to elementary beam theory the relationship between the applied bending moment m and the resulting curvature of the center line of the beam is given by e i ρ m where ρ is the radius of curvature e is the elastic modulus i is the inertia of the beam s section the expression of the bending moment is valid under the assumption of a symmetrical beam and if its transverse sections remain normal to the bended centerline thus the bending moment is assumed to be proportional to the curvature of the twine at each location of the twine the bending stiffness is ei also known as the flexural rigidity for present work and like authors cited in this work the same assumptions are made leading to good results flexural rigidity of twines is taken into account to model its resistance to bending in these two situations 1 to model the suppleness of the twine and 2 when the twine is embedded into a netting node 2 4 2 1 curvature radius to model the suppleness of a twine in fig 2 the green line is supposed to be a bended netting twine the bar b k i defined by its two ends nodes n k n i and the bar b i j defined by n i n j are two adjacent bars discretizing the bended twine element the rotation angle of the discrete bar n i n j from its non bended position is α i the radius of curvature ρ is assumed to be the radius of the osculating circle to the local twine shape the circle is the circumcircle to the triangle ni nj nk thus its center is located at the intersection of the bisectors to ni nj and nj nk consequently α i is also the angle between the bisectors thus it follows sin α i k ℓ i k 2 ρ and sin α i j ℓ i j 2 ρ by using α i α i k α i j and the common relation sin α 1 sin α 2 2 sin α 1 α 2 2 cos α 1 α 2 2 it comes ρ ℓ i j ℓ i k 4 sin α i 2 and m i e i 4 sin α i 2 ℓ i j ℓ i k a general expression using triangle points co ordinates to calculate the radius of the circumcircle of a triangle could also be used 2 4 2 2 curvature radius to model a twine embedded in a netting knot the observation of a piece of netting shows that knots cannot be considered as punctual objects fig 3 they have an extension in the netting normal direction consequently it is proposed to model netting knots with a bar as shown in fig 5 observation also show that twines are not embedded in knots with a null angle between two adjacent twines in order to define the angle of twine free of load we define a local referential linked to the knot fig 4 the local orthonormal referential is defined by vectors n and t n is aligned with the so called normal direction of the netting which defines the orientation of netting nodes n is simply defined by the bar b i j and is normalized vector t is first approximately defined with t n o r m a l i s e d b 2 b 3 b 1 b 4 where b i is the vector oriented from the central node to the other end of bar b i and the normalization function is defined by n o r m a l i s e d u u u all b i have the same length in this application vector t is a unit vector close to t but that does not ensure orthogonality with n using n t λ n defining a unit vector normal to the average mesh plan t n λ n can be calculated which is normal to n thus n t defines a local orthonormal system to the node and is used to define the rest position of bars linked to this node vectors r i denote the rest orientation of bar i assuming the rest angle α r is known and a knot and its 4 bars are symmetrical at rest r i is simply calculated as follows r 1 sin α r t cos α r n r 2 sin α r t cos α r n r 3 r 1 r 4 r 2 the shape of the bended twine embedded in knot b i j is supposed to be approached by the circle tangent to r k at the node n i and passing through the node n k fig 5 we obtain the following expression of the radius of curvature ρ ℓ i k 2 sin α i and m i e i 2 sin α i ℓ i k we assume that angles and moments are positive when turning counterclockwise on fig 2 figs 4 and 6 then m i j 0 is the moment applied on b k i by b i j and m i j 0 is the moment applied on b i j by b k i 2 4 3 tridimensional implementation explanations given from figs 3 6 are valid for a 2d sketch when considering 3d models bending moments are applied on each bar by the mean of forces normal to the plan defined by the 2 bars fig 6 for instance the bending moment m applied by bar b k i on bar b i j is m f i j ℓ i j where ℓ i j is the length of bar b i j force f i j m ℓ i j is applied on node n j and f i j is applied on node n i to keep the resultant of forces applied on the bar b i j constant forces applied on b i j and on b k i have then to be calculated these forces are coplanar to b k i b i j as no torsion moment is assumed we need to calculate a unit vector having the same direction and orientation of the force let s call u i j the unit vector normal to b i j coplanar to b k i b i j being oriented so that n k n i u i j 0 and u k i is the unit vector normal to b k i coplanar to b k i b i j being oriented so that n j n i u k i 0 the unit vector normal to b k i b i j is defined as follows m i j k n j n i λ n k n i n j n i λ n k n i if n j n i and n k n i are collinear the bending moment is zero the unit vectors supporting the forces applied on b k i and b i j can be calculated with u i j m i j k λ n j n i n j n i and u i k m i j k λ n k n i n k n i forces applied to model the bending torque are calculated from the moment m d λ f where d is the so called moment arm using the relation of the double cross product u λ v λ w u w v u v w we get f d λ m d ² consequently forces to implement are m i e i 4 sin α i 2 ℓ i j ℓ i k m i j k for modelling twine bending force which leads to f i e i 4 sin α i 2 ℓ ℓ i j ℓ i k u i j m i e i 2 sin α i ℓ i k m i j k for modelling embedded twine bending which leads to f i e i 2 sin α i ℓ ℓ i k u i j with ℓ is denoting the bar length where the force torque is applied 3 determination of the physical properties of the netting model by inverse identification 3 1 particle swarm optimization algorithm in the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 reynolds 1987 particles are defined that represent each a potential solution to the optimization problem to be solved these particles are defined in the solution domain by a position noted x and their speed 1 1 called the speed in the literature v is actually a displacement noted v they are then flying smartly through the solution domain by following each other to finally converge together to the global minimum of the considered objective function the speed and the position of particle i are then re calculated at each iteration t 1 of the optimization process as follows v i t 1 ω v i t c 1 r 1 p i b e s t t x i t c 2 r 2 g b e s t t x i t x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where p i b e s t t is the personal best position of particle i found so far given in terms of a position in the solution domain g b e s t t is the global best position found so far by the swarm ω is an inertia that is the influence of the previous speed on the calculation of the new one c 1 and c 2 are confident parameters weighing the influence of the entire swarm versus the personal memory of the particle r 1 and r 2 are random parameters defined in 0 1 ω is balancing the abilities of the algorithm to i explore the solution domain with a high value of ω ii exploit promising areas of the solution domain with a lower value then c 1 and c 2 have to be chosen carefully to optimize the capabilities of the algorithm to converge to the global minimum of the objective function moreover the positions and speeds of the particles have to be constrained for the calculation to converge the speed is then defined in v m a x v m a x where v m a x is defined as a function of the solution domain to be given in the same order of magnitude such as v m a x x m a x x m i n 2 where x m a x and x m i n are the extremal values defining the solution domain as it has been demonstrated in di cesare et al 2015 the pso particles can be seen as a markov chain and the transition probabilities can be seen as the influence of the particles on each other the transition probability matrix can then be recalculated at each iteration of the optimization process by considering the particles respective performance regarding the best one as the steady state of the markov chain to be fitted in a previous work di cesare et al 2015 this inverse pagerank pso algorithm has been proposed using the pagerank an artificial intelligence algorithm used by the world famous search engine google to redefine the influences of all the particles on all the others at every iteration of the optimization process the pso equations are then modified in the following way v i t 1 ω v i t c 1 r 1 p i b e s t t x i t c 2 r 2 j 1 n c i j p j b e s t t x i t x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where c is the transition probability matrix defined by the inverse pagerank algorithm and defining the influence of all the particles on the others the inverse pagerank pso algorithm has been used in this work to identify the constitutive parameters of the flexural rigidity model of the fishing net 3 2 choice of variables to optimize the numerical model described in previous sections is driven by a set of variables representing the mechanical and dimensional properties of the tested netting material axial rigidity k flexural rigidity ei length of the bar used to model the physical knot mesh side length and rest angle half mesh angle when the mesh is free of load twine weight and the amount of twines contained in a knot some of these variables have been determined by simple measurements or approximations this choice reduces the complexity of the optimization step and avoids potentially negative angles or distance de la prada and gonzalez 2015 sala et al 2007 mesh side length has been measured as the distance between the centers of two adjacent knots an averaging process is described in the experimental protocol linear axial rigidity can be measured through a stress strain experiment alternatively the approximation proposed in section 2 4 1 has been used in the present work twine linear weight is a known characteristic supplied by the net maker known as the twine runnage it has been weighed as detailed in the experimental protocol the amount of twine contained in a knot is needed to calculate the weight of a netting piece we have used the netting braiding factor approximately equal to 1 8 d c where d is the twine diameter and c in the mesh side prado and dremière 1988 other variables have been identified the length of the bar used to model the physical knot could be set to 3 times the twine diameter prado and dremière 1988 however physical knots are not symmetrical their shape depends on twine angle thus this variable has been identified through the optimization process morvan has measured the rest angle of a piece of netting put on a horizontal vibrating table to ensure that friction forces have a negligible effect taking into account the plasticity effects we assume that the rest angle cannot have a constant value and cannot be measured at rest before deformation cycles as a traction experiment will definitely modify the shape of the netting model thus the rest angle has been identified by the optimization process ei has also been identified the flexural rigidity the length of the bar used to model the physical knot and the rest angle are defined as the design variables to be identified through the optimization process 3 3 numerical test case and effects of discretization 3 3 1 size of the test case the test problem is chosen to be easily reproduced by a physical experiment by knowing the possible variation of dimensional characteristics of netting material the test case used has 3 meshes in the normal direction and 6 meshed in the transverse direction de la prada and gonzalez 2015 used a netting section of 3 x 8 meshes and morvan et al 2016 used a section of 5 x 10 meshes in section 4 1 it is shown that experimental results are reproducible with different netting sections taken on the same netting panel or sell unit in order to simulate the physical netting model the 3x6 virtual meshes model is suspended vertically to a horizontal support where the 3 upper nodes are free to move only in the support direction with no friction fig 9 different vertical forces are applied to the 3 lower nodes to model the effect of calibrated weights that will stretch the net during the experiment the length of the model is defined by the average distance between upper nodes and lower nodes and its width is defined by the average distance between left nodes and right nodes see fig 8 3 3 2 discretization effects the choice for the sample model discretization is a compromise between accuracy of equations resolution particularly the calculation of twines curvature radius and the complexity of the calculation six different mesh discretization are compared for pe4x40 samples 3 4 6 8 12 and 20 bars per mesh side calculated values of heights hi and widths wi for weight i see table 2 are shown on fig 7 one can observe a rapid convergence to a nearly constant value for discretization finer than 6 bars for each discretization table 1 shows the sample width and height relative differences with the finest discretization values compared to the finest discretization the 6 bars discretization leads to a maximum difference of 4 34 width and 2 5 height which seems a reasonable compromise consequently the discretization level has been set to 6 bars and the all presented results are obtained with this mesh side discretization 3 4 experimental protocol the netting samples dimensional characteristics were measured with a sliding caliper and a mm scale twelve twines 6 meshes in the t direction were set together side by side on a plane and the average diameter was measured as the sample thickness this measurement was repeated 6 times per sample for the 3 meshes in the n direction thus each twine of the sample was taken into account notice that the measured diameter is not used in the calculations average mesh length was calculated from the measurement of 6 aligned mesh sides between 2 knot centers 6 measurements per sample of 3 x 6 meshes uncertainties were deduced from min and max values the experimental setup fig 9 was made of a netting sample with 3 meshes set horizontally and 6 meshes set vertically normal netting direction was horizontal and transverse direction was vertical the 3 upper meshes were linked to 3 hooks that were manually moved on the horizontal support to set them vertically this prevents the induction of transversal force components to the netting sample the netting sample was stretch using lead weights in order to apply uniform loads on the lower 3 knots each weight was eventually adjusted by removing some lead with a small diameter drill the weights were checked using a calibrated balance pe6000 mettler toledo the maximum uncertainty of weights value is 0 4 gr six different charges were set to the 3 lower knots to stretch the netting sample the mass in grams of the weights are shown in table 2 the maximum weight value has been determined so as to produce the maximum stretch of the netting section due to flexural deformation larger weights lead to axial elongation and the model width does not decrease significantly no pre loading stage is processed except the one applied during the netting manufacturing process two samples of each netting type were tested their characteristics are detailed in table 3 plasticity effects were studied through a series of charge and discharge cycles for each cycle the following operations were performed on the experimental setup for each of the 6 loads w1 to w6 and then for the 5 loads from w5 to w1 as follows 1 set the charge at the 3 lower knots 2 move the hooks to ensure that there is no transversal load on the upper knots 3 wait 50 min and periodically check hooks are still vertical otherwise move them accordingly 4 measure the 3 distances between the upper and lower knots 2 by 2 and calculate the average height 5 measure the 6 distances between the left and right knots 2 by 2 and calculate the average width 6 go to step 1 using next charge case or go to next cycle if unload is finished distances were measured with a mm precision ruler the estimated measurement uncertainty is 1 mm the duration of 50 min has been chosen to ensure that the sample reached an almost constant height so that the plastic deformation is taken into account the criterion used was the height increased decreased by less than 1 in a 10 min interval cycles were repeated until the experimental protocol produces repeatable height and width measurements with a maximum relative difference of 3 on the height following this criterion we observed that the cycles 3 and 4 were reproducible heights widths are then averaged for the cycles 3 and 4 for each weight the lengths measured in the load process are averaged with the lengths measured in the unload process finally for each load measured deformations for the 2 samples are averaged to be used in optimization process in the objective of suppling the end user with averaged nettings characteristics 4 results 4 1 experimental results three different netting types have been studied table 3 measured heights and widths for the 4 load unload cycles are presented on fig 9 for pe4 40 graphics for other nettings and detailed values are presented in the supplementary material the maximum relative height difference between cycles 3 and 4 is 2 16 for pe4x40 sample 4 2 inverse identification results heights and widths presented in fig 10 are used to identify ei the rest angle and the length of the virtual knot for pe4 40 netting the quality of the identification is tested through the standard determination coefficient r2 and the mean absolute percentage error mape r ² 1 n y i y i ² y i y ² m a p e 100 n y i y i y i where y i are the experimental points the objectives of the optimization and y i are the simulated points y is the average objective during the optimization process mape was used to calculate the error function the parameters of inverse pagerank pso are the following c 1 c 2 2 and ω is linearly decreasing from 0 8 to 0 4 as the iterations are going the boundaries of the design domain are defined separately for each design variable as given in table 4 and the extremal particles displacements are defined as 20 of these design domains table 5 shows the identified values for the 3 parameters for the different tested nettings and fig 11 shows the simulation results with identified parameters compared to experimental results 4 3 comparison with other author s results the current methodology was applied to identify parameters from experimental results established by morvan et al 2016 with a different experimental protocol the author measured the vertical elongation of netting sample made of different materials table 6 the two main differences between the experimental protocols used by morvan and the one used in the present work are 1 the measurement of the rest angle on the sample at rest on a vibrating table to remove friction effects vs the identification of the rest angle in present work and 2 no particular care to take into account plasticity effects vs the use of the last repeatable cycles after several load unload cycles in the present work this last difference can be the cause of differences between parameters identified in the present work experiments and morvan s experiments moreover 10 samples of each material where tested by the author an important modeling difference comes from the node length it is not taken into account by morvan there is no virtual knot while it is taken into account in the present work the 3 variables ei angle at rest and node length have been identified with a 6 bars model from the average elongation of all samples for each load measured average samples and calculated elongations with the optimized parameter are shown in fig 12 table 7 summarizes the results and shows the values of identified parameters roughly we can observe ei values are smaller for present methodology as expected de la prada and gonzalez 2015 have studied different netting materials one sample of 4x8 meshes for each netting it cannot be stated that fibers constituting twines are the same than the one used in present work measured heights and widths are not detailed thus identification using present method cannot be undertaken from her measurements moreover she has presented different results derived from different modelling with or without optimization parameters constraints and the parameters were identified separately for the load and unload processes de la prada results with min max constrain on all parameters and present work results are compared in table 8 4 4 sensitivity analysis the value of each of the three variables flexural rigidity mesh angle at rest knot length is separately increased by 10 from its optimal value to assess the effect on the calculated sample width and height for each load this can be interpreted as assessing the error on geometry parameters samples width and height resulting from an identification error of a driving parameter ei the rest angle and the node length are increased by 10 from their respective optimal values errors on height and width and maximum errors observed are given in table 9 4 5 application to the simulation of netting tubes shape two tubes were built from pe4 40 and pe3 40 netting each tube has 29 meshes in circumference and is 35 meshes high so as to ensure the circular shape continuity knots of each sides were welded together two by two each tube was attached to a horizontal rigid 65 cm diameter circular frame with regular spacing between knots the protocol used to assess the load geometry relation was similar to the one described in 0 the total load among 0n 8 84n 20 15n 30 03 n 41 91n was attached to the lower knots after a period of 50 min the following characteristics were measured with a mm ruller average height minimum diameter at the neck of the tube distance from the upper part of the position of the minimum diameter average diameter of the lower part of the tube heights and diameters were measured 3 times at 120 and averaged the first cycles were ignored until repeatable geometrical characteristics could be measured the simulations were achieved with the 6 bars model fig 13 shows the measurement and simulation results with identified parameters for each netting see fig 14 results provided by the model are in reasonably good agreement with measures for height and diameters large relative errors were sometimes found for the position of the tube neck it must be noticed that the cylinders are not perfectly symmetrical due to the welding process and inhomogeneous netting this brings to measurement uncertainties moreover this result can be explained by the difficulty to accurately measure the neck position 5 discussion this article presents a new method to identify flexural rigidity rest angle knot length and enables the simulation of large deformation of nettings constructions including 3d flexural rigidity the two dimensional flexural rigidity ei has already been addressed in previous studies de la prada 2014 de la prada and gonzalez 2015 de la prada and gonzález 2016 morvan et al 2016 as well as the mesh angle at rest de la prada and gonzalez 2015 de la prada and gonzález 2016 the length of the physical knots has been added taking into account plasticity effects present method was applied to the set of experimental data of morvan et al 2016 where the netting knots length is null and identification results were compared the stretch mesh length being the same in both approaches mesh sides excluding the knot length are then slightly shorter when modeling a virtual node in the present work consequently we could anticipate over estimated ei values for morvan his mesh sides being longer higher ei values leads to the sample height for a given load this assumption is verified for each netting type morvan s ei values are roughly 2 times greater than values identified by present method on his experimental values rest angle has been measured with no load vs identified in present work but values are not significantly different table 7 as expected rest angle value for same netting types are greater for the present work 33 5 vs 7 for pe4x40 and 40 21 vs 6 32 taking plasticity effect into consideration identified ei value for pe4x40 and pe4x60 using present experimental protocol respectively 8 66e 05 and 8 84e 5 n m2 are expected to be smaller than morvan s values indeed the sample heights for load unload cycles 3 and 4 are greater than for a single cycle morvan s protocol this assumption is also verified identified parameters for pe3x40 and pe4x40 were compared to de la prada and gonzalez 2015 results the comparison is easier as the methodologies are closer the two methods differ by a separate identification for load and unload and by different constrained unconstrained parameters optimization approaches results are quite comparable ei and mesh angle at rest for the present work are inside the extrema depending on the modeling method used by the author averaged de la prada ei load and unload min max constrain for pe3x40 is 3 35e 05 n m2 vs 4 30e 05 and 6 22e 05 n m2 for pe4x40 vs 8 66e 05 average angle at rest is 29 vs 33 5 for pe3x40 and 32 vs 32 4 for pe4x40 ei values for different mesh sides with same twine diameter should be close in the case of 4 mm diameter netting this assumption is verified in present work 8 66e 05 8 84e 5 n m2 2 difference but is not verified for morvan s 4 mm samples 8 07e 05 3 22e 04 3 88e 04 1 30e 04 n m2 furthermore inertia varies with the 4th power of the diameter the ratio between ei 4 mm and ei 3 mm is around 2 in present work and for averaged de la prada values but is expected to be around 3 2 around 3 3 when considering measured diameters possible characteristic dispersion of the fibers constituting the different twines twine diameter reduction when load increases could explain this result the number of samples 2 samples in present work compared to 1 sample studied by de la prada and 10 or 5 double twine samples studied by morvan and the size of each sample 3x6 meshes for each netting vs 4x8 meshes for de la prada and 4x10 or 5x25 double twine meshes for morvan does not seem to have a major influence on ei results less than 5 variation for the 10 samples of morvan it confirms our choice for sample number and size it also confirms our choice to consider the average height and width values for each sample pair moreover identified values applied to larger netting structures cylinders made of 29 meshes in circumference and is 35 meshes height lead to calculated cylinder heights that compare with experimental values with mape errors of 2 98 for 4x40 cylinder and 1 92 for 3x40 cylinder nevertheless the identified node length 5 34 5 02 and 8 86 mm respectively for pe3x40 pe4x40 and pe4x60 differ from expected values about 3 times the diameter de la prada and gonzalez 2015 prado and dremière 1988 this can be interpreted as an attempt to optimize driving parameters so as to compensate imperfect mechanical model for instance plasticity which is not modelled the capacity of the developed model to reproduce experimental data is not perfect r2 0 999 mape 2 especially with larger loads this can be explained by 1 modeling hypothesis the twines diameter is supposed to be constant but it decreases when tension increases friction among fibers constituting twines is not taken into account thus ei is not constant as it has been shown by morvan et al 2016 ei varies by less than 6 for single twine pe and less than 10 for other materials with larger variations for lowest loads 2 the model does not take into account plasticity effects and consequently cannot not reproduce them thus when averaging load and unload cycles the resulting optimization objectives become more difficult to fit in the same way the number of objectives has been increased with the measured sample width which reduces the possibility to perfectly fit them however the precision observed for cylinder models mape 3 makes this methodology a good candidate for fisheries applications by taking into consideration the uncertainties of nettings and fishing gear characteristics a rapid sensitivity study has shown that the more sensitive variable is the mesh angle at rest but however with no amplification effect the output model uncertainty remains lower than the angle uncertainty in the meantime there is a lack of unified methodology among different authors to identify the mesh rest angle future work should consider the plasticity in the modeling and a more realistic model for the netting knot the way twines are embedded in an actual knot is different for the 4 twines knots are not symmetrical and their shape change with the mesh load this could lead to improve of the experimental protocol studying artificially aged netting materials could be complementary to the plasticity study taking into account twine torsion effects are also potential improvements for better understanding and implementation

21921,ballast tank sediments host organisms that pose invasion risk even if the ships are installed with ballast treatment systems the bottom sediments also contribute to corrosion and cause cumulative deadweight loss over the years this study presents the outcomes of the project conceptual ballast tank design for reducing sediment accumulation tubitak grant no 115y740 in the published first phase of the project sediment accumulation pattern was determined and the center girder was found to be critical in this study the findings of the second and third phases are presented in the second phase the tank model design was revised aiming to reduce total sediment accumulation the contribution of this revision was found to be is numerically insignificant however this revision drove more sediment towards the center girder thus in the third phase a pneumatic cleaning system targeting the center girder was designed to mobilize water to suspend sediment and facilitate discharge from the tank the pneumatic cleaning system reduced the total sediment deposition in the ballast tank up to 45 operating the pneumatic system before de ballasting operations on a regular basis would decrease the amount of sediment to be managed reduce the invasion risk tank corrosion and cumulative deadweight loss keywords ballast tank design sediment reduction pneumatic cleaning system invasive species 1 introduction ballast water is an integral element of safe shipping however the living organisms in the ballast tanks have in different aspects been an important issue for the academic world and different stakeholders of marine transportation within the last four decades following the recognition of the translocation of organisms along with the ballast water carlton 1985 medcof 1975 there have been great number of studies on identifying the organisms which are translocated within the ballast tanks bailey 2015 chu e tam fung chen 1997 davidson and simkanin 2012 gollasch et al 2015 gonçalves 2013 grigorovich et al 2003 hallegraeff 2015 hallegraeff and bolch 1991 lavoie et al 1999 occhipinti ambrogi and savini 2003 ojaveer et al 2014 wu et al 2019 international maritime organization imo has focused on the ballast water organism problem since the 1990s and finally adopted the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments bwm convention on 03 february 2004 the bwm requires all relevant vessels to manage their ballast water to meet either d 1 ballast water exchange standard or d 2 performance standard for most of the ships it can only be achieved through ballast water treatment with a designated time table imo 2004 however the time table has been exceeded before the bwm convention entered into force on september 8 2017 therefore the bwm convention s implementation timetable for existing ships has been postponed two years by the imo marine environment protection committee mepc according to the amendments all existing vessels are required to comply with the d 2 standards on a date to be determined according to the age and international oil pollution prevention iopp renewal surveys from 8 september 2019 to 8 september 2024 mepc 2018a on the other hand certain requirements of the bwm convention including ballast water management for all ships and the d 2 standard for new ships are now in force the bwm convention requires the treatment systems to be installed to have a type approval certificate in accordance with guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems guidelines g8 the revised guidelines g8 have been converted into mandatory code for approval of ballast water management systems bwms code at the 72nd session of mepc mepc 2018b there are more than 70 type approved systems which make use of different treatment methods available and each system has limitation depending on the technologies used and the properties of the ballast water hess erga et al 2019 jing et al 2012 tsolaki and diamadopoulos 2010 on the other hand ballast water is not the only habitat in ballast tanks but bottom sediment is an important habitat as well it is not possible to completely empty the ballast tanks of the ships anything that settles from the water column within the ballast tanks is susceptible to deposition in the sediment at the bottom of ballast tanks the studies on ballast sediment underline the necessity of efficient management of ballast tank sediment not only for protecting the marine environment but also human health as well the bottom sediment may host a diverse array of active and dormant stages of marine organisms and microorganisms including pathogens bailey et al 2007 brinkmeyer 2016 briski et al 2012 gollasch et al 2018 mimura et al 2005 sutherland and levings 2013 many invertebrates phytoplankton including toxic dinoflagellates protozoan and bacterial species have the capability of producing resting stages in their life cycles and when organisms are at their resting stage they have extremely high resistance to harsh conditions including noxious chemicals and capability of germination when the conditions get favorable johengen et al 2005 the ability of many sediment organisms to produce resting stages ensures the long term viability and this reduces the ballast water treatment efficacy hallegraeff 2015 the recent studies focusing on ballast sediment show that there are more organisms than those that have already been reported and a considerable number of these newly identified organisms are harmful and pose an ecological or public health risks the study by shang et al increased the number of fully identified dinoflagellate species from ballast tank sediments by more than 50 shang et al 2019 besides lv et al have identified high abundance of diverse antibiotic resistance genes and human pathogens in ballast sediment lv et al 2018 in addition to providing habitat to organisms the sediment of the ballast tank may contain heavy metals feng et al 2017 maglić et al 2016 and disinfection byproducts banerji et al 2012 the biotic and abiotic content of the ballast sediment gives rise to the need for managing sediment with careful and proper removal storage and disposal procedures maglić et al 2017 the bwm convention also necessitates parties to provide adequate facilities for the reception of sediments in ports and terminals where cleaning or repairing of ballast tanks take place imo 2004 the sediment removal should be undertaken under controlled conditions guidelines for sediment reception facilities g1 have been developed by mepc to support the proper management of the sediment mepc 2006 the uscg ballast water discharge standards final rule which along with the imo bwm convention is also one of the two predominant legislations around the globe brings about stringent requirements for sediment management uscg 2012 the amount of the sediment depends on the type capacity age and operation characteristics of the vessels however this amount may reach up to 100s of tons hamer 2002 johengen et al 2005 the accumulation of such amount of weight would not only cause loss of cargo capacity in ships which will in return cause a cumulative loss of income through the years but also the microbial content of the ballast sediment increases corrosion risk heyer et al 2013 most of the ballast water management has the primary treatment stage which employs filters if installed onboard a ship these systems would reduce the amount of the sediment to be accumulated to a degree but will not be sufficient to eliminate the sediment completely the typical backwash filters used in these systems are limited to particle size larger than 40 50 μm due to optimal operating conditions however the ballast tank sediment is mostly below this limit and is in the clay 2 μm or less and silt 2 63 μm form maglić et al 2017 2016 the flow regime in the ballast tanks has an important effect on the sediment deposition the complex geometry of the double bottom ballast tanks due to longitudinal and transversal structural members results in a complex flow regime during ballasting and de ballasting operation many dead spots with very low local flow velocities which are susceptible to sediment accumulation occur during these operations the geometry of the ballast tanks and position of the inlet outlet qi and eames 2015 qi et al 2014 wilson et al 2006 affect the sedimentation pattern and the flushing efficacy the sedimentation pattern within the tank also differs by the proximity of the location to the bell mouth ballast intake pump out port and openings on the tank members sturtevant et al 2007 regulation b 5 of the bwm convention states that ships should be designed and constructed

designing ships to minimize the retention of sediment mepc 2012 in their technical paper prange and pereira 2013 propose some simple modifications in ballast tanks to reduce the amount of the bottom sediment prange and pereira 2013 these simple modifications include modification in the de ballasting system some minor alterations in the tank design and injection of water against the bottom of tanks yuan et al also proposes a flushing system to re suspend the accumulated sediments at the bottom and circulate it through a hydro cyclone for separating yuan et al 2017 the present study reports the outcomes of the conceptual ballast tank design for reducing sediment accumulation project which was supported by the scientific and technical research council of turkey tubitak grant no 115y740 the overall project was conducted in three stages the main objective of the first stage was to observe the accumulation characteristics of the sediment in a conventional tanker double bottom ballast tank for this purpose a preliminary 2 d numerical analysis was conducted for defining potential accumulation zones where the flow halts and several experimental studies were conducted with a conventional tanker double bottom ballast tank model constructed at a laboratory scale within the scope of the first stage the sediment accumulation pattern through the tank model was determined bilgin güney danışman ertürk bozkurtoğlu yonsel 2018 and the region around the center girder line found to be the most critical zone of the double bottom ballast tank in a longitudinally framed tanker for the second stage the design improvement recommendations of g12 mepc 2012 along with the findings of the first stage were evaluated to revise the model design to reduce sediment accumulation without compromising security the changes made in the design aimed to facilitate the ballast water transport between the compartments the contribution of these structural changes to reducing accumulation has been examined experimentally in the second stage at the final stage based on the findings of the first two stages a pneumatic system was designed to mobilize water to reduce sediment build up and facilitate discharge from the tank this system was adapted to the design of the second model this manuscript includes the results of the 2 d numerical analysis benchmark tests with the conventional ballast tank model and presents the findings of the second and the third stages of the project 2 definition of the problem and preliminary computational analysis the ships have six degrees of freedom however the sediment motion would be dominantly triggered by the rotational and oscillatory motions among the rotational motions only rolling and pitching are purely oscillatory as they are acting under restoring force or moment das et al 2008 on the other hand as the response amplitude operator of pitch motion is rather weak compared to the roll motions response amplitude operator bertram 2012 the effect of pitch motion is neglected in this study as a first approach a preliminary 2d computational analysis was conducted to investigate the flow characteristics inside a ballast tank when the ship is subjected to the roll motion and to predict potential dead zones that are susceptible to sediment accumulation the numerical analysis was bounded by the roll motion only in 3 4 sea state beaufort number 4 5 condition which is a common condition for sea state bialystocki and konovessis 2016 with the roll angle φ 5 and the rolling period t 15 65 s the computational analysis performed on a 1 20 scale model of a longitudinally framed tanker double bottom ballast tank with the structural elements fig 1 to obtain the flow characteristics in the ballast tank an open source cfd solver which is based on the lattice boltzmann method lbm was used lattice boltzmann method is a meshless simulation method for cfd problems which involves complex geometries chen and doolen 1998 since the ballast tank geometry includes several structural elements and subjected to an oscillatory motion the problem requires a large number of grid discretization in conventional flow solvers and special treatment to handle the motion of the tank briefly lbm focuses on fictive particles and computes propagation of collision of those particles over the lattice mesh on the contrary conventional cfd methods first solve the conservation equations on the macroscopic scale lbm method depends on collision and streaming steps collision step 1 f i x t δ t f i x t f i e q x t f i x t τ f where ρ x t is the density of the fluid and x is the position and t is the time f i i 0 a components of the lattice f i e q x t is the equilibrium density along the direction i τ f is the timescale where the fluid reaches an equilibrium state locally streaming step 2 f i x e i t 1 f i x t where e i denotes the velocity of the fluid at time t and the next time step t 1 the position of the fluid will be x e i a 2d section of the ballast tank and lattice distribution can be seen in fig 2 along with center plane cl and bilge computations were carried out for 40 s of a simulation which covers more than 10 cycles of the model motion after 3 cycles of the motion computation converges and motion of the fluid shows the same behavior steady state at the same position of the cyclic motion stages of the tank motion after the flow in the tank reaches its steady state condition are given in fig 3 with 9 equal time intervals in one period of the cycle the stages of the motion can be summarized as follows 1 the tank passes through its initial position 2 the tank makes approximately 2 5⁰ heel to the starboard flow moves towards the outside of the tank 3 the tank reaches 5⁰ of heel angle to the starboard an eddy at the bilge is observed velocity magnitudes near the center plane cl are smaller than that of the bilge area tank s roll motion is directed to the port side the flow starts moving through the center plane an eddy becomes visible near the center plane flow is almost stationary at the bottom of the tank near the center plane 4 the tank passes through its initial position again motion is directed to the port side flow accelerates through the center plane the eddy near the center plane becomes more visible the eddy at the bilge area sweeps the tank bottom thoroughly 5 the tank reaches 2 5⁰ heel to the port the eddy near the center plane becomes more dominant flow is still stationary at the bottom of the tank 6 the tank reaches 5⁰ heel to the port the roll motion will be directed towards the starboard two large eddies are observed near the center plane these eddies decelerate the flow to the side of the tank 7 the tank makes 2 5⁰ heel to the port the roll motion is directed to the starboard the motion of the fluid decelerated by the two eddies observed near the center plane 8 the tank makes a 5⁰ heel to the port the roll motion is directed to the starboard the eddies observed near the center plane become more dominant and decelerate the flow 9 the tank reaches its initial position again the similarity between the 1st and 9th stages shows that the computation has reached its steady state condition at the end of the computational analysis it was observed that the bilge area was swept by the eddies during the roll motion also flow accelerated towards the center plane but decelerated towards bilge it is worth noting that when focusing on areas near the central plane the flow was almost stationary around the bottom longitudinals and more sediment accumulation could be expected near the center plane according to the flow characteristics consequently it was observed that all the structural elements affect the flow in the tank and have a contribution to the sediment accumulation in light of these deductions an experimental study designed in order to observe the detailed effects of these structural elements on the sediment accumulation and to determine the precautions to be taken for decreasing the accumulation amount 3 experiment preparation and methods an experimental study to simulate the ballast condition of a tanker in the roll motion the roll angle φ 5 rolling period t 15 65 s was designed the details of the experimental study are given in the following sections 3 1 the experimental system the experimental system consists of three units a roll simulator to provide roll motion a ballast tank model and a mixing tank for preparation of ballast mixture fig 4 these three units were employed in all three stages of the project in the third stage an air compressor and a pipe system were integrated into the experimental system for mobilizing the sediment the ballast tank model was placed in the center of the system as the main unit three different models were used during the project and the design of the model depended on the stage of the experiments all of the three ballast tank models were constructed as a 1 20 scale model of a longitudinally framed tanker double bottom ballast tank structure fig 1 the first model model 1 was the scaled model of the double bottom ballast tank of a real tanker on service small holes and openings to allow water to flow through the compartments of the tank model were also available at the same location and in the same number but in scaled dimensions as the actual tanker the changes in the other models model 2 and model 3 will be explained in detail in the respective section of the manuscript each model contained all the main components available in a real tanker double bottom the models were separated longitudinally by a continuous center girder each model contained port side and starboard side tanks the tanks had 8 stations and 24 compartments sectioned by transversal floors and longitudinal girders for the experiments presented in this study the ballast mixture was filled only to the port side tanks the starboard side of the model was not used for the experiments it was filled with plain water only to provide the uniform weight distribution on the roll simulator the starboard and port side tanks were separated with a watertight center girder and the cross contamination of the water in the tanks was prevented by using separate valves thus the clean water on the starboard side had no effects on the results the compartment rows were numbered from 1 to 8 starting from the bow side to the aft side of the models compartment columns were labeled as a b c from the port side towards the center girder of the models fig 1 in the first phase of the project steel material was used for the simplicity of the model s construction process however it was observed that the effective roughness of the model increased with time due to the corrosion of the material during the experiments according to the ittc quality manual 7 5 01 01 01 models to be used in the tests should comply with the following recommendation the model surface should be smooth and equivalent to that achieved with a 300 to 400 grit wet and dry paper since this recommendation cannot be justified by the actual ship paints when they are used in the models to eliminate the roughness effect of the material the first model model 1 was rebuilt for the benchmark experiments a material which is smooth enough to comply with the ittc recommendations and does not require painting to prevent corrosion was preferred thus the outer shell of the model was built with plexiglass material the interior elements were built with aluminum to decrease the effect of the material thickness on fluid flow through the tiny holes the same materials were used for the second and third models in the later stages the second unit of the experiment system was the roll simulator which the model was placed on this unit was used to provide the regular rolling motion for the simulations of ballast condition voyages of a tanker the rolling motion was provided by a 1 5 kw asynchronous electric motor the third unit in the system was the sediment water mixing tank to prepare a mixture hereinafter will be referred to as a ballast mixture that was used instead of ballast water for ballast condition voyage simulations the tank was designed to keep the water sediment mixture in a homogeneous state until it feeds the ballast tank model the mixer unit was actuated by a 1 5 kw asynchronous electric motor the unit contained two separate blade systems one at the bottom and the other 50 cm above the bottom a pipe circuit in the system was used to fill and drain the ballast tank model with the help of an electric motor and a centrifugal pump the flow direction was provided by a bidirectional valve system 3 2 preparation of ballast mixture the ballast mixture used in the study was prepared to contain 3 5 g l sediment which is about 10 times the normal port scenario linders 2013 and compatible with the condition of the harbors with the high sediment load fettweis et al 2011 the ballast mixture used in the experiments was the water suspension of the bentonite clay industrially manufactured sodium calcium bentonite clay was used for the mixture using commercially available clay instead of sea sediment was convenient not only for practical reasons but also for the replicability of the experiments as different fractions of sea bottom sediments would adversely affect the comparability of the replicate experiments the bentonite clay used in the experiment was manufactured in powder form with particle size less than 2 μm the mixture was prepared by the continuous mixing of bentonite clay and water in the mixing tank 24 h before the experiments the reason for mixing for 24 h is to ensure that the sediment used in the experiments was saturated with water like sediment in the real ballast water the choice of clay size as a sediment substrate was based on the geometric dimension of the particles the clay sized minerals are the fractions of the soil which are below 2 μm this dimension is suitable for the model scale as the size of the bottom apertures of the ballast tank that provide water passage between the compartments decreases from centimeters to millimeters when scaled to the model size so the particle size of the sediment to be used was scaled in such a way that it would not cause more clogging than in real ballast tank conditions bilgin güney et al 2018 on the other hand when scaled up to the real condition particle size 2 μm would correspond to a particle size 40 μm the size was also found compatible with the particle size of the high share of the sediment accumulated in the ballast tanks maglić et al 2016 and suitable for the experiments since it is below the sediment elimination range of most of the commercially available ballast water treatment systems when scaled up to real conditions 3 3 experimental procedure the sediment accumulation pattern which was determined in the first stage bilgin güney et al 2018 formed the basis of the studies carried out in the second and third stages to enable the comparison of the study the experimental procedure applied in the first stage was also applied for the second and third stage experiments as well as the benchmarking experiments table 1 for each stage three consecutive ballast condition voyages of a tanker were simulated with the roll simulator each voyage assumed to have lasted 4 5 days a duration which is reasonable for a voyage between two mediterranean ports ship model motion tests are carried out according to froude s law which states that model motions are proportional to the square root of the model scale artyszuk 2016 considering the model scale used in the experiments which is 20 model time flows 20 4 47 times faster than the real ship time at the beginning of each ballast voyage simulation the ballast tank model was filled up to 90 of its capacity with the ballast mixture through the inlet outlet spout at the rear side of the model the roll simulator was started to simulate the ballast voyage after 24 h simulation corresponding to 108 h of the real voyage the simulator stopped and the ballast mixture was discharged through the same spout at the rear side at the end of the discharge process to ensure maximum unloading volume a 5 trim is provided on the rear side of the model as in the case of the actual unloading condition the simulation of the first voyage ended as the discharge process was completed the second voyage simulation started after filling the ballast tank model up to 90 of its capacity with ballast mixture again the new ballast mixture was taken over the remaining sediment and the simulation of the second voyage was started then the same process was repeated once again the experimental trial was completed after simulating a total of three ballast cycles at the end of the three voyage simulations the wet sediment collected from each compartment was taken into the previously weighed beakers for measuring the dry weight of the sediment residual the only exception was the usage of the pneumatic system within the model 3 at the end of the three voyage simulation set the pneumatic system within the model 3 was operated for 1 min see section 4 2 for details before discharging the ballast mixture prior to the sediment collection in the experimental procedure three consecutive ballast voyages were simulated where the tank is filled up immediately after the discharge at the end of the voyage in reality in most cases after a ballast voyage a loaded voyage starts during this loaded voyage ballast tanks remain empty this provides time for the sediment to dry the drying process depends on the remaining ballast quantity time and temperature as a result the sediment may become more compact and denser depending on the material properties when a new ballast voyage starts the sediment will be accumulated over this denser sediment layer at the bottom consequently it should be noted that the loaded voyages with the drying period for ballast tanks were not considered in this study the uncertainty analysis for the experimental study was also carried out according to the international towing tank conference ittc quality manual 7 5 02 02 02 the uncertainty analysis showed that the error was in the acceptable range when the experiments were conducted with 6 sets of repetitions bilgin güney et al 2018 based on the uncertainty analysis experiments with each model were conducted with at least 6 sets of repetitions to keep the measurement uncertainty close to 10 the evaluations for the models are based on the average values of these 6 repetition sets for each model fig 5 3 4 measuring the dry weight of the sediment accumulated in the tank compartments the amount of the sediment accumulated in each compartment of the tank was determined by measuring the dry weight of the residual in the relevant compartment the residual wet sediment in each compartment was collected in a separate beaker which had been previously weighed each beaker was placed into the oven and dried at a temperature of 103 105 c when the constant weight is obtained the beakers were cooled down to the room temperature in a desiccator the total solids accumulated in each compartment were then determined with the analytic scale by measuring the weight gain of the evaporation residue in the sediment collected from the respective compartments the weight of the sediment depends on its properties thus for this study two non dimensional parameters that are independent of the specific properties of sediment are presented to provide a general perspective on the issue these non dimensional parameters are sediment accumulation rate per loading sapl and sediment reduction rate srr sediment accumulation rate per loading sapl is the percentage of the dry weight of the sediment obtained from each compartment wc to the total sediment loading in the tank wl defined as 3 s a p l w c w l 100 sediment reduction rate srr ij is the reduction percentage of sediment weight in model i to the weight of the sediment in model j given as 4 s r r i j 100 s a p l i s a p l j 100 4 experimental study the benchmark tests of the first stage were conducted with the 1 20 scale model model 1 of a double bottom ballast tank of a typical longitudinal system tanker depending on the findings of the first stage the model design was revised for the second stage the findings in these two stages formed the basis of the third stage and the model was retrofitted with a pneumatic system for reducing the sediment accumulation for better understanding and to easily follow the manuscript this section of the article first describes what has been done at each stage of the study the results of the respective stages are given immediately afterward the results of the benchmark tests showed that the sediment accumulation increases towards the center girder and decreases in the horizontal direction with increasing distance from the center girder fig 6 the total amount of the sediment accumulated in the tank was 32 85 of total loading for the trials out of this total amount 21 3 of sediment accumulated at column c located next to the center girder column c was followed by b and a columns whose shares are 6 22 and 5 36 respectively among the compartments c8 had the biggest share with 4 27 out of the total loading 4 1 the minor physical alterations in ballast tank design and experimental results the preliminary 2d numerical study showed that the flow is almost stationary around the bottom structural elements the experimental studies in the first phase of the project showed that the apertures between the compartments clog during discharge of the ballast mixture and taking measures to facilitate the flow between the compartments could contribute to the reduction of sediment accumulation bilgin güney et al 2018 the clogging problem was also observed during the benchmarking tests the design improvement recommendations of g12 mepc 2012 along with the findings of the first stage and computational analysis were evaluated and the ballast tank model design was revised the contribution of some minor physical alterations the enlargement of the apertures increasing their number and relocation of some apertures to sediment accumulation reduction rate is observed the changes made for the revision were also compatible with the recommendations of prange and pereira 2013 while making these modifications the regulations of the türk loydu rule book for the classification of the ships were considered türk loydu 2020 in order not to compromise security the türk loydu rule book similar to other societies rule books excludes small openings from calculations of the section modulus in certain cases the changes made on model 2 are within these exclusion ranges however the local stresses on the girders in the real ship scale were taken into consideration within this study the critical sections for the girders are the sections where large openings are located from this aspect the aa section on the girder along with the effective plates was taken into consideration fig 7 the section modulus w of the profile is calculated by using the equation 5 w i y where i the moment of inertia of the area y the distance of the center of the area from the neutral axis the relation between the bending stress in the girder σ bending moment m and section modulus w is as follows 6 σ m w in order to find out the effect of opening enlargement on the local stress the ratio of the stresses for the original case σo and modified case σi were compared the ratio of the stresses was calculated as follows 7 σ i σ o m i w i m o w o as all the external conditions of the section remain the same bending moments will remain the same for both cases however in this study the bottom opening h of this section fig 7 is subject to change which also leads to change in section modulus w as a result in this study the bending stress in the girder σ will change only by the section modulus consequently the relation between the bending stresses and section modulus becomes as follows 8 σ i σ o w o w i the parametric change of the stress in the section with the increasing radius of the bottom opening was calculated by using the above relation fig 8 during calculations the radius was increased from the original radius of the opening in the real ship 6 cm to 10 cm the calculations showed that when the bottom opening is increased from 6 cm to 8 cm bending stresses in the girder will increase by 2 4 on the other hand according to the türk loydu rule book the equivalent stress is not to exceed 230 n mm2 while the bending stresses alone in girders are not to exceed 150 n mm2 in practice ship designers design the structural elements to be within the range of 10 20 below the maximum allowable stress ünsan y 1 1 assist prof dr yalçın ünsan istanbul technical university faculty of naval architecture and ocean engineering 34469 istanbul turkey personal communication taking this range to be 15 the bending stresses in girder can be assumed to be taken as 127 5 n mm2 the increment of 2 4 will lead to 130 56 n mm2 which is in the acceptable stress range the second model model 2 had the same main dimensions 1 20 scale model with the first model considering the stress calculation results alterations were made in the holes and apertures that would allow water flow through the compartments lightening holes fig 9 on bottom longitudinals which were located above the bottom in the classical tanker model were attached to the base of the tank in the revised model in this way it is aimed to facilitate transverse transitions within the compartments to facilitate the transitions between the tank compartments in the transverse direction the number of the draining holes on the bottom girders fig 10 was increased and the radii of the draining holes were enlarged in a longitudinal framing system the bottom and inner bottom longitudinals run along the length of the ship within the double bottom piercing the floors through the draining holes to facilitate ballast water transitions in the longitudinal direction the draining holes where the bottom longitudinals pierce through the transverse floors and the drain holes were also enlarged fig 11 and fig 12 the mounting tabs and the assembly lines in figs 9 12 are used for assembling the model these mounting tabs were also revised for the second model to facilitate model manufacturing however this type of installation is not available in real shipbuilding the bottom view of the longitudinal water passageways when the transverse and longitudinal members are mounted to one another is shown in fig 13 and fig 14 for model 1 and model 2 respectively the cutouts labeled as 1 in the figures indicate the holes located where the bottom longitudinals cross the transverse floor elements this alteration provides a larger passageway for transitions between the tank compartments in the longitudinal direction the holes labeled as 2 in the figures indicate the welding cutouts located where the bottom girders cross the transverse floors in model 1 these holes were located only on the transverse floors in the revised model welding cutouts were also placed on the bottom girders in this way 2 dimensional planar cavities were transformed into 3 dimensional spherical voids the mounting tabs of model 2 were relocated to provide this change when the experiment was repeated for the modified model model 2 it was observed that the total accumulated sediment amount in the whole model was 31 14 of total loading the sediment accumulation pattern obtained with model 2 fig 15 showed great similarity with the sediment accumulation pattern of benchmarking tests with model 1 the biggest share of the bottom sediment 21 12 out of total loading accumulated in the center girder zone column c column c was followed by b and a columns whose shares are 5 33 and 4 69 respectively the compartment c8 had the biggest share among all compartments with 3 93 of the total loading after minor physical alterations the fraction of accumulated sediment out of total loading was decreased by 5 18 the srr per compartment is given in fig 16 this figure indicates that the changes such as the enlargement of the apertures increasing their number and relocation of some apertures resulted in remarkable decreases in column a 12 38 and column b 14 26 however there was only a slight decrease in column c 0 72 looking through the compartments it is seen that sediment reduced in all compartments of column a however there were increases in compartments b3 b4 and c1 4 2 the pneumatic cleaning system design and experimental results the preliminary 2d numerical analysis and all experiments carried out with model 1 and model 2 have shown that the center girder area is very critical for sediment deposition on the other hand the experimental results with model 2 show that the structural changes made in the classical model have little effect on reducing sediment accumulation based on the results obtained in the first two stages a pneumatic system was designed to be placed along the center girder to facilitate the removal of sediment from the tank and reduce sediment accumulation this system is adapted to model 3 which is based on the geometric properties of model 2 the pneumatic system consists of a compressor and a pipe circuit adjacent to the center girder the system consists of 6 mm diameter pipes that go down to 2 mm above the bottom of the tank this pipe circuit is shown in green in fig 17 and fig 18 the procedure applied in the experiments performed with the two previous models was repeated for the experiments with model 3 additionally at the end of the three voyage simulation of each set just before the roll simulator was stopped the pneumatic system was operated for 1 min and the air was delivered at a 5 bar pressure from the air inlet located in the middle of the center girder fig 17 the discharge valves were turned off during the airflow the roll simulator and the compressor were stopped at the end of 1 min and then de ballasting was started the total accumulated sediment amount in model 3 was 18 17 of the total sediment loading similar to model 1 and model 2 the center girder zone column c had the biggest share with 9 36 out of total loading and column c was followed by b and a columns whose shares are 4 87 and 3 95 respectively with 1 69 of the total loading compartment c8 had the biggest share among all compartments fig 19 the total sediment reduction in the tank was found to be 41 68 and by 44 66 respectively compared to model 2 and model 1 the srr per compartment in model 3 compared with model 2 is given in fig 20 the figure shows that 15 92 of the decrease was in column a 8 71 of the decrease was in column b on the other hand there are increases in the compartments in the 6th 7th rows of a and 6th 7th and 8th rows in b columns fig 21 shows the srr per compartment in model 3 compared with model 1 the figure indicates that reduction was achieved in all compartments most of the reduction in sediment occurred in column c with a rate of 56 the decrease in column c was followed by columns a and b with a rate of 26 33 and 21 72 respectively 5 discussion the experiments and the 2d numerical analysis have shown that the most important regions to be considered in terms of sediment accumulation in the ballast tanks are those adjacent to the center girder this is compatible with the in tank flow pattern during tank rolling motion dead zones occur where the flow slows and or halts causing sediment deposition the physics of fluid flow inside the rolling tanks is complex boundary layer formation in the near wall region presents strong gradients and nonlinear velocity profiles due to viscous effects which in turn can influence the global flow pattern in the tanks in the boundary layer the tangential velocity fluctuation is decreased due to the viscous damping and the normal velocity fluctuation is stopped during the rolling motion of a tank filled with water the water at the sides and bottom of the compartments move more slowly than the rest of the water in the compartment due to the boundary layer effect the water pushed towards the sides of the compartments forms a pressure gradient such that the pressure rises towards the direction of the exterior of the tank after reaching the sides of the compartment the displaced water moves downward and when it reaches the bottom of the tank and encounters relatively slow moving water there it is pushed towards the center girder of the tank once the water reaches the center girder it is forced upwards and this cycle continues repeatedly this phenomenon is also observed during numerical analysis wall shear stress is a flow parameter that can play an important role in sediment transport and can be treated as a criterion for the sedimentation of suspended particles in the tanks the wall shear stress is determined by the velocity gradient near the wall 9 τ w μ u y y 0 where μ is the dynamic viscosity u is the flow velocity parallel to the wall and y is the distance to the wall the shields number is the nondimensionalized shear stress denoted by τ and it is used to calculate the initiation of motion of sediment in a fluid flow it is given by 10 τ τ ρ s ρ g d where τ is the dimensional shear stress ρs is the density of the sediment ρ is the density of the fluid g is the gravitational acceleration d is a characteristic particle diameter of the sediment the shields number is proportional to the ratio of fluid force acting on the particle to the weight of the particle low shear stress thus low shields number corresponds to the particle deposition zones the existence of secondary flow near the corners of the tank walls changes the flow parameters locally and creates a zone with a low value of wall shear stress and foster sediment deposition marin et al 2016 vidal et al 2017 yi 2017 the sediment deposition observed during the experiments conducted in this study clearly verifies this rule the sediment behavior observed in the tank is a result of the formation of the boundary layer along the sidewalls and bottom of the compartments the sediment in the water is too heavy to be lifted by the upstream flow in the tank but they are caught in the flow in the tank and are directed towards the center girder of the tank and accumulate there bilgin güney et al 2018 jung et al 2015 in terms of sediment accumulation the results obtained in the previous stage bilgin güney et al 2018 and the present results are compatible the results of both stages and the preliminary numerical analysis show that the region around the center girder is the most susceptible zone in a longitudinally framed double bottom ballast tank when the design improvement recommendations of g12 mepc 2012 which are applicable in the model scale were realized in the second stage the results fig 22 show that total sediment reduction in the tank obtained by minor alterations in the tank design is below the uncertainty range bilgin güney et al 2018 of the experiments and is numerically insignificant the sediment accumulation rate per loading sapl in the compartments of all three models are given in fig 23 in all three models more deposition is observed towards the rear wall of the tank model where the outlet is located this is not unexpected as the tank is given a 5 trim towards the end of the de ballasting process to provide maximum discharge when the holes are enlarged in model 2 the sediment is mobilized and transported both towards the rear end and the center girder causing less sediment deposition in the compartments far away from the rear end compared to model 1 in model 3 a pneumatic cleaning system is integrated into model 2 the pneumatic cleaning system drastically reduces the sediment accumulation in all compartments fig 23 guidelines g12 mepc 2012 and prange and pereira 2013 have suggested that some minor structural changes can result in sediment reduction in the ballast tanks however the modifications such as enlargement and repositioning of some holes made in this study provide only a little reduction in the total sediment amount although this reduction can be considered numerically insignificant the reduction observed in columns a and b is remarkable fig 23 this shows that enlargement of the holes helps the sediment to easily flow through the holes and facilitates the accumulation of the sediment around the center girder this structural design arrangement again makes the central girder the most critical region on the other hand the pneumatic cleaning system used in model 3 reduces the total sediment deposition in the ballast tank by 41 when used alone while it reduces the total sediment deposition in the ballast tank by 45 with the structural changes in model 2 fig 24 it was observed that even though the structural changes applied in model 2 does not have a significant effect on the total sediment reduction they increased the efficiency of the pneumatic system by directing the sediment towards the center girder prange and pereira 2013 also proposed water injection against the bottom of the ballast tanks in order to stir the accumulated sediment upward for resuspension suspension of sediment by water injection was also used by yuan et al 2017 on a laboratory scale the system proposed by yuan et al 2017 was based on the circulation of ballast water in the ballast tanks following the suspension by water injection in their proposed system there is a pipeline spread to the bottom of the tank with this pipeline they aim to circulate ballast water in the tank while mobilizing the deposited sediment and moving the sediment away from the tank with a hydro cyclone filter in their system the need for circulation increases energy consumption yuan et al 2017 when the proposed pneumatic cleaning system is applied to ships the accumulated sediment in the ballast tanks will be re suspended just before the discharge of the ballast water by a unidirectional pipe circuit that is to be adapted to the existing compressors air tubes without any additional machinery equipment the sediment will be re suspended by delivering air pressure in the liquid for short time intervals prior to de ballasting thus most of the sediment will be discharged directly from the tanks with the discharged water without significant energy consumption operating the pneumatic system before de ballasting operations on a regular basis would decrease the amount of the sediment to be managed furthermore when necessary the system can be supported by integrating a mechanical separation unit at the outlet of the de ballasting system 6 conclusion this study shows that to be effective in reducing sediment accumulation in the ballast tanks it is important to take measures along the center girder where the sediment buildup is highest structural modifications such as enlargement and repositioning of bottom holes on the structural elements are not enough to significantly reduce the total sediment amount in the ballast tanks however these modifications mobilize the sediment in the compartments and drive them towards the center girder contributing to more sediment deposition around the center girder during the rolling motion which is the most common oscillatory motion that a ship encounters to reduce the total sediment amount that will be left after de ballasting a pneumatic cleaning system targeting the center girder is designed and proposed in this manuscript the reduction in sediment accumulation provided by the designed system is strikingly larger than the value of the uncertainty analysis performed previously and thus it is numerically significant the proposed pneumatic system is easy to integrate into existing ship systems it is a pipe system that is connected to a compressor air tubes which already exists in the ships and runs along the center girder branching in each compartment around the center girder although the system is located along the center girder air pressure provided by the compressor re suspends the sediment accumulated at the bottom in all compartments of the tank the system will be working for short time intervals prior to de ballasting and will not cause a significant increase in the energy consumption of ships as it does not need a continuous circulation of ballast water according to the bwm convention amendments all ships should meet the d 2 standards by 8 september 2024 the ballast water management systems will be installed to existing ships through retrofit projects by that date the proposed pneumatic cleaning system can be adapted to retrofit projects to ensure the compliance of the system with the convention by reducing the sediment accumulation this study shows that the mobilization and reduction of sediments through re suspension can be achieved by injecting air to ballast tanks however as future work this system should be designed targeting the specific needs structure and operational conditions of ships ship types and dimensions are important for pneumatic system optimization thus the geometry of the nozzle and its location in the tank should be optimized considering the properties of the ship moreover the properties and amount of sediment accumulated in the ballast tanks depend on the navigational characteristics the frequency of pneumatic system usage the air delivery duration and the pressure of the air to be delivered should be optimized depending on the ship specific navigational characteristics in this study the ship s loaded voyage without ballast was not considered while optimizing the pressure of the system it should be considered that the sediment will dry up and become more concentrated during these voyages the vibrational effects of the system on the whole ship structure are not investigated in the scope of this project as it was not reliable to measure these effects in the model scale since the model manufacturing techniques and the materials used differ from the real ships it will be beneficial to study these effects before scaling up credit authorship contribution statement ceren bilgin güney conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing review

21921,ballast tank sediments host organisms that pose invasion risk even if the ships are installed with ballast treatment systems the bottom sediments also contribute to corrosion and cause cumulative deadweight loss over the years this study presents the outcomes of the project conceptual ballast tank design for reducing sediment accumulation tubitak grant no 115y740 in the published first phase of the project sediment accumulation pattern was determined and the center girder was found to be critical in this study the findings of the second and third phases are presented in the second phase the tank model design was revised aiming to reduce total sediment accumulation the contribution of this revision was found to be is numerically insignificant however this revision drove more sediment towards the center girder thus in the third phase a pneumatic cleaning system targeting the center girder was designed to mobilize water to suspend sediment and facilitate discharge from the tank the pneumatic cleaning system reduced the total sediment deposition in the ballast tank up to 45 operating the pneumatic system before de ballasting operations on a regular basis would decrease the amount of sediment to be managed reduce the invasion risk tank corrosion and cumulative deadweight loss keywords ballast tank design sediment reduction pneumatic cleaning system invasive species 1 introduction ballast water is an integral element of safe shipping however the living organisms in the ballast tanks have in different aspects been an important issue for the academic world and different stakeholders of marine transportation within the last four decades following the recognition of the translocation of organisms along with the ballast water carlton 1985 medcof 1975 there have been great number of studies on identifying the organisms which are translocated within the ballast tanks bailey 2015 chu e tam fung chen 1997 davidson and simkanin 2012 gollasch et al 2015

organization imo has focused on the ballast water organism problem since the 1990s and finally adopted the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments bwm convention on 03 february 2004 the bwm requires all relevant vessels to manage their ballast water to meet either d 1 ballast water exchange standard or d 2 performance standard for most of the ships it can only be achieved through ballast water treatment with a designated time table imo 2004 however the time table has been exceeded before the bwm convention entered into force on september 8 2017 therefore the bwm convention s implementation timetable for existing ships has been postponed two years by the imo marine environment protection committee mepc according to the amendments all existing vessels are required to comply with the d 2 standards on a date to be determined according to the age and international oil pollution prevention iopp renewal surveys from 8 september 2019 to 8 september 2024 mepc 2018a on the other hand certain requirements of the bwm convention including ballast water management for all ships and the d 2 standard for new ships are now in force the bwm convention requires the treatment systems to be installed to have a type approval certificate in accordance with guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems guidelines g8 the revised guidelines g8 have been converted into mandatory code for approval of ballast water management systems bwms code at the 72nd session of mepc mepc 2018b there are more than 70 type approved systems which make use of different treatment methods available and each system has limitation depending on the technologies used and the properties of the ballast water hess erga et al 2019 jing et al 2012 tsolaki and diamadopoulos 2010 on the other hand ballast water is not the only habitat in ballast tanks but bottom sediment is an important habitat as well it is not possible to completely empty the ballast tanks of the ships anything that settles from the water column within the ballast tanks is susceptible to deposition in the sediment at the bottom of ballast tanks the studies on ballast sediment underline the necessity of efficient management of ballast tank sediment not only for protecting the marine environment but also human health as well the bottom sediment may host a diverse array of active and dormant stages of marine organisms and microorganisms including pathogens bailey et al 2007 brinkmeyer 2016 briski et al 2012 gollasch et al 2018 mimura et al 2005 sutherland and levings 2013 many invertebrates phytoplankton including toxic dinoflagellates protozoan and bacterial species have the capability of producing resting stages in their life cycles and when organisms are at their resting stage they have extremely high resistance to harsh conditions including noxious chemicals and capability of germination when the conditions get favorable johengen et al 2005 the ability of many sediment organisms to produce resting stages ensures the long term viability and this reduces the ballast water treatment efficacy hallegraeff 2015 the recent studies focusing on ballast sediment show that there are more organisms than those that have already been reported and a considerable number of these newly identified organisms are harmful and pose an ecological or public health risks the study by shang et al increased the number of fully identified dinoflagellate species from ballast tank sediments by more than 50 shang et al 2019 besides lv et al have identified high abundance of diverse antibiotic resistance genes and human pathogens in ballast sediment lv et al 2018 in addition to providing habitat to organisms the sediment of the ballast tank may contain heavy metals feng et al 2017 maglić et al 2016 and disinfection byproducts banerji et al 2012 the biotic and abiotic content of the ballast sediment gives rise to the need for managing sediment with careful and proper removal storage and disposal procedures maglić et al 2017 the bwm convention also necessitates parties to provide adequate facilities for the reception of sediments in ports and terminals where cleaning or repairing of ballast tanks take place imo 2004 the sediment removal should be undertaken under controlled conditions guidelines for sediment reception facilities g1 have been developed by mepc to support the proper management of the sediment mepc 2006 the uscg ballast water discharge standards final rule which along with the imo bwm convention is also one of the two predominant legislations around the globe brings about stringent requirements for sediment management uscg 2012 the amount of the sediment depends on the type capacity age and operation characteristics of the vessels however this amount may reach up to 100s of tons hamer 2002 johengen et al 2005 the accumulation of such amount of weight would not only cause loss of cargo capacity in ships which will in return cause a cumulative loss of income through the years but also the microbial content of the ballast sediment increases corrosion risk heyer et al 2013 most of the ballast water management has the primary treatment stage which employs filters if installed onboard a ship these systems would reduce the amount of the sediment to be accumulated to a degree but will not be sufficient to eliminate the sediment completely the typical backwash filters used in these systems are limited to particle size larger than 40 50 μm due to optimal operating conditions however the ballast tank sediment is mostly below this limit and is in the clay 2 μm or less and silt 2 63 μm form maglić et al 2017 2016 the flow regime in the ballast tanks has an important effect on the sediment deposition the complex geometry of the double bottom ballast tanks due to longitudinal and transversal structural members results in a complex flow regime during ballasting and de ballasting operation many dead spots with very low local flow velocities which are susceptible to sediment accumulation occur during these operations the geometry of the ballast tanks and position of the inlet outlet qi and eames 2015 qi et al 2014 wilson et al 2006 affect the sedimentation pattern and the flushing efficacy the sedimentation pattern within the tank also differs by the proximity of the location to the bell mouth ballast intake pump out port and openings on the tank members sturtevant et al 2007 regulation b 5 of the bwm convention states that ships should be designed and constructed

designing ships to minimize the retention of sediment mepc 2012 in their technical paper prange and pereira 2013 propose some simple modifications in ballast tanks to reduce the amount of the bottom sediment prange and pereira 2013 these simple modifications include modification in the de ballasting system some minor alterations in the tank design and injection of water against the bottom of tanks yuan et al also proposes a flushing system to re suspend the accumulated sediments at the bottom and circulate it through a hydro cyclone for separating yuan et al 2017 the present study reports the outcomes of the conceptual ballast tank design for reducing sediment accumulation project which was supported by the scientific and technical research council of turkey tubitak grant no 115y740 the overall project was conducted in three stages the main objective of the first stage was to observe the accumulation characteristics of the sediment in a conventional tanker double bottom ballast tank for this purpose a preliminary 2 d numerical analysis was conducted for defining potential accumulation zones where the flow halts and several experimental studies were conducted with a conventional tanker double bottom ballast tank model constructed at a laboratory scale within the scope of the first stage the sediment accumulation pattern through the tank model was determined

for the second stage the design improvement recommendations of g12 mepc 2012 along with the findings of the first stage were evaluated to revise the model design to reduce sediment accumulation without compromising security the changes made in the design aimed to facilitate the ballast water transport between the compartments the contribution of these structural changes to reducing accumulation has been examined experimentally in the second stage at the final stage based on the findings of the first two stages a pneumatic system was designed to mobilize water to reduce sediment build up and facilitate discharge from the tank this system was adapted to the design of the second model this manuscript includes the results of the 2 d numerical analysis benchmark tests with the conventional ballast tank model and presents the findings of the second and the third stages of the project 2 definition of the problem and preliminary computational analysis the ships have six degrees of freedom however the sediment motion would be dominantly triggered by the rotational and oscillatory motions among the rotational motions only rolling and pitching are purely oscillatory as they are acting under restoring force or moment das et al 2008 on the other hand as the response amplitude operator of pitch motion is rather weak compared to the roll motions response amplitude operator bertram 2012 the effect of pitch motion is neglected in this study as a first approach a preliminary 2d computational analysis was conducted to investigate the flow characteristics inside a ballast tank when the ship is subjected to the roll motion and to predict potential dead zones that are susceptible to sediment accumulation the numerical analysis was bounded by the roll motion only in 3 4 sea state beaufort number 4 5 condition which is a common condition for sea state bialystocki and konovessis 2016 with the roll angle φ 5 and the rolling period t 15 65 s the computational analysis performed on a 1 20 scale model of a longitudinally framed tanker double bottom ballast tank with the structural elements fig 1 to obtain the flow characteristics in the ballast tank an open source cfd solver which is based on the lattice boltzmann method lbm was used lattice boltzmann method is a meshless simulation method for cfd problems which involves complex geometries chen and doolen 1998 since the ballast tank geometry includes several structural elements and subjected to an oscillatory motion the problem requires a large number of grid discretization in conventional flow solvers and special treatment to handle the motion of the tank briefly lbm focuses on fictive particles and computes propagation of collision of those particles over the lattice mesh on the contrary conventional cfd methods first solve the conservation equations on the macroscopic scale lbm method depends on collision and streaming steps collision step 1 f i x t δ t f i x t f i e q x t f i x t τ f where ρ x t is the density of the fluid and x is the position and t is the time f i i 0 a components of the lattice f i e q x t is the equilibrium density along the direction i τ f is the timescale where the fluid reaches an equilibrium state locally streaming step 2 f i x e i t 1 f i x t where e i denotes the velocity of the fluid at time t and the next time step t 1 the position of the fluid will be x e i a 2d section of the ballast tank and lattice distribution can be seen in fig 2 along with center plane cl and bilge computations were carried out for 40 s of a simulation which covers more than 10 cycles of the model motion after 3 cycles of the motion computation converges and motion of the fluid shows the same behavior steady state at the same position of the cyclic motion stages of the tank motion after the flow in the tank reaches its steady state condition are given in fig 3 with 9 equal time intervals in one period of the cycle the stages of the motion can be summarized as follows 1 the tank passes through its initial position 2 the tank makes approximately 2 5⁰ heel to the starboard flow moves towards the outside of the tank 3 the tank reaches 5⁰ of heel angle to the starboard an eddy at the bilge is observed velocity magnitudes near the center plane cl are smaller than that of the bilge area tank s roll motion is directed to the port side the flow starts moving through the center plane an eddy becomes visible near the center plane flow is almost stationary at the bottom of the tank near the center plane 4 the tank passes through its initial position again motion is directed to the port side flow accelerates through the center plane the eddy near the center plane becomes more visible the eddy at the bilge area sweeps the tank bottom thoroughly 5 the tank reaches 2 5⁰ heel to the port the eddy near the center plane becomes more dominant flow is still stationary at the bottom of the tank 6 the tank reaches 5⁰ heel to the port the roll motion will be directed towards the starboard two large eddies are observed near the center plane these eddies decelerate the flow to the side of the tank 7 the tank makes 2 5⁰ heel to the port the roll motion is directed to the starboard the motion of the fluid decelerated by the two eddies observed near the center plane 8 the tank makes a 5⁰ heel to the port the roll motion is directed to the starboard the eddies observed near the center plane become more dominant and decelerate the flow 9 the tank reaches its initial position again the similarity between the 1st and 9th stages shows that the computation has reached its steady state condition at the end of the computational analysis it was observed that the bilge area was swept by the eddies during the roll motion also flow accelerated towards the center plane but decelerated towards bilge it is worth noting that when focusing on areas near the central plane the flow was almost stationary around the bottom longitudinals and more sediment accumulation could be expected near the center plane according to the flow characteristics consequently it was observed that all the structural elements affect the flow in the tank and have a contribution to the sediment accumulation in light of these deductions an experimental study designed in order to observe the detailed effects of these structural elements on the sediment accumulation and to determine the precautions to be taken for decreasing the accumulation amount 3 experiment preparation and methods an experimental study to simulate the ballast condition of a tanker in the roll motion the roll angle φ 5 rolling period t 15 65 s was designed the details of the experimental study are given in the following sections 3 1 the experimental system the experimental system consists of three units a roll simulator to provide roll motion a ballast tank model and a mixing tank for preparation of ballast mixture fig 4 these three units were employed in all three stages of the project in the third stage an air compressor and a pipe system were integrated into the experimental system for mobilizing the sediment the ballast tank model was placed in the center of the system as the main unit three different models were used during the project and the design of the model depended on the stage of the experiments all of the three ballast tank models were constructed as a 1 20 scale model of a longitudinally framed tanker double bottom ballast tank structure fig 1 the first model model 1 was the scaled model of the double bottom ballast tank of a real tanker on service small holes and openings to allow water to flow through the compartments of the tank model were also available at the same location and in the same number but in scaled dimensions as the actual tanker the changes in the other models model 2 and model 3 will be explained in detail in the respective section of the manuscript each model contained all the main components available in a real tanker double bottom the models were separated longitudinally by a continuous center girder each model contained port side and starboard side tanks the tanks had 8 stations and 24 compartments sectioned by transversal floors and longitudinal girders for the experiments presented in this study the ballast mixture was filled only to the port side tanks the starboard side of the model was not used for the experiments it was filled with plain water only to provide the uniform weight distribution on the roll simulator the starboard and port side tanks were separated with a watertight center girder and the cross contamination of the water in the tanks was prevented by using separate valves thus the clean water on the starboard side had no effects on the results the compartment rows were numbered from 1 to 8 starting from the bow side to the aft side of the models compartment columns were labeled as a b c from the port side towards the center girder of the models fig 1 in the first phase of the project steel material was used for the simplicity of the model s construction process however it was observed that the effective roughness of the model increased with time due to the corrosion of the material during the experiments according to the ittc quality manual 7 5 01 01 01 models to be used in the tests should comply with the following recommendation the model surface should be smooth and equivalent to that achieved with a 300 to 400 grit wet and dry paper since this recommendation cannot be justified by the actual ship paints when they are used in the models to eliminate the roughness effect of the material the first model model 1 was rebuilt for the benchmark experiments a material which is smooth enough to comply with the ittc recommendations and does not require painting to prevent corrosion was preferred thus the outer shell of the model was built with plexiglass material the interior elements were built with aluminum to decrease the effect of the material thickness on fluid flow through the tiny holes the same materials were used for the second and third models in the later stages the second unit of the experiment system was the roll simulator which the model was placed on this unit was used to provide the regular rolling motion for the simulations of ballast condition voyages of a tanker the rolling motion was provided by a 1 5 kw asynchronous electric motor the third unit in the system was the sediment water mixing tank to prepare a mixture hereinafter will be referred to as a ballast mixture that was used instead of ballast water for ballast condition voyage simulations the tank was designed to keep the water sediment mixture in a homogeneous state until it feeds the ballast tank model the mixer unit was actuated by a 1 5 kw asynchronous electric motor the unit contained two separate blade systems one at the bottom and the other 50 cm above the bottom a pipe circuit in the system was used to fill and drain the ballast tank model with the help of an electric motor and a centrifugal pump the flow direction was provided by a bidirectional valve system 3 2 preparation of ballast mixture the ballast mixture used in the study was prepared to contain 3 5 g l sediment which is about 10 times the normal port scenario linders 2013 and compatible with the condition of the harbors with the high sediment load fettweis et al 2011 the ballast mixture used in the experiments was the water suspension of the bentonite clay industrially manufactured sodium calcium bentonite clay was used for the mixture using commercially available clay instead of sea sediment was convenient not only for practical reasons but also for the replicability of the experiments as different fractions of sea bottom sediments would adversely affect the comparability of the replicate experiments the bentonite clay used in the experiment was manufactured in powder form with particle size less than 2 μm the mixture was prepared by the continuous mixing of bentonite clay and water in the mixing tank 24 h before the experiments the reason for mixing for 24 h is to ensure that the sediment used in the experiments was saturated with water like sediment in the real ballast water the choice of clay size as a sediment substrate was based on the geometric dimension of the particles the clay sized minerals are the fractions of the soil which are below 2 μm this dimension is suitable for the model scale as the size of the bottom apertures of the ballast tank that provide water passage between the compartments decreases from centimeters to millimeters when scaled to the model size so the particle size of the sediment to be used was scaled in such a way that it would not cause more clogging than in real ballast tank conditions bilgin güney et al 2018 on the other hand when scaled up to the real condition particle size 2 μm would correspond to a particle size 40 μm the size was also found compatible with the particle size of the high share of the sediment accumulated in the ballast tanks maglić et al 2016 and suitable for the experiments since it is below the sediment elimination range of most of the commercially available ballast water treatment systems when scaled up to real conditions 3 3 experimental procedure the sediment accumulation pattern which was determined in the first stage bilgin güney et al 2018 formed the basis of the studies carried out in the second and third stages to enable the comparison of the study the experimental procedure applied in the first stage was also applied for the second and third stage experiments as well as the benchmarking experiments table 1 for each stage three consecutive ballast condition voyages of a tanker were simulated with the roll simulator each voyage assumed to have lasted 4 5 days a duration which is reasonable for a voyage between two mediterranean ports ship model motion tests are carried out according to froude s law which states that model motions are proportional to the square root of the model scale artyszuk 2016 considering the model scale used in the experiments which is 20 model time flows 20 4 47 times faster than the real ship time at the beginning of each ballast voyage simulation the ballast tank model was filled up to 90 of its capacity with the ballast mixture through the inlet outlet spout at the rear side of the model the roll simulator was started to simulate the ballast voyage after 24 h simulation corresponding to 108 h of the real voyage the simulator stopped and the ballast mixture was discharged through the same spout at the rear side at the end of the discharge process to ensure maximum unloading volume a 5 trim is provided on the rear side of the model as in the case of the actual unloading condition the simulation of the first voyage ended as the discharge process was completed the second voyage simulation started after filling the ballast tank model up to 90 of its capacity with ballast mixture again the new ballast mixture was taken over the remaining sediment and the simulation of the second voyage was started then the same process was repeated once again the experimental trial was completed after simulating a total of three ballast cycles at the end of the three voyage simulations the wet sediment collected from each compartment was taken into the previously weighed beakers for measuring the dry weight of the sediment residual the only exception was the usage of the pneumatic system within the model 3 at the end of the three voyage simulation set the pneumatic system within the model 3 was operated for 1 min see section 4 2 for details before discharging the ballast mixture prior to the sediment collection in the experimental procedure three consecutive ballast voyages were simulated where the tank is filled up immediately after the discharge at the end of the voyage in reality in most cases after a ballast voyage a loaded voyage starts during this loaded voyage ballast tanks remain empty this provides time for the sediment to dry the drying process depends on the remaining ballast quantity time and temperature as a result the sediment may become more compact and denser depending on the material properties when a new ballast voyage starts the sediment will be accumulated over this denser sediment layer at the bottom consequently it should be noted that the loaded voyages with the drying period for ballast tanks were not considered in this study the uncertainty analysis for the experimental study was also carried out according to the international towing tank conference ittc quality manual 7 5 02 02 02 the uncertainty analysis showed that the error was in the acceptable range when the experiments were conducted with 6 sets of repetitions bilgin güney et al 2018 based on the uncertainty analysis experiments with each model were conducted with at least 6 sets of repetitions to keep the measurement uncertainty close to 10 the evaluations for the models are based on the average values of these 6 repetition sets for each model fig 5 3 4 measuring the dry weight of the sediment accumulated in the tank compartments the amount of the sediment accumulated in each compartment of the tank was determined by measuring the dry weight of the residual in the relevant compartment the residual wet sediment in each compartment was collected in a separate beaker which had been previously weighed each beaker was placed into the oven and dried at a temperature of 103 105 c when the constant weight is obtained the beakers were cooled down to the room temperature in a desiccator the total solids accumulated in each compartment were then determined with the analytic scale by measuring the weight gain of the evaporation residue in the sediment collected from the respective compartments the weight of the sediment depends on its properties thus for this study two non dimensional parameters that are independent of the specific properties of sediment are presented to provide a general perspective on the issue these non dimensional parameters are sediment accumulation rate per loading sapl and sediment reduction rate srr sediment accumulation rate per loading sapl is the percentage of the dry weight of the sediment obtained from each compartment wc to the total sediment loading in the tank wl defined as 3 s a p l w c w l 100 sediment reduction rate srr ij is the reduction percentage of sediment weight in model i to the weight of the sediment in model j given as 4 s r r i j 100 s a p l i s a p l j 100 4 experimental study the benchmark tests of the first stage were conducted with the 1 20 scale model model 1 of a double bottom ballast tank of a typical longitudinal system tanker depending on the findings of the first stage the model design was revised for the second stage the findings in these two stages formed the basis of the third stage and the model was retrofitted with a pneumatic system for reducing the sediment accumulation for better understanding and to easily follow the manuscript this section of the article first describes what has been done at each stage of the study the results of the respective stages are given immediately afterward the results of the benchmark tests showed that the sediment accumulation increases towards the center girder and decreases in the horizontal direction with increasing distance from the center girder fig 6 the total amount of the sediment accumulated in the tank was 32 85 of total loading for the trials out of this total amount 21 3 of sediment accumulated at column c located next to the center girder column c was followed by b and a columns whose shares are 6 22 and 5 36 respectively among the compartments c8 had the biggest share with 4 27 out of the total loading 4 1 the minor physical alterations in ballast tank design and experimental results the preliminary 2d numerical study showed that the flow is almost stationary around the bottom structural elements the experimental studies in the first phase of the project showed that the apertures between the compartments clog during discharge of the ballast mixture and taking measures to facilitate the flow between the compartments could contribute to the reduction of sediment accumulation bilgin güney et al 2018 the clogging problem was also observed during the benchmarking tests the design improvement recommendations of g12 mepc 2012 along with the findings of the first stage and computational analysis were evaluated and the ballast tank model design was revised the contribution of some minor physical alterations the enlargement of the apertures increasing their number and relocation of some apertures to sediment accumulation reduction rate is observed the changes made for the revision were also compatible with the recommendations of prange and pereira 2013 while making these modifications the regulations of the türk loydu rule book for the classification of the ships were considered türk loydu 2020 in order not to compromise security the türk loydu rule book similar to other societies rule books excludes small openings from calculations of the section modulus in certain cases the changes made on model 2 are within these exclusion ranges however the local stresses on the girders in the real ship scale were taken into consideration within this study the critical sections for the girders are the sections where large openings are located from this aspect the aa section on the girder along with the effective plates was taken into consideration fig 7 the section modulus w of the profile is calculated by using the equation 5 w i y where i the moment of inertia of the area y the distance of the center of the area from the neutral axis the relation between the bending stress in the girder σ bending moment m and section modulus w is as follows 6 σ m w in order to find out the effect of opening enlargement on the local stress the ratio of the stresses for the original case σo and modified case σi were compared the ratio of the stresses was calculated as follows 7 σ i σ o m i w i m o w o as all the external conditions of the section remain the same bending moments will remain the same for both cases however in this study the bottom opening h of this section fig 7 is subject to change which also leads to change in section modulus w as a result in this study the bending stress in the girder σ will change only by the section modulus consequently the relation between the bending stresses and section modulus becomes as follows 8 σ i σ o w o w i the parametric change of the stress in the section with the increasing radius of the bottom opening was calculated by using the above relation fig 8 during calculations the radius was increased from the original radius of the opening in the real ship 6 cm to 10 cm the calculations showed that when the bottom opening is increased from 6 cm to 8 cm bending stresses in the girder will increase by 2 4 on the other hand according to the türk loydu rule book the equivalent stress is not to exceed 230 n mm2 while the bending stresses alone in girders are not to exceed 150 n mm2 in practice ship designers design the structural elements to be within the range of 10 20 below the maximum allowable stress ünsan y 1 1 assist prof dr yalçın ünsan istanbul technical university faculty of naval architecture and ocean engineering 34469 istanbul turkey personal communication taking this range to be 15 the bending stresses in girder can be assumed to be taken as 127 5 n mm2 the increment of 2 4 will lead to 130 56 n mm2 which is in the acceptable stress range the second model model 2 had the same main dimensions 1 20 scale model with the first model considering the stress calculation results alterations were made in the holes and apertures that would allow water flow through the compartments lightening holes fig 9 on bottom longitudinals which were located above the bottom in the classical tanker model were attached to the base of the tank in the revised model in this way it is aimed to facilitate transverse transitions within the compartments to facilitate the transitions between the tank compartments in the transverse direction the number of the draining holes on the bottom girders fig 10 was increased and the radii of the draining holes were enlarged in a longitudinal framing system the bottom and inner bottom longitudinals run along the length of the ship within the double bottom piercing the floors through the draining holes to facilitate ballast water transitions in the longitudinal direction the draining holes where the bottom longitudinals pierce through the transverse floors and the drain holes were also enlarged fig 11 and fig 12 the mounting tabs and the assembly lines in figs 9 12 are used for assembling the model these mounting tabs were also revised for the second model to facilitate model manufacturing however this type of installation is not available in real shipbuilding the bottom view of the longitudinal water passageways when the transverse and longitudinal members are mounted to one another is shown in fig 13 and fig 14 for model 1 and model 2 respectively the cutouts labeled as 1 in the figures indicate the holes located where the bottom longitudinals cross the transverse floor elements this alteration provides a larger passageway for transitions between the tank compartments in the longitudinal direction the holes labeled as 2 in the figures indicate the welding cutouts located where the bottom girders cross the transverse floors in model 1 these holes were located only on the transverse floors in the revised model welding cutouts were also placed on the bottom girders in this way 2 dimensional planar cavities were transformed into 3 dimensional spherical voids the mounting tabs of model 2 were relocated to provide this change when the experiment was repeated for the modified model model 2 it was observed that the total accumulated sediment amount in the whole model was 31 14 of total loading the sediment accumulation pattern obtained with model 2 fig 15 showed great similarity with the sediment accumulation pattern of benchmarking tests with model 1 the biggest share of the bottom sediment 21 12 out of total loading accumulated in the center girder zone column c column c was followed by b and a columns whose shares are 5 33 and 4 69 respectively the compartment c8 had the biggest share among all compartments with 3 93 of the total loading after minor physical alterations the fraction of accumulated sediment out of total loading was decreased by 5 18 the srr per compartment is given in fig 16 this figure indicates that the changes such as the enlargement of the apertures increasing their number and relocation of some apertures resulted in remarkable decreases in column a 12 38 and column b 14 26 however there was only a slight decrease in column c 0 72 looking through the compartments it is seen that sediment reduced in all compartments of column a however there were increases in compartments b3 b4 and c1 4 2 the pneumatic cleaning system design and experimental results the preliminary 2d numerical analysis and all experiments carried out with model 1 and model 2 have shown that the center girder area is very critical for sediment deposition on the other hand the experimental results with model 2 show that the structural changes made in the classical model have little effect on reducing sediment accumulation based on the results obtained in the first two stages a pneumatic system was designed to be placed along the center girder to facilitate the removal of sediment from the tank and reduce sediment accumulation this system is adapted to model 3 which is based on the geometric properties of model 2 the pneumatic system consists of a compressor and a pipe circuit adjacent to the center girder the system consists of 6 mm diameter pipes that go down to 2 mm above the bottom of the tank this pipe circuit is shown in green in fig 17 and fig 18 the procedure applied in the experiments performed with the two previous models was repeated for the experiments with model 3 additionally at the end of the three voyage simulation of each set just before the roll simulator was stopped the pneumatic system was operated for 1 min and the air was delivered at a 5 bar pressure from the air inlet located in the middle of the center girder fig 17 the discharge valves were turned off during the airflow the roll simulator and the compressor were stopped at the end of 1 min and then de ballasting was started the total accumulated sediment amount in model 3 was 18 17 of the total sediment loading similar to model 1 and model 2 the center girder zone column c had the biggest share with 9 36 out of total loading and column c was followed by b and a columns whose shares are 4 87 and 3 95 respectively with 1 69 of the total loading compartment c8 had the biggest share among all compartments fig 19 the total sediment reduction in the tank was found to be 41 68 and by 44 66 respectively compared to model 2 and model 1 the srr per compartment in model 3 compared with model 2 is given in fig 20 the figure shows that 15 92 of the decrease was in column a 8 71 of the decrease was in column b on the other hand there are increases in the compartments in the 6th 7th rows of a and 6th 7th and 8th rows in b columns fig 21 shows the srr per compartment in model 3 compared with model 1 the figure indicates that reduction was achieved in all compartments most of the reduction in sediment occurred in column c with a rate of 56 the decrease in column c was followed by columns a and b with a rate of 26 33 and 21 72 respectively 5 discussion the experiments and the 2d numerical analysis have shown that the most important regions to be considered in terms of sediment accumulation in the ballast tanks are those adjacent to the center girder this is compatible with the in tank flow pattern during tank rolling motion dead zones occur where the flow slows and or halts causing sediment deposition the physics of fluid flow inside the rolling tanks is complex boundary layer formation in the near wall region presents strong gradients and nonlinear velocity profiles due to viscous effects which in turn can influence the global flow pattern in the tanks in the boundary layer the tangential velocity fluctuation is decreased due to the viscous damping and the normal velocity fluctuation is stopped during the rolling motion of a tank filled with water the water at the sides and bottom of the compartments move more slowly than the rest of the water in the compartment due to the boundary layer effect the water pushed towards the sides of the compartments forms a pressure gradient such that the pressure rises towards the direction of the exterior of the tank after reaching the sides of the compartment the displaced water moves downward and when it reaches the bottom of the tank and encounters relatively slow moving water there it is pushed towards the center girder of the tank once the water reaches the center girder it is forced upwards and this cycle continues repeatedly this phenomenon is also observed during numerical analysis wall shear stress is a flow parameter that can play an important role in sediment transport and can be treated as a criterion for the sedimentation of suspended particles in the tanks the wall shear stress is determined by the velocity gradient near the wall 9 τ w μ u y y 0 where μ is the dynamic viscosity u is the flow velocity parallel to the wall and y is the distance to the wall the shields number is the nondimensionalized shear stress denoted by τ and it is used to calculate the initiation of motion of sediment in a fluid flow it is given by 10 τ τ ρ s ρ g d where τ is the dimensional shear stress ρs is the density of the sediment ρ is the density of the fluid g is the gravitational acceleration d is a characteristic particle diameter of the sediment the shields number is proportional to the ratio of fluid force acting on the particle to the weight of the particle low shear stress thus low shields number corresponds to the particle deposition zones the existence of secondary flow near the corners of the tank walls changes the flow parameters locally and creates a zone with a low value of wall shear stress and foster sediment deposition marin et al 2016 vidal et al 2017 yi 2017 the sediment deposition observed during the experiments conducted in this study clearly verifies this rule the sediment behavior observed in the tank is a result of the formation of the boundary layer along the sidewalls and bottom of the compartments the sediment in the water is too heavy to be lifted by the upstream flow in the tank but they are caught in the flow in the tank and are directed towards the center girder of the tank and accumulate there bilgin güney et al 2018 jung et al 2015 in terms of sediment accumulation the results obtained in the previous stage bilgin güney et al 2018 and the present results are compatible the results of both stages and the preliminary numerical analysis show that the region around the center girder is the most susceptible zone in a longitudinally framed double bottom ballast tank when the design improvement recommendations of g12 mepc 2012 which are applicable in the model scale were realized in the second stage the results fig 22 show that total sediment reduction in the tank obtained by minor alterations in the tank design is below the uncertainty range bilgin güney et al 2018 of the experiments and is numerically insignificant the sediment accumulation rate per loading sapl in the compartments of all three models are given in fig 23 in all three models more deposition is observed towards the rear wall of the tank model where the outlet is located this is not unexpected as the tank is given a 5 trim towards the end of the de ballasting process to provide maximum discharge when the holes are enlarged in model 2 the sediment is mobilized and transported both towards the rear end and the center girder causing less sediment deposition in the compartments far away from the rear end compared to model 1 in model 3 a pneumatic cleaning system is integrated into model 2 the pneumatic cleaning system drastically reduces the sediment accumulation in all compartments fig 23 guidelines g12 mepc 2012 and prange and pereira 2013 have suggested that some minor structural changes can result in sediment reduction in the ballast tanks however the modifications such as enlargement and repositioning of some holes made in this study provide only a little reduction in the total sediment amount although this reduction can be considered numerically insignificant the reduction observed in columns a and b is remarkable fig 23 this shows that enlargement of the holes helps the sediment to easily flow through the holes and facilitates the accumulation of the sediment around the center girder this structural design arrangement again makes the central girder the most critical region on the other hand the pneumatic cleaning system used in model 3 reduces the total sediment deposition in the ballast tank by 41 when used alone while it reduces the total sediment deposition in the ballast tank by 45 with the structural changes in model 2 fig 24 it was observed that even though the structural changes applied in model 2 does not have a significant effect on the total sediment reduction they increased the efficiency of the pneumatic system by directing the sediment towards the center girder prange and pereira 2013 also proposed water injection against the bottom of the ballast tanks in order to stir the accumulated sediment upward for resuspension suspension of sediment by water injection was also used by yuan et al 2017 on a laboratory scale the system proposed by yuan et al 2017 was based on the circulation of ballast water in the ballast tanks following the suspension by water injection in their proposed system there is a pipeline spread to the bottom of the tank with this pipeline they aim to circulate ballast water in the tank while mobilizing the deposited sediment and moving the sediment away from the tank with a hydro cyclone filter in their system the need for circulation increases energy consumption yuan et al 2017 when the proposed pneumatic cleaning system is applied to ships the accumulated sediment in the ballast tanks will be re suspended just before the discharge of the ballast water by a unidirectional pipe circuit that is to be adapted to the existing compressors air tubes without any additional machinery equipment the sediment will be re suspended by delivering air pressure in the liquid for short time intervals prior to de ballasting thus most of the sediment will be discharged directly from the tanks with the discharged water without significant energy consumption operating the pneumatic system before de ballasting operations on a regular basis would decrease the amount of the sediment to be managed furthermore when necessary the system can be supported by integrating a mechanical separation unit at the outlet of the de ballasting system 6 conclusion this study shows that to be effective in reducing sediment accumulation in the ballast tanks it is important to take measures along the center girder where the sediment buildup is highest structural modifications such as enlargement and repositioning of bottom holes on the structural elements are not enough to significantly reduce the total sediment amount in the ballast tanks however these modifications mobilize the sediment in the compartments and drive them towards the center girder contributing to more sediment deposition around the center girder during the rolling motion which is the most common oscillatory motion that a ship encounters to reduce the total sediment amount that will be left after de ballasting a pneumatic cleaning system targeting the center girder is designed and proposed in this manuscript the reduction in sediment accumulation provided by the designed system is strikingly larger than the value of the uncertainty analysis performed previously and thus it is numerically significant the proposed pneumatic system is easy to integrate into existing ship systems it is a pipe system that is connected to a compressor air tubes which already exists in the ships and runs along the center girder branching in each compartment around the center girder although the system is located along the center girder air pressure provided by the compressor re suspends the sediment accumulated at the bottom in all compartments of the tank the system will be working for short time intervals prior to de ballasting and will not cause a significant increase in the energy consumption of ships as it does not need a continuous circulation of ballast water according to the bwm convention amendments all ships should meet the d 2 standards by 8 september 2024 the ballast water management systems will be installed to existing ships through retrofit projects by that date the proposed pneumatic cleaning system can be adapted to retrofit projects to ensure the compliance of the system with the convention by reducing the sediment accumulation this study shows that the mobilization and reduction of sediments through re suspension can be achieved by injecting air to ballast tanks however as future work this system should be designed targeting the specific needs structure and operational conditions of ships ship types and dimensions are important for pneumatic system optimization thus the geometry of the nozzle and its location in the tank should be optimized considering the properties of the ship moreover the properties and amount of sediment accumulated in the ballast tanks depend on the navigational characteristics the frequency of pneumatic system usage the air delivery duration and the pressure of the air to be delivered should be optimized depending on the ship specific navigational characteristics in this study the ship s loaded voyage without ballast was not considered while optimizing the pressure of the system it should be considered that the sediment will dry up and become more concentrated during these voyages the vibrational effects of the system on the whole ship structure are not investigated in the scope of this project as it was not reliable to measure these effects in the model scale since the model manufacturing techniques and the materials used differ from the real ships it will be beneficial to study

21922,a low cost global navigation satellite system gnss buoy platform was developed for measuring coastal sea levels to provide information where logistical physical and or financial constraints prevent the application of established tide gauges and satellite altimetry and where spatially and temporally discrete tidal data are required to support surveys for monitoring coastal morphodynamics the buoy was constructed from scaffold tubing and four floats with a central platform for the gnss receiver and antenna the overall cost was around 300 buoy parts 100 gps logger 200 the single frequency gnss receiver was set up to record gps glonass satellite data at 5hz post processing was carried out with rtklib software to derive solutions for sea level gnss buoy performance was evaluated against a reference tide gauge using a van de casteele test the rmse of 1 4 cm computed from the differences between the gnss buoy and reference tide gauge demonstrates that this low cost gnss buoy tide gauge compares well with previous more expensive gnss buoys and is suitable for obtaining local scale coastal sea level data in addition to providing coastal data at cm accuracy the results also indicate the presence of high frequency oscillations in the sea level data caused by coastal geometry and wave induced disturbance keywords gnss buoy sea level tide seiche 1 introduction obtaining local sea level data is a critical challenge for assessing risks to increasing coastal populations infrastructure economies and ecosystems particularly with respect to characterizing environmental response to projected climate change storms and sea level rise cf nicholls et al 2007 this is especially important for low latitude small island developing states sids where the economy is highly reliant upon sustainable development in the low lying coastal hinterland and adjacent waters both of which are vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes cf turvey 2007 more widely data on local sea level can be used to quantify biases and errors due to land contamination of satellite altimetry coastal sea level data to assure safe port operations and navigation to underpin accurate flood hazard assessment and forecasting and to facilitate the assessment of coastal response to hydrodynamic forcing marcos et al 2019 and thus has an essential role to play in climate change adaptation amongst the technologies available for coastal sea level measurement gnss buoy platforms provide an effective means for quantifying local sea level independent of land level at cm accuracy andre et al 2013 here we describe the development and testing of a low cost gnss buoy for deployment where local sea level data are required or where tide gauges or satellite altimetry cannot be utilised local sea level data are important for repeat surveys of coastal bathymetry and morphodynamics which provide essential data on the character of coastal nearshore change including quantification of long term accretion recession rates monitoring impacts of engineering interventions and dredging operations and assessment of response to inter annual and seasonal variability and storm forcing harley et al 2011 furthermore repeat surveys at smaller spatial and shorter temporal scales provide a foundation for assessing the local implications of global sea level rise projections nicholls et al 2007 progressing beyond the established application of periodic lidar differential gps and unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys marine x band radar allows continuous monitoring of coastal morphology and morphological change over timescales from days to years bell 2008 bird et al 2017 here the morphology of beaches and tidal flats can be characterised in terms of their instantaneous and long term behaviours by applying a water line method bell et al 2016 whereby the advancing and retreating shoreline during the tidal cycle can be assigned an altitude on the basis of the corresponding tidal level the accuracy of intertidal morphology determined via the water line method can be significantly improved when combined with tidal data obtained within the radar survey operating spatial and temporal window bell et al 2016 for example applying the radar water line method with tidal measurements taken from within the survey domain would reduce any spatial or temporal tidal phase issues that might be present between the survey location and the location of the nearest tide gauge furthermore these portable radar systems may be deployed at coastal locations where local sea level data are not readily available or traditional methods of measuring sea levels cannot easily be applied e g no fixed structures such as piers to attach tide gauges thus gnss buoy deployment for local sea level at cm accuracy provides an important complement to these new survey technologies global navigation satellite system gnss is the standard generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous geo spatial positioning with global coverage this term includes for example the us global positioning system gps the russian global navigation satellite system glonass the european union galileo system the chinese beidou system and other regional systems gnss buoys for sea level measurement were originally developed for the verification of data from earth orbiting satellite altimeters hein et al 1990 rocken et al 1990 essentially a sea level time series can be obtained from a gps antenna mounted on a buoy if the height of the antenna phase centre above sea level is known kelecy et al 1994 gnss systems use the properties of l band microwave frequencies i e l1 1575 42 mhz and l2 1227 60 mhz kaplan and hegarty 2017 to determine geodetic position from appropriate scaling and combination of the l1 and l2 measurements in the past decade considerable progress has been made on the analysis of reflected gnss data for sea level monitoring gnss r e g roussel et al 2015 but gnss geodetic receivers are readily deployed on buoy platforms to measure sea surface heights watson et al 2008 for example apel et al 2012 and frappart et al 2017 demonstrated how the technology can be applied to buoys in estuarine and river systems while lin et al 2017 showed that by using real time kinematic rtk positioning technology accurate measurements of tidal levels from an offshore buoy could be obtained with a root mean square error rmse of less than 10 cm another use of kinematic gnss at sea is for seafloor geodesy were gnss buoys have been used in combination with seafloor pressure gauges for vertical deformation monitoring ballu et al 2009 furthermore morales maqueda et al 2016 installed a geodetic gps on a wave glider and used kinematic precise point positioning ppp to produce 5 cm precision water surface heights for a scottish loch later penna et al 2018 used the same wave glider configuration with a north sea deployment and obtained centimetric precision instantaneous sea surface heights as well as ellipsoidal height estimates and significant wave heights in another gnss application andré et al 2013 compared three geodetic gps equipped buoys two recording at 5 hz and one at 1 hz with established radar tide gauge data they post processed the gps data in kinematic mode with respect to a land based reference station post processed kinematic ppk mode is an alternative technique to rtk and differs in that the solution algorithms and timing corrections are applied later the reference station was located around 500 m away from a relatively sheltered coastal location where the buoys were deployed they concluded that a rmse range of 1 2 2 cm between the gps buoys and a radar tide gauge again evidenced that gps buoys are suitable for determining coastal sea level however stal et al 2016 using a similar approach reported an accuracy of 4 cm in a more exposed location and further out to sea they used a navcom geodetic gnss receiver recording at 1 hz which was fitted to an axys technologies hydrolevel buoy with the closest gnss reference station within 20 km of the deployment they reported that the data sets suffered noise related to wave heights and that a significant amount of other noise was present in the positioning solution see stal et al 2016 for further elaboration in the examples above the buoys were fitted with geodetic gnss receivers and antennas capable of picking up both the l1 and l2 satellite signals and recording carrier phase information these types of receiver can cost between 2000 and 10 000 gbp and typically require expensive antennae 3000 the advantage of using a l1 l2 receiver is that one of the largest errors caused by the travel time delays on the satellite signals due to the ionosphere can be almost eliminated kaplan and hegarty 2017 another advantage is that having two simultaneous satellite signals can help in the processing when cycle slips occur in the data kaplan and hegarty 2017 furthermore both the l1 l2 signals are necessary for accurate sea level measurements if using ppp methods for example when processing data from remote ocean deployments well away from suitable land based gnss reference stations this paper assesses the performance of an inexpensive gnss buoy for measuring of sea levels consisting of a buoy made from readily available parts and a low priced gnss receiver and logger especially as these buoys are intended for deployment in the coastal zone with a potentially high attrition rate successful development of this buoy will also have the potential for wider deployment in low and middle income countries where the financial resources for gathering data on coastal hydrodynamics may be limited first we compare the derived sea levels with a reference tide gauge and then investigate the noise in the rtk solutions as reported by stal et al 2016 here we apply the ppk technique to data from a low cost u blox m8t gnss receiver u blox 2019a with a tallysman tw2741 patch antenna although limited to the measurement of the l1 signal it can record the necessary carrier phase information and is capable of centimetre level accuracies u blox 2016 as well as the lower cost single l1 receivers also consume less power which is an advantage for battery solar power based applications also their use in the nearshore zone is complemented by land based gnss reference stations with geodetic receivers as part of the overall positioning solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 buoy design the buoy fig 1 a was designed to be easy to construct with off the shelf components buoy parts total cost 100 the buoy consists of four yellow polyform purse seine floats bpb series 4600 four sections of 33 mm diameter aluminium scaffold tubing three 0 5 m sections and one 1 0 m section one four way scaffold connector two other scaffold tube fittings one with an eyelet for the mid section and one for connecting the mooring line using shackles the aluminium tubes connect with stainless steel bolts using standard grub screw holes in the four way connector and other fittings as a guide for the drill bit a black plastic base bolts on to the top of the four way connector on which attaches the gnss package each purse seine float has a buoyancy capable of supporting a weight of 4 6 kg the buoy was tested in a local marine lake with different weights to assess the floating profile and its stability in the water the gnss receiver electronics and battery fig 1b were contained in an ip67 68 waterproof enclosure bopla bocube 270 125 60 mm the waterproofing was enhanced using silicon grease on the rubber seals waterproof tape and flexible sealant for the antenna cable entry 2 2 gnss receiver the u blox m8t gnss receiver was chosen as it is a cost effective low power unit 32 ma 3 v just receiver and has been shown to be capable of centimetre level accuracies ublox 2016 for land based rtk applications including built up areas where satellite signal losses can occur it is a single frequency receiver capable of receiving the l1 satellite signals that can record concurrent gps glonass beidou and galileo satellite data up to 5 hz and up to 10 hz for single gnss systems such as gps in addition it records the raw satellite data including the carrier phase output which is required for the centimetre accuracy an advantage of the buoy being deployed in a marine environment is that visibility of the whole sky will be available while on many land based applications such as car tracking buildings can obscure and scatter the satellite signals a disadvantage of marine based deployments is that the buoy will be bounced around with the waves which would induce the losing of low lying satellite tracking resulting in inaccurate final horizontal and vertical positioning solutions as shown by stal et al 2016 the u blox m8t receiver was first tested using a u blox evaluation kit evk m8t with a gnss logger though for field testing an early emlid reach emlid reach 2019 now updated to the reach m with 8 gb of memory was used as it had a m8t receiver already embedded onto a small form linux board an intel edison wifi for data transfer internal storage 2 gb and a software user interface that allowed for quick alteration of the receiver settings the emlid reach costing 200 includes a small tallysman multi gnss patch antenna tw4721 and is mainly aimed at the growing uav drone market it is a self contained experimental package fig 1b and draws a current of 200 300 ma depending on the set up and antenna used the antenna was secured to the top of the enclosure on a 7 cm square steel ground plane the ground plane is essential to reduce multi path reflections and increase the antenna gain u blox 2019b its optimum dimensions often supplied with antenna manufacturer s specifications are determined by the antenna size an easyacc 20 000 mah battery pack was used with the emlid reach which provided enough power to cover the experimental period the expected endurance based upon the power requirements would be up to 4 days although not part of this initial experiment further successful trials have been carried out using larger capacity batteries as well as voltaic systems solar power panels to allow for extended periods of deployment 2 3 buoy testing at holyhead holyhead harbour fig 2 was chosen as the site for the testing as it has a long established tide gauge part of the uk national tide gauge network and an additional holyhead port authority tide gauge for direct comparisons there is also a uk ordnance survey os geodetic gnss site wgs 53 19 03 8 n 04 38 31 4 w british national grid sh 24104 83343 located at the life boat station close to the new harbour a source of research quality gnss data which can be applied to the ppk solution and a fundamental benchmark wgs 53 18 47 2 n 04 38 30 0 w british national grid sh 24111 82829 the datum used throughout is local chart datum cd which at holyhead is 3 05 m below ordnance datum newlyn odn at holyhead the largest tidal range is 6 26 m national oceanography poltips 3 2019 during the test 11 13 september 2018 the highest predicted tide was 6 16 m while the lowest was 0 21 m and the largest range was 5 86 m the highest predicted tide of the month was 6 17 m on 10 september at 22 45 the tides were close to the peak springs decreasing towards neaps the test took place in the new harbour fig 2 where the buoy was attached to a mooring buoy fig 3 and allowed to float freely deployed position wgs 53 19 08 4 n 04 38 24 0 w charts indicated the mooring location was in about 4 m water depth below chart datum the u blox m8t receiver embedded on the emlid reach using a tallysman patch antenna was set up to record gnss data at 5 hz gps and glonass raw satellite data were recorded including the carrier phase information in the u blox binary format ubx data were recorded from 10 00 on 11 september until 09 51 on 13 september with a gap of 42 min 09 35 10 17 on 12 september during a data download test and battery check 2 4 gnss data processing to obtain accurate positions using a moving single frequency receiver u blox m8t data from another gnss at a known fixed location are needed ideally recording both l1 and l2 frequencies for both rtk and ppk solutions the open source software rtklib 2018 was used for processing the gnss data the advantage of ppk over rtk is that the solution can be applied both forwards and backwards in time and additional corrections for the satellite clocks and orbits can be included as they become available after a few weeks see below for further details thus improving the overall positional solution here the u blox m8t is the moving rover the buoy moving in vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring and the reference os gnss is the base station optimal solutions for the ppk are obtained as the distances between the rover and base station reduce to within 20 km of each other thus these have been kept as short as possible for the experiment at holyhead the distance between the buoy and the reference os gnss station was about 200 m fig 2 the os gnss station comprises a trimble alloy gnss receiver capable of receiving the l1 and l2 satellite signals combined with a leica ar25 gnss antenna and data were downloaded from the os online download facility ordnance survey 2019 these data are initially available at 30 s intervals and used for initial ppk processing however once the 1 hz data are available delay of 45 days these were used in the final positioning solution the archived 1 hz gnss data were obtained from the british isles continuous gnss facility bigf 2018 the processing uses rtklib on data spans of up to six hours to be within software memory limits the parameter settings for the software are listed in table 1 they are mostly the default settings for rtklib with recommendations from other groups for example emlid reach 2019 they are similar to the optimised settings of stal et al 2016 except that sensor dynamics was switched to on and glonass satellites were used both of which improve the derived solution these parameters were used to obtain the best solution for each data period based on the returned rtklib solution quality indicators see rtklib manual rtklib 2018 to improve the overall solution satellite ephemerides for precise orbit corrections and satellite and station clock error corrections were applied these were obtained from the crustal dynamics data information system cddis 2018 noll 2010 the corrections are delivered with increasing accuracy in the form of ultra rapid and final correction files available between 3 and 9 h 17 41 h and 11 17 days respectively the results in this paper use the final products the gnss measurements are referred to an antenna phase centre a non constant value that depends on the direction of the satellite signal i e corrections need to be applied during the processing within the rtklib software package which outputs the positional data i e including the sea level there is an option to apply these corrections by including models of the antenna phase centre these models are available for many of the geodetic antenna types including the leica ar25 base antenna although not for small low cost patch antennas such as the tw4721 rover antenna thus during the processing the corrections were applied for the leica ar25 antenna but not for the tw4721 antenna tallysman 2019 provides some antenna performance documentation for the tw4721 which suggests that the antenna phase centre variations fall in a range of 1 cm 2 5 local tidal data tidal data for comparison with the gnss buoy results were from the environment agency ea tide gauge wgs 53 18 50 2 n 04 37 13 6 w british

data were recorded as one minute averages the ea gauge is part of the uk national tide gauge network uk coastal monitoring and forecasting 2015 and is the reference tide gauge for this experiment as bodc monitor the data quality it consists of a full tide bubbler tide gauge system woodworth and smith 2003 3 results 3 1 gnss derived tidal heights and local tide gauge data selected comparisons from the data are displayed in fig 4 a e derived tidal heights to chart datum from the gnss buoy 5 hz environment agency tide gauge 15 min averages and filtered gnss data boxcar 15 min moving averages gnss data quality is good with an exception that occurred on 11 september 2018 23 02 23 10 as illustrated in fig 4e the discontinuity was present when the gnss receiver recorded fewer quality satellite fixes hence more uncertainty in the derived position as the harbour is used 24 h a day and seven days a week any port traffic nearby could potentially cause shadowing as boats may block some of the satellite signals the fig 4a and b also show higher frequency signals in the 5 hz gnss derived sea levels which will be explored in detail in following sections oscillations of around 10 30 min which can be attributed to harbour oscillations and higher frequency oscillations of less than one minute for example see fig 4a around high water fig 4c and d shows that while the higher frequency oscillations are present in the 5 hz data the harbour oscillations are not obvious and seem to have disappeared 3 2 the van de casteele test the performance of a tide gauge can be assessed using the van de casteele test miguez et al 2008 2012 tested a variety of tide gauges and demonstrated the ability to highlight different types of tide gauge error while andré et al 2013 used it to compare data from three different gnss buoys for measuring sea level against a nearby radar tide gauge the method compares a reference tide gauge data set data known to be an accurate measurement of sea level to contemporaneous data from the tide gauge being tested h the reference sea level data h are plotted on the ordinate against the tide gauge difference δh on the abscissa x axis where δh h h the resulting diagram would produce a straight vertical line centred on x 0 for a perfect match between the two tide gauges 3 2 1 assessing the gnss buoy tide gauge accuracy before comparing the gnss data with the ea tide gauge data a 900 s boxcar moving average was applied to the gnss data and then values corresponding to the timings of the ea gauge data were resampled at fifteen minute intervals the resulting van de casteele diagram in fig 5 a indicates good agreement between the ea tide gauge and the gnss buoy tide gauge the near vertical alignment in the chart of the differences between low water and high water although not perfectively straight implies that there are no timing offsets which would result in a more ellipsoidal pattern and no obvious systematic errors e g scale error which would have introduced a large gradient from low water to high water however there is a small overall negative offset from zero this bias shown in fig 5a may be partly due to the spatial difference between the two tide gauges and or due to errors in the measurement of the antenna elevation above the water surface the mean difference between the gnss data and the ea tide gauge data was 0 011 m the standard deviation was 0 009 m and the rmse was 0 014 m some of the larger residuals are due to the presence of the harbour oscillations which are noticeable in the 900 s boxcar averaged gnss data fig 4a that are not represented in the 15 min ea tide gauge record these differences may be the result of wave damping that has been introduced within the design of the ea tide gauge bubbler system fig 6 plots the tidal differences against time left axis alongside the ea tide gauge observations right axis the time series of differences between tide gauges δh produces a tide shaped sinusoid which is mildly correlated with the tidal cycle this translates into the small slope from high tide to low tide that is evident within the van de casteele diagram fig 5a thus indicating that the gnss buoy tide gauge is performing well cf miguez et al 2008 3 3 harbour oscillations to examine the above mentioned oscillations with periods of between 10 and 30 min seen in the 5 hz data fig 4a data from the port authority tide gauge recording one minute averages were compared to the gnss derived sea level data after applying the van de casteele test described above to the port authority tidal data using the ea tidal data as the reference the test results highlight three issues with the port authority tide gauge a general datum offset a gradient away from vertical in the van de casteele test diagram fig 5b from high water to low water and large differences at low water the mean difference was 0 086 m the standard deviation was 0 034 m and the rmse was 0 092 m however these data confirm the presence of harbour oscillations seen within the gnss data fig 7 a and b which can be seen clearly across the high water period 11 september 2018 at 10 00 13 00 and to a lesser degree across the high water period 12 september 10 30 13 30 it is interesting that these oscillations are reduced in amplitude and appear to be at a different frequency during the high water period 24 h later the power spectral density psd using welch s method of the 5 hz gnss data in fig 8 indicates the presence of oscillations at frequency peaks across the 10 30 min band between 10 00 13 30 on 11 september the oscillations have a period of around 22 min while 24 h later between 10 30 13 30 on 12 september the oscillations appear to have periods of 15 and 22 min both have similar spectral density there appears to be more energy in the 10 30 min band spanning the high water on 11 september than on the corresponding high water on 12 september 3 4 higher frequency oscillations oscillations contained within the gnss data with periods shorter than one minute frequencies higher than 0 0167 hz were explored as well as noise introduced by the gnss system and ppk solution method other potential sources of the high frequency oscillations are the responses to external waves across the harbour entrance ferry movements and pitch and roll motion induced by response of the buoy platform to sea surface waves fig 9 shows the power spectral density of the 5 hz gnss derived sea level data for the periods 11 september 10 30 to 12 september 09 35 and 12 september 10 17 to 13 september 09 51 the first period is shorter in order to avoid contaminating the spectra from the poor quality data on 11 september 23 02 23 10 there are peaks at 10 s 8 s and 4 s periods which point to the presence of appreciable wave activity in the new harbour complex a possible cause of the waves could be the wakes of irish sea ferries with an extensive daily schedule to and from ireland and other port traffic on each day of the deployment there were twenty evenly spread departures and arrivals the longest gap with no scheduled ferry service was 3 5 h although the ferry arrival departure times were not always consistent with the schedule visual note made during deployment and other traffic were using the port the results are consistent with other studies on ferry wakes for example soomere 2005 observed groups of waves created by a fast ferries operating in the baltic sea with periods of 9 15 s 7 9 s and 3 4 s 3 5 uncertainty in the derived sea level solution the gnss derived sea level solution contains uncertainty related to the processing method in kinematic mode which manifests itself as resembling noise see section 2 4 on data processing to investigate this contribution and ascertain its likely effect on the derived solution another identical u blox m8t receiver and antenna were positioned on the fundamental benchmark fbm at holyhead for one hour coincident with a buoy deployment the rtklib software was then applied with the parameters listed in table 1 to obtain the vertical levels and once again using the ordnance survey gnss data as the base station applying the solution parameter of kinematic to a receiver on a fixed point stationary would therefore quantify the processing noise within the kinematic solution to compare the results the solution parameter of static was also applied to the gnss m8t receiver data at the fbm reference station the power spectral densities for the three situations are shown in fig 10 it confirms the presence of high frequency components in the gnss buoy results see section 3 4 when compared with the gnss results at the fbm the spectra support the hypothesis of locally generated waves within the new harbour the two fbm power spectra highlight the differences in the solution due to the chosen processing options static and kinematic with the static solution having much lower energy differences between the mean of each fbm solution static kinematic is small less than 1 cm and the corresponding standard deviations for each time series are 0 0024 m and 0 0097 m respectively also there is a peak of around 1 s period within the fmb kinematic mode solution fig 10 this may be an artefact of the rtklib processing software and how it copes with two different sampling rates for base and rover e g the gnss buoy recorded at 5 hz and the os gnss station data were recorded at 1 hz 4 discussion and conclusions a test deployment of an experimental buoy fitted with a gps system u blox m8t gnss receiver for measuring coastal sea level has been undertaken in holyhead harbour wales uk the gnss receiver recorded two days of 5 hz data between 11 and 13 september 2018 encompassing four high waters and four low waters the van de casteele test results comparing the gnss positioning solution with the local ea tide gauge part of the uk national tidal gauge network gave a mean difference of around 1 cm rmse 1 4 cm thus confirming that this low cost gnss buoy tide gauge can produce coastal sea level measurements that are comparable with previous deployments of more expensive gnss buoys for the same purpose e g rocken et al 1990 andre et al 2013 the 1 cm difference may be due to many factors including the instruments themselves tying errors and the way the subsequent data are analysed for example the uncertain antenna phase centre on the tallysman tw4721 antenna could produce errors up to 1 cm as specified in the antenna documentation and indeed inferred from previous studies kelecy et al 1994 marcos et al 2019 using similar antennas for base and rover receivers would almost eliminate this problem if the base site is first established using a geodetic gnss receiver and in combination with a short baseline also the differences could arise from the different hydrodynamics between the new harbour and the inner harbour i e there is a separation of 1500 m between the gnss buoy and the other tide gauges with the added complexity of a jetty which is open underneath separating the new harbour from the outer basin and inner harbour fig 2 furthermore the uncertainty within the kinematic solution may result in a bias although the experiment at the fbm reference station using both static and kinematic solutions suggest that this is smaller than 1 cm the observed harbour oscillations in the gnss and port authority tidal data are likely to be seiches rabinovich 2009 pugh and woodworth 2014 that can be set in motion by external forces such as wave energy impinging on the harbour wind tide and so on using merian s formula where the basin is open at one end and with the length of the bay corresponding to one quarter of a wavelength the natural period for the basin is τ 4l gd ½ where l is the length of the harbour d is its average depth and g is acceleration due to gravity considering the new harbour with l 1800 m and d 9 m the calculated period becomes 13 min which is similar to the observed periods of 15 and 22 min fig 8 likewise for the inner harbour which is dredged to a 5 5 m minimum depth with l 800 m and d 8 m and the whole basin i e the area of water contained within the seawall and the land towards the east fig 2 with l 3700 m and d 10 m the corresponding periods are 6 min and 25 min respectively these observed oscillations figs 7a and 8 may be related to tidal forcing since the deployment was at or just after the peak spring tides the higher frequency oscillation peaks at ten eight and four second periods shown in fig 9 are most likely caused by waves induced by the busy port traffic e g ferries to and from ireland as mentioned previously these periods are consistent with other studies on ferry waves soomere 2005 the pitch and roll of the buoy with local wind induced wavelets appear to be at much higher frequencies visual assessment of the buoy on mooring and this is what is possibly represented as the small peak in the psd beyond 1 hz e g approx 0 6 s period fig 9 whilst this may be regarded as a complicating factor in the evaluation of the gnss buoy for measuring sea level it highlights the further potential for this instrument for capturing data on local wave climate cf hein et al 1990 kelecy et al 1994 over the last decade using gnss receivers on buoys to measure sea levels has been prohibitively expensive when compared to other methods and thus they have mainly been used for specific scientific purposes however recently the overall cost for geodetic quality gnss receivers and antennas and associated loggers has fallen dramatically and these low cost packages can now deliver centimetre level accuracy for example u blox now offer a new dual frequency receiver e g zep f9p with a similar cost to the u blox m8t used in this experiment furthermore there are additional gnss systems such as galileo becoming fully operational a new carrier frequency e g l5 which when combined with advances in gnss receiver software will help to reduce errors and improve the overall positional results consequently the low cost gnss tide gauge buoy developed herein offers considerable potential for multiple deployments within survey domains and for addressing information gaps in our global network of tide gauges for monitoring coastal sea level this potential is enhanced by the gnss buoy tide gauge s compact size permitting single person deployment and its low cost making it attractive for use in low and middle income countries where financial resources for environmental monitoring are limited credit authorship

21922,a low cost global navigation satellite system gnss buoy platform was developed for measuring coastal sea levels to provide information where logistical physical and or financial constraints prevent the application of established tide gauges and satellite altimetry and where spatially and temporally discrete tidal data are required to support surveys for monitoring coastal morphodynamics the buoy was constructed from scaffold tubing and four floats with a central platform for the gnss receiver and antenna the overall cost was around 300 buoy parts 100 gps logger 200 the single frequency gnss receiver was set up to record gps glonass satellite data at 5hz post processing was carried out with rtklib software to derive solutions for sea level gnss buoy performance was evaluated against a reference tide gauge using a van de casteele test the rmse of 1 4 cm computed from the differences between the gnss buoy and reference tide gauge demonstrates that this low cost gnss buoy tide gauge compares well with previous more expensive gnss buoys and is suitable for obtaining local scale coastal sea level data in addition to providing coastal data at cm accuracy the results also indicate the presence of high frequency oscillations in the sea level data caused by coastal geometry and wave induced disturbance keywords gnss buoy sea level tide seiche 1 introduction obtaining local sea level data is a critical challenge for assessing risks to increasing coastal populations infrastructure economies and ecosystems particularly with respect to characterizing environmental response to projected climate change storms and sea level rise cf nicholls et al 2007 this is especially important for low latitude small island developing states sids where the economy is highly reliant upon sustainable development in the low lying coastal hinterland and adjacent waters both of which are vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes cf turvey 2007 more widely data on local sea level can be used to quantify biases and errors due to land contamination of satellite altimetry coastal sea level data to assure safe port operations and navigation to underpin accurate flood hazard assessment and forecasting and to facilitate the assessment of coastal response to hydrodynamic forcing marcos et al 2019 and thus has an essential role to play in climate change adaptation amongst the technologies available for coastal sea level measurement gnss buoy platforms provide an effective means for quantifying local sea level independent of land level at cm accuracy andre et al 2013 here we describe the development and testing of a low cost gnss buoy for deployment where local sea level data are required or where tide gauges or satellite altimetry cannot be utilised local sea level data are important for repeat surveys of coastal bathymetry and morphodynamics which provide essential data on the character of coastal nearshore change including quantification of long term accretion recession rates monitoring impacts of engineering interventions and dredging operations and assessment of response to inter annual and seasonal variability and storm forcing harley et al 2011 furthermore repeat surveys at smaller spatial and shorter temporal scales provide a foundation for assessing the local implications of global sea level rise projections nicholls et al 2007 progressing beyond the established application of periodic lidar differential gps and unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys marine x band radar allows continuous monitoring of coastal morphology and morphological change over timescales from days to years bell 2008 bird et al 2017 here the morphology of beaches and tidal flats can be characterised in terms of their instantaneous and long term behaviours by applying a water line method bell et al 2016 whereby the advancing and retreating shoreline during the tidal cycle can be assigned an altitude on the basis of the corresponding tidal level the accuracy of intertidal morphology determined via the water line method can be significantly improved when combined with tidal data obtained within the radar survey operating spatial and temporal window bell et al 2016 for example applying the radar water line method with tidal measurements taken from within the survey domain would reduce any spatial or temporal tidal phase issues that might be present between the survey location and the location of the nearest tide gauge furthermore these portable radar systems may be deployed at coastal locations where local sea level data are not readily available or traditional methods of measuring sea levels cannot easily be applied e g no fixed structures such as piers to attach tide gauges thus gnss buoy deployment for local sea level at cm accuracy provides an important complement to these new survey technologies global navigation satellite system gnss is the standard generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous geo spatial positioning with global coverage this term includes for example the us global positioning system gps the russian global navigation satellite system glonass the european union galileo system the chinese beidou system and other regional systems gnss buoys for sea level measurement were originally developed for the verification of data from earth orbiting satellite altimeters hein et al 1990 rocken et al 1990 essentially a sea level time series can be obtained from a gps antenna mounted on a buoy if the height of the antenna phase centre above sea level is known kelecy et al 1994 gnss systems use the properties of l band microwave frequencies i e l1 1575 42 mhz and l2 1227 60 mhz kaplan and hegarty 2017 to determine geodetic position from appropriate scaling and combination of the l1 and l2 measurements in the past decade considerable progress has been made on the analysis of reflected gnss data for sea level monitoring gnss r e g roussel et al 2015 but gnss geodetic receivers are readily deployed on buoy platforms to measure sea surface heights watson et al 2008 for example apel et al 2012 and frappart et al 2017 demonstrated how the technology can be applied to buoys in estuarine and river systems while lin et al 2017 showed that by using real time kinematic rtk positioning technology accurate measurements of tidal levels from an offshore buoy could be obtained with a root mean square error rmse of less than 10 cm another use of kinematic gnss at sea is for seafloor geodesy were gnss buoys have been used in combination with seafloor pressure gauges for vertical deformation monitoring ballu et al 2009 furthermore morales maqueda et al 2016 installed a geodetic gps on a wave glider and used kinematic precise point positioning ppp to produce 5 cm precision water surface heights for a scottish loch later penna et al 2018 used the same wave glider configuration with a north sea deployment and obtained centimetric precision instantaneous sea surface heights as well as ellipsoidal height estimates and significant wave heights in another gnss application andré et al 2013 compared three geodetic gps equipped buoys two recording at 5 hz and one at 1 hz with established radar tide gauge data they post processed the gps data in kinematic mode with respect to a land based reference station post processed kinematic ppk mode is an alternative technique to rtk and differs in that the solution algorithms and timing corrections are applied later the reference station was located around 500 m away from a relatively sheltered coastal location where the buoys were deployed they concluded that a rmse range of 1 2 2 cm between the gps buoys and a radar tide gauge again evidenced that gps buoys are suitable for determining coastal sea level however stal et al 2016 using a similar approach reported an accuracy of 4 cm in a more exposed location and further out to sea they used a navcom geodetic gnss receiver recording at 1 hz which was fitted to an axys technologies hydrolevel buoy with the closest gnss reference station within 20 km of the deployment they reported that the data sets suffered noise related to wave heights and that a significant amount of other noise was present in the positioning solution see stal et al 2016 for further elaboration in the examples above the buoys were fitted with geodetic gnss receivers and antennas capable of picking up both the l1 and l2 satellite signals and recording carrier phase information these types of receiver can cost between 2000 and 10 000 gbp and typically require expensive antennae 3000 the advantage of using a l1 l2 receiver is that one of the largest errors caused by the travel time delays on the satellite signals due to the ionosphere can be almost eliminated kaplan and hegarty 2017 another advantage is that having two simultaneous satellite signals can help in the processing when cycle slips occur in the data kaplan and hegarty 2017 furthermore both the l1 l2 signals are necessary for accurate sea level measurements if using ppp methods for example when processing data from remote ocean deployments well away from suitable land based gnss reference stations this paper assesses the performance of an inexpensive gnss buoy for measuring of sea levels consisting of a buoy made from readily available parts and a low priced gnss receiver and logger especially as these buoys are intended for deployment in the coastal zone with a potentially high attrition rate successful development of this buoy will also have the potential for wider deployment in low and middle income countries where the financial resources for gathering data on coastal hydrodynamics may be limited first we compare the derived sea levels with a reference tide gauge and then investigate the noise in the rtk solutions as reported by stal et al 2016 here we apply the ppk technique to data from a low cost u blox m8t gnss receiver u blox 2019a with a tallysman tw2741 patch antenna although limited to the measurement of the l1 signal it can record the necessary carrier phase information and is capable of centimetre level accuracies u blox 2016 as well as the lower cost single l1 receivers also consume less power which is an advantage for battery solar power based applications also their use in the nearshore zone is complemented by land based gnss reference stations with geodetic receivers as part of the overall positioning solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 buoy design the buoy fig 1 a was designed to be easy to construct with off the shelf components buoy parts total cost 100 the buoy consists of four yellow polyform purse seine floats bpb series 4600 four sections of 33 mm diameter aluminium scaffold tubing three 0 5 m sections and one 1 0 m section one four way scaffold connector two other scaffold tube fittings one with an eyelet for the mid section and one for connecting the mooring line using shackles the aluminium tubes connect with stainless steel bolts using standard grub screw holes in the four way connector and other fittings as a guide for the drill bit a black plastic base bolts on to the top of the four way connector on which attaches the gnss package each purse seine float has a buoyancy capable of supporting a weight of 4 6 kg the buoy was tested in a local marine lake with different weights to assess the floating profile and its stability in the water the gnss receiver electronics and battery fig 1b were contained in an ip67 68 waterproof enclosure bopla bocube 270 125 60 mm the waterproofing was enhanced using silicon grease on the rubber seals waterproof tape and flexible sealant for the antenna cable entry 2 2 gnss receiver the u blox m8t gnss receiver was chosen as it is a cost effective low power unit 32 ma 3 v just receiver and has been shown to be capable of centimetre level accuracies ublox 2016 for land based rtk applications including built up areas where satellite signal losses can occur it is a single frequency receiver capable of receiving the l1 satellite signals that can record concurrent gps glonass beidou and galileo satellite data up to 5 hz and up to 10 hz for single gnss systems such as gps in addition it records the raw satellite data including the carrier phase output which is required for the centimetre accuracy an advantage of the buoy being deployed in a marine environment is that visibility of the whole sky will be available while on many land based applications such as car tracking buildings can obscure and scatter the satellite signals a disadvantage of marine based deployments is that the buoy will be bounced around with the waves which would induce the losing of low lying satellite tracking resulting in inaccurate final horizontal and vertical positioning solutions as shown by stal et al 2016 the u blox m8t receiver was first tested using a u blox evaluation kit evk m8t with a gnss logger though for field testing an early emlid reach emlid reach 2019 now updated to the reach m with 8 gb of memory was used as it had a m8t receiver already embedded onto a small form linux board an intel edison wifi for data transfer internal storage 2 gb and a software user interface that allowed for quick alteration of the receiver settings the emlid reach costing 200 includes a small tallysman multi gnss patch antenna tw4721 and is mainly aimed at the growing uav drone market it is a self contained experimental package fig 1b and draws a current of 200 300 ma depending on the set up and antenna used the antenna was secured to the top of the enclosure on a 7 cm square steel ground plane the ground plane is essential to reduce multi path reflections and increase the antenna gain u blox 2019b its optimum dimensions often supplied with antenna manufacturer s specifications are determined by the antenna size an easyacc 20 000 mah battery pack was used with the emlid reach which provided enough power to cover the experimental period the expected endurance based upon the power requirements would be up to 4 days although not part of this initial experiment further successful trials have been carried out using larger capacity batteries as well as voltaic systems solar power panels to allow for extended periods of deployment 2 3 buoy testing at holyhead holyhead harbour fig 2 was chosen as the site for the testing as it has a long established tide gauge part of the uk national tide gauge network and an additional holyhead port authority tide gauge for direct comparisons there is also a uk ordnance survey os geodetic gnss site wgs 53 19 03 8 n 04 38 31 4 w british national grid sh 24104 83343 located at the life boat station close to the new harbour a source of research quality gnss data which can be applied to the ppk solution and a fundamental benchmark wgs 53 18 47 2 n 04 38 30 0 w british national grid sh 24111 82829 the datum used throughout is local chart datum cd which at holyhead is 3 05 m below ordnance datum newlyn odn at holyhead the largest tidal range is 6 26 m national oceanography poltips 3 2019 during the test 11 13 september 2018 the highest predicted tide was 6 16 m while the lowest was 0 21 m and the largest range was 5 86 m the highest predicted tide of the month was 6 17 m on 10 september at 22 45 the tides were close to the peak springs decreasing towards neaps the test took place in the new harbour fig 2 where the buoy was attached to a mooring buoy fig 3 and allowed to float freely deployed position wgs 53 19 08 4 n 04 38 24 0 w charts indicated the mooring location was in about 4 m water depth below chart datum the u blox m8t receiver embedded on the emlid reach using a tallysman patch antenna was set up to record gnss data at 5 hz gps and glonass raw satellite data were recorded including the carrier phase information in the u blox binary format ubx data were recorded from 10 00 on 11 september until 09 51 on 13 september with a gap of 42 min 09 35 10 17 on 12 september during a data download test and battery check 2 4 gnss data processing to obtain accurate positions using a moving single frequency receiver u blox m8t data from another gnss at a known fixed location are needed ideally recording both l1 and l2 frequencies for both rtk and ppk solutions the open source software rtklib 2018 was used for processing the gnss data the advantage of ppk over rtk is that the solution can be applied both forwards and backwards in time and additional corrections for the satellite clocks and orbits can be included as they become available after a few weeks see below for further details thus improving the overall positional solution here the u blox m8t is the moving rover the buoy moving in vertical and horizontal directions at the mooring and the reference os gnss is the base station optimal solutions for the ppk are obtained as the distances between the rover and base station reduce to within 20 km of each other thus these have been kept as short as possible for the experiment at holyhead the distance between the buoy and the reference os gnss station was about 200 m fig 2 the os gnss station comprises a trimble alloy gnss receiver capable of receiving the l1 and l2 satellite signals combined with a leica ar25 gnss antenna and data were downloaded from the os online download facility ordnance survey 2019 these data are initially available at 30 s intervals and used for initial ppk processing however once the 1 hz data are available delay of 45 days these were used in the final positioning solution the archived 1 hz gnss data were obtained from the british isles continuous gnss facility bigf 2018 the processing uses rtklib on data spans of up to six hours to be within software memory limits the parameter settings for the software are listed in table 1 they are mostly the default settings for rtklib with recommendations from other groups for example emlid reach 2019 they are similar to the optimised settings of stal et al 2016 except that sensor dynamics was switched to on and glonass satellites were used both of which improve the derived solution these parameters were used to obtain the best solution for each data period based on the returned rtklib solution quality indicators see rtklib manual rtklib 2018 to improve the overall solution satellite ephemerides for precise orbit corrections and satellite and station clock error corrections were applied these were obtained from the crustal dynamics data information system cddis 2018 noll 2010 the corrections are delivered with increasing accuracy in the form of ultra rapid and final correction files available between 3 and 9 h 17 41 h and 11 17 days respectively the results in this paper use the final products the gnss measurements are referred to an antenna phase centre a non constant value that depends on the direction of the satellite signal i e corrections need to be applied during the processing within the rtklib software package which outputs the positional data i e including the sea level there is an option to apply these corrections by including models of the antenna phase centre these models are available for many of the geodetic antenna types including the leica ar25 base antenna although not for small low cost patch antennas such as the tw4721 rover antenna thus during the processing the corrections were applied for the leica ar25 antenna but not for the tw4721 antenna tallysman 2019 provides some antenna performance documentation for the tw4721 which suggests that the antenna phase centre variations fall in a range of 1 cm 2 5 local tidal data tidal data for comparison with the gnss buoy results were from the environment agency ea tide gauge wgs 53 18 50 2 n 04 37 13 6 w british national grid sh 25529 82870 downloaded from british oceanographic data centre bodc website www bodc ac uk and the holyhead port authority s tide gauge verbal and email communication with the harbour

data were recorded as one minute averages the ea gauge is part of the uk national tide gauge network uk coastal monitoring and forecasting 2015 and is the reference tide gauge for this experiment as bodc monitor the data quality it consists of a full tide bubbler tide gauge system woodworth and smith 2003 3 results 3 1 gnss derived tidal heights and local tide gauge data selected comparisons from the data are displayed in fig 4 a e derived tidal heights to chart datum from the gnss buoy 5 hz environment agency tide gauge 15 min averages and filtered gnss data boxcar 15 min moving averages gnss data quality is good with an exception that occurred on 11 september 2018 23 02 23 10 as illustrated in fig 4e the discontinuity was present when the gnss receiver recorded fewer quality satellite fixes hence more uncertainty in the derived position as the harbour is used 24 h a day and seven days a week any port traffic nearby could potentially cause shadowing as boats may block some of the satellite signals the fig 4a and b also show higher frequency signals in the 5 hz gnss derived sea levels which will be explored in detail in following sections oscillations of around 10 30 min which can be attributed to harbour oscillations and higher frequency oscillations of less than one minute for example see fig 4a around high water fig 4c and d shows that while the higher frequency oscillations are present in the 5 hz data the harbour oscillations are not obvious and seem to have disappeared 3 2 the van de casteele test the performance of a tide gauge can be assessed using the van de casteele test miguez et al 2008 2012 tested a variety of tide gauges and demonstrated the ability to highlight different types of tide gauge error while andré et al 2013 used it to compare data from three different gnss buoys for measuring sea level against a nearby radar tide gauge the method compares a reference tide gauge data set data known to be an accurate measurement of sea level to contemporaneous data from the tide gauge being tested h the reference sea level data h are plotted on the ordinate against the tide gauge difference δh on the abscissa x axis where δh h h the resulting diagram would produce a straight vertical line centred on x 0 for a perfect match between the two tide gauges 3 2 1 assessing the gnss buoy tide gauge accuracy before comparing the gnss data with the ea tide gauge data a 900 s boxcar moving average was applied to the gnss data and then values corresponding to the timings of the ea gauge data were resampled at fifteen minute intervals the resulting van de casteele diagram in fig 5 a indicates good agreement between the ea tide gauge and the gnss buoy tide gauge the near vertical alignment in the chart of the differences between low water and high water although not perfectively straight implies that there are no timing offsets which would result in a more ellipsoidal pattern and no obvious systematic errors e g scale error which would have introduced a large gradient from low water to high water however there is a small overall negative offset from zero this bias shown in fig 5a may be partly due to the spatial difference between the two tide gauges and or due to errors in the measurement of the antenna elevation above the water surface the mean difference between the gnss data and the ea tide gauge data was 0 011 m the standard deviation was 0 009 m and the rmse was 0 014 m some of the larger residuals are due to the presence of the harbour oscillations which are noticeable in the 900 s boxcar averaged gnss data fig 4a that are not represented in the 15 min ea tide gauge record these differences may be the result of wave damping that has been introduced within the design of the ea tide gauge bubbler system fig 6 plots the tidal differences against time left axis alongside the ea tide gauge observations right axis the time series of differences between tide gauges δh produces a tide shaped sinusoid which is mildly correlated with the tidal cycle this translates into the small slope from high tide to low tide that is evident within the van de casteele diagram fig 5a thus indicating that the gnss buoy tide gauge is performing well cf miguez et al 2008 3 3 harbour oscillations to examine the above mentioned oscillations with periods of between 10 and 30 min seen in the 5 hz data fig 4a data from the port authority tide gauge recording one minute averages were compared to the gnss derived sea level data after applying the van de casteele test described above to the port authority tidal data using the ea tidal data as the reference the test results highlight three issues with the port authority tide gauge a general datum offset a gradient away from vertical in the van de casteele test diagram fig 5b from high water to low water and large differences at low water the mean difference was 0 086 m the standard deviation was 0 034 m and the rmse was 0 092 m however these data confirm the presence of harbour oscillations seen within the gnss data fig 7 a and b which can be seen clearly across the high water period 11 september 2018 at 10 00 13 00 and to a lesser degree across the high water period 12 september 10 30 13 30 it is interesting that these oscillations are reduced in amplitude and appear to be at a different frequency during the high water period 24 h later the power spectral density psd using welch s method of the 5 hz gnss data in fig 8 indicates the presence of oscillations at frequency peaks across the 10 30 min band between 10 00 13 30 on 11 september the oscillations have a period of around 22 min while 24 h later between 10 30 13 30 on 12 september the oscillations appear to have periods of 15 and 22 min both have similar spectral density there appears to be more energy in the 10 30 min band spanning the high water on 11 september than on the corresponding high water on 12 september 3 4 higher frequency oscillations oscillations contained within the gnss data with periods shorter than one minute frequencies higher than 0 0167 hz were explored as well as noise introduced by the gnss system and ppk solution method other potential sources of the high frequency oscillations are the responses to external waves across the harbour entrance ferry movements and pitch and roll motion induced by response of the buoy platform to sea surface waves fig 9 shows the power spectral density of the 5 hz gnss derived sea level data for the periods 11 september 10 30 to 12 september 09 35 and 12 september 10 17 to 13 september 09 51 the first period is shorter in order to avoid contaminating the spectra from the poor quality data on 11 september 23 02 23 10 there are peaks at 10 s 8 s and 4 s periods which point to the presence of appreciable wave activity in the new harbour complex a possible cause of the waves could be the wakes of irish sea ferries with an extensive daily schedule to and from ireland and other port traffic on each day of the deployment there were twenty evenly spread departures and arrivals the longest gap with no scheduled ferry service was 3 5 h although the ferry arrival departure times were not always consistent with the schedule visual note made during deployment and other traffic were using the port the results are consistent with other studies on ferry wakes for example soomere 2005 observed groups of waves created by a fast ferries operating in the baltic sea with periods of 9 15 s 7 9 s and 3 4 s 3 5 uncertainty in the derived sea level solution the gnss derived sea level solution contains uncertainty related to the processing method in kinematic mode which manifests itself as resembling noise see section 2 4 on data processing to investigate this contribution and ascertain its likely effect on the derived solution another identical u blox m8t receiver and antenna were positioned on the fundamental benchmark fbm at holyhead for one hour coincident with a buoy deployment the rtklib software was then applied with the parameters listed in table 1 to obtain the vertical levels and once again using the ordnance survey gnss data as the base station applying the solution parameter of kinematic to a receiver on a fixed point stationary would therefore quantify the processing noise within the kinematic solution to compare the results the solution parameter of static was also applied to the gnss m8t receiver data at the fbm reference station the power spectral densities for the three situations are shown in fig 10 it confirms the presence of high frequency components in the gnss buoy results see section 3 4 when compared with the gnss results at the fbm the spectra support the hypothesis of locally generated waves within the new harbour the two fbm power spectra highlight the differences in the solution due to the chosen processing options static and kinematic with the static solution having much lower energy differences between the mean of each fbm solution static kinematic is small less than 1 cm and the corresponding standard deviations for each time series are 0 0024 m and 0 0097 m respectively also there is a peak of around 1 s period within the fmb kinematic mode solution fig 10 this may be an artefact of the rtklib processing software and how it copes with two different sampling rates for base and rover e g the gnss buoy recorded at 5 hz and the os gnss station data were recorded at 1 hz 4 discussion and conclusions a test deployment of an experimental buoy fitted with a gps system u blox m8t gnss receiver for measuring coastal sea level has been undertaken in holyhead harbour wales uk the gnss receiver recorded two days of 5 hz data between 11 and 13 september 2018 encompassing four high waters and four low waters the van de casteele test results comparing the gnss positioning solution with the local ea tide gauge part of the uk national tidal gauge network gave a mean difference of around 1 cm rmse 1 4 cm thus confirming that this low cost gnss buoy tide gauge can produce coastal sea level measurements that are comparable with previous deployments of more expensive gnss buoys for the same purpose e g rocken et al 1990 andre et al 2013 the 1 cm difference may be due to many factors including the instruments themselves tying errors and the way the subsequent data are analysed for example the uncertain antenna phase centre on the tallysman tw4721 antenna could produce errors up to 1 cm as specified in the antenna documentation and indeed inferred from previous studies kelecy et al 1994 marcos et al 2019 using similar antennas for base and rover receivers would almost eliminate this problem if the base site is first established using a geodetic gnss receiver and in combination with a short baseline also the differences could arise from the different hydrodynamics between the new harbour and the inner harbour i e there is a separation of 1500 m between the gnss buoy and the other tide gauges with the added complexity of a jetty which is open underneath separating the new harbour from the outer basin and inner harbour fig 2 furthermore the uncertainty within the kinematic solution may result in a bias although the experiment at the fbm reference station using both static and kinematic solutions suggest that this is smaller than 1 cm the observed harbour oscillations in the gnss and port authority tidal data are likely to be seiches rabinovich 2009 pugh and woodworth 2014 that can be set in motion by external forces such as wave energy impinging on the harbour wind tide and so on using merian s formula where the basin is open at one end and with the length of the bay corresponding to one quarter of a wavelength the natural period for the basin is τ 4l gd ½ where l is the length of the harbour d is its average depth and g is acceleration due to gravity considering the new harbour with l 1800 m and d 9 m the calculated period becomes 13 min which is similar to the observed periods of 15 and 22 min fig 8 likewise for the inner harbour which is dredged to a 5 5 m minimum depth with l 800 m and d 8 m and the whole basin i e the area of water contained within the seawall and the land towards the east fig 2 with l 3700 m and d 10 m the corresponding periods are 6 min and 25 min respectively these observed oscillations figs 7a and 8 may be related to tidal forcing since the deployment was at or just after the peak spring tides the higher frequency oscillation peaks at ten eight and four second periods shown in fig 9 are most likely caused by waves induced by the busy port traffic e g ferries to and from ireland as mentioned previously these periods are consistent with other studies on ferry waves soomere 2005 the pitch and roll of the buoy with local wind induced wavelets appear to be at much higher frequencies visual assessment of the buoy on mooring and this is what is possibly represented as the small peak in the psd beyond 1 hz e g approx 0 6 s period fig 9 whilst this may be regarded as a complicating factor in the evaluation of the gnss buoy for measuring sea level it highlights the further potential for this instrument for capturing data on local wave climate cf hein et al 1990 kelecy et al 1994 over the last decade using gnss receivers on buoys to measure sea levels has been prohibitively expensive when compared to other methods and thus they have mainly been used for specific scientific purposes however recently the overall cost for geodetic quality gnss receivers and antennas and associated loggers has fallen dramatically and these low cost packages can now deliver centimetre level accuracy for example u blox now offer a new dual frequency receiver e g zep f9p with a similar cost to the u blox m8t used in this experiment furthermore there are additional gnss systems such as galileo becoming fully operational a new carrier frequency e g l5 which when combined with advances in gnss receiver software will help to reduce errors and improve the overall positional results consequently the low cost gnss tide gauge buoy developed herein offers considerable potential for multiple deployments within survey domains and for addressing information gaps in our global network of tide gauges for monitoring coastal sea level this potential is enhanced by the gnss buoy tide gauge s compact size permitting single person deployment and its low cost making it attractive for use in low and middle income countries where financial resources for environmental monitoring are limited credit authorship

21923,the objective of this work is to investigate the transient flow around a pre swirl stator pump jet propulsor based on the discussion of the unsteady analysis we conduct a comparative study on the wake vortices generated by the hybrid rans les family at the design operating condition j 1 0 due to the interaction between the rotor and stator the rotor working behind the stator causes the fluctuant thrust however due to the oncoming flow of the rotor is improved by the pre swirl effect of the stator the thrust and pressure fluctuations on the blade surface are low intensity though the shrunk effect of the duct has significantly restricted the tip vortices development there also exits typical vortices in the wake the tip vortices induce the shear layer of the duct and then form the second vortices merging into the tip vortices generated by the next blade the hybrid rans les category catches enough and rich turbulence structures as they show improved abilities in resolving the vortices in the rotor wake where it is vital for the duct there are apparent differences in pjp hydrodynamic performance the iddes sdes and sbes show the prominent resolving ability in vortices motion and evolution than the sas and ddes keywords pjp hydrodynamics transient vortices 1 introduction the propulsion system is an essential part of the underwater carriers it ensures the navigation of autonomous underwater vehicle auv and submarine the pumpjet propulsor pjp is applied extensively in the high speed auv and submarine with the aim of achieving high thrust or lower noise level than the conventional propeller the design and performance of pjp have been widely studied by experiments and numerical calculations eisenhuth and mc cormick 1963 presented the design and performance of the pjp with the consideration of cavitation and efficiency requirements the predicted efficiency and cavitation agree well with the experiments ivanell 2001 numerically investigated the performances of pjp behind a torpedo and conducted a wind tunnel test suryanarayana et al 2010a b c carried out series experiments on the open water and cavitation performance of pjp behind a torpedo in wind tunnel and cavitation tunnel respectively and numerical analysis the results of non cavitation and cavitation show that the pjp performs well in torque balance even though the torpedo has a trim angle of 4 5 the cavitation inception of the rotor occurs on the tip surface and develops towards the suction side of the rotor as the rotating speed increases and the cavitation expands fully on the suction side of the rotor blade when the pjp operates at a very low cavitation number the numerical results show great agreement with the experimental results which indicates applying the numerical approach to predict and investigate the pjp cavitation is reliable shi et al 2015 lu et al 2016 applied the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulation to study the effects of cavitation number advance coefficient and tip clearance size on pjp cavitation performance decreasing the cavitation number or the advance coefficient will enhance the cavitation while the impacts of tip clearance on cavitation performance do not show regular change and are affected by the advance coefficient similarly pan et al 2016 investigated the cavitation performance of pjp behind an auv motallebi nejad et al 2017 employed a periodic computational domain of pjp to calculated the open water performance and did a transient analysis of the pressure field between the rotor and stator shirazi et al 2019 also had simulated the fluid flow on a full scale pjp with using the periodic computational domain and conducted several experiments with the behind hull condition in a towing tank such as bollard pull self propulsion point and bare hull results show that the stator and duct profiles should be designed very thoughtfully for avoiding the consumption of rotor thrust moreover the hull wake has a significant decrement in pjp efficiency li et al 2019 implemented a series of numerical calculations of the fluid flow on pjp with the focus on the mutual interference between the rotor and stator they discussed the unsteady effects on pjp performance with a comparative study of steady and unsteady and analyzed the exciting forces of rotor and stator both the blades of the rotor and stator have a high level of exciting force and the increase of tip clearance will enhance the level the stator shows an insufficient ability to absorb the energy in tip clearance flow with the analysis of the typical tip clearance vortices and the tip clearance flow in the stator and pjp wake wang et al 2019 proposed a tip clearance model employed in the panel method based on the potential flow theory to get a more accurate prediction of pjp performance and compared the results of the potential flow and the viscous flow based on the comparison they conducted another comparison of tip clearance flow effects on the pre swirl stator pjp and rear stator pjp the results show that the tip vortex model has little effect on the pre swirl stator pjp and plays an vital role in the rear stator pjp the rear stator pjp has an intense leakage vortex and it will get evident improvement on the calculating results by introducing the tip vortex model to model the tip leakage vortex qin et al 2019 and sun et al 2019 applied the sawtooth duct for pjp noise reduction based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation both papers numerically predicted the pjp noise with detached eddy simulation des under an open water condition and large eddy simulation les under the behind hull condition respectively results show that the sawtooth duct wastes a little efficiency of pjp and gains an improvement of the whole noise level of pjp both the papers discuss the effects of sawtooth on the vortices and pjp wake flow and it indicates that the vortices and its evolution in pjp wake represent great value of research the vortex dynamics in the wake of the ducted propeller and conventional propeller has been further researched by the experimental observation and numerical approach felli et al 2008 2011 experimentally studied the mechanism of the wake evolution and instability transition in propeller wake the mutual interference between the tip vortex of the current blade and the wake of the next one affects the instability of the propeller slipstream the multi step grouping mechanism among tip vortices is driven by the mutual inductance between adjacent spirals whose characteristics depend on the number of blades baek et al 2015 numerically studied the effect of the advance coefficient on the vortex pattern in the wake of a propeller by applying the rans simulation they successfully captured the primary vortex and conducted a detailed analysis of the main vortex behaviors chase and carrica 2013 studied the effect of rans simulation des and ddes on the propeller wake results show that the rans simulation overly dissipates the wake and the grid shows a more critical role in the convergency of thrust torque and efficiency than the time step size muscari et al 2013 also concluded that rans simulation is too dissipative with the basis of applying the rans simulation and des to investigate on the vortex dynamics in the wake of a marine propeller though the rans simulation can obtain a satisfactory prediction of global quantities such as thrust and torque with a relatively small number of grid points it is inappropriate to apply the rans simulation when unsteady fluctuation of the flow or instability processes in the wake are of interest for noise assessment for instance kumar and mahesh 2017 investigated the wake of the propeller with the focus on the mechanism of wake instability by using large eddy simulation les with 181 million hexahedral cells their numerical results indicate that the tip vortices and its interaction with the smaller vortices generated by the roll up of the blade trailing edge wake in the near wake are the mutual induction mechanisms of wake instability posa et al 2019 employed the les in about 840 million mesh nodes to discuss the wake characterization of a submarine propeller results reveal an influence of tip and hub vortices on the streamwise evolution of turbulent kinetic energy and indicate that small vortices populating the wake of each blade are short lived downstream and show limited influence on the fields of turbulent kinetic energy moving away from the propeller plane gong et al 2018 presented a comparative study on the evolution of wake vortices generated by the ducted propeller and non ducted propeller by employing the des they hold the view that the interference between duct and propeller changes the morphology of vortices and wake contraction and the shear layer of the duct has a strong interaction with the blade tip vortices based on the analysis of the power spectral density of kinetic energy they think the interference strengthens the self induction and mutual induction of vortices and accelerates the primary vortices merging and grouping zhang and jaiman 2019 applied the delayed detached eddy simulation ddes to get the flow around a ducted propeller and conducted an investigation on the vortices evolution and wake flow instability of the ducted propeller under the primary consideration of the effects of zero inflow and advance coefficient they think that the primary mechanism for the breakdown of tip leakage vortex is the short wave instability in this paper the layout is as follows section 2 presents the research object a geometric model of pjp in section 3 the numerical formulation are introduced the mesh and the problem set up are described in section 4 the discussion and analysis are exhibits in section 5 including the verifications of the mesh and time step the unsteady hydrodynamics performance the transient flow field and the comparative discussion of the vortices wake generated by the rans simulation and hybrid rans les family finally a summary of the key results can be found in section 6 2 geometry configuration a pump jet propulsor pjp with model scale and the coordinate are presented in fig 1 this model has a pre swirl stator with 8 blades and a rear rotor with 6 blades the diameter of rotor is d r 0 1664 m and the maximum diameter of stator is d s 0 2038 m the diameters of duct inlet and outlet are d t 1 0 2104 m and d t 2 0 1460 m respectively the tip clearance size between the inner duct surface and the tip face of the rotor blade is 1 0 mm the stator hub has the same conical degree with the submarine tail and extends out of the duct inlet the far field hub and the stator hub are connected by an ellipsoid for a better transition the rotor rotates around axis z and the fluid flow positive direction follows the z axis direction 3 theoretical background 3 1 governing equations the fluid is considered as incompressible with the homogeneous assumption without the body force and gravitational acceleration the navier stokes ns equations are 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i in the equations ρ and μ are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively u i is the velocity vector and p is the pressure 3 2 modeling turbulence turbulence is the three dimensional unsteady random motion in fluids at moderate to high reynolds the turbulence described by the n s equations is not feasible in most engineering situations to resolve the wide range of scales in time and space by direct numerical simulation dns as the cpu requirements would far exceed the available computing power choi and moin 2012 gave an estimation of the grid points for dns the estimation is related to reynolds number and resolving the kolmogorov length scale requires the number of grid points approximately equal to r e l x 37 14 applying the averaging procedures to the navier stokes equations to filter out all or at least parts of the turbulence spectrum would get acceptable and reliable precision in engineering fields the averaging process resulting in the rans equations introduces additional unknown terms into the transport equations that need to be provided by suitable turbulence models for turbulence closures the turbulence models simplify the problem to the solution of the additional transport equations and introduce an eddy viscosity μ t to compute the reynolds stresses the turbulence models can be simply classified according to the number of the additional transport equation for example the spalart allmaras s a model is a one equation turbulence model that is specially designed for the aerodynamics flow and the k ϵ turbulence model is a classic two equation model which has a number of derivative models compared to the k ϵ model the k ω model is a further improved two equation turbulence model and has two more improved forms called the baseline bsl k ω model and the shear stress transport sst k ω model menter 1993 though the bsl k ω model is also an improved model compared to the original k ω model the sst k ω model is a better one considering the adverse pressure gradient boundary layer flows menter 1993 1994 moreover considering pjp operates at high r e numbers the transition formulations of the sst k ω are not employed so all the hybrid rans les approaches are based on the original sst k ω model in this paper menter 1993 1994 and menter et al 2003 proposed and developed the sst k ω turbulence model that has been widely applied and validated in predicting no cavitating and cavitating flow around underwater propulsors with its advantages lu et al 2016 pan et al 2016 motallebi nejad et al 2017 li et al 2019 baek et al 2015 the turbulence kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω transport equations of sst k ω turbulence model are as follows 3 ρ k t ρ k u i x j x j μ μ t σ k k x j p k d k s k 4 ρ ω t ρ ω u i x j x j μ μ t σ ω ω x j p ω d ω c d ω s ω where the σ k and σ ω are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ω p k and p ω are the productions of k and ω respectively d k and d ω are the dissipations of k and ω respectively c d ω denotes the cross diffusion term s k and s ω are the user defined terms in the sst k ω turbulence model an additional limiter is applied for obtaining the proper transport behavior and the eddy viscosity is formulated by the following expression 5 μ t ρ k ω 1 max 1 α s f 2 a 1 ω where f 2 is a blending function the value of a 1 is 0 31 s is the strain magnitude and α is a coefficient that damps the turbulent viscosity causing a low reynolds number correction menter and egorov 2005 2010 egorov et al 2010 also proposed a scale adaptive simulation sas model by adding a source term q s a s into right of the ω equation the q s a s is formulated by the expression 6 q s a s max 3 51 ρ κ s 2 l l ν κ 2 6 ρ k max 1 ω 2 ω x j ω x j 1 k 2 k x j k x j 0 where l is the modeled turbulence length scale and l ν κ is the von kármán length scale κ is the von kármán constant rans models are suitable for many engineering applications and typically offer the level of accuracy required and provide the most economical approach however the rans models cannot offer more resolution of turbulence so with the aim of reducing the impacts of the averaging procedures on turbulence and resolving at least a portion of the turbulence for at least a portion of the flow domain an alternative to rans models is the scale resolving srs models les is the most widely known concept of srs models and widely used in academic research but the les model had very limited impact in many engineering simulations due to its excessively high resolution requirements for wall boundary layers a very fine grid near the wall and a small time step choi and moin 2012 revisited the old grid points estimation chapman 1979 and gave the new version of estimations for les both estimations require the grid points approximately equal to r e l x 9 5 and r e l x 13 7 respectively that is hard to satisfy the cpu requirements in many industrial applications where the reynolds number is far exceed 1 1 0 5 the complexity of geometry is also a limitation that causes many grids in the near wall boundary layer cai et al 2019 did a comparative study of srs models the feasibility to apply the dynamic les model is based on a periodic fluid domain though the periodic fluid domain is also applied in pjps to obtain the open water characteristic and flow field motallebi nejad et al 2017 shirazi et al 2019 it is inappropriate to analyze the transient flow of the inner field and wake of pjp and get the mutual interference characteristic between rotor and stator a hybrid rans les model spalart 1997 has been developed to avoid the high resolution requirements of les the basic hybrid rans les model is the des model which achieves the switch between rans and les by a comparison of the turbulent length scale l t with the grid spacing δ max the des has been applied in predicting propeller hydrodynamics and studying the evolution of propeller wake muscari et al 2013 gong et al 2018 zhang and jaiman 2019 and it also has been used in obtaining the flow field characteristic and noise level qin et al 2019 the des has many extensions due to the hybrid with different rans turbulence models the des with sst k ω model strelets 2001 menter et al 2003 is derived by modifying d k as 7 d k ρ β k ω f d e s where f d e s is expressed as 8 f d e s max l t c d e s δ max 1 in the expression c d e s has a value of 0 61 and δ max is the maximum local grid spacing β is a constant value of the sst model l t is the turbulent length scale 9 l t k β ω in the des model the grid spacing affects the rans solution in regions where the grid is between rans and les resolution so called gray area in des and where the flow instability is not strong enough to generate the les structures spalart et al 2006 and the des limiter becomes active and affects the rans solution in a point where the grid for an attached wall boundary layer flow is refined the lack of flow instability cannot balance the reduced rans content by resolved turbulence which results in an artificial flow separation named the grid induced separation gis menter 2016 the ddes model proposed by spalart et al 2006 offers limiter protection against the gis and an updated version of ddes named improved ddes iddes is provided by shur et al 2008 which extends the les zone of the model to the outer part of wall boundary layers the ddes model spalart et al 2006 is originally proposed for the s a model later gritskevich et al 2012 developed the formulations of ddes and iddes for sst k ω model like the des with sst k ω model a parameter f d d e s is applied to modify the d k which is expressed as 10 f d d e s l r a n s l d d e s and the ddes length scale l d d e s and rans length scale l r a n s read as follow 11 l d d e s l r a n s f d max 0 l r a n s l l e s l r a n s k c μ ω l l e s c d e s δ max where c d e s is calculated with the expression c d e s c d e s 1 f 1 c d e s 2 1 f 1 f 1 is the blending function menter et al 2003 and the model constants c d e s 1 c d e s 2 have the value of 0 78 and 0 61 respectively c μ has a constant value of 0 09 f d is a empirical delay function whose value is computed with the use of the following relations 12 f d 1 tanh c d 1 r d c d 2 r d ν t ν κ 2 d w 2 1 2 s 2 ω 2 where ν t and ν are the eddy viscosity and molecular viscosity respectively ω is the magnitude of vorticity tensor d w is the distance to the wall c d 1 and c d 2 are the constants with the values of 20 and 3 respectively similarly for the iddes a parameter f i d d e s is defined as follow 13 f i d d e s l r a n s l i d d e s compared to the ddes the l d d e s is replaced by l i d d e s whose expression is 14 l i d d e s f d 1 f e l r a n s 1 f d l l e s where the les length scale is redefined as 15 l l e s c d e s δ δ min 0 15 max d w δ m a x δ m a x where f d is the empirical function and f e is the elevating function gritskevich et al 2012 in addition there are two alternatives to des and its evolutional models in the hybrid turbulence model family the first alternative model is the shielded detached eddy simulation sdes a shielded function f s d e s is added into the k equation of sst k ω model this function protects the rans wall boundary layer against influences from the les model and results in faster transition from rans to les in separating regions the resulting sink term is equivalent to the one from the ddes model 16 ε s d e s β ρ k ω f s d e s f s d e s max l t c s d e s δ s d e s 1 f s d e s 1 1 where c s d e s is used with a value of 0 4 and the δ s d e s is formulated as 17 δ s d e s max v 3 0 2 δ max where v is the volume of the cell the second alternative model is the stress blended eddy simulation sbes menter 2016 developed from sdes the stress is blended with the following formulation 18 τ i j s b e s f s d e s τ i j r a n s 1 f s d e s τ i j l e s where τ i j r a n s is the rans portion and τ i j l e s is the les portion of the modeled stress tensor both modeled stress tensors are based on the eddy viscosity concepts whose formulation simplifies to 19 μ t s b e s f s d e s μ t r a n s 1 f s d e s μ t l e s for the subgrid scale model in sbes the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 is employed in les regions where the eddy viscosity is formulated as 20 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 and l s is defined as follows 21 l s min κ d c w v 1 3 where the constant c w is equal to 0 325 and s i j d is the traceless symmetric part of the square of the velocity gradient tensor 3 3 pjp performance parameters in order to assess the performance of pre swirl pump jet propulsor the non dimensional coefficients are defined as follows 22 j v n d r k t r t r ρ n 2 d r 4 k q

respectively the subscripts r s and d denote to the rotor stator and duct respectively η is the efficiency of pump jet propulsor 4 mesh and numerical set up the entire computational domain is divided into three sub domains of the rotor domain stator domain and external domain the external domain has the same section of 0 6 m 0 6 m with the cavitation tunnel and the length of 15 0 d r the rotor location has a distance of 5 0 d r from the inlet partitioning the entire computational domain into sub domains offers the convenience of mesh generation all the sub domains were generated with structure mesh and both the mesh of rotor and stator were generated by the periodic grid of one blade the close up views of the fine mesh are given in fig 2 for the pjp the reynolds number r e is defined as ρ c 1 0 r v 2 π n d r 2 μ where c 1 0 r is chord length at 1 0 r and r is the radius of rotor blade the r e ranges from 9 25 1 0 5 to 9 88 1 0 5 in the simulations according to the r e near the walls the heights of first layers are 2 1 0 5 m and 5 1 0 5 m for tip clearance and other wall boundaries respectively that is appropriate for the rans solver and the hybrid rans les family solvers the height of the first layer δ y is calculated by a estimation formulation yielded from a flat plate with a reynolds number of r e l p ρ u l p μ where the u is the characteristic velocity and l p is the length of the plate the definition of the dimensionless distance from the wall y is y δ y u τ ν where u τ is the wall friction velocity according to the definition of wall shear stress coefficient c f 2 ρ u τ 2 ρ u 2 2 u τ u 2 and the correlation between the plate c f and the reynolds number c f 0 027 r e l p 1 7 white and corfield 2006 then the estimation formulation of the height of first layer can be yielded as δ y y l p 74 r e l p 13 14 three groups of coarse medium and fine mesh are generated with the same topology structure and have the same height of the first layer near the wall the max cell volume in the duct inner flow field of the fine mesh is approximate to 2 d r 1 d r 1 d r and the max cell volume is less than 1 d r 1 d r 1 d r in rotor domain the mesh number distribution details are listed in table 1 the total mesh number is 15 50 million m which includes 5 77m of rotating part and 9 73m of stationary parts another finer mesh very fine mesh system shown in fig 1 is generated by refining the rotor wake and pjp wake both in axis direction and circumference direction and limiting the max cell volume less than 1 d r 1 d r 1 d r in the inner flow field of the duct the boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 a uniform flow with the velocity value v corresponding to the advance coefficient j of pjp and the turbulence intensity of the default value 5 is set on the inlet boundary the outlet boundary is a pressure outlet with the fixed pressure p o u t equal to 1 a t m the far field wall is set as a zero shear stress wall during the simulations the rotor revolution speed n is 20 r s three group mesh of coarse medium and fine are used to study the grid effect on predicting the hydrodynamics of pjp by steady simulation for the transient calculations based on the fine mesh different time steps of 0 5 δ t 1 0 δ t corresponded to one degree for rotor revolution and 2 δ t are set to estimate the time step size impacts on open water characteristic of pjp both the mesh and time step verifications are implemented by rans solver with the sst k ω turbulence model based on the mesh verification the fine mesh and very fine mesh are going to be used in studying the rotor wake and pjp wake flow field with modeling the turbulence by rans and hybrid rans les family approaches all the simulations are solved by fluent with the simplec scheme a second order discretization of momentum and standard discretization of pressure are used the discretization of the transient term depends on the turbulence modeling method in addition all the steady operating conditions are conducted on the workstation intel r xeon r silver 4216 cpu 2 10 ghz 64 threads and all the unsteady calculations are performed in a cloud computing platform ccp anon 0000 5 results and discussion 5 1 verification of grid and time following the ittc 2008 guidelines for a solution variable ϕ numerical errors are decomposed into iterative errors δ i t ϕ grid size error δ g ϕ time step error δ t ϕ and other parameters related errors δ o p ϕ the simulation numerical uncertainty u s n ϕ is expressed as 23 u s n 2 ϕ u i t 2 ϕ u g 2 ϕ u t 2 ϕ u o p 2 ϕ where the subscripts follow the same denotation as numerical errors components for the corrected approach the estimated numerical error δ s n ϕ and corrected uncertainty u c s n ϕ are given by 24 δ s n ϕ δ i t ϕ δ g ϕ δ t ϕ δ o p ϕ u c s n 2 ϕ u c i t 2 ϕ u c g 2 ϕ u c t 2 ϕ u c o p 2 ϕ however in most practical engineering applications the numerical errors related to other parameters are ignored and iterative uncertainty is negligible for steady simulations the convergency study needs at least 3 solutions solved with the meshes following a systematic refinement process for the parameter i under investigations all other parameters should be holden constant the refinement ratio r i is used to estimate the input parameter refining level for grid refinement a uniform parameter r g is required the recommended value of r i is 2 in ittc guidelines ittc 2008 so in this present work the value of r g is set equal to 1 4 in the mesh refining procedure and for the input parameter of time the time refinement ratio r t has the value of 2 the convergency ratio r i ϕ for the input parameter is expressed as 25 r i ϕ s i 2 ϕ s i 1 ϕ s i 3 ϕ s i 2 ϕ where s i 1 ϕ s i 2 ϕ and s i 3 ϕ represent three different solutions with fine medium and coarse input parameter respectively three conditions are possible 1 0 r i ϕ 1 monotonic convergence 2 1 r i ϕ 0 oscillatory convergence 3 r i ϕ 1 divergence the richardson extrapolation re is used to estimate u i ϕ δ i ϕ and u c i ϕ when r i ϕ represents a monotonic convergency for oscillatory convergency u i ϕ is estimated with the average of oscillatory maximum and minimum simulated values based on monotonic convergency the normalized discretization error δ r e i ϕ and order of accuracy p i ϕ are defined as follows 26 δ r e i ϕ s i 2 ϕ s i 1 ϕ r i p

value δ i 21 a ϕ is the approximate error and δ i 21 e x t ϕ is the extrapolated relative error in this case r i 21 and r i 32 are equal to r i so q p ϕ is zero table 2 and fig 3 show the mean y value and the y distributions of rotor surface stator surface and duct surface at j 1 0 the mean y is lower than 5 and the higher y main locate at the rotor leading edge near blade tip and stator leading edge near duct tables 3 and 4 list the mesh independency analysis results of k t and k q by applying two different approaches except for the design point j 1 0 the other three operating points are also given all the results indicate the three mesh groups of coarse medium and fine are monotonic convergence and it has more sensitive on the mesh when the pjp operates at high advance coefficients though both approaches of the correction factor and grid convergency index show the same trend for the results of all the calculated advance coefficients the results of grid convergency index represent greater range of uncertainty which has lower output values with better input parameters and higher output values with poor input parameters compared to the correction factor approach that also can be understood that the gci approach shows more distinguishable outputs with the same convergence ratio value for instance an input of k t at j 0 2 it differs an order of magnitude of uncertainty moreover with a modified definition of p i a convergence ratio at oscillatory convergence also can be used to estimate the gci value with all other parameters holden constants the steady results indicate good convergence as the grid is refined based on the fine mesh the time independency was conducted and the analysis is shown in table 5 in the unsteady results it gets 2 87 increment of k t at j 1 0 k t and k q has a slight change between the time step of δ t and 0 5 δ t the uncertainty analysis applying the correction factor approach illustrates that it has tiny uncertainty so in the following calculations the time step of δ t was set which corresponds to one degree of rotor revolution and it is appropriate for propulsor hydrodynamics calculating furthermore the mesh size and time step effects on flow field details open water curves and thrust coefficient convergence are represented in figs 4 and 5 the mesh density mainly has significant effects on the velocity magnitudes in tip regions and the near hub regions in the rotor domain where the fluid flow is complex and high turbulent the contours with medium mesh and fine mesh show more similar distributions than the coarse mesh for the tip regions and its downstream the fine mesh have more resolution capacity and represents the obvious difference which indicates that the fine mesh has the greater ability to capture the tip clearance flow and can represent more appropriate calculation based on the fine mesh the finer time step has better resolution in rotor outflow and pjp wake and it shows little difference between the time step of 1 0 δ t and 0 5 δ t for the unsteady simulations a whole period of rotor revolution is necessary and at least until the k t curve develops into a stage with stable fluctuation the vorticity is calculated with the gradient of velocity components it shows the same results that the time steps of 1 0 δ t and 0 5 δ t have no obvious difference in capturing the flow field main vortices following the k t time curves it indicates again that the time step 1 0 δ t is proper for calculation and can decrease the cpu time requirement 5 2 open water performance the open water curves under steady and unsteady simulations the unsteady effects and torque balance are represented in fig 6 and the unsteady results are the time averaged value in a stable period unlike the pump jet propulsor eisenhuth and mc cormick 1963 suryanarayana et al 2010a c b motallebi nejad et al 2017 shirazi et al 2019 li et al 2019 which is mainly applied to high speed auv or torpedo this pump jet propulsor shows great difference in its operating conditions the range of the advance coefficient has a similar value with that of the traditional propeller felli et al 2008 chase and carrica 2013 baek et al 2015 posa et al 2019 cai et al 2019 it has some evident differences between the steady and unsteady calculations the unsteady calculation simulates the rotor inlet flow more proper and considers the mutual interference between the pre swirl stator and the rotor and this causes some differences with the steady predictions with the synchro increments or decrements of k t and k q the open water efficiency η presents the negligible changes the k t contains k t r k t s and k t d and k t r shares the major change of k t between the steady and unsteady calculations comparing to the changes of k t s and k t d the stator provides a negative thrust at all the advance coefficients k t d presents a monotonically decreasing and it has the minimum absolute value when j locates around 0 8 owing to the rational placement of stator k q s shows negative value and hence offset some torque generated by the rotor this is beneficial for the submarine balance except for the k t d at j 0 8 the relative values between steady and unsteady predictions of k t r k t s k t d k q r and k q s locate between 1 and 4 because the k t d gets a value around zero at j 0 8 it conducts an abnormal value when the relative value is applied to estimate the level of change between steady and unsteady predictions according to the relative values it explains that the unsteady simulation is essential when there exists mutual interference in pjp unlike the pump jet propulsor with a rear stator which is properly designed and placed for recycling the circumference component velocity in rotor wake to offer the reverse torque for balance and some thrust for offsetting the duct drag the pump jet propulsor with a pre swirl stator performs not well in torque balance because its stator is mainly designed for generating a pre swirl inlet flow for rotor furthermore the experimental data of the k t r and k q r is given the experiment was executed in the science and technology on water jet propulsion laboratory of marine design and research institute of china the trend and the magnitude level are acceptable and in agreement with the experimental results though there are some differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients the k t r and k q r coefficients show the same tendency of decaying and increasing patterns according to the loading conditions respectively we suggest that this difference can be attributed to inherent numerical analysis results in the flow due to the complex interaction between the rotor and stator and the relatively large and highly complex vortical structures that separate from the rotor blades and act on the downstream inner duct therefore the numerical approach applied for this study is appropriate for investigating flow characteristics past the pjp in fig 6 δ k q describes the relative change between the stator torque and rotor torque while the rotor torque decreases as the advance coefficient increases the absolute value of stator torque increases as the advance increases and they achieve the approximately same absolute value when j locates around 0 8 around the design point j 1 0 the torque generated by the stator needs the additional value over 20 of rotor torque to balance the rotor torque but this is not the primary consideration of the stator design for the design point j 1 0 the time domain curves of k t k t r k t s k t d k q r and k q s in one period are shown in fig 7 the curve of k t consisting of k t r k t s k t d is fluctuant which means there exists the periodic existing force the k t r contributes almost the whole fluctuant force the stator has a pre swirl effect on the inlet flow of the rotor which causes the periodic fluctuation to the curves of rotor thrust and torque with mutual interference it also causes periodic effects on the stator and duct k t r and k q r show more greater fluctuation range than k t s k t d k q s for the stator because it locates at the upstream of rotor and has a large distance from the rotor and the suction effect of rotor has slightly impacts on stator k t s and k q s present indistinct range of fluctuation though the ordinates are enlarged to 10 3 and 10 4 respectively for the duct and rotor the rotor operating at a non uniform oncoming flow results in the obviously periodic fluctuation of k t r k t d and k q r under the same enlarged level of ordinate respectively the time domain curve has 24 crests and 24 troughs where the number 24 is the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8 corresponded to the number of rotor blade and that of stator blade respectively for all the non dimensional coefficients the intensities of the fluctuations are lower than 1 of the time averaged value it shows that the stator provides the pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of rotor and concurrently causes acceptable and low level exciting effects on the stator rotor and duct furthermore applying the fast fourier transform fft method the frequency domain curves of k t r k t s k t d k q r and k q s at all the advance coefficients are presented in fig 8 the shaft frequency sf is equal to the revolution speed of the rotor the blade passing frequency bpf of the rotor depends on the sf and the blade number of the rotor similarly the stator also has a bpf depending on the sf and the blade number of the stator under the effect of mutual interference except for the direct current dc components all the curves have a characteristic peak at the frequency f 480 hz where the frequency corresponds to the lowest common multiple of the bpfs of stator and rotor and the amplitude is far higher than the amplitudes of the rest of the frequency domain a characteristic peak appearing at f 480 hz indicates that this peak is conjointly affected by the stator and rotor meanwhile for the frequency domain curve of k t r or k q r another second characteristic peak locates at the frequency f 240 hz where the amplitude is lower than the amplitude at f 480 hz and the frequency is double of the rotor bpf this means that it is mainly influenced by the rotor for every frequency domain curve under every advance coefficient the amplitude at f 480 hz is much smaller than the dc component table 6 gives the relative intensities of the amplitude under the percentage of the dc components though the amplitudes are affected by the advance coefficient and show higher value at a low advance coefficient the relative intensities of amplitudes are smaller than 0 2 this indicates that the exciting forces of stator rotor and duct are acceptable the stator offers a pre swirl impact on the oncoming flow of the rotor and has little exciting force effect on the whole performance of pjp the thrust of the rotor and stator consist of the thrusts of per blade of rotor and stator respectively the fluctuation means that per blade works in a periodic flow field in fig 9 the thrust of one blade in the time domain and frequency domain are shown k t b is the thrust coefficient of one blade and defined as 33 k t b t b ρ n 2 d r 4 where the t b is the thrust of one blade as the greatest common divisor of the numbers of rotor blade and stator blade is 2 the k t b curves of rotor blades divide into three groups with different phases blade 1 and 4 blade 2 and 5 blade 3 and 6 every curve has 8 crests and 8 troughs where the number is equal to the number of stator blades moreover the crest values and trough values among groups are slightly different the resultant force of the thrusts of rotor blades shows 24 crests and 24 troughs under the effects of three groups because all the k t b curves of rotor blades have different phases the fluctuation of k t r curve presents a lower level and thus shows lower fluctuant intensity in the frequency domain the curves have the typical peaks at f 160 hz which is equal to the bpf of the stator similarly the k t b curve of per stator blade has 6 crests and 6 troughs and all the k t b curves are divided into four groups the k t b curve of per stator blade in the frequency domain has the peaks at f 120 hz which is equal to the rotor bpf from the frequency domain curve of k t r it cannot be known that which one of bpf or all the bpfs decides the frequency f 480 hz as it is the lowest common multiple of the bpfs of stator and rotor here comparing the k t b curve of per rotor blade and the k t r curve it can be gotten that for the k t r k t d k q r the frequency f 480 hz depends on the stator bpf as it is three times of stator bpf and the frequency f 240 hz depends on the rotor bpf as it is double times of rotor bpf moreover for the k t s or k q s the peak at f 480 hz depends on the rotor bpf as it is four times of the rotor bpf 5 3 transient flow field the force curves of the rotor blades and stator blades indicate that though the stator offers a pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of the rotor the flow is also not uniform and thus affects the force of the rotor blades which work in different advance angles the pre swirl effect mainly provides the circumferential velocity to improve the advance angle of the blade section so the uniform intensity of the circumferential velocity represents the level of pre swirl effect in fig 10 show the distributions of velocity components at j 1 0 the axial velocity accelerates in the flow direction under the rotor operation and is also affected by the stator differing from the above mentioned velocity components the radial velocity shows lower values and is mainly caused by the angle of the duct and the hub composing the inner flow field of pjp and thus presents negative value because of the shrunk inner flow field in the flow direction the stator shows the evident pre swirl effect as it presents a higher value of the radial velocity between the stator and rotor before the stator with the uniform oncoming flow from the inlet boundary it almost no circumferential velocity in s 1 slice at s 2 slice though it is close to the stator inlet there are no apparent changes in the distribution of the circumferential velocity after the pre swirl stator high circumferential velocity exists in the stator wake shown in s 3 slice and periodically distributes in the circumferential direction the nonuniform distribution of the rotor oncoming flow contributes to the exciting force of the rotor during its operation in the rotor wake the circumferential velocity goes to a lower level and periodically distributes in rotor wake the stator generates the pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of the rotor and carries the wake effect on the flow at the same time so for the stator with a pre swirl design a proper large distance between the trailing edge of the stator and the leading edge of the rotor is beneficial for the oncoming flow of the rotor to reduce the wake effect and thus decrease the exciting fore of rotor in fig 11 the c p contours of one blade under different time steps during 1 8 operation period are shown where the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 34 c p p p 0 5 ρ π n d r 2 on the suction side the areas of pressure obviously changing are located on the leading edge near the hub and the middle of the tip where the pressures are local lower the pressure change on the leading edge areas is mainly affected by the nonuniform oncoming flow as the rotor works in the stator wake comparatively the tip clearance flow directly acts on the pressure of the tip region the tip region is indirectly affected by the stator wake as the tip clearance flow begins at the leading edge of the tip where is primarily influenced by the stator wake and the wall flow of the inner duct meanwhile on the pressure side the tip clearance flow shows a slight effect on the pressure of the tip as the area of the pressure obviously changing locates at the leading edge of the blade close to the rotor hub a series of monitor points close to the inner surface of the duct based on the origin coordinate is shown in fig 12 where r 1 is 0 0841m and the c p curves of corresponding points are shown in fig 13 the pressure of the points is periodically affected by the rotor operating as it shows series peaks at the rotor bpf and the harmonic the amplitudes of peaks have the same order of c p magnitude the pressure of the tip region is highly fluctuant and this will propagate to the downstream and the pjp wake as the blade tip passes the tip clearance flow carrying low pressure acts on the locations of monitor points and presents a trough in c p curves the c p curves show the larger fluctuant range and have a larger proportion of negative value this means the tip zones are relatively low pressure most of the time of the rotor operating a whole period the c p changes periodically indicates that though the operating of the rotor does not result in obvious changes in the pressure of the blade tip surface it causes not only the fluctuation of pressure on the inner surface of the duct but also the periodic tip clearance flow with higher pressure gradient transmitting to downstream from the c p contours though it presents a slight change of pressure on most of the surface of the blade the pressure is highly fluctuant and periodic near the leading edge under the mutual interference between stator and rotor in fig 14 fluctuation intensity of pressure in one period n t 360 is presented which is defined by the root mean square error of pressure σ p the σ p is calculated by the time mean pressure p for every grid node and the formulations are as follows 35 σ p 1 n t n 1 n t p t p p 1 n t n 1 n t p t where n t is the statistical time steps p t is the statistical time variant pressure of a grid node the c p contours follow the similar distribution to c p from the c p contour the local low pressure areas are located at the middle tip region and the blade leading edge near the hub and the local high pressure areas are located at the blade trailing edge near the tip the low pressure area means it is easy to cavitate if the surrounding pressure decrease until the vapor pressure of water for the high pressure area the blade thickness of its location is thin under higher pressure difference it is harmful to the blade structural strength most of the blade surface is covered with σ p lower than 100pa the higher σ p mainly exists on the leading edge of the rotor blade though the tip region is the second local low pressure zone its σ p is much lower than the leading edge area the σ p distribution means that the periodic pressure component on the rotor blade is low that is why the k t b of rotor blade show a lower fluctuant level for the stator blade σ p of almost the whole blade surface is lower than 200pa and it results in a very low fluctuant level of the thrust and torque of the stator blade 5 4 wake vortices the transient pressure field indicates the tip clearance flow carries high pressure gradient propagating to the wake so it is worth discussing the wake and its evolution in fig 15 the pressure distribution of wake is affected by the advance coefficient as it has a broader region distributed with high pressure at a high advance coefficient though the tip clearance flow with local low pressure has a lower pressure center when the rotor blade works with heavy load low advance coefficient it shows a more prolonged effect in the wake when the pjp works at the operating conditions with high open water efficiency for instance j 0 8 and j 1 0 the heavy load on the blade aggravates the instability of the rotor wake and thus effects the tip clearance flow propagating to downstream as the advance coefficient increases the inner duct near the rotor wake and the leading edge of the inner duct show high pressure and thus it causes the duct thrust from positive to negative the pressure of the inner duct is conjointly affected by the rotor and the oncoming flow with the rotor revolution speed fixed the increase of oncoming flow will decrease the rotor suction effect and then it shows local higher pressure distribution of the inner duct at a high advance coefficient in the wake of the rotor and duct larger vorticity exists the vorticity in the duct wake mergers into the vorticity in the rotor wake and then enhances it comparatively though the vorticity in the stator wake is weak it passes through the rotor blades and also affects an extended region in the pjp wake as the vorticity in the stator wake is affected by the rotor wake and depends on the velocity of the flow through the stator the vorticity in the stator wake shows a larger intensity and long effect region in the pjp wake when the pjp works at high open water efficiency the wake vortices are identified by q criterion hunt et al 1988 and visualized with the iso surface value of q 10000 s 2 shown in fig 16 relatively the q criterion shows more visible results in identifying the vortices than the pressure or vorticity zhang et al 2018 the hub vortex in the wake shows the larger intensity and the longer region as the advance coefficient goes down near the stator hub a vortex beginning from the trailing edge of the stator is cut off by the rotor blade and exhibits a series of segments in the rotor downstream before the rotor the vortices in the stator wake is enhanced as the advance coefficient increase and this follows the changing trend of vorticity magnitude behind the rotor the vortices from the stator wake are sharply weakened as the wake velocity of the rotor blade accelerates the vortices propagation and dissipation for the typical tip vortices its development follows the same trend of open water efficiency as it shows a prolonged region and remains the shape in the flow direction when the pjp works at high open water efficiency the tip vortices shape is strongly constricted by the shrunk duct in the radial direction when the vortices pass through the duct outlet the tip vortices induce the shear layer on the duct outlet and then curl into sub vortices and merge into the tip vortices from the next rotor blade this enhances the tip vortices develop long distance in the downstream with the fine mesh system it can present the difference in the effect of the advance coefficient on the pjp wake and a coarse view on its vortices evolution moreover the sst k ω turbulence model has the ability to obtain the difference in the vortices wake as the j changes however there are many alternatives turbulence models to model the vortices motion and its evolution better so with the aim to investigate the effect of hybrid rans les models on the vortices in pjp wake the fine mesh is refined into the very fine mesh system shown in fig 2 and the design point j 1 0 is selected to conduct these calculations in table 7 the sst term is the relative difference of the hydrodynamics coefficient between the very fine mesh and the fine mesh and the rest of the terms are the relative differences of the high hierarchy models to the sst with very fine mesh system refining the mesh has over 1 difference in the duct thrust as the rotor wake inside the duct is calculated on the finer mesh which has a significant impact on the tip clearance flow directly acting on the inner duct behind the rotor except the k t d in which the sas causes over 1 difference the sas and ddes show slight changes of all the hydrodynamics coefficients the iddes model causes large decreases in the thrust of the rotor among all the models the sdes and sbes cause over 5 relative difference in k t d and also have apparent changes in stator thrust and torque a comparison of the contours of pressure vorticity magnitude and q distributions in fine mesh and very fine mesh are demonstrated in fig 17 the mesh size has only a noticeable effect on the pressure distribution in the vortices the finer mesh decreases and delays the pressure dissipation of vortices regions and that results in more distinct vortices cores due to the local lowest pressure on the duct outlet the vortex core before flowing out the duct is indistinct under the vorticity the vortex shows more clear locations than the pressure but the effect of the tip vortices on the duct wake is not so distinct with the very fine mesh the effect presents a clear display but the vorticity shows some unconcerned areas when the vortex cores need to identify the q criterion better captures the vortex core however it is also strongly affected by mesh density in this work the very fine mesh system shows a clear view of the merging of tip vortices and duct wake vortices the vortex cores are marked under the identifications of the pressure vorticity magnitude and q criterion respectively the q criterion shows the more typical vortex cores and clear representation the locations of vortex cores under q criterion are given in table 8 though the locations indicate that there is a slight difference in the two mesh groups as mentioned before the very fine mesh is more proper to discuss the vortices wake some locations under the very fine mesh system are set as probes to monitor the variables for a comparative discussion of different hybrid turbulence models at the design point j 1 0 the iso surface of q criterion under different turbulence models with very fine mesh presented in fig 18 describes the motion and evolution of the wake vortices the inducing of the tip vortices on the shedding vortices from the duct trailing edge is distinguishable and thus the sub vortices occur as the sub vortices is a segment and then merges into the tip vortices the intensity of the tip vortices is inhomogeneous in the circumferential direction and also increases the instability of the tip vortices moreover the inducing vortices have slightly decelerated the primary tip vortices the sst turbulence model only can capture the main vortices and it also shows a large dissipation of vortices in the flow direction as the mesh is fine and the resolution is sufficient to get the resolved turbulent structures the sas solution does not fallback to urans and thus offers a more different wake vortices structure than the sst the eddy simulation category has the advantage of modeling the vortices motion and its evolution comparing the ddes and iddes the ddes shows a long stable region of the wake vortices in the flow direction the ddes protects the vortices from developing into the sub scale vortices and it shows less ability to capture small vortices in iddes sdes and sbes the delay effect on the vortices evolution is much lower than the ddes and the mutual inductance exists in the pairing vortices from the blade and the next blade as described in widnall s works widnall 1972 with the helix filament the short wave instability is built up inside the vortex cores the instability begins early in the iddes and sbes as it shows more twisted shapes before the tip vortices inducing the duct shear layer to sub scale vortices the instability is perturbation between the pairing vortices and thus induces the secondary vortices moreover the development of the massive secondary vortices will further enhance the inducement and the mutual interference between the main pairing vortices though the induced vortices shedding from the duct trailing edge enhance the intensities of wake vortices the instability also increases the vortices beginning on the shear layer of the trailing edge of the inner duct is instable as it is induced by unstable tip vortices from the upstream this induced vortices merging into the next tip vortices and increases the instability of the tip vortices pairing in the downstream in the downstream as the instability develops into an uncontrolled state under the tip vortices all the vortices break up into massive small vortices and dissipate in the wake for the hub vortices the sst result presents a stable shape in the downstream in the sas and ddes the hub vortices remain its shape and show a long transition stage in the sdes and sbes the hub vortices hold the form in the near wake and then demonstrate the clear transition to small vortices the difference is that the sbes provides an early transition and more diffuse vortices after the transition the iddes does not give a transition stage of the hub vortices as the hub vortices diffuse from its begin place on the hub tail the vortices beginning from the trailing edge of the stator blade present weaker shape under the sst modeling the sas and ddes have captured the early stage of the vortices in stator wake before the rotor but after the rotor due to the effect of rotor wake the sas and ddes show an unclear representation of the dissipation comparing to the iddes sdes and sbes the turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence viscosity ratio μ t μ at different slices are demonstrated in figs 19 and 20 as a whole the sdes and sbes give a low k level while the ddes and iddes show the moderate k level and the high k level is presented in sst and sas except for the tip vortices regions where the ddes gives a much higher k value and the iddes gives a low k which is lower than the k of the rotor blade wake the ddes and iddes present the same k distribution higher k exists in the wakes in the sst and sas calculations especially the tip regions where the k is much higher in sst due to the low ability to resolve turbulence in the sst model it remains a high net value of k production in the tip vortices region and downstream where the small scale turbulence is highly modeled and filtered the distributions of k in sst and sas are similar because it lacks relatively strong flow instabilities switching to srs mode in sas thus the sas remains in sst mode and will not produce unsteady structures the iddes in wall modeled les wmles requires the specification of the inflow conditions without any turbulent content and becomes active when the grid of boundary layer type precludes the resolution of the dominant eddies as the iddes has more strict applying conditions and the boundary layer and the dominant vortices are hybrid in the tip regions it causes an abnormal k distribution comparing to other models the sdes and sbes shielding properties are much improved and rapid transition relative to ddes they provide more resolved turbulence and thus lower k in the wake as the μ t demonstrates the relationship between the reynolds stress and the time averaged variables and the μ is a constant the μ t μ indicates the level of the resolved turbulence scale for the sst high value and the large area of μ t μ means the turbulence is more modeled and a high prediction of the turbulent stress overall the iddes exhibits abnormal results in the tip vortices region where the μ t μ is lower than the μ t μ in the wake of the rotor blade similarly the distribution of μ t μ given by sas does not show the distinction between the tip vortices region and the wake of the rotor blade saying the abnormal it is because that many previous studies show that the tip region and downstream are much turbulent than other places in the propeller duct propeller and pump jet propulsor fluid domains comparatively the sdes and sbes offer more resolved turbulence in the fluid domain and clearly distinguish the high turbulence area between the ddes and sbes as the sbes switches reliably and swiftly from the rans to les in separating shear layer and uses the les model in the les portion of the flow instead of relying on the les capability of des like models more resolved turbulence areas exist in the wake and more apparent distinction between the vortices than the sdes provided is shown especially the tip flow region the power spectral density psd curves of turbulence kinetic energy at the probes v 3 v 4 v 9 are given in the fig 21 all the psd curves have many tonal components and wide broadband components for the tonal components it mainly has the relationship to the motion of dominant eddies while the broadband components indicate the small scale turbulence in the near field v 3 the sst and sas give similar results in the low frequency band moreover the main difference between sst and sas is that many peaks with high amplitudes occur at the moderate frequency band as some portions of the flow field are in the srs model the ddes and iddes also present the same trend of psd curves except that the iddes gives a low psd in the low frequency band and the very smaller amplitude of psd at bpf and the harmonics comparatively the psd curves of sdes and sbes is far different from the psd curves of the mentioned above models the tonal components show low psd and decay slowly at the low frequency band for the broadband components though they have low values of psd there is no decay in the low frequency band in v 4 where the effects of the induced vortices from the shear layer of the inner duct are included it demonstrates some sub level tonal components in the moderate frequency band moreover all the models show the increase of the broadband components at the high frequency band in the far field v 9 the sst exhibits a quickly decaying trend and has more peaks on account of the over modeled of turbulence in sst the sas also presents clear peaks with high amplitude at the bpf and its harmonics in the low frequency band due to the lack of instabilities and shows high psd in the moderate and high frequency bands the ddes gives a similar result to sst while iddes shows the same decay trend with sdes and sbes but the psd value is far higher than the psd presented by sdes and sbes from the k and μ t μ distributions and the visualized q criterion in the flow direction the ddes sdes and sbes are the better choices for easily applied in pjp calculation and fewer requirements of applying conditions than the iddes furthermore the sbes is applied to resolve the wake vortices at all operating conditions shown in fig 22 with the mesh refined and especially the improved ability to resolve the turbulence of sbes more scale turbulence and the detailed motion and evolution of vortices are demonstrated as the advance coefficient increase the slipstream which is the jet flow separating the undisturbed flow region is narrower and the filaments of the tip vortices are enhanced and well organized at high advance coefficients the distance between the filaments of the contiguous tip vortices increases and the tip vortices sustain longer due to the more unstable filaments at the low advance coefficient the tip vortices break down and develop into more sub scale vortices moreover as the tip vortices becoming more unstable early before moving out the duct outlet it affects the induced vortices shedding from the duct shear layer the induced vortices are also more unstable and thus merge into the tip vortices and enhance the vortices breaking the distance between the filaments of the contiguous tip vortices depends on the pitch of the tip vortices so the smaller distance results in easily disturbing and stronger inducing effect between the groups of tip vortices when the pjp works at low advance coefficient at the low advance coefficient the vortices faster transit into the unstable regions and massive small vortices evolve to the downstream when the advance coefficient increases the tip vortices have a larger ability to hold its shape and the transition stage becomes more prolonged and in the transition the secondary vortical structures exhibit more clear vision the secondary vortices wrap around the main tip vortex and play a bridge effect on the contiguous primary tip vortices and thus cause the interaction the partially ordered structures of the primary and secondary vortices tend to break down into progressively smaller structures and as a consequence of the inflow conditions different portions of the wake experience different dynamic evolutions at the end of the transition stage 6 conclusions in this paper a transient study of the pjp hydrodynamics and a comparative study of the hybrid rans les methods for modeling the pjp wake are carried out the rans simulation with sst k ω model is mainly applied in obtain the unsteady characteristics of the pjp based on the rans results some studies of the detailed verifications the unsteady hydrodynamics performance the transient flow field the vortices wake are performed moreover after a discussion of the vortices wake generated by rans the turbulence models including the sas ddes iddes sdes and sbes are adopted to resolve the pjp wake in a refining mesh system for the multi components propulsor considering the interaction between the components is much important than the conventional propeller and the pre stator pjp demonstrates a vast difference in hydrodynamics performance comparing with the post stator pjp due to a pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of the rotor though the pjp shows the exciting forces especially the rotor the intensities are low and the pressure fluctuation indicates low strength during the operation the tip flow field is slightly affected by the pre swirl flow the pre swirl flow improves the attack angle of the rotor which is better for the rotor stably operating unlike the post stator proper designed for better torque balance and some positive thrust the pre stator has different design purposes which are to offer the pre swirl flow for low vibration and noise level with the basis of abandoning some thrust and balance differing from the post stator pjp the circumferential velocity component in the rotor wake is not recycled and the tip vortices of the rotor blades are also not severely affected though the shrunk duct restricts the tip vortices and the inducing vortices increase the instabilities of the wake vortices it has no effects on absorbing the circumferential velocity component and destroying the tip vortices structures compared to the rear stator the tip vortices are also affected by the load on the rotor blade and the duct wake as they have a more prolonged zone when the pjp works at high efficiency moreover in order to generate the pre swirl flow the stator has a specific shape and thus forms a vortex in the wake and propagates to the downstream of the rotor the hybrid rans les models show the outstanding abilities in resolving the turbulence among them the iddes sdes and sbes model the vortices transition and the inducement of a pairing vortices the sdes and sbes resolve more sub scale turbulence in the wake the sas shows apparent changes in vortex motion and evolution comparing to the rans and offers a minor improvement in resolve the turbulence the ddes presents similar results to the sas but performs better in modeling the turbulence credit authorship contribution

21923,the objective of this work is to investigate the transient flow around a pre swirl stator pump jet propulsor based on the discussion of the unsteady analysis we conduct a comparative study on the wake vortices generated by the hybrid rans les family at the design operating condition j 1 0 due to the interaction between the rotor and stator the rotor working behind the stator causes the fluctuant thrust however due to the oncoming flow of the rotor is improved by the pre swirl effect of the stator the thrust and pressure fluctuations on the blade surface are low intensity though the shrunk effect of the duct has significantly restricted the tip vortices development there also exits typical vortices in the wake the tip vortices induce the shear layer of the duct and then form the second vortices merging into the tip vortices generated by the next blade the hybrid rans les category catches enough and rich turbulence structures as they show improved abilities in resolving the vortices in the rotor wake where it is vital for the duct there are apparent differences in pjp hydrodynamic performance the iddes sdes and sbes show the prominent resolving ability in vortices motion and evolution than the sas and ddes keywords pjp hydrodynamics transient vortices 1 introduction the propulsion system is an essential part of the underwater carriers it ensures the navigation of autonomous underwater vehicle auv and submarine the pumpjet propulsor pjp is applied extensively in the high speed auv and submarine with the aim of achieving high thrust or lower noise level than the conventional propeller the design and performance of pjp have been widely studied by experiments and numerical calculations eisenhuth and mc cormick 1963 presented the design and performance of the pjp with the consideration of cavitation and efficiency requirements the predicted efficiency and cavitation agree well with the experiments ivanell 2001 numerically investigated the performances of pjp behind a torpedo and conducted a wind tunnel test suryanarayana et al 2010a b c carried out series experiments on the open water and cavitation performance of pjp behind a torpedo in wind tunnel and cavitation tunnel respectively and numerical analysis the results of non cavitation and cavitation show that the pjp performs well in torque balance even though the torpedo has a trim angle of 4 5 the cavitation inception of the rotor occurs on the tip surface and develops towards the suction side of the rotor as the rotating speed increases and the cavitation expands fully on the suction side of the rotor blade when the pjp operates at a very low cavitation number the numerical results show great agreement with the experimental results which indicates applying the numerical approach to predict and investigate the pjp cavitation is reliable shi et al 2015 lu et al 2016 applied the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulation to study the effects of cavitation number advance coefficient and tip clearance size on pjp cavitation performance decreasing the cavitation number or the advance coefficient will enhance the cavitation while the impacts of tip clearance on cavitation performance do not show regular change and are affected by the advance coefficient similarly pan et al 2016 investigated the cavitation performance of pjp behind an auv motallebi nejad et al 2017 employed a periodic computational domain of pjp to calculated the open water performance and did a transient analysis of the pressure field between the rotor and stator shirazi et al 2019 also had simulated the fluid flow on a full scale pjp with using the periodic computational domain and conducted several experiments with the behind hull condition in a towing tank such as bollard pull self propulsion point and bare hull results show that the stator and duct profiles should be designed very thoughtfully for avoiding the consumption of rotor thrust moreover the hull wake has a significant decrement in pjp efficiency li et al 2019 implemented a series of numerical calculations of the fluid flow on pjp with the focus on the mutual interference between the rotor and stator they discussed the unsteady effects on pjp performance with a comparative study of steady and unsteady and analyzed the exciting forces of rotor and stator both the blades of the rotor and stator have a high level of exciting force and the increase of tip clearance will enhance the level the stator shows an insufficient ability to absorb the energy in tip clearance flow with the analysis of the typical tip clearance vortices and the tip clearance flow in the stator and pjp wake wang et al 2019 proposed a tip clearance model employed in the panel method based on the potential flow theory to get a more accurate prediction of pjp performance and compared the results of the potential flow and the viscous flow based on the comparison they conducted another comparison of tip clearance flow effects on the pre swirl stator pjp and rear stator pjp the results show that the tip vortex model has little effect on the pre swirl stator pjp and plays an vital role in the rear stator pjp the rear stator pjp has an intense leakage vortex and it will get evident improvement on the calculating results by introducing the tip vortex model to model the tip leakage vortex qin et al 2019 and sun et al 2019 applied the sawtooth duct for pjp noise reduction based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fwh equation both papers numerically predicted the pjp noise with detached eddy simulation des under an open water condition and large eddy simulation les under the behind hull condition respectively results show that the sawtooth duct wastes a little efficiency of pjp and gains an improvement of the whole noise level of pjp both the papers discuss the effects of sawtooth on the vortices and pjp wake flow and it indicates that the vortices and its evolution in pjp wake represent great value of research the vortex dynamics in the wake of the ducted propeller and conventional propeller has been further researched by the experimental observation and numerical approach felli et al 2008 2011 experimentally studied the mechanism of the wake evolution and instability transition in propeller wake the mutual interference between the tip vortex of the current blade and the wake of the next one affects the instability of the propeller slipstream the multi step grouping mechanism among tip vortices is driven by the mutual inductance between adjacent spirals whose characteristics depend on the number of blades baek et al 2015 numerically studied the effect of the advance coefficient on the vortex pattern in the wake of a propeller by applying the rans simulation they successfully captured the primary vortex and conducted a detailed analysis of the main vortex behaviors chase and carrica 2013 studied the effect of rans simulation des and ddes on the propeller wake results show that the rans simulation overly dissipates the wake and the grid shows a more critical role in the convergency of thrust torque and efficiency than the time step size muscari et al 2013 also concluded that rans simulation is too dissipative with the basis of applying the rans simulation and des to investigate on the vortex dynamics in the wake of a marine propeller though the rans simulation can obtain a satisfactory prediction of global quantities such as thrust and torque with a relatively small number of grid points it is inappropriate to apply the rans simulation when unsteady fluctuation of the flow or instability processes in the wake are of interest for noise assessment for instance kumar and mahesh 2017 investigated the wake of the propeller with the focus on the mechanism of wake instability by using large eddy simulation les with 181 million hexahedral cells their numerical results indicate that the tip vortices and its interaction with the smaller vortices generated by the roll up of the blade trailing edge wake in the near wake are the mutual induction mechanisms of wake instability posa et al 2019 employed the les in about 840 million mesh nodes to discuss the wake characterization of a submarine propeller results reveal an influence of tip and hub vortices on the streamwise evolution of turbulent kinetic energy and indicate that small vortices populating the wake of each blade are short lived downstream and show limited influence on the fields of turbulent kinetic energy moving away from the propeller plane gong et al 2018 presented a comparative study on the evolution of wake vortices generated by the ducted propeller and non ducted propeller by employing the des they hold the view that the interference between duct and propeller changes the morphology of vortices and wake contraction and the shear layer of the duct has a strong interaction with the blade tip vortices based on the analysis of the power spectral density of kinetic energy they think the interference strengthens the self induction and mutual induction of vortices and accelerates the primary vortices merging and grouping zhang and jaiman 2019 applied the delayed detached eddy simulation ddes to get the flow around a ducted propeller and conducted an investigation on the vortices evolution and wake flow instability of the ducted propeller under the primary consideration of the effects of zero inflow and advance coefficient they think that the primary mechanism for the breakdown of tip leakage vortex is the short wave instability in this paper the layout is as follows section 2 presents the research object a geometric model of pjp in section 3 the numerical formulation are introduced the mesh and the problem set up are described in section 4 the discussion and analysis are exhibits in section 5 including the verifications of the mesh and time step the unsteady hydrodynamics performance the transient flow field and the comparative discussion of the vortices wake generated by the rans simulation and hybrid rans les family finally a summary of the key results can be found in section 6 2 geometry configuration a pump jet propulsor pjp with model scale and the coordinate are presented in fig 1 this model has a pre swirl stator with 8 blades and a rear rotor with 6 blades the diameter of rotor is d r 0 1664 m and the maximum diameter of stator is d s 0 2038 m the diameters of duct inlet and outlet are d t 1 0 2104 m and d t 2 0 1460 m respectively the tip clearance size between the inner duct surface and the tip face of the rotor blade is 1 0 mm the stator hub has the same conical degree with the submarine tail and extends out of the duct inlet the far field hub and the stator hub are connected by an ellipsoid for a better transition the rotor rotates around axis z and the fluid flow positive direction follows the z axis direction 3 theoretical background 3 1 governing equations the fluid is considered as incompressible with the homogeneous assumption without the body force and gravitational acceleration the navier stokes ns equations are 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i in the equations ρ and μ are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively u i is the velocity vector and p is the pressure 3 2 modeling turbulence turbulence is the three dimensional unsteady random motion in fluids at moderate to high reynolds the turbulence described by the n s equations is not feasible in most engineering situations to resolve the wide range of scales in time and space by direct numerical simulation dns as the cpu requirements would far exceed the available computing power choi and moin 2012 gave an estimation of the grid points for dns the estimation is related to reynolds number and resolving the kolmogorov length scale requires the number of grid points approximately equal to r e l x 37 14 applying the averaging procedures to the navier stokes equations to filter out all or at least parts of the turbulence spectrum would get acceptable and reliable precision in engineering fields the averaging process resulting in the rans equations introduces additional unknown terms into the transport equations that need to be provided by suitable turbulence models for turbulence closures the turbulence models simplify the problem to the solution of the additional transport equations and introduce an eddy viscosity μ t to compute the reynolds stresses the turbulence models can be simply classified according to the number of the additional transport equation for example the spalart allmaras s a model is a one equation turbulence model that is specially designed for the aerodynamics flow and the k ϵ turbulence model is a classic two equation model which has a number of derivative models compared to the k ϵ model the k ω model is a further improved two equation turbulence model and has two more improved forms called the baseline bsl k ω model and the shear stress transport sst k ω model menter 1993 though the bsl k ω model is also an improved model compared to the original k ω model the sst k ω model is a better one considering the adverse pressure gradient boundary layer flows menter 1993 1994 moreover considering pjp operates at high r e numbers the transition formulations of the sst k ω are not employed so all the hybrid rans les approaches are based on the original sst k ω model in this paper menter 1993 1994 and menter et al 2003 proposed and developed the sst k ω turbulence model that has been widely applied and validated in predicting no cavitating and cavitating flow around underwater propulsors with its advantages lu et al 2016 pan et al 2016 motallebi nejad et al 2017 li et al 2019 baek et al 2015 the turbulence kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω transport equations of sst k ω turbulence model are as follows 3 ρ k t ρ k u i x j x j μ μ t σ k k x j p k d k s k 4 ρ ω t ρ ω u i x j x j μ μ t σ ω ω x j p ω d ω c d ω s ω where the σ k and σ ω are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ω p k and p ω are the productions of k and ω respectively d k and d ω are the dissipations of k and ω respectively c d ω denotes the cross diffusion term s k and s ω are the user defined terms in the sst k ω turbulence model an additional limiter is applied for obtaining the proper transport behavior and the eddy viscosity is formulated by the following expression 5 μ t ρ k ω 1 max 1 α s f 2 a 1 ω where f 2 is a blending function the value of a 1 is 0 31 s is the strain magnitude and α is a coefficient that damps the turbulent viscosity causing a low reynolds number correction menter and egorov 2005 2010 egorov et al 2010 also proposed a scale adaptive simulation sas model by adding a source term q s a s into right of the ω equation the q s a s is formulated by the expression 6 q s a s max 3 51 ρ κ s 2 l l ν κ 2 6 ρ k max 1 ω 2 ω x j ω x j 1 k 2 k x j k x j 0 where l is the modeled turbulence length scale and l ν κ is the von kármán length scale κ is the von kármán constant rans models are suitable for many engineering applications and typically offer the level of accuracy required and provide the most economical approach however the rans models cannot offer more resolution of turbulence so with the aim of reducing the impacts of the averaging procedures on turbulence and resolving at least a portion of the turbulence for at least a portion of the flow domain an alternative to rans models is the scale resolving srs models les is the most widely known concept of srs models and widely used in academic research but the les model had very limited impact in many engineering simulations due to its excessively high resolution requirements for wall boundary layers a very fine grid near the wall and a small time step choi and moin 2012 revisited the old grid points estimation chapman 1979 and gave the new version of estimations for les both estimations require the grid points approximately equal to r e l x 9 5 and r e l x 13 7 respectively that is hard to satisfy the cpu requirements in many industrial applications where the reynolds number is far exceed 1 1 0 5 the complexity of geometry is also a limitation that causes many grids in the near wall boundary layer cai et al 2019 did a comparative study of srs models the feasibility to apply the dynamic les model is based on a periodic fluid domain though the periodic fluid domain is also applied in pjps to obtain the open water characteristic and flow field motallebi nejad et al 2017 shirazi et al 2019 it is inappropriate to analyze the transient flow of the inner field and wake of pjp and get the mutual interference characteristic between rotor and stator a hybrid rans les model spalart 1997 has been developed to avoid the high resolution requirements of les the basic hybrid rans les model is the des model which achieves the switch between rans and les by a comparison of the turbulent length scale l t with the grid spacing δ max the des has been applied in predicting propeller hydrodynamics and studying the evolution of propeller wake muscari et al 2013 gong et al 2018 zhang and jaiman 2019 and it also has been used in obtaining the flow field characteristic and noise level qin et al 2019 the des has many extensions due to the hybrid with different rans turbulence models the des with sst k ω model strelets 2001 menter et al 2003 is derived by modifying d k as 7 d k ρ β k ω f d e s where f d e s is expressed as 8 f d e s max l t c d e s δ max 1 in the expression c d e s has a value of 0 61 and δ max is the maximum local grid spacing β is a constant value of the sst model l t is the turbulent length scale 9 l t k β ω in the des model the grid spacing affects the rans solution in regions where the grid is between rans and les resolution so called gray area in des and where the flow instability is not strong enough to generate the les structures spalart et al 2006 and the des limiter becomes active and affects the rans solution in a point where the grid for an attached wall boundary layer flow is refined the lack of flow instability cannot balance the reduced rans content by resolved turbulence which results in an artificial flow separation named the grid induced separation gis menter 2016 the ddes model proposed by spalart et al 2006 offers limiter protection against the gis and an updated version of ddes named improved ddes iddes is provided by shur et al 2008 which extends the les zone of the model to the outer part of wall boundary layers the ddes model spalart et al 2006 is originally proposed for the s a model later gritskevich et al 2012 developed the formulations of ddes and iddes for sst k ω model like the des with sst k ω model a parameter f d d e s is applied to modify the d k which is expressed as 10 f d d e s l r a n s l d d e s and the ddes length scale l d d e s and rans length scale l r a n s read as follow 11 l d d e s l r a n s f d max 0 l r a n s l l e s l r a n s k c μ ω l l e s c d e s δ max where c d e s is calculated with the expression c d e s c d e s 1 f 1 c d e s 2 1 f 1 f 1 is the blending function menter et al 2003 and the model constants c d e s 1 c d e s 2 have the value of 0 78 and 0 61 respectively c μ has a constant value of 0 09 f d is a empirical delay function whose value is computed with the use of the following relations 12 f d 1 tanh c d 1 r d c d 2 r d ν t ν κ 2 d w 2 1 2 s 2 ω 2 where ν t and ν are the eddy viscosity and molecular viscosity respectively ω is the magnitude of vorticity tensor d w is the distance to the wall c d 1 and c d 2 are the constants with the values of 20 and 3 respectively similarly for the iddes a parameter f i d d e s is defined as follow 13 f i d d e s l r a n s l i d d e s compared to the ddes the l d d e s is replaced by l i d d e s whose expression is 14 l i d d e s f d 1 f e l r a n s 1 f d l l e s where the les length scale is redefined as 15 l l e s c d e s δ δ min 0 15 max d w δ m a x δ m a x where f d is the empirical function and f e is the elevating function gritskevich et al 2012 in addition there are two alternatives to des and its evolutional models in the hybrid turbulence model family the first alternative model is the shielded detached eddy simulation sdes a shielded function f s d e s is added into the k equation of sst k ω model this function protects the rans wall boundary layer against influences from the les model and results in faster transition from rans to les in separating regions the resulting sink term is equivalent to the one from the ddes model 16 ε s d e s β ρ k ω f s d e s f s d e s max l t c s d e s δ s d e s 1 f s d e s 1 1 where c s d e s is used with a value of 0 4 and the δ s d e s is formulated as 17 δ s d e s max v 3 0 2 δ max where v is the volume of the cell the second alternative model is the stress blended eddy simulation sbes menter 2016 developed from sdes the stress is blended with the following formulation 18 τ i j s b e s f s d e s τ i j r a n s 1 f s d e s τ i j l e s where τ i j r a n s is the rans portion and τ i j l e s is the les portion of the modeled stress tensor both modeled stress tensors are based on the eddy viscosity concepts whose formulation simplifies to 19 μ t s b e s f s d e s μ t r a n s 1 f s d e s μ t l e s for the subgrid scale model in sbes the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 is employed in les regions where the eddy viscosity is formulated as 20 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 and l s is defined as follows 21 l s min κ d c w v 1 3 where the constant c w is equal to 0 325 and s i j d is the traceless symmetric part of the square of the velocity gradient tensor 3 3 pjp performance parameters in order to assess the performance of pre swirl pump jet propulsor the non dimensional coefficients are defined as follows 22 j v n d r k t r t r ρ n 2 d r 4 k q

respectively the subscripts r s and d denote to the rotor stator and duct respectively η is the efficiency of pump jet propulsor 4 mesh and numerical set up the entire computational domain is divided into three sub domains of the rotor domain stator domain and external domain the external domain has the same section of 0 6 m 0 6 m with the cavitation tunnel and the length of 15 0 d r the rotor location has a distance of 5 0 d r from the inlet partitioning the entire computational domain into sub domains offers the convenience of mesh generation all the sub domains were generated with structure mesh and both the mesh of rotor and stator were generated by the periodic grid of one blade the close up views of the fine mesh are given in fig 2 for the pjp the reynolds number r e is defined as ρ c 1 0 r v 2 π n d r 2 μ where c 1 0 r is chord length at 1 0 r and r is the radius of rotor blade the r e ranges from 9 25 1 0 5 to 9 88 1 0 5 in the simulations according to the r e near the walls the heights of first layers are 2 1 0 5 m and 5 1 0 5 m for tip clearance and other wall boundaries respectively that is appropriate for the rans solver and the hybrid rans les family solvers the height of the first layer δ y is calculated by a estimation formulation yielded from a flat plate with a reynolds number of r e l p ρ u l p μ where the u is the characteristic velocity and l p is the length of the plate the definition of the dimensionless distance from the wall y is y δ y u τ ν where u τ is the wall friction velocity according to the definition of wall shear stress coefficient c f 2 ρ u τ 2 ρ u 2 2 u τ u 2 and the correlation between the plate c f and the reynolds number c f 0 027 r e l p 1 7 white and corfield 2006 then the estimation formulation of the height of first layer can be yielded as δ y y l p 74 r e l p 13 14 three groups of coarse medium and fine mesh are generated with the same topology structure and have the same height of the first layer near the wall the max cell volume in the duct inner flow field of the fine mesh is approximate to 2 d r 1 d r 1 d r and the max cell volume is less than 1 d r 1 d r 1 d r in rotor domain the mesh number distribution details are listed in table 1 the total mesh number is 15 50 million m which includes 5 77m of rotating part and 9 73m of stationary parts another finer mesh very fine mesh system shown in fig 1 is generated by refining the rotor wake and pjp wake both in axis direction and circumference direction and limiting the max cell volume less than 1 d r 1 d r 1 d r in the inner flow field of the duct the boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 a uniform flow with the velocity value v corresponding to the advance coefficient j of pjp and the turbulence intensity of the default value 5 is set on the inlet boundary the outlet boundary is a pressure outlet with the fixed pressure p o u t equal to 1 a t m the far field wall is set as a zero shear stress wall during the simulations the rotor revolution speed n is 20 r s three group mesh of coarse medium and fine are used to study the grid effect on predicting the hydrodynamics of pjp by steady simulation for the transient calculations based on the fine mesh different time steps of 0 5 δ t 1 0 δ t corresponded to one degree for rotor revolution and 2 δ t are set to estimate the time step size impacts on open water characteristic of pjp both the mesh and time step verifications are implemented by rans solver with the sst k ω turbulence model based on the mesh verification the fine mesh and very fine mesh are going to be used in studying the rotor wake and pjp wake flow field with modeling the turbulence by rans and hybrid rans les family approaches all the simulations are solved by fluent with the simplec scheme a second order discretization of momentum and standard discretization of pressure are used the discretization of the transient term depends on the turbulence modeling method in addition all the steady operating conditions are conducted on the workstation intel r xeon r silver 4216 cpu 2 10 ghz 64 threads and all the unsteady calculations are performed in a cloud computing platform ccp anon 0000 5 results and discussion 5 1 verification of grid and time following the ittc 2008 guidelines for a solution variable ϕ numerical errors are decomposed into iterative errors δ i t ϕ grid size error δ g ϕ time step error δ t ϕ and other parameters related errors δ o p ϕ the simulation numerical uncertainty u s n ϕ is expressed as 23 u s n 2 ϕ u i t 2 ϕ u g 2 ϕ u t 2 ϕ u o p 2 ϕ where the subscripts follow the same denotation as numerical errors components for the corrected approach the estimated numerical error δ s n ϕ and corrected uncertainty u c s n ϕ are given by 24 δ s n ϕ δ i t ϕ δ g ϕ δ t ϕ δ o p ϕ u c s n 2 ϕ u c i t 2 ϕ u c g 2 ϕ u c t 2 ϕ u c o p 2 ϕ however in most practical engineering applications the numerical errors related to other parameters are ignored and iterative uncertainty is negligible for steady simulations the convergency study needs at least 3 solutions solved with the meshes following a systematic refinement process for the parameter i under investigations all other parameters should be holden constant the refinement ratio r i is used to estimate the input parameter refining level for grid refinement a uniform parameter r g is required the recommended value of r i is 2 in ittc guidelines ittc 2008 so in this present work the value of r g is set equal to 1 4 in the mesh refining procedure and for the input parameter of time the time refinement ratio r t has the value of 2 the convergency ratio r i ϕ for the input parameter is expressed as 25 r i ϕ s i 2 ϕ s i 1 ϕ s i 3 ϕ s i 2 ϕ where s i 1 ϕ s i 2 ϕ and s i 3 ϕ represent three different solutions with fine medium and coarse input parameter respectively three conditions are possible 1 0 r i ϕ 1 monotonic convergence 2 1 r i ϕ 0 oscillatory convergence 3 r i ϕ 1 divergence the richardson extrapolation re is used to estimate u i ϕ δ i ϕ and u c i ϕ when r i ϕ represents a monotonic convergency for oscillatory convergency u i ϕ is estimated with the average of oscillatory maximum and minimum simulated values based on monotonic convergency the normalized discretization error δ r e i ϕ and order of accuracy p i ϕ are defined as follows 26 δ r e i ϕ s i 2 ϕ s i 1 ϕ r i p

value δ i 21 a ϕ is the approximate error and δ i 21 e x t ϕ is the extrapolated relative error in this case r i 21 and r i 32 are equal to r i so q p ϕ is zero table 2 and fig 3 show the mean y value and the y distributions of rotor surface stator surface and duct surface at j 1 0 the mean y is lower than 5 and the higher y main locate at the rotor leading edge near blade tip and stator leading edge near duct tables 3 and 4 list the mesh independency analysis results of k t and k q by applying two different approaches except for the design point j 1 0 the other three operating points are also given all the results indicate the three mesh groups of coarse medium and fine are monotonic convergence and it has more sensitive on the mesh when the pjp operates at high advance coefficients though both approaches of the correction factor and grid convergency index show the same trend for the results of all the calculated advance coefficients the results of grid convergency index represent greater range of uncertainty which has lower output values with better input parameters and higher output values with poor input parameters compared to the correction factor approach that also can be understood that the gci approach shows more distinguishable outputs with the same convergence ratio value for instance an input of k t at j 0 2 it differs an order of magnitude of uncertainty moreover with a modified definition of p i a convergence ratio at oscillatory convergence also can be used to estimate the gci value with all other parameters holden constants the steady results indicate good convergence as the grid is refined based on the fine mesh the time independency was conducted and the analysis is shown in table 5 in the unsteady results it gets 2 87 increment of k t at j 1 0 k t and k q has a slight change between the time step of δ t and 0 5 δ t the uncertainty analysis applying the correction factor approach illustrates that it has tiny uncertainty so in the following calculations the time step of δ t was set which corresponds to one degree of rotor revolution and it is appropriate for propulsor hydrodynamics calculating furthermore the mesh size and time step effects on flow field details open water curves and thrust coefficient convergence are represented in figs 4 and 5 the mesh density mainly has significant effects on the velocity magnitudes in tip regions and the near hub regions in the rotor domain where the fluid flow is complex and high turbulent the contours with medium mesh and fine mesh show more similar distributions than the coarse mesh for the tip regions and its downstream the fine mesh have more resolution capacity and represents the obvious difference which indicates that the fine mesh has the greater ability to capture the tip clearance flow and can represent more appropriate calculation based on the fine mesh the finer time step has better resolution in rotor outflow and pjp wake and it shows little difference between the time step of 1 0 δ t and 0 5 δ t for the unsteady simulations a whole period of rotor revolution is necessary and at least until the k t curve develops into a stage with stable fluctuation the vorticity is calculated with the gradient of velocity components it shows the same results that the time steps of 1 0 δ t and 0 5 δ t have no obvious difference in capturing the flow field main vortices following the k t time curves it indicates again that the time step 1 0 δ t is proper for calculation and can decrease the cpu time requirement 5 2 open water performance the open water curves under steady and unsteady simulations the unsteady effects and torque balance are represented in fig 6 and the unsteady results are the time averaged value in a stable period unlike the pump jet propulsor eisenhuth and mc cormick 1963 suryanarayana et al 2010a c b motallebi nejad et al 2017 shirazi et al 2019 li et al 2019 which is mainly applied to high speed auv or torpedo this pump jet propulsor shows great difference in its operating conditions the range of the advance coefficient has a similar value with that of the traditional propeller felli et al 2008 chase and carrica 2013 baek et al 2015 posa et al 2019 cai et al 2019 it has some evident differences between the steady and unsteady calculations the unsteady calculation simulates the rotor inlet flow more proper and considers the mutual interference between the pre swirl stator and the rotor and this causes some differences with the steady predictions with the synchro increments or decrements of k t and k q the open water efficiency η presents the negligible changes the k t contains k t r k t s and k t d and k t r shares the major change of k t between the steady and unsteady calculations comparing to the changes of k t s and k t d the stator provides a negative thrust at all the advance coefficients k t d presents a monotonically decreasing and it has the minimum absolute value when j locates around 0 8 owing to the rational placement of stator k q s shows negative value and hence offset some torque generated by the rotor this is beneficial for the submarine balance except for the k t d at j 0 8 the relative values between steady and unsteady predictions of k t r k t s k t d k q r and k q s locate between 1 and 4 because the k t d gets a value around zero at j 0 8 it conducts an abnormal value when the relative value is applied to estimate the level of change between steady and unsteady predictions according to the relative values it explains that the unsteady simulation is essential when there exists mutual interference in pjp unlike the pump jet propulsor with a rear stator which is properly designed and placed for recycling the circumference component velocity in rotor wake to offer the reverse torque for balance and some thrust for offsetting the duct drag the pump jet propulsor with a pre swirl stator performs not well in torque balance because its stator is mainly designed for generating a pre swirl inlet flow for rotor furthermore the experimental data of the k t r and k q r is given the experiment was executed in the science and technology on water jet propulsion laboratory of marine design and research institute of china the trend and the magnitude level are acceptable and in agreement with the experimental results though there are some differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients the k t r and k q r coefficients show the same tendency of decaying and increasing patterns according to the loading conditions respectively we suggest that this difference can be attributed to inherent numerical analysis results in the flow due to the complex interaction between the rotor and stator and the relatively large and highly complex vortical structures that separate from the rotor blades and act on the downstream inner duct therefore the numerical approach applied for this study is appropriate for investigating flow characteristics past the pjp in fig 6 δ k q describes the relative change between the stator torque and rotor torque while the rotor torque decreases as the advance coefficient increases the absolute value of stator torque increases as the advance increases and they achieve the approximately same absolute value when j locates around 0 8 around the design point j 1 0 the torque generated by the stator needs the additional value over 20 of rotor torque to balance the rotor torque but this is not the primary consideration of the stator design for the design point j 1 0 the time domain curves of k t k t r k t s k t d k q r and k q s in one period are shown in fig 7 the curve of k t consisting of k t r k t s k t d is fluctuant which means there exists the periodic existing force the k t r contributes almost the whole fluctuant force the stator has a pre swirl effect on the inlet flow of the rotor which causes the periodic fluctuation to the curves of rotor thrust and torque with mutual interference it also causes periodic effects on the stator and duct k t r and k q r show more greater fluctuation range than k t s k t d k q s for the stator because it locates at the upstream of rotor and has a large distance from the rotor and the suction effect of rotor has slightly impacts on stator k t s and k q s present indistinct range of fluctuation though the ordinates are enlarged to 10 3 and 10 4 respectively for the duct and rotor the rotor operating at a non uniform oncoming flow results in the obviously periodic fluctuation of k t r k t d and k q r under the same enlarged level of ordinate respectively the time domain curve has 24 crests and 24 troughs where the number 24 is the lowest common multiple of 6 and 8 corresponded to the number of rotor blade and that of stator blade respectively for all the non dimensional coefficients the intensities of the fluctuations are lower than 1 of the time averaged value it shows that the stator provides the pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of rotor and concurrently causes acceptable and low level exciting effects on the stator rotor and duct furthermore applying the fast fourier transform fft method the frequency domain curves of k t r k t s k t d k q r and k q s at all the advance coefficients are presented in fig 8 the shaft frequency sf is equal to the revolution speed of the rotor the blade passing frequency bpf of the rotor depends on the sf and the blade number of the rotor similarly the stator also has a bpf depending on the sf and the blade number of the stator under the effect of mutual interference except for the direct current dc components all the curves have a characteristic peak at the frequency f 480 hz where the frequency corresponds to the lowest common multiple of the bpfs of stator and rotor and the amplitude is far higher than the amplitudes of the rest of the frequency domain a characteristic peak appearing at f 480 hz indicates that this peak is conjointly affected by the stator and rotor meanwhile for the frequency domain curve of k t r or k q r another second characteristic peak locates at the frequency f 240 hz where the amplitude is lower than the amplitude at f 480 hz and the frequency is double of the rotor bpf this means that it is mainly influenced by the rotor for every frequency domain curve under every advance coefficient the amplitude at f 480 hz is much smaller than the dc component table 6 gives the relative intensities of the amplitude under the percentage of the dc components though the amplitudes are affected by the advance coefficient and show higher value at a low advance coefficient the relative intensities of amplitudes are smaller than 0 2 this indicates that the exciting forces of stator rotor and duct are acceptable the stator offers a pre swirl impact on the oncoming flow of the rotor and has little exciting force effect on the whole performance of pjp the thrust of the rotor and stator consist of the thrusts of per blade of rotor and stator respectively the fluctuation means that per blade works in a periodic flow field in fig 9 the thrust of one blade in the time domain and frequency domain are shown k t b is the thrust coefficient of one blade and defined as 33 k t b t b ρ n 2 d r 4 where the t b is the thrust of one blade as the greatest common divisor of the numbers of rotor blade and stator blade is 2 the k t b curves of rotor blades divide into three groups with different phases blade 1 and 4 blade 2 and 5 blade 3 and 6 every curve has 8 crests and 8 troughs where the number is equal to the number of stator blades moreover the crest values and trough values among groups are slightly different the resultant force of the thrusts of rotor blades shows 24 crests and 24 troughs under the effects of three groups because all the k t b curves of rotor blades have different phases the fluctuation of k t r curve presents a lower level and thus shows lower fluctuant intensity in the frequency domain the curves have the typical peaks at f 160 hz which is equal to the bpf of the stator similarly the k t b curve of per stator blade has 6 crests and 6 troughs and all the k t b curves are divided into four groups the k t b curve of per stator blade in the frequency domain has the peaks at f 120 hz which is equal to the rotor bpf from the frequency domain curve of k t r it cannot be known that which one of bpf or all the bpfs decides the frequency f 480 hz as it is the lowest common multiple of the bpfs of stator and rotor here comparing the k t b curve of per rotor blade and the k t r curve it can be gotten that for the k t r k t d k q r the frequency f 480 hz depends on the stator bpf as it is three times of stator bpf and the frequency f 240 hz depends on the rotor bpf as it is double times of rotor bpf moreover for the k t s or k q s the peak at f 480 hz depends on the rotor bpf as it is four times of the rotor bpf 5 3 transient flow field the force curves of the rotor blades and stator blades indicate that though the stator offers a pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of the rotor the flow is also not uniform and thus affects the force of the rotor blades which work in different advance angles the pre swirl effect mainly provides the circumferential velocity to improve the advance angle of the blade section so the uniform intensity of the circumferential velocity represents the level of pre swirl effect in fig 10 show the distributions of velocity components at j 1 0 the axial velocity accelerates in the flow direction under the rotor operation and is also affected by the stator differing from the above mentioned velocity components the radial velocity shows lower values and is mainly caused by the angle of the duct and the hub composing the inner flow field of pjp and thus presents negative value because of the shrunk inner flow field in the flow direction the stator shows the evident pre swirl effect as it presents a higher value of the radial velocity between the stator and rotor before the stator with the uniform oncoming flow from the inlet boundary it almost no circumferential velocity in s 1 slice at s 2 slice though it is close to the stator inlet there are no apparent changes in the distribution of the circumferential velocity after the pre swirl stator high circumferential velocity exists in the stator wake shown in s 3 slice and periodically distributes in the circumferential direction the nonuniform distribution of the rotor oncoming flow contributes to the exciting force of the rotor during its operation in the rotor wake the circumferential velocity goes to a lower level and periodically distributes in rotor wake the stator generates the pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of the rotor and carries the wake effect on the flow at the same time so for the stator with a pre swirl design a proper large distance between the trailing edge of the stator and the leading edge of the rotor is beneficial for the oncoming flow of the rotor to reduce the wake effect and thus decrease the exciting fore of rotor in fig 11 the c p contours of one blade under different time steps during 1 8 operation period are shown where the pressure coefficient c p is defined as 34 c p p p 0 5 ρ π n d r 2 on the suction side the areas of pressure obviously changing are located on the leading edge near the hub and the middle of the tip where the pressures are local lower the pressure change on the leading edge areas is mainly affected by the nonuniform oncoming flow as the rotor works in the stator wake comparatively the tip clearance flow directly acts on the pressure of the tip region the tip region is indirectly affected by the stator wake as the tip clearance flow begins at the leading edge of the tip where is primarily influenced by the stator wake and the wall flow of the inner duct meanwhile on the pressure side the tip clearance flow shows a slight effect on the pressure of the tip as the area of the pressure obviously changing locates at the leading edge of the blade close to the rotor hub a series of monitor points close to the inner surface of the duct based on the origin coordinate is shown in fig 12 where r 1 is 0 0841m and the c p curves of corresponding points are shown in fig 13 the pressure of the points is periodically affected by the rotor operating as it shows series peaks at the rotor bpf and the harmonic the amplitudes of peaks have the same order of c p magnitude the pressure of the tip region is highly fluctuant and this will propagate to the downstream and the pjp wake as the blade tip passes the tip clearance flow carrying low pressure acts on the locations of monitor points and presents a trough in c p curves the c p curves show the larger fluctuant range and have a larger proportion of negative value this means the tip zones are relatively low pressure most of the time of the rotor operating a whole period the c p changes periodically indicates that though the operating of the rotor does not result in obvious changes in the pressure of the blade tip surface it causes not only the fluctuation of pressure on the inner surface of the duct but also the periodic tip clearance flow with higher pressure gradient transmitting to downstream from the c p contours though it presents a slight change of pressure on most of the surface of the blade the pressure is highly fluctuant and periodic near the leading edge under the mutual interference between stator and rotor in fig 14 fluctuation intensity of pressure in one period n t 360 is presented which is defined by the root mean square error of pressure σ p the σ p is calculated by the time mean pressure p for every grid node and the formulations are as follows 35 σ p 1 n t n 1 n t p t p p 1 n t n 1 n t p t where n t is the statistical time steps p t is the statistical time variant pressure of a grid node the c p contours follow the similar distribution to c p from the c p contour the local low pressure areas are located at the middle tip region and the blade leading edge near the hub and the local high pressure areas are located at the blade trailing edge near the tip the low pressure area means it is easy to cavitate if the surrounding pressure decrease until the vapor pressure of water for the high pressure area the blade thickness of its location is thin under higher pressure difference it is harmful to the blade structural strength most of the blade surface is covered with σ p lower than 100pa the higher σ p mainly exists on the leading edge of the rotor blade though the tip region is the second local low pressure zone its σ p is much lower than the leading edge area the σ p distribution means that the periodic pressure component on the rotor blade is low that is why the k t b of rotor blade show a lower fluctuant level for the stator blade σ p of almost the whole blade surface is lower than 200pa and it results in a very low fluctuant level of the thrust and torque of the stator blade 5 4 wake vortices the transient pressure field indicates the tip clearance flow carries high pressure gradient propagating to the wake so it is worth discussing the wake and its evolution in fig 15 the pressure distribution of wake is affected by the advance coefficient as it has a broader region distributed with high pressure at a high advance coefficient though the tip clearance flow with local low pressure has a lower pressure center when the rotor blade works with heavy load low advance coefficient it shows a more prolonged effect in the wake when the pjp works at the operating conditions with high open water efficiency for instance j 0 8 and j 1 0 the heavy load on the blade aggravates the instability of the rotor wake and thus effects the tip clearance flow propagating to downstream as the advance coefficient increases the inner duct near the rotor wake and the leading edge of the inner duct show high pressure and thus it causes the duct thrust from positive to negative the pressure of the inner duct is conjointly affected by the rotor and the oncoming flow with the rotor revolution speed fixed the increase of oncoming flow will decrease the rotor suction effect and then it shows local higher pressure distribution of the inner duct at a high advance coefficient in the wake of the rotor and duct larger vorticity exists the vorticity in the duct wake mergers into the vorticity in the rotor wake and then enhances it comparatively though the vorticity in the stator wake is weak it passes through the rotor blades and also affects an extended region in the pjp wake as the vorticity in the stator wake is affected by the rotor wake and depends on the velocity of the flow through the stator the vorticity in the stator wake shows a larger intensity and long effect region in the pjp wake when the pjp works at high open water efficiency the wake vortices are identified by q criterion hunt et al 1988 and visualized with the iso surface value of q 10000 s 2 shown in fig 16 relatively the q criterion shows more visible results in identifying the vortices than the pressure or vorticity zhang et al 2018 the hub vortex in the wake shows the larger intensity and the longer region as the advance coefficient goes down near the stator hub a vortex beginning from the trailing edge of the stator is cut off by the rotor blade and exhibits a series of segments in the rotor downstream before the rotor the vortices in the stator wake is enhanced as the advance coefficient increase and this follows the changing trend of vorticity magnitude behind the rotor the vortices from the stator wake are sharply weakened as the wake velocity of the rotor blade accelerates the vortices propagation and dissipation for the typical tip vortices its development follows the same trend of open water efficiency as it shows a prolonged region and remains the shape in the flow direction when the pjp works at high open water efficiency the tip vortices shape is strongly constricted by the shrunk duct in the radial direction when the vortices pass through the duct outlet the tip vortices induce the shear layer on the duct outlet and then curl into sub vortices and merge into the tip vortices from the next rotor blade this enhances the tip vortices develop long distance in the downstream with the fine mesh system it can present the difference in the effect of the advance coefficient on the pjp wake and a coarse view on its vortices evolution moreover the sst k ω turbulence model has the ability to obtain the difference in the vortices wake as the j changes however there are many alternatives turbulence models to model the vortices motion and its evolution better so with the aim to investigate the effect of hybrid rans les models on the vortices in pjp wake the fine mesh is refined into the very fine mesh system shown in fig 2 and the design point j 1 0 is selected to conduct these calculations in table 7 the sst term is the relative difference of the hydrodynamics coefficient between the very fine mesh and the fine mesh and the rest of the terms are the relative differences of the high hierarchy models to the sst with very fine mesh system refining the mesh has over 1 difference in the duct thrust as the rotor wake inside the duct is calculated on the finer mesh which has a significant impact on the tip clearance flow directly acting on the inner duct behind the rotor except the k t d in which the sas causes over 1 difference the sas and ddes show slight changes of all the hydrodynamics coefficients the iddes model causes large decreases in the thrust of the rotor among all the models the sdes and sbes cause over 5 relative difference in k t d and also have apparent changes in stator thrust and torque a comparison of the contours of pressure vorticity magnitude and q distributions in fine mesh and very fine mesh are demonstrated in fig 17 the mesh size has only a noticeable effect on the pressure distribution in the vortices the finer mesh decreases and delays the pressure dissipation of vortices regions and that results in more distinct vortices cores due to the local lowest pressure on the duct outlet the vortex core before flowing out the duct is indistinct under the vorticity the vortex shows more clear locations than the pressure but the effect of the tip vortices on the duct wake is not so distinct with the very fine mesh the effect presents a clear display but the vorticity shows some unconcerned areas when the vortex cores need to identify the q criterion better captures the vortex core however it is also strongly affected by mesh density in this work the very fine mesh system shows a clear view of the merging of tip vortices and duct wake vortices the vortex cores are marked under the identifications of the pressure vorticity magnitude and q criterion respectively the q criterion shows the more typical vortex cores and clear representation the locations of vortex cores under q criterion are given in table 8 though the locations indicate that there is a slight difference in the two mesh groups as mentioned before the very fine mesh is more proper to discuss the vortices wake some locations under the very fine mesh system are set as probes to monitor the variables for a comparative discussion of different hybrid turbulence models at the design point j 1 0 the iso surface of q criterion under different turbulence models with very fine mesh presented in fig 18 describes the motion and evolution of the wake vortices the inducing of the tip vortices on the shedding vortices from the duct trailing edge is distinguishable and thus the sub vortices occur as the sub vortices is a segment and then merges into the tip vortices the intensity of the tip vortices is inhomogeneous in the circumferential direction and also increases the instability of the tip vortices moreover the inducing vortices have slightly decelerated the primary tip vortices the sst turbulence model only can capture the main vortices and it also shows a large dissipation of vortices in the flow direction as the mesh is fine and the resolution is sufficient to get the resolved turbulent structures the sas solution does not fallback to urans and thus offers a more different wake vortices structure than the sst the eddy simulation category has the advantage of modeling the vortices motion and its evolution comparing the ddes and iddes the ddes shows a long stable region of the wake vortices in the flow direction the ddes protects the vortices from developing into the sub scale vortices and it shows less ability to capture small vortices in iddes sdes and sbes the delay effect on the vortices evolution is much lower than the ddes and the mutual inductance exists in the pairing vortices from the blade and the next blade as described in widnall s works widnall 1972 with the helix filament the short wave instability is built up inside the vortex cores the instability begins early in the iddes and sbes as it shows more twisted shapes before the tip vortices inducing the duct shear layer to sub scale vortices the instability is perturbation between the pairing vortices and thus induces the secondary vortices moreover the development of the massive secondary vortices will further enhance the inducement and the mutual interference between the main pairing vortices though the induced vortices shedding from the duct trailing edge enhance the intensities of wake vortices the instability also increases the vortices beginning on the shear layer of the trailing edge of the inner duct is instable as it is induced by unstable tip vortices from the upstream this induced vortices merging into the next tip vortices and increases the instability of the tip vortices pairing in the downstream in the downstream as the instability develops into an uncontrolled state under the tip vortices all the vortices break up into massive small vortices and dissipate in the wake for the hub vortices the sst result presents a stable shape in the downstream in the sas and ddes the hub vortices remain its shape and show a long transition stage in the sdes and sbes the hub vortices hold the form in the near wake and then demonstrate the clear transition to small vortices the difference is that the sbes provides an early transition and more diffuse vortices after the transition the iddes does not give a transition stage of the hub vortices as the hub vortices diffuse from its begin place on the hub tail the vortices beginning from the trailing edge of the stator blade present weaker shape under the sst modeling the sas and ddes have captured the early stage of the vortices in stator wake before the rotor but after the rotor due to the effect of rotor wake the sas and ddes show an unclear representation of the dissipation comparing to the iddes sdes and sbes the turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence viscosity ratio μ t μ at different slices are demonstrated in figs 19 and 20 as a whole the sdes and sbes give a low k level while the ddes and iddes show the moderate k level and the high k level is presented in sst and sas except for the tip vortices regions where the ddes gives a much higher k value and the iddes gives a low k which is lower than the k of the rotor blade wake the ddes and iddes present the same k distribution higher k exists in the wakes in the sst and sas calculations especially the tip regions where the k is much higher in sst due to the low ability to resolve turbulence in the sst model it remains a high net value of k production in the tip vortices region and downstream where the small scale turbulence is highly modeled and filtered the distributions of k in sst and sas are similar because it lacks relatively strong flow instabilities switching to srs mode in sas thus the sas remains in sst mode and will not produce unsteady structures the iddes in wall modeled les wmles requires the specification of the inflow conditions without any turbulent content and becomes active when the grid of boundary layer type precludes the resolution of the dominant eddies as the iddes has more strict applying conditions and the boundary layer and the dominant vortices are hybrid in the tip regions it causes an abnormal k distribution comparing to other models the sdes and sbes shielding properties are much improved and rapid transition relative to ddes they provide more resolved turbulence and thus lower k in the wake as the μ t demonstrates the relationship between the reynolds stress and the time averaged variables and the μ is a constant the μ t μ indicates the level of the resolved turbulence scale for the sst high value and the large area of μ t μ means the turbulence is more modeled and a high prediction of the turbulent stress overall the iddes exhibits abnormal results in the tip vortices region where the μ t μ is lower than the μ t μ in the wake of the rotor blade similarly the distribution of μ t μ given by sas does not show the distinction between the tip vortices region and the wake of the rotor blade saying the abnormal it is because that many previous studies show that the tip region and downstream are much turbulent than other places in the propeller duct propeller and pump jet propulsor fluid domains comparatively the sdes and sbes offer more resolved turbulence in the fluid domain and clearly distinguish the high turbulence area between the ddes and sbes as the sbes switches reliably and swiftly from the rans to les in separating shear layer and uses the les model in the les portion of the flow instead of relying on the les capability of des like models more resolved turbulence areas exist in the wake and more apparent distinction between the vortices than the sdes provided is shown especially the tip flow region the power spectral density psd curves of turbulence kinetic energy at the probes v 3 v 4 v 9 are given in the fig 21 all the psd curves have many tonal components and wide broadband components for the tonal components it mainly has the relationship to the motion of dominant eddies while the broadband components indicate the small scale turbulence in the near field v 3 the sst and sas give similar results in the low frequency band moreover the main difference between sst and sas is that many peaks with high amplitudes occur at the moderate frequency band as some portions of the flow field are in the srs model the ddes and iddes also present the same trend of psd curves except that the iddes gives a low psd in the low frequency band and the very smaller amplitude of psd at bpf and the harmonics comparatively the psd curves of sdes and sbes is far different from the psd curves of the mentioned above models the tonal components show low psd and decay slowly at the low frequency band for the broadband components though they have low values of psd there is no decay in the low frequency band in v 4 where the effects of the induced vortices from the shear layer of the inner duct are included it demonstrates some sub level tonal components in the moderate frequency band moreover all the models show the increase of the broadband components at the high frequency band in the far field v 9 the sst exhibits a quickly decaying trend and has more peaks on account of the over modeled of turbulence in sst the sas also presents clear peaks with high amplitude at the bpf and its harmonics in the low frequency band due to the lack of instabilities and shows high psd in the moderate and high frequency bands the ddes gives a similar result to sst while iddes shows the same decay trend with sdes and sbes but the psd value is far higher than the psd presented by sdes and sbes from the k and μ t μ distributions and the visualized q criterion in the flow direction the ddes sdes and sbes are the better choices for easily applied in pjp calculation and fewer requirements of applying conditions than the iddes furthermore the sbes is applied to resolve the wake vortices at all operating conditions shown in fig 22 with the mesh refined and especially the improved ability to resolve the turbulence of sbes more scale turbulence and the detailed motion and evolution of vortices are demonstrated as the advance coefficient increase the slipstream which is the jet flow separating the undisturbed flow region is narrower and the filaments of the tip vortices are enhanced and well organized at high advance coefficients the distance between the filaments of the contiguous tip vortices increases and the tip vortices sustain longer due to the more unstable filaments at the low advance coefficient the tip vortices break down and develop into more sub scale vortices moreover as the tip vortices becoming more unstable early before moving out the duct outlet it affects the induced vortices shedding from the duct shear layer the induced vortices are also more unstable and thus merge into the tip vortices and enhance the vortices breaking the distance between the filaments of the contiguous tip vortices depends on the pitch of the tip vortices so the smaller distance results in easily disturbing and stronger inducing effect between the groups of tip vortices when the pjp works at low advance coefficient at the low advance coefficient the vortices faster transit into the unstable regions and massive small vortices evolve to the downstream when the advance coefficient increases the tip vortices have a larger ability to hold its shape and the transition stage becomes more prolonged and in the transition the secondary vortical structures exhibit more clear vision the secondary vortices wrap around the main tip vortex and play a bridge effect on the contiguous primary tip vortices and thus cause the interaction the partially ordered structures of the primary and secondary vortices tend to break down into progressively smaller structures and as a consequence of the inflow conditions different portions of the wake experience different dynamic evolutions at the end of the transition stage 6 conclusions in this paper a transient study of the pjp hydrodynamics and a comparative study of the hybrid rans les methods for modeling the pjp wake are carried out the rans simulation with sst k ω model is mainly applied in obtain the unsteady characteristics of the pjp based on the rans results some studies of the detailed verifications the unsteady hydrodynamics performance the transient flow field the vortices wake are performed moreover after a discussion of the vortices wake generated by rans the turbulence models including the sas ddes iddes sdes and sbes are adopted to resolve the pjp wake in a refining mesh system for the multi components propulsor considering the interaction between the components is much important than the conventional propeller and the pre stator pjp demonstrates a vast difference in hydrodynamics performance comparing with the post stator pjp due to a pre swirl effect on the oncoming flow of the rotor though the pjp shows the exciting forces especially the rotor the intensities are low and the pressure fluctuation indicates low strength during the operation the tip flow field is slightly affected by the pre swirl flow the pre swirl flow improves the attack angle of the rotor which is better for the rotor stably operating unlike the post stator proper designed for better torque balance and some positive thrust the pre stator has different design purposes which are to offer the pre swirl flow for low vibration and noise level with the basis of abandoning some thrust and balance differing from the post stator pjp the circumferential velocity component in the rotor wake is not recycled and the tip vortices of the rotor blades are also not severely affected though the shrunk duct restricts the tip vortices and the inducing vortices increase the instabilities of the wake vortices it has no effects on absorbing the circumferential velocity component and destroying the tip vortices structures compared to the rear stator the tip vortices are also affected by the load on the rotor blade and the duct wake as they have a more prolonged zone when the pjp works at high efficiency moreover in order to generate the pre swirl flow the stator has a specific shape and thus forms a vortex in the wake and propagates to the downstream of the rotor the hybrid rans les models show the outstanding abilities in resolving the turbulence among them the iddes sdes and sbes model the vortices transition and the inducement of a pairing vortices the sdes and sbes resolve more sub scale turbulence in the wake the sas shows apparent changes in vortex motion and evolution comparing to the rans and offers a minor improvement in resolve the turbulence the ddes presents similar results to the sas but performs better in modeling the turbulence credit authorship contribution

21924,this paper presents an investigation on the symmetric motions and loads of the s 175 containership undergoing severe green water impact that may result in high frequency whipping symmetric dynamic response results from two flexible fluid structure interaction approaches namely one and two way coupling methods are assessed and compared in regular head waves numerical computations are performed by coupling cfd star ccm and fea abaqus the creative meshing strategy adopted for rans cfd simulations is presented and numerical predictions are compared against experimental measurements over a range of wave frequencies it is concluded that heave pitch and the linear wave frequency component in the wave loads are predicted well by the two approaches however overall two way coupling compares better with measurements and a significant difference between the two different methods is especially noted in the high frequency whipping domain it is concluded that one way coupling underestimates the high frequency vibratory components and therefore care must be enforced when applying this method for calculating hydroelastic responses in waves keywords hydroelasticity of ships wave loads flexible fluid structure interactions ffsi reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics rans cfd finite element analysis fea 1 introduction in recent years the influence of the economies of scale leading to larger ship sizes resulted in more flexible or softer hulls that may vibrate globally in response to steady state or slamming induced excitations in such cases the structural deformations could significantly affect the flow field and the hydrodynamic loading that cannot be estimated accurately by rigid body approximations this fully coupled flexible fluid structure interaction ffsi is termed as hydroelasticity global hydroelastic effects are mainly categorised as springing and whipping springing is a wave excited steady state global hydroelastic hull girder vibration that may have significant effect in the fatigue strength of ships whipping on the other hand is transient vibration of hull girder due to wave impact loads arising from bow or stern slamming or severe green water on deck for example the for the case of an 8 100 teu modern containership discussed in the work of hirdaris et al 2010 hogging wave bending moments increase by about 11 and sagging bending moments by 42 when whipping and springing are taken under consideration today in practical ship design whipping is incorporated as a dynamic loading factor in the deterministic maritime classification rules lloyd s register 2018 this approach does not consider hull flexibility or the stochastic nature of the wave environment following the pioneering work of bishop and price 1979 there has been great deal of research on 2d and 3d frequency and time domain hydroelastic methods e g bishop et al 1980 bishop et al 1986 hirdaris and temarel 2009 a key drawback of conventional linear hydroelasticity theories e g when using 2d or 3d potential flow within a modal analysis framework and a beam or 3d fea structural representation is that they are unable to capture the nonlinearities involved in the fluid actions as a consequence of the assumptions involved hirdaris et al 2014 incorporation of some nonlinear effects in the aforementioned analyses could lead to some improvement in predictions depending for example on wave steepness e g park and temarel 2007 and shin et al 2015 nevertheless the models in frequency domain are inaccurate when influenced by strong nonlinearities say due to large amplitude motions or flexibility zhao and faltinsen 1993 faltinsen et al 2004 a ship in stochastic weather is subject to various nonlinearities that require hydrodynamic modelling investigations in the time domain ittc 2014 for example tuitman malenica 2009 developed a time domain numerical analysis tool to compute the global and local responses of symmetrically induced slamming and slamming induced whipping loads kim and kim 2009 presented a time domain approach for the first time that directly couples bem and fem to investigate the hydroelasticity of flexible floating structures this method was applied to predict the springing and whipping of a 60m barge 6500 teu and 10 000 teu containership kim and kim 2014 they noted good agreement in linear responses to waves but discrepancies were observed in nonlinear springing and whipping responses issc 2000 presented an exhaustive study to investigate the wave induced loads on the s 175 containership using state of art potential flow tools with particular emphasis on nonlinear ship motions and loads it was concluded that the various non linear strip theory formulations predict the magnitude of hog sag first harmonics with sufficient engineering accuracy however the nonlinear loads represented as higher order harmonics shows large scatter and care has to be taken when such procedures are used for design load calculations the advent of high performance computing over the recent years has resulted in development and implementation of fully nonlinear time domain cfd methods to simulate 3d ffsi problems of ships and offshore structures kim 2011 rans cfd methods can implicitly take into account the nonlinearities arising due to the hydrodynamic actions include compressibility and viscosity and aid in visualising the flow features this is an important aspect since it can help us understand the physical phenomena arising in the boundary between the fluid and the structure to date application of rans cfd to study the structural responses of ships in waves has been carried out using both one or two way partitioned coupling methods in one way coupling the fluid loads acting on the structure are transferred to the fe model and the structural responses are calculated for the time history of loading although the method is computationally fast the added mass effect due to the elasticity is not accounted for benra et al 2011 thus it could neglect the high frequency dynamic vibrations of the structure for example slamming induced whipping responses that could result in serious consequences seng 2012 a more accurate way to represent hydroelastic effects is by allowing the structural deformations calculated in the fea to distort the structure in the cfd simulations paik et al 2009 presented a coupled fsi method and compared the results of rigid one and two way coupling of s 175 containership with experiments they concluded that the one way coupling approach provided overall a similar quality of solution i e it captured the trends well in comparison to the two way coupling a conclusion which requires further validation for various test cases however in this work the two way coupling method considered only the effects of structural deformations in way of the amplitude and phase of vbm and the oscillations in rigid body accelerations on the other hand seng et al 2012 and takami et al 2018 reported that the one way coupling was unable to capture the vibratory components in the slamming pressures and the bending moments when compared to the experiments investigations carried out using two way coupling simulations have shown to be promising and the predictions compared well with measurements oberhagemann et al 2012a jensen et al 2014 lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2019 2018 it is believed that the differences in the predictions between the two way coupled analyses arose because of the effects of added mass during structural deformation this is because both one and two way coupling methods match in terms of physical flow phenomena assumptions excluding the influence of added mass on flexible distortions more recently the motions and wave loads on a flexible containership using one and two way cfd and fea simulations showed that the two way coupling results were promising and more accurate when compared to experiments takami and iijima 2019 this was investigated for one wave condition λ l 1 0 where the model experienced whipping loads a thorough study on the prediction of nonlinear wave loads for a range of wave frequencies does not exist this is important so that we get a clearer picture on the accuracy of the two methods when applied to nonlinear wave load predictions on a flexible ship and the associated limitations of one way coupling idealisations for such cases this paper presents numerical computations of symmetric motions and wave induced loads with emphasis on the nonlinear components for the case of the s175 containership progressing with forward speed in regular head waves the numerical computations are performed by coupling cfd star ccm and fea abaqus using two separate approaches namely one and two way coupling in one way coupling approach the fluid pressures exported from the cfd simulations are used to calculate the structural responses of the fe model in one time step however in two way coupling the structural deformations are fed back into the cfd solver multiple times in a time step to deform the mesh results are compared against the experimental measurements of chen et al 2001 watanabe et al 1989 and fonseca and guedes soares 2004 the simulations are performed for 8 wave frequencies where severe green water is shipped at some frequencies resulting in high frequency whipping components the main aim is to compare and contrast between the linear and nonlinear components in the amidships bending moment calculated using the two approaches 2 the s 175 containership experimental model this section describes the experimental set up of the s 175 containership model that is used as main test case for validating the numerical approach presented reviewing the measurements using flexible models of two benchmark studies carried out by chen et al 2001 and watanabe et al 1989 and the segmented model of fonseca and guedes soares 2004 showed some differences in the measurements especially in the case of higher order harmonics for very similar testing conditions the test matrix and the model properties are primarily obtained from chen et al 2001 nevertheless the results from watanabe et al 1989 and fonseca and guedes soares 2004 are also used to discuss the practical significance of the results the s 175 containership experiments were conducted in the towing tank of cssrc by using the fully elastic model presented by chen et al 2001 see table 1 the model was self propelled and was free to surge heave and pitch but it was constrained to sway yaw and roll in addition to the wave loads vertical accelerations at the fp heave and pitch motions were also measured this elastic model was constructed using material abs702 with thickness of the deck bottom and the side hull being 2 mm because of this low plate thickness the bending rigidity of the model amidships was estimated to be 18 higher than the intended scaled model accordingly the 2 node frequency in water was at 9 45 hz instead of 8 57 hz as calculated by the law of similitude 1 1 it is noted that the slightly longer model length 4 5 m tested by watanabe et al 1989 was made of synthetic resins and the bending rigidity concurred to the law of similitude the regular wave conditions selected for the numerical simulations presented in this paper are summarised in table 2 it was reported that the model experienced severe green water effects on deck and water spray in the range of the ship wave matching region for all wave heights tested the vertical bending moments were calculated from the strain measurements chen et al 2001 the location of measurement points are given in table 3 bending moments were recorded on the starboard side deck plate of the flexible model at the longitudinal locations in the numerical simulations a beam model represented the flexibility of the hull and the responses calculated on the beam nodes located in way of the corresponding longitudinal locations of the centre line the fundamental differences between the model tests and the numerical simulations are listed in table 4 3 numerical modelling and simulation 3 1 fluid modelling 3 1 1 computational fluid dynamics method the numerical method employed is a finite volume fv method in which the flow is assumed to be governed by rans equations ferziger and peric 2003 the rans equations reduce to the well known euler equations for the case of inviscid flow used in this paper first the spatial fluid domain is discretised into a finite number of control volumes cvs the integral form of conservation equations with the initial and boundary conditions are then applied to the control volume cell centres and simplified into an algebraic system of equations the governing equations not only contain surface and volume integrals but also time and spatial derivatives apart from the conservation equations the general transport equation for scalar quantities ϕ temperature t k ε ω turbulence quantities etc must also be satisfied in the control volume centres in the numerical simulations of moving co ordinates e g when the boundaries are deforming in the flow described in section 3 1 5 an additional space conservation equation must also be satisfied the space conservation equation describes that the continuity and momentum equations are satisfied when the control volumes are moving arbitrarily peric et al 2007 it ensures that the sum of the volume fluxes through the cells faces when undergoing motion or deformation is equal to the rate of change of their volume all integrals are computed using the midpoint rule implying that the value of the integrand is first evaluated at the centre of the integration domain face centres for surface integral cv centres for volume integrals and time level for time integrals and then multiplied by the range of integration in order to compute the diffusive fluxes gradients are also needed at cell faces the hybrid gauss least square gradient method is used to solve the transport equations the governing equations are solved using a segregated iterative method that employs a pressure velocity coupling algorithm namely the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 the rigid body motions are solved using a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi method and the position of the body is updated at every outer iteration this dfbi model enables the cfd solver to calculate the fluid forces moments and gravitational forces on the body in waves the forces and moments acting is used to calculate the translation of the centre of mass and the angular motion of the body for time integration the solver uses a trapezoidal scheme of second order accuracy star ccm 2012 the specific mesh motion technique is detailed in section 3 1 5 free surface flows are implemented using the volume of fluid vof tracking method hirt and nichols 1981 in order to account for the position of free surface interface in multiphase flows and allow for its arbitrary deformation an additional transport equation is solved for the volume fraction c in multiphase flows the volume fraction c is assigned a value of 0 when the cell consists entirely of air and when it is equal to 1 the cell is filled with only water the air water interface is represented by a volume fraction of 0 5 the hric high resolution interface capturing discretisation scheme is used for free surface flow along with the vof tracking to maintain a sharp interface star ccm 2012 the hric scheme is carried out by blending of upwind and downwind schemes and further corrected depending on the local courant number muzaferija et al 1998 3 1 2 wave simulations the vof wave modelling method was used to simulate the surface gravity waves in the cfd simulations accordingly the first order waves were modelled with a first order approximation of the stokes theory assuming regular periodic sinusoidal profile elevations a vof damping model was implemented in the simulations to reduce the wave amplitudes and damp them as they approach the outlet boundary this was done to ensure that the waves do not reflect back to the inlet boundary after reaching the outlet boundary numerical damping was executed by adding a resistance term to the vertical velocity of the wave choi and yoon 2009 the wave model also took into account the forward velocity of the ship the position of the ship is fixed and an additional velocity that corresponds to the velocity of the ship in the experiment was given as current velocity in the first order wave input 3 1 3 computational domain boundary conditions and solver settings the coordinate system of the fluid domain was designed such that the longitudinal direction of the ship is aligned with the x axis with the transom plane located at x 0 and the side wall extended in the y axis the mean free surface of wave lies at z 0 the computational domain extends to 2 0 l 4 0 l includes 2 0 l damping zone and 2 5 l towards the inlet outlet and side wall direction respectively the ship wave simulations in regular waves resulted in heave and pitch motions that make the problem symmetric with respect to the longitudinal axis consequently only one half of the solution domain was modelled using symmetry boundary condition to reduce the computational effort a constant damping distance of 2 0 l was set for all wave models see fig 1 for the boundary conditions selected in cfd simulations see table 5 these boundary conditions of the fluid domain for both rigid and flexible simulations were selected so that they mimic the conditions of a towing tank as shown in fig 2 at the velocity inlet boundary the position of the free surface and velocity of the first order wave were prescribed as field functions ferziger and peric 2003 accordingly in way of the outlet boundary the outlet pressure was set to the hydrostatic pressure of the wave and the position of free surface was specified this ensured that there is no reflection of the flow in the outlet boundary the top of the domain was set to velocity inlet as it prevents fluid from sticking to the walls this approach helps to avoid a velocity gradient between the fluid and the wall and directs the flow parallel to the outlet boundary lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2019 for the no slip wall condition the fluid tangential velocity was set to zero the boundary condition on the symmetry plane ensures that the normal velocity and the normal gradients of all variables are zero i e it reflects the flow to the other half of the domain based on modelling experience the total number of inner iterations per time step chosen for the coupled simulations was twelve a constant time step of 0 0008 s was used for two way simulations due to divergence issues with respect to the overset mesh motion and 0 001 s for the one way coupling 3 1 4 spatial and temporal discretisation a trimmed cartesian grid was used for discretising the 3d domain accordingly the ensuing mesh was made up effectively of unstructured hexahedral cells with trimmed cells adjacent to the ship model the trimmed cells were identified as hexahedral cells with one or more edges or corners that are cut forming polyhedral cells star ccm 2012 furthermore the outlet and the side wall boundaries were extruded using user specified stretching parameters keeping into consideration that there is not any significant change in the grid sizes of the adjacent layers that could result in numerical issues due to the number of test cases simulated it would be tedious to generate individual meshes for every single case thus a more rational approach has been adopted by designing a single mesh creatively for the wave height so that it is suitable for the entire range of wave frequencies to be investigated the snap shots of the mesh refinements at the bow and stern and in the wake region were shown in fig 3 for h l 50 when simulating wave body interaction in cfd the propagation and stability of the wave may be critical and difficult to achieve this is because it is sensitive to the cell sizes on the free surface time stepping and the order of the temporal discretisation westphalen et al 2008 for stable wave propagation the recommend values of cell sizes on the free surface were 80 cells per wave length and 20 cells per wave height star ccm 2012 ittc 2011 notwithstanding previous experience demonstrated that the minimum required cells per wave length could go down to 40 cells per wave length and therefore modelling was carried out on this basis lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2019 the number of cells in the wave height is a lot more critical and if violated will result in reduction in the wave height as the simulation progresses as a first step grid sizes on the free surface were set for λ l 1 0 as per the recommendations i e 80 cells per wave length and 22 cells per wave height the above cell sizes on the free surface designed for λ l 1 0 translates to approximately 50 and 160 cells per wave length for λ l 0 6 and λ l 2 0 respectively approximately 22 cells are contained per wave height in the free surface region for the wave height of l 50 volumetric blocks were used to carry out the mesh refinement for the intended extent based on modelling experience the following points are noteworthy in the design of the refinement blocks on the free surface the volumetric block on the free surface should be minimum 20 more than the wave height to ensure that the wave is within the refinement in the whole domain it is advisable to coarsen the free surface progressively and in steps along the z direction for a stable wave propagation the number of refinement blocks should be decided based on the scalar field plots of the velocity in the wave simulations three refinement blocks were provided in the mesh designed for the investigations and this can be noticed in fig 3 the free surface refinement in the overset region is larger than the background region to ensure that the two are coupled even when the body undergoes large motions this can be distinguished in fig 3 c and d where the refinement in the red region is greater than in blue the concept of overset mesh is described in section 4 1 5 thereafter the refinements adjacent to the hull and in the wake region were calculated to adequately capture the severe free surface flows arising due to the green water effects and the divergent wave system of the advancing ship kim and lee 2011 and piro 2013 suggest around 150 grid cells per wave length near the hull surface in both upstream and downstream directions when severe motions inducing slamming and green water effects are present additionally piro 2013 also used refined grids at the bow region recommending approximately 29 grid points along the depth to resolve the impact flow and water shipped on the deck in the simulations for λ l 1 160 cells per wave length shown by the blue box in fig 3 were placed in the vicinity of the hull this near hull refinement resulted in approximately 100 and 320 cells per wave length for λ l 0 6 and λ l 2 0 respectively the bow shown by blue box in fig 3 and stern contain 50 grid points along the depth the global mesh count of the background and overset mesh for the coupled simulations are given in table 6 the simulations were run in parallel mode with single precision on the csc finland high power computing facility taito the wall clock time exhausted to compute 1 s of real time simulation for the two way simulations using 256 processors is 8 10 h and for one way coupling using 80 processors was 5 h 3 1 5 mesh motion techniques the mesh motion or grid adaptation techniques used in the simulations of the ship in waves solely depends on whether the body is treated as a rigid or flexible for fsi problems the grid adaptation strategies are implemented commonly using two techniques namely morphing deforming and overset grids baker 1997 morphing occurs by deforming the fluid grid to conform to the motion of ship in waves the challenge is to maintain a good quality of fluid grid when it deforms in this case the transport equations shown in section 3 1 1 are solved by considering the arbitrary motion of the fluid vertices this technique is sometimes known as the arbitary lagrangian eulerian ale description in addition the space conservation law described in section 3 1 1 must also be satisfied as the cells move and change their location and in the case of two way simulations also change their shape ferziger and peric 2003 morphing could however create problems in the case of a body undergoing large motions in waves or when the mesh topologies are dramatically different the deformation of the entire fluid grid could result in the free surface falling outside the refined region of the domain additionally the quality of the deformed cells can become poor resulting in numerical errors a more efficient way to perform this is by the use of overset grids in this modelling approach the area around the body is defined as overset boundary in the overset region see fig 4 the overset boundaries are attached to the floating body and move with it freely with the resultant motion in waves the motion of the overset grid is relative to the background region that encompasses the fluid domain but is fixed in space generally overset grids are highly efficient in the case of free surface flow where the body undergoes large motions in waves but should be avoided for flows subject to large solution gradients or large regions of separated flows wang 1995 tang et al 2003 in the rigid body case grid adaptation to account for the motion of the model in waves is performed using the overset mesh the ship is enclosed within a floating region which is assigned as the overset region see blue region in fig 4 the overset region moves freely relative to the background region in response to the rigid body motions of heave and pitch of the ship in regular head waves a combination of overset mesh and mesh morphing is used in the case of the two way simulations to model the flexibility of the ship in such cases the nodal displacements that include the rigid body motions and distortions imported from abaqus are used to redistribute the fluid grid vertices by generating an interpolation field throughout the fluid domain the overset boundaries then move in response to the interpolation field created by the mesh morpher that in turn helps to maintain good quality mesh in the region 3 2 structural modelling for the purposes of this paper the structural responses to the fluid pressure and shear forces were computed using finite element analysis fea the main features of the finite element method and solvers used is described briefly in the following section furthermore the approach implemented to model the structural details in the form of a finite element mesh is detailed 3 2 1 finite element method abaqus 6 14 1 was used to represent and solve the structural part of the floating body in the original form of application of fea the exact solution required that both forces and moments are in equilibrium at all times over any arbitrary volume of the body bathe 2007 however a displacement method employed in this study approximated this equilibrium by replacing it with a weaker requirement i e the equilibrium must be maintained in an average sense over a finite number of divisions of the volume of the body in the displacement based method the basis of the finite element solution is the principle of virtual work or virtual displacements dassault systèmes 2013 according to the principle of virtual work for any infinitesimal displacement applied to the body in its state of equilibrium the total internal work which represents the stresses and strains is equal to the total external virtual work due to the applied loads bathe 2007 the stresses are in equilibrium with the external applied load and the virtual strains are corresponding to the virtual displacements bathe 2007 a direct step by step time domain integration technique was adopted to calculate the dynamic response accordingly the solution to equations was satisfied at discrete time intervals the solution to the discretised equation can be obtained using an explicit or implicit integration scheme the structural responses for both one way and two way coupling were calculated using the direct implicit time integration finite element analysis in abaqus fea solver accordingly the equilibrium was considered at time t δtn and the hilber hughes taylor implicit operator was used for time integration bathe 2007 this operator is an extension of the newmark β scheme where the numerical damping parameters α and β can be changed depending on the application it is true that the present interest is in the global response of the vessel however this method can be extended to investigate high frequency oscillations relating to for example slamming 3 2 2 finite element mesh the fea model of s 175 used in two way coupling consisted of 3d quadratic timoshenko beam elements abaqus b31 idealisation that take into account the ship hull flexibility dassault systèmes 2013 the structural properties were calculated using scaling laws from the full scale mass and structural properties published by wu and hermundstad 2002 a total of 100 beam elements were used the material properties of the beam elements corresponding to the flexible backbone of the model were defined as that of aluminium the effective shear area was taken into account in the fea model the hull surface was modelled using dummy surface elements sfm3d4 and these were connected to the beam nodes using kinematic coupling constraints a large number of nodes or surfaces were constrained to the motion of control nodes in this case the beam element nodes using kinematic coupling all six degrees of freedom were constrained in the kinematic coupling of beam nodes and the dummy surface in the sense that the beam deformations are imparted on to the hull these elements are required for performing the two way coupling between the cfd and fe topologies see fig 5 the fe model was constrained in the y axis no sway as well as translations and rotations about the x and z axes no roll and yaw the forward velocity effects of the s 175 containership in the two way coupling was carried out by assigning an additional velocity of propagation equal to the model velocity to the regular wave if the model is not restricted in the longitudinal direction in either the cfd or fea models it may experience a drift in the direction of wave propagation due to a longitudinal surge type force furthermore the time history of bending moment bm without bc shown in fig 6 revealed a progressive decrease in its magnitude as the simulation proceeded and the wave encounter period increased the solution adopted to counteract this effect has been to define an additional boundary condition in the fe model restricting the unphysical drift in the longitudinal direction thus an additional constraint of zero translation in the x direction to a beam node close to the lcg of the model was defined to restrict the longitudinal drift in this way the magnitude of bending moment with the boundary condition bm with bc was steady and the period of the response constant 3 3 fluid structure interaction models in general the term fsi can be used for rigid body and elastic body interactions with the fluid in solving fsi problems for flexible bodies the fluid and structural solvers should run in a coupled manner 3 3 1 one way coupling in one way coupling procedure the deformations of the structure were not fed back into the cfd solver to cause mesh deformations the cfd simulations of the ship treated as a rigid body in waves was solved at first in these simulations the fluid hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures and associated inertia forces were exported at prescribed time steps of the order of 0 01s a major drawback of the one way simulation has been that it does not account for the added mass effects due to the elastic deformation of the flexible ship in waves nevertheless the one way coupling is computationally fast another advantage is the flexibility of computing the structural dynamics using the wave loads exported from cfd using any fea software or even using a simple modal superposition on a beam ley and el moctar 2014 paik et al 2009 takami et al 2018 dhavalikar et al 2015 the application of the one way coupling procedure employed in this study is shown schematically in fig 7 the fluid pressures on the rigid ship were exported at a regular interval of 0 01 s to an external file the process of mapping the fluid pressure on to the fe model and exporting it at the prescribed time steps has been carried out automatically using a user defined java macros finite volume codes store the scalar quantities at each cell centre or the face centroid of the mesh and fea codes store the solution at the vertices of the mesh therefore a least square interpolation technique was used to map the fluid pressure stored in the face centroid of the mesh to the face centres of the sfm3d4 membrane elements see fig 5 the boundary conditions in the fe model have been same as described in section 4 2 1 with the exception of the boundary condition used to prevent the longitudinal drift this is because the forces in the longitudinal direction were not exported from the cfd model the pressure time histories from the external file were applied as loading at each time step using a fortran subroutine dynamic implicit analysis was performed using thread based parallelisation employing 6 cpus in such a way that one processor was dedicated to read the pressure file and the remaining processors were dedicated for computing the solution 3 3 2 two way coupling the two way coupling procedure is shown in fig 8 in this case the structural deformations were fed back into the fluid solver to redefine the body and the fluid grid as described in section 3 1 5 a partitioned algorithm was in turn used to execute the two way coupling causin et al 2005 two way coupling can be classified into explicit or implicit coupling in some fsi problems e g static deformation of a flexible aerofoil in a steady state airflow the interaction between the fluid and the structure will approach a steady state solution where the structural velocities decrease to very small or even zero values in these cases an explicit coupling where the exchange of information takes places once per time step can be used to calculate the steady state solution tallec and mouro 2001 rugonyi and bathe 2001 on the other hand when the mutual dependency on time is high and a small change in one solver will have an immediate effect on the other an implicit coupling scheme is preferred causin et al 2005 in the implicit coupling approach employed in this paper the information exchange between hydrodynamic loading and structural velocities is critical for the stability and accuracy of the coupled simulations bloxom 2014 based on modelling experience for twelve iterations for each time step four exchanges were performed within one time step face to face mapping in the coupling used least square interpolations and node to face mapping used shape function interpolation in the shape function interpolation technique the nodal displacements stored at the vertex of the fe mesh were interpolated to the face centroid of the fluid mesh using the shape functions in the case of 3 d trimmed cartesian cfd mesh hexahedral shape function was applied thus the fluid pressures at the interface stored at the face centroid of the cvs were mapped on the face centres of the sfm3d4 membrane surface elements using the least squares interpolation technique 3 4 analysing the simulation results the higher order harmonics and 2 node component in the wave induced loads were calculated from the time series signal of the vertical bending moment this was accomplished by decomposing the time series signal into its sinusoidal frequency components using a fourier transform the transformed signals were then identified as first second third harmonics of the wave encounter frequency as well as the 2 node wet resonant frequency the amplitude of the corresponding frequency components obtained at every wave encounter frequency was non dimensionalised with respect to the wave heights as follows c z z a w c θ θ k a w c m m d i where l denotes the length of the model g acceleration due to gravity k wave number z heave amplitude θ pitch amplitude a w h 2 wave amplitude m i denotes the frequency component of bending moment as defined by the index i and denominator d is the parameter for non dimensionalisation of the corresponding wave load component defined as d ρ g l 2 b h for m i m 1 double amplitude of first harmonic bending moment d ρ g l 2 b a w for m i m 2 3 2 node amplitude of 2nd 3rd and 2 node bending moment m sag hog is also non dimensionalised using the latter expression for d to calculate non dimensional coefficients in the above method an estimate of the wave height or amplitude was also required in the numerical simulations the wave height was recorded at a distance of one ship length from the forward of the ship and the average amplitude over 8 10 complete cycles was used in the calculations the structural responses calculated were band pass filtered into low frequency lf and high frequency hf signals so that the coupled simulations can be compared against each other the band pass filter used to extract the wave frequency component lf has been between 0 1 and 1 2 hz and for the high frequency component that includes the 2 node wet frequency was 6 9 hz the time history signals were analysed using a python code with the inbuilt scipy module for signal processing 4 results and discussion this section presents comparisons of numerical predictions using one and two way coupling against the experimental results of chen et al 2001 watanabe et al 1989 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 and wu and hermundstad 2002 see section 2 when different wave heights are used these are denoted by l 50 and l 30 the numerical predictions of one and two way coupling are denoted as cfd 1 way and cfd 2 way respectively 4 1 heave and pitch motion in waves the incoming wave was monitored at one ship length 3 6m in front of the model for linear ship motions average wave amplitudes over the last stable 8 10 wave periods were used to calculate the response amplitude operators raos incoming waves were assumed stable and decrease in wave amplitude was assumed to be less than 6 for the wave frequencies investigated responses were plotted against the non dimensionlised wave frequency ω l g where ω is the incident wave frequency in two way simulations the total displacement of a point probe on the deck of the ship at lcg is used calculate the heave rao and in one way simulations the rigid body heave is computed using cfd see fig 10 it was reported in the experiments that the model experienced severe green water on deck and water spray chen et al 2001 the time instances shown in fig 9 for λ l 1 0 shows the evidence of violent free surface flows and green water in the cfd simulations please note that this occurred at frequencies λ l 0 9 1 5 but no bow slamming was detected the ship wave matching resonance for the cfd predictions occurs in the vicinity of ω l g 2 2 λ l 1 1 the position of this resonance is also confirmed by the measured results shown in fig 10 the two way simulations are larger than the measurements by 15 25 in the longer wave lengths ω l g 1 8 2 5 the heave calculated using the one way or rigid body simulations is slightly smaller than the two way nevertheless the coupled simulations do not show marked difference in heave predictions the possible reason for the difference could be due to the omission of viscous effects in the cfd simulations it is known that symmetric motions are not influenced strongly by viscosity but in the tests cases investigated a large amount of green water and water spraying was observed in the experiments this might be one of the reasons due to the differences in the predictions the two way coupling predictions of the pitch rao shown in fig 11 show good agreement with the experiments except in the non dimensional frequency range of 2 0 2 2 where the pitch is over predicted the magnitude of pitch angle is very small for this model in the range of 0 6 4 0 the predictions in this region ω l g 2 0 2 2 compare better with the measurements of the other experiments fonseca and guedes soares 2004 watanabe et al 1989 o dea et al 1992 noted that the pitch motion for a s175 model w r t varying wave steepness was virtually linear the measurements by chen et al 2001 exhibit a sharp decrease in the non dimensionalised frequency region 2 0 2 2 not noted by other experimentalists chen et al 2001 do not offer a specific reasoning about this odd behaviour the effect of distortion on pitch is very small when comparing the two way cfd fea and one way cfd1 way simulations the pitch response is over predicted in the one way simulations and this varies between 2 and 6 in general the heave and pitch motions are well predicted compared to the experiments and the differences between the two numerical methods are inconsequential 4 2 wave loads in regular head waves this section presents results in the form of first second and third harmonics of the wave encounter frequency the 2 node component was considered as the bending moment response in the vicinity of the 2 node wet natural frequency of the model numerical predictions of the first harmonic of amidships bending moment are shown in fig 12 the differences between the predictions and the measurements were distinguished in short and long waves regions the correspondence between the coupled simulations and the measurements is good in the region of λ l 1 0 1 3 close to the ship wave matching resonance in the longer wave region λ l 1 5 2 0 the predicted bending moments are lower than the measurements a maximum difference of 30 is observed at λ l 2 0 for both coupled simulations the one way simulations are slightly better than the two way simulations at λ l 1 5 in short waves λ l 0 9 all the numerical predictions are higher than the measurements however it must be noted that the experimental measurements exhibit some differences in this region and therefore the coupled predictions match well with watanabe et al 1989 at λ l 0 8 and 1 0 than against the other two experiments fig 13 shows the results from the comparative study using various established partially non linear methods and the model tests that was undertaken by issc 2000 the codes used were fundamentally modifications of linear strip theory to account for nonlinear effects in various ways the majority of the methods over predict the amidships bending moment in the region of λ l 0 7 1 2 and the uncertainties in the predictions for the range of wave frequencies investigated are quite high the presented coupled methods predicts the linear to a similar degree of accuracy if not better the uncertainties in the measurements are not addressed in the literature and hence it is not possible to quantify thoroughly the uncertainties between the predictions and the measurements finally when comparing the one and two way coupled simulations the results are in close agreement with each other at most frequencies and the maximum differences is less than 15 the s175 containership used in this study is comparatively rigid to modern containerships and the effect of flexibility modelled by the two way coupling is not noticeable in the first harmonic of the wave loads the one way coupling that is significantly faster computationally than the two way produces results with similar accuracy the second harmonic of amidships bending moments calculated using the coupled methods and the measurements are compared in fig 14 this component varies between 2 and 10 of the first harmonics in the measurements recorded by chen et al 2001 and is seen to be weaker than the other experiments and the numerical predictions the two way coupling predict the second harmonics in the range of 15 30 of the magnitude of the first harmonic and compares better with watanabe et al 1989 the coupled simulations predictions are in close proximity but the differences are larger than the first harmonics the one way coupling predictions are marginally larger at certain wave frequencies with respect to the third harmonics the comparison between the predictions and the experimental measurements chen et al 2001 are better as shown in fig 15 in the range of λ l 1 2 1 5 one way method predicts about 1 2 1 3 times stronger third harmonics than the two way method from the plots it is understood that the numerical predictions of the higher order harmonics of wave loads produce reliable results with sufficient engineering accuracy there are inevitable differences observed owing to uncertainties in measurements and the numerical methods when compared to the first harmonics the differences between the coupled methods in the higher order harmonics are slightly larger the nonlinearities in wave loads occurs due to severe green water that is shipped on the deck and the violent free surface flows these nonlinearities translate to higher order harmonic responses of the hull girder the nonlinear fluid actions are taken into account accurately in both the coupled cfd simulations and the effect of flexibility is not compelling for the relatively rigid s175 ship hence the results produced by both methods generally compare well with each other the 2 node component in the amidships bending moments for the range of wave frequencies investigated is shown in fig 16 there is close agreement between the two way simulations and the measurements for most wave frequencies except at λ l 1 0 and 1 2 the predictions at these two frequencies are nearly 6 times larger than the measurements these two frequencies correspond to the eighth and ninth order of the wave encounter frequency that coincides exactly with the wet frequency of the model this causes resonance and the high frequency vibrations are amplified especially in the absence of any structural damping lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2018 reported that the inclusion of structural damping in the fe model improved the predictions at these two frequencies and compared well with the measurements now the one way coupling predictions exhibits marked differences the 2 node high frequency components calculated are smaller than the measurements and the two way coupling it is an indication that the high frequency vibratory response is not captured well by the one way coupling method that omits certain key features in the fluid structure interactions mainly the added mass effects of deformable bodies to distinguish the two coupling methods used and the predicted response especially the high frequency components the time series signal is separated into low and high frequency using a band pass filter the results of these investigations are described in the next section fig 17 compares the hogging negative and sagging positive moment calculated using the one and two way coupling with the measurements and other numerical methods for h l 30 the nonlinearity is evident in the hogging and sagging loads and the coupled simulations predict this asymmetry very well compared to the other comparators 4 3 comparison of one way and two way coupling the band pass filter was used to extract the wave frequency first harmonic and the high frequency components closer to the 2 node wet frequency for two regular wavelengths λ l 1 1 and 1 3 for these two frequencies the first harmonics were found to be in close agreement with each other and the 2 node component predicted using the two methods differed by 30 λ l 1 1 and 62 λ l 1 3 in the frequency domain in figs 18 and 19 the two way and one way predictions for say λ l 1 1 are denoted as 1 1 t and 1 1 o respectively the time series vbm raw data low and high frequency components are denoted as data lf and hf respectively fig 18 shows the time histories of the total vbm amidships for λ l 1 1 as obtained from coupled analyses the vibratory responses computed using the two methods are different from each other as illustrated in this fig 19 however they become more apparent in fig 19 where they are separated into lf and hf components the lf component that includes the wave encounter frequency was extracted using a band pass filter 0 1 1 2 hz the hf band pass filter 6 9 hz extracts the structural responses close to the 2 node wet frequency 8 88 hz and hence it represents the whipping responses induced due to the severe green water shipped on the deck the encounter wave frequency response lf predicted using the two methods shows excellent agreement in the time domain see fig 19 the high frequency response hf displays distinctive differences in the predictions the two way predictions that compares well with the measurements in the frequency domain computes larger magnitude than the one way coupling in the time domain this observation is consistent in the case of λ l 1 3 shown in fig 21 the lf responses predicted by the two methods agree well however the hf component predicted by the two way coupling is in general stronger in the time series signal the total vbm time series shown in fig 20 gives an indication especially in hogging that the vibratory response in the one way coupling is larger but this is not the case when analysing using a band pass filter unfortunately the time series signal from the experiments are not available neverthelesss it is possible to make some general observations comparing the plots in figs 18 21 the 2 node component in frequency domain agrees well with the experiments and the one way predicts weaker responses it is also reflected when the hf time series of the present predictions are compared with each other it should be noted that when predicting the transient high frequency responses due to whipping in waves the two way coupled method produces accurate results this is due to the added mass effects that are implicitly taken into account in the two way coupling simualtions when predicting the whipping responses in regular or irregular waves the two way coupled simulations must be carried out and the time series analysis can be performed to study the transient vibrations in high frequency region this is of outmost importance when studying slamming induced whipping because it is not only the magnitude of the loads that are important but also the occurrence of the slamming event 4 4 the effect of mesh discretisation on one way simulations mesh discretisation around the body affects the vibratory responses predicted using a cfd method typically coarse discretisation results in an over prediction of the hydrodynamic damping and in turn this may lead to lower dynamic response oberhagemann et al 2012b the effect of a coarser mesh discretisation on the responses predicted using the one way coupling is reported in this section three wavelengths λ l 0 6 1 0 and 1 1 have been used as reference to assess and compare the results from numerical simulations accordingly cfd computations were performed for three wavelengths using a coarser mesh and the responses were calculated using only an one way method the details of the global mesh count and the grid arrangement is discussed in section 3 1 4 the coarse mesh was created from the medium mesh using a refinement factor of 2 in the near hull bow and stern and the wake refinement the mesh discretisation on the free surface has not been modified to ensure stable wave propagation the coarse and medium meshes contained a total global cell count of 3 3 m and 4 4 m respectively figs 22 and 23 show the comparison between two meshes for λ l 1 1 the results obtained on the coarser mesh for this wavelength demonstrate negligible differences in the low frequency lf and high frequency hf responses in the time series however in the case of λ l 1 0 see fig 24 that corresponds to the ship wave matching region there is a marked difference in the time series for the amidships vbm it is notable that in this wave matching region the high frequency vibrations are damped in the time history signal for the coarse mesh and a phase lag can be noted as the simulation progresses this observation satisfies the choice in terms of mesh discretisation see section 3 1 in fig 25 the magnitude of the wave frequency response or lf for the two meshes compares well omitting the obvious phase difference and notable differences appear in the hf response in the case of the short wavelength λ l 0 6 shown in figs 26 and 27 7 the predictions on the two meshes are identical indicating that the hydrodynamic damping is not affected by the mesh discretisation using the present configurations for shorter wave lengths it is noted that other wave frequencies exhibit a trend similar to λ l 1 1 the reason for showing the three frequencies is to demonstrate that the deviation in the predicted results occur only at the ship wave matching region due to the mesh discretisation the hydrodynamic damping is most sensitive in this resonant region and as we move away the results do not change drastically due to the mesh oberhagemann j et al 2012b 5 conclusions in this paper the experimental measurements of the flexible s 175 containership have been used to assess and compare predictions from one way and two way coupled time domain nonlinear ffsi computations experiments and computations were compared for a scenario corresponding to severe green water on decks resulting in nonlinear wave loads and high frequency whipping components in head seas in two way coupling the structural deformations were allowed to deform the fluid mesh thus representing closely the flexible model in regular wave head waves the study resulted in the following conclusions one and two way coupling methods predict well heave and pitch raos numerical predictions compare well with each other and with experimental results it is notable that for the ship type investigated the effect of flexibility that is implicit in the two way time domain hydroelastic simulations do not result in differences in the motion raos when compared with the rigid approximation in one way coupling such effects are not noticeable in frequency domain hydroelastic methods where the rigid and flexible ffsi idealisation are linear and uncoupled see bishop et al 1986 hirdaris and temarel 2009 the 1st harmonic of bending moment that represents the linear wave frequency contribution is predicted to a similar degree of accuracy when compared to measurements the results also compare well with other established nonlinear potential flow codes predictions of the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of the vbm amidships exhibit discrepancies for different ffsi models specifically one way coupling predicts stronger nonlinear responses particularly around the ship wave matching region the 2 node wave load component shows considerable differences and the one way coupling under predicts this component when compared to two way coupling and the measurements the effect of flexibility becomes evident in the high frequency contribution and two way simulations produce better estimations when compared to experiments the high frequency vibratory responses in vbm extracted using a band pass filter makes the difference between the two methods more evident the lf component representing the wave frequency are nearly identical however the hf component displays marked differences the effect of mesh discretisation using a coarser mesh can be noticed in the ship wave matching condition in this wave length the coarser mesh underestimates the wave loads and the high frequency components are heavily damped this effect does not occur in the other frequencies the computations were performed on a relatively rigid containership when compared to modern flexible ships thus from the evaluations presented it can be confirmed that the nonlinear wave loads represented as higher order harmonics are predicted well by one way coupling using cfd and fea the reason is because these nonlinear wave loads arise from fluid loading and not the structural responses and are implicitly accounted for in the cfd model in both one and two way methods one way coupling is computationally more efficient than two way coupled simulations however care has to be taken when evaluating the high frequency responses like whipping or springing in such cases the deformation of the ship even for a relatively rigid ship produces noticeable differences in the predictions the hydrodynamic actions due to the flexibility namely the added mass effect in the elastic deformation is not accounted for in the one way simulations and results in underestimation of wave loads for a more slender hull the differences could be alarming and can be detrimental thus the more accurate two way coupling idealisation should the preferred modelling ffsi

21924,this paper presents an investigation on the symmetric motions and loads of the s 175 containership undergoing severe green water impact that may result in high frequency whipping symmetric dynamic response results from two flexible fluid structure interaction approaches namely one and two way coupling methods are assessed and compared in regular head waves numerical computations are performed by coupling cfd star ccm and fea abaqus the creative meshing strategy adopted for rans cfd simulations is presented and numerical predictions are compared against experimental measurements over a range of wave frequencies it is concluded that heave pitch and the linear wave frequency component in the wave loads are predicted well by the two approaches however overall two way coupling compares better with measurements and a significant difference between the two different methods is especially noted in the high frequency whipping domain it is concluded that one way coupling underestimates the high frequency vibratory components and therefore care must be enforced when applying this method for calculating hydroelastic responses in waves keywords hydroelasticity of ships wave loads flexible fluid structure interactions ffsi reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics rans cfd finite element analysis fea 1 introduction in recent years the influence of the economies of scale leading to larger ship sizes resulted in more flexible or softer hulls that may vibrate globally in response to steady state or slamming induced excitations in such cases the structural deformations could significantly affect the flow field and the hydrodynamic loading that cannot be estimated accurately by rigid body approximations this fully coupled flexible fluid structure interaction ffsi is termed as hydroelasticity global hydroelastic effects are mainly categorised as springing and whipping springing is a wave excited steady state global hydroelastic hull girder vibration that may have significant effect in the fatigue strength of ships whipping on the other hand is transient vibration of hull girder due to wave impact loads arising from bow or stern slamming or severe green water on deck for example the for the case of an 8 100 teu modern containership discussed in the work of hirdaris et al 2010 hogging wave bending moments increase by about 11 and sagging bending moments by 42 when whipping and springing are taken under consideration today in practical ship design whipping is incorporated as a dynamic loading factor in the deterministic maritime classification rules lloyd s register 2018 this approach does not consider hull flexibility or the stochastic nature of the wave environment following the pioneering work of bishop and price 1979 there has been great deal of research on 2d and 3d frequency and time domain hydroelastic methods e g bishop et al 1980 bishop et al 1986 hirdaris and temarel 2009 a key drawback of conventional linear hydroelasticity theories e g when using 2d or 3d potential flow within a modal analysis framework and a beam or 3d fea structural representation is that they are unable to capture the nonlinearities involved in the fluid actions as a consequence of the assumptions involved hirdaris et al 2014 incorporation of some nonlinear effects in the aforementioned analyses could lead to some improvement in predictions depending for example on wave steepness e g park and temarel 2007 and shin et al 2015 nevertheless the models in frequency domain are inaccurate when influenced by strong nonlinearities say due to large amplitude motions or flexibility zhao and faltinsen 1993 faltinsen et al 2004 a ship in stochastic weather is subject to various nonlinearities that require hydrodynamic modelling investigations in the time domain ittc 2014 for example tuitman malenica 2009 developed a time domain numerical analysis tool to compute the global and local responses of symmetrically induced slamming and slamming induced whipping loads kim and kim 2009 presented a time domain approach for the first time that directly couples bem and fem to investigate the hydroelasticity of flexible floating structures this method was applied to predict the springing and whipping of a 60m barge 6500 teu and 10 000 teu containership kim and kim 2014 they noted good agreement in linear responses to waves but discrepancies were observed in nonlinear springing and whipping responses issc 2000 presented an exhaustive study to investigate the wave induced loads on the s 175 containership using state of art potential flow tools with particular emphasis on nonlinear ship motions and loads it was concluded that the various non linear strip theory formulations predict the magnitude of hog sag first harmonics with sufficient engineering accuracy however the nonlinear loads represented as higher order harmonics shows large scatter and care has to be taken when such procedures are used for design load calculations the advent of high performance computing over the recent years has resulted in development and implementation of fully nonlinear time domain cfd methods to simulate 3d ffsi problems of ships and offshore structures kim 2011 rans cfd methods can implicitly take into account the nonlinearities arising due to the hydrodynamic actions include compressibility and viscosity and aid in visualising the flow features this is an important aspect since it can help us understand the physical phenomena arising in the boundary between the fluid and the structure to date application of rans cfd to study the structural responses of ships in waves has been carried out using both one or two way partitioned coupling methods in one way coupling the fluid loads acting on the structure are transferred to the fe model and the structural responses are calculated for the time history of loading although the method is computationally fast the added mass effect due to the elasticity is not accounted for benra et al 2011 thus it could neglect the high frequency dynamic vibrations of the structure for example slamming induced whipping responses that could result in serious consequences seng 2012 a more accurate way to represent hydroelastic effects is by allowing the structural deformations calculated in the fea to distort the structure in the cfd simulations paik et al 2009 presented a coupled fsi method and compared the results of rigid one and two way coupling of s 175 containership with experiments they concluded that the one way coupling approach provided overall a similar quality of solution i e it captured the trends well in comparison to the two way coupling a conclusion which requires further validation for various test cases however in this work the two way coupling method considered only the effects of structural deformations in way of the amplitude and phase of vbm and the oscillations in rigid body accelerations on the other hand seng et al 2012 and takami et al 2018 reported that the one way coupling was unable to capture the vibratory components in the slamming pressures and the bending moments when compared to the experiments investigations carried out using two way coupling simulations have shown to be promising and the predictions compared well with measurements oberhagemann et al 2012a jensen et al 2014 lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2019 2018 it is believed that the differences in the predictions between the two way coupled analyses arose because of the effects of added mass during structural deformation this is because both one and two way coupling methods match in terms of physical flow phenomena assumptions excluding the influence of added mass on flexible distortions more recently the motions and wave loads on a flexible containership using one and two way cfd and fea simulations showed that the two way coupling results were promising and more accurate when compared to experiments takami and iijima 2019 this was investigated for one wave condition λ l 1 0 where the model experienced whipping loads a thorough study on the prediction of nonlinear wave loads for a range of wave frequencies does not exist this is important so that we get a clearer picture on the accuracy of the two methods when applied to nonlinear wave load predictions on a flexible ship and the associated limitations of one way coupling idealisations for such cases this paper presents numerical computations of symmetric motions and wave induced loads with emphasis on the nonlinear components for the case of the s175 containership progressing with forward speed in regular head waves the numerical computations are performed by coupling cfd star ccm and fea abaqus using two separate approaches namely one and two way coupling in one way coupling approach the fluid pressures exported from the cfd simulations are used to calculate the structural responses of the fe model in one time step however in two way coupling the structural deformations are fed back into the cfd solver multiple times in a time step to deform the mesh results are compared against the experimental measurements of chen et al 2001 watanabe et al 1989 and fonseca and guedes soares 2004 the simulations are performed for 8 wave frequencies where severe green water is shipped at some frequencies resulting in high frequency whipping components the main aim is to compare and contrast between the linear and nonlinear components in the amidships bending moment calculated using the two approaches 2 the s 175 containership experimental model this section describes the experimental set up of the s 175 containership model that is used as main test case for validating the numerical approach presented reviewing the measurements using flexible models of two benchmark studies carried out by chen et al 2001 and watanabe et al 1989 and the segmented model of fonseca and guedes soares 2004 showed some differences in the measurements especially in the case of higher order harmonics for very similar testing conditions the test matrix and the model properties are primarily obtained from chen et al 2001 nevertheless the results from watanabe et al 1989 and fonseca and guedes soares 2004 are also used to discuss the practical significance of the results the s 175 containership experiments were conducted in the towing tank of cssrc by using the fully elastic model presented by chen et al 2001 see table 1 the model was self propelled and was free to surge heave and pitch but it was constrained to sway yaw and roll in addition to the wave loads vertical accelerations at the fp heave and pitch motions were also measured this elastic model was constructed using material abs702 with thickness of the deck bottom and the side hull being 2 mm because of this low plate thickness the bending rigidity of the model amidships was estimated to be 18 higher than the intended scaled model accordingly the 2 node frequency in water was at 9 45 hz instead of 8 57 hz as calculated by the law of similitude 1 1 it is noted that the slightly longer model length 4 5 m tested by watanabe et al 1989 was made of synthetic resins and the bending rigidity concurred to the law of similitude the regular wave conditions selected for the numerical simulations presented in this paper are summarised in table 2 it was reported that the model experienced severe green water effects on deck and water spray in the range of the ship wave matching region for all wave heights tested the vertical bending moments were calculated from the strain measurements chen et al 2001 the location of measurement points are given in table 3 bending moments were recorded on the starboard side deck plate of the flexible model at the longitudinal locations in the numerical simulations a beam model represented the flexibility of the hull and the responses calculated on the beam nodes located in way of the corresponding longitudinal locations of the centre line the fundamental differences between the model tests and the numerical simulations are listed in table 4 3 numerical modelling and simulation 3 1 fluid modelling 3 1 1 computational fluid dynamics method the numerical method employed is a finite volume fv method in which the flow is assumed to be governed by rans equations ferziger and peric 2003 the rans equations reduce to the well known euler equations for the case of inviscid flow used in this paper first the spatial fluid domain is discretised into a finite number of control volumes cvs the integral form of conservation equations with the initial and boundary conditions are then applied to the control volume cell centres and simplified into an algebraic system of equations the governing equations not only contain surface and volume integrals but also time and spatial derivatives apart from the conservation equations the general transport equation for scalar quantities ϕ temperature t k ε ω turbulence quantities etc must also be satisfied in the control volume centres in the numerical simulations of moving co ordinates e g when the boundaries are deforming in the flow described in section 3 1 5 an additional space conservation equation must also be satisfied the space conservation equation describes that the continuity and momentum equations are satisfied when the control volumes are moving arbitrarily peric et al 2007 it ensures that the sum of the volume fluxes through the cells faces when undergoing motion or deformation is equal to the rate of change of their volume all integrals are computed using the midpoint rule implying that the value of the integrand is first evaluated at the centre of the integration domain face centres for surface integral cv centres for volume integrals and time level for time integrals and then multiplied by the range of integration in order to compute the diffusive fluxes gradients are also needed at cell faces the hybrid gauss least square gradient method is used to solve the transport equations the governing equations are solved using a segregated iterative method that employs a pressure velocity coupling algorithm namely the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 the rigid body motions are solved using a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi method and the position of the body is updated at every outer iteration this dfbi model enables the cfd solver to calculate the fluid forces moments and gravitational forces on the body in waves the forces and moments acting is used to calculate the translation of the centre of mass and the angular motion of the body for time integration the solver uses a trapezoidal scheme of second order accuracy star ccm 2012 the specific mesh motion technique is detailed in section 3 1 5 free surface flows are implemented using the volume of fluid vof tracking method hirt and nichols 1981 in order to account for the position of free surface interface in multiphase flows and allow for its arbitrary deformation an additional transport equation is solved for the volume fraction c in multiphase flows the volume fraction c is assigned a value of 0 when the cell consists entirely of air and when it is equal to 1 the cell is filled with only water the air water interface is represented by a volume fraction of 0 5 the hric high resolution interface capturing discretisation scheme is used for free surface flow along with the vof tracking to maintain a sharp interface star ccm 2012 the hric scheme is carried out by blending of upwind and downwind schemes and further corrected depending on the local courant number muzaferija et al 1998 3 1 2 wave simulations the vof wave modelling method was used to simulate the surface gravity waves in the cfd simulations accordingly the first order waves were modelled with a first order approximation of the stokes theory assuming regular periodic sinusoidal profile elevations a vof damping model was implemented in the simulations to reduce the wave amplitudes and damp them as they approach the outlet boundary this was done to ensure that the waves do not reflect back to the inlet boundary after reaching the outlet boundary numerical damping was executed by adding a resistance term to the vertical velocity of the wave choi and yoon 2009 the wave model also took into account the forward velocity of the ship the position of the ship is fixed and an additional velocity that corresponds to the velocity of the ship in the experiment was given as current velocity in the first order wave input 3 1 3 computational domain boundary conditions and solver settings the coordinate system of the fluid domain was designed such that the longitudinal direction of the ship is aligned with the x axis with the transom plane located at x 0 and the side wall extended in the y axis the mean free surface of wave lies at z 0 the computational domain extends to 2 0 l 4 0 l includes 2 0 l damping zone and 2 5 l towards the inlet outlet and side wall direction respectively the ship wave simulations in regular waves resulted in heave and pitch motions that make the problem symmetric with respect to the longitudinal axis consequently only one half of the solution domain was modelled using symmetry boundary condition to reduce the computational effort a constant damping distance of 2 0 l was set for all wave models see fig 1 for the boundary conditions selected in cfd simulations see table 5 these boundary conditions of the fluid domain for both rigid and flexible simulations were selected so that they mimic the conditions of a towing tank as shown in fig 2 at the velocity inlet boundary the position of the free surface and velocity of the first order wave were prescribed as field functions ferziger and peric 2003 accordingly in way of the outlet boundary the outlet pressure was set to the hydrostatic pressure of the wave and the position of free surface was specified this ensured that there is no reflection of the flow in the outlet boundary the top of the domain was set to velocity inlet as it prevents fluid from sticking to the walls this approach helps to avoid a velocity gradient between the fluid and the wall and directs the flow parallel to the outlet boundary lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2019 for the no slip wall condition the fluid tangential velocity was set to zero the boundary condition on the symmetry plane ensures that the normal velocity and the normal gradients of all variables are zero i e it reflects the flow to the other half of the domain based on modelling experience the total number of inner iterations per time step chosen for the coupled simulations was twelve a constant time step of 0 0008 s was used for two way simulations due to divergence issues with respect to the overset mesh motion and 0 001 s for the one way coupling 3 1 4 spatial and temporal discretisation a trimmed cartesian grid was used for discretising the 3d domain accordingly the ensuing mesh was made up effectively of unstructured hexahedral cells with trimmed cells adjacent to the ship model the trimmed cells were identified as hexahedral cells with one or more edges or corners that are cut forming polyhedral cells star ccm 2012 furthermore the outlet and the side wall boundaries were extruded using user specified stretching parameters keeping into consideration that there is not any significant change in the grid sizes of the adjacent layers that could result in numerical issues due to the number of test cases simulated it would be tedious to generate individual meshes for every single case thus a more rational approach has been adopted by designing a single mesh creatively for the wave height so that it is suitable for the entire range of wave frequencies to be investigated the snap shots of the mesh refinements at the bow and stern and in the wake region were shown in fig 3 for h l 50 when simulating wave body interaction in cfd the propagation and stability of the wave may be critical and difficult to achieve this is because it is sensitive to the cell sizes on the free surface time stepping and the order of the temporal discretisation westphalen et al 2008 for stable wave propagation the recommend values of cell sizes on the free surface were 80 cells per wave length and 20 cells per wave height star ccm 2012 ittc 2011 notwithstanding previous experience demonstrated that the minimum required cells per wave length could go down to 40 cells per wave length and therefore modelling was carried out on this basis lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2019 the number of cells in the wave height is a lot more critical and if violated will result in reduction in the wave height as the simulation progresses as a first step grid sizes on the free surface were set for λ l 1 0 as per the recommendations i e 80 cells per wave length and 22 cells per wave height the above cell sizes on the free surface designed for λ l 1 0 translates to approximately 50 and 160 cells per wave length for λ l 0 6 and λ l 2 0 respectively approximately 22 cells are contained per wave height in the free surface region for the wave height of l 50 volumetric blocks were used to carry out the mesh refinement for the intended extent based on modelling experience the following points are noteworthy in the design of the refinement blocks on the free surface the volumetric block on the free surface should be minimum 20 more than the wave height to ensure that the wave is within the refinement in the whole domain it is advisable to coarsen the free surface progressively and in steps along the z direction for a stable wave propagation the number of refinement blocks should be decided based on the scalar field plots of the velocity in the wave simulations three refinement blocks were provided in the mesh designed for the investigations and this can be noticed in fig 3 the free surface refinement in the overset region is larger than the background region to ensure that the two are coupled even when the body undergoes large motions this can be distinguished in fig 3 c and d where the refinement in the red region is greater than in blue the concept of overset mesh is described in section 4 1 5 thereafter the refinements adjacent to the hull and in the wake region were calculated to adequately capture the severe free surface flows arising due to the green water effects and the divergent wave system of the advancing ship kim and lee 2011 and piro 2013 suggest around 150 grid cells per wave length near the hull surface in both upstream and downstream directions when severe motions inducing slamming and green water effects are present additionally piro 2013 also used refined grids at the bow region recommending approximately 29 grid points along the depth to resolve the impact flow and water shipped on the deck in the simulations for λ l 1 160 cells per wave length shown by the blue box in fig 3 were placed in the vicinity of the hull this near hull refinement resulted in approximately 100 and 320 cells per wave length for λ l 0 6 and λ l 2 0 respectively the bow shown by blue box in fig 3 and stern contain 50 grid points along the depth the global mesh count of the background and overset mesh for the coupled simulations are given in table 6 the simulations were run in parallel mode with single precision on the csc finland high power computing facility taito the wall clock time exhausted to compute 1 s of real time simulation for the two way simulations using 256 processors is 8 10 h and for one way coupling using 80 processors was 5 h 3 1 5 mesh motion techniques the mesh motion or grid adaptation techniques used in the simulations of the ship in waves solely depends on whether the body is treated as a rigid or flexible for fsi problems the grid adaptation strategies are implemented commonly using two techniques namely morphing deforming and overset grids baker 1997 morphing occurs by deforming the fluid grid to conform to the motion of ship in waves the challenge is to maintain a good quality of fluid grid when it deforms in this case the transport equations shown in section 3 1 1 are solved by considering the arbitrary motion of the fluid vertices this technique is sometimes known as the arbitary lagrangian eulerian ale description in addition the space conservation law described in section 3 1 1 must also be satisfied as the cells move and change their location and in the case of two way simulations also change their shape ferziger and peric 2003 morphing could however create problems in the case of a body undergoing large motions in waves or when the mesh topologies are dramatically different the deformation of the entire fluid grid could result in the free surface falling outside the refined region of the domain additionally the quality of the deformed cells can become poor resulting in numerical errors a more efficient way to perform this is by the use of overset grids in this modelling approach the area around the body is defined as overset boundary in the overset region see fig 4 the overset boundaries are attached to the floating body and move with it freely with the resultant motion in waves the motion of the overset grid is relative to the background region that encompasses the fluid domain but is fixed in space generally overset grids are highly efficient in the case of free surface flow where the body undergoes large motions in waves but should be avoided for flows subject to large solution gradients or large regions of separated flows wang 1995 tang et al 2003 in the rigid body case grid adaptation to account for the motion of the model in waves is performed using the overset mesh the ship is enclosed within a floating region which is assigned as the overset region see blue region in fig 4 the overset region moves freely relative to the background region in response to the rigid body motions of heave and pitch of the ship in regular head waves a combination of overset mesh and mesh morphing is used in the case of the two way simulations to model the flexibility of the ship in such cases the nodal displacements that include the rigid body motions and distortions imported from abaqus are used to redistribute the fluid grid vertices by generating an interpolation field throughout the fluid domain the overset boundaries then move in response to the interpolation field created by the mesh morpher that in turn helps to maintain good quality mesh in the region 3 2 structural modelling for the purposes of this paper the structural responses to the fluid pressure and shear forces were computed using finite element analysis fea the main features of the finite element method and solvers used is described briefly in the following section furthermore the approach implemented to model the structural details in the form of a finite element mesh is detailed 3 2 1 finite element method abaqus 6 14 1 was used to represent and solve the structural part of the floating body in the original form of application of fea the exact solution required that both forces and moments are in equilibrium at all times over any arbitrary volume of the body bathe 2007 however a displacement method employed in this study approximated this equilibrium by replacing it with a weaker requirement i e the equilibrium must be maintained in an average sense over a finite number of divisions of the volume of the body in the displacement based method the basis of the finite element solution is the principle of virtual work or virtual displacements dassault systèmes 2013 according to the principle of virtual work for any infinitesimal displacement applied to the body in its state of equilibrium the total internal work which represents the stresses and strains is equal to the total external virtual work due to the applied loads bathe 2007 the stresses are in equilibrium with the external applied load and the virtual strains are corresponding to the virtual displacements bathe 2007 a direct step by step time domain integration technique was adopted to calculate the dynamic response accordingly the solution to equations was satisfied at discrete time intervals the solution to the discretised equation can be obtained using an explicit or implicit integration scheme the structural responses for both one way and two way coupling were calculated using the direct implicit time integration finite element analysis in abaqus fea solver accordingly the equilibrium was considered at time t δtn and the hilber hughes taylor implicit operator was used for time integration bathe 2007 this operator is an extension of the newmark β scheme where the numerical damping parameters α and β can be changed depending on the application it is true that the present interest is in the global response of the vessel however this method can be extended to investigate high frequency oscillations relating to for example slamming 3 2 2 finite element mesh the fea model of s 175 used in two way coupling consisted of 3d quadratic timoshenko beam elements abaqus b31 idealisation that take into account the ship hull flexibility dassault systèmes 2013 the structural properties were calculated using scaling laws from the full scale mass and structural properties published by wu and hermundstad 2002 a total of 100 beam elements were used the material properties of the beam elements corresponding to the flexible backbone of the model were defined as that of aluminium the effective shear area was taken into account in the fea model the hull surface was modelled using dummy surface elements sfm3d4 and these were connected to the beam nodes using kinematic coupling constraints a large number of nodes or surfaces were constrained to the motion of control nodes in this case the beam element nodes using kinematic coupling all six degrees of freedom were constrained in the kinematic coupling of beam nodes and the dummy surface in the sense that the beam deformations are imparted on to the hull these elements are required for performing the two way coupling between the cfd and fe topologies see fig 5 the fe model was constrained in the y axis no sway as well as translations and rotations about the x and z axes no roll and yaw the forward velocity effects of the s 175 containership in the two way coupling was carried out by assigning an additional velocity of propagation equal to the model velocity to the regular wave if the model is not restricted in the longitudinal direction in either the cfd or fea models it may experience a drift in the direction of wave propagation due to a longitudinal surge type force furthermore the time history of bending moment bm without bc shown in fig 6 revealed a progressive decrease in its magnitude as the simulation proceeded and the wave encounter period increased the solution adopted to counteract this effect has been to define an additional boundary condition in the fe model restricting the unphysical drift in the longitudinal direction thus an additional constraint of zero translation in the x direction to a beam node close to the lcg of the model was defined to restrict the longitudinal drift in this way the magnitude of bending moment with the boundary condition bm with bc was steady and the period of the response constant 3 3 fluid structure interaction models in general the term fsi can be used for rigid body and elastic body interactions with the fluid in solving fsi problems for flexible bodies the fluid and structural solvers should run in a coupled manner 3 3 1 one way coupling in one way coupling procedure the deformations of the structure were not fed back into the cfd solver to cause mesh deformations the cfd simulations of the ship treated as a rigid body in waves was solved at first in these simulations the fluid hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures and associated inertia forces were exported at prescribed time steps of the order of 0 01s a major drawback of the one way simulation has been that it does not account for the added mass effects due to the elastic deformation of the flexible ship in waves nevertheless the one way coupling is computationally fast another advantage is the flexibility of computing the structural dynamics using the wave loads exported from cfd using any fea software or even using a simple modal superposition on a beam ley and el moctar 2014 paik et al 2009 takami et al 2018 dhavalikar et al 2015 the application of the one way coupling procedure employed in this study is shown schematically in fig 7 the fluid pressures on the rigid ship were exported at a regular interval of 0 01 s to an external file the process of mapping the fluid pressure on to the fe model and exporting it at the prescribed time steps has been carried out automatically using a user defined java macros finite volume codes store the scalar quantities at each cell centre or the face centroid of the mesh and fea codes store the solution at the vertices of the mesh therefore a least square interpolation technique was used to map the fluid pressure stored in the face centroid of the mesh to the face centres of the sfm3d4 membrane elements see fig 5 the boundary conditions in the fe model have been same as described in section 4 2 1 with the exception of the boundary condition used to prevent the longitudinal drift this is because the forces in the longitudinal direction were not exported from the cfd model the pressure time histories from the external file were applied as loading at each time step using a fortran subroutine dynamic implicit analysis was performed using thread based parallelisation employing 6 cpus in such a way that one processor was dedicated to read the pressure file and the remaining processors were dedicated for computing the solution 3 3 2 two way coupling the two way coupling procedure is shown in fig 8 in this case the structural deformations were fed back into the fluid solver to redefine the body and the fluid grid as described in section 3 1 5 a partitioned algorithm was in turn used to execute the two way coupling causin et al 2005 two way coupling can be classified into explicit or implicit coupling in some fsi problems e g static deformation of a flexible aerofoil in a steady state airflow the interaction between the fluid and the structure will approach a steady state solution where the structural velocities decrease to very small or even zero values in these cases an explicit coupling where the exchange of information takes places once per time step can be used to calculate the steady state solution tallec and mouro 2001 rugonyi and bathe 2001 on the other hand when the mutual dependency on time is high and a small change in one solver will have an immediate effect on the other an implicit coupling scheme is preferred causin et al 2005 in the implicit coupling approach employed in this paper the information exchange between hydrodynamic loading and structural velocities is critical for the stability and accuracy of the coupled simulations bloxom 2014 based on modelling experience for twelve iterations for each time step four exchanges were performed within one time step face to face mapping in the coupling used least square interpolations and node to face mapping used shape function interpolation in the shape function interpolation technique the nodal displacements stored at the vertex of the fe mesh were interpolated to the face centroid of the fluid mesh using the shape functions in the case of 3 d trimmed cartesian cfd mesh hexahedral shape function was applied thus the fluid pressures at the interface stored at the face centroid of the cvs were mapped on the face centres of the sfm3d4 membrane surface elements using the least squares interpolation technique 3 4 analysing the simulation results the higher order harmonics and 2 node component in the wave induced loads were calculated from the time series signal of the vertical bending moment this was accomplished by decomposing the time series signal into its sinusoidal frequency components using a fourier transform the transformed signals were then identified as first second third harmonics of the wave encounter frequency as well as the 2 node wet resonant frequency the amplitude of the corresponding frequency components obtained at every wave encounter frequency was non dimensionalised with respect to the wave heights as follows c z z a w c θ θ k a w c m m d i where l denotes the length of the model g acceleration due to gravity k wave number z heave amplitude θ pitch amplitude a w h 2 wave amplitude m i denotes the frequency component of bending moment as defined by the index i and denominator d is the parameter for non dimensionalisation of the corresponding wave load component defined as d ρ g l 2 b h for m i m 1 double amplitude of first harmonic bending moment d ρ g l 2 b a w for m i m 2 3 2 node amplitude of 2nd 3rd and 2 node bending moment m sag hog is also non dimensionalised using the latter expression for d to calculate non dimensional coefficients in the above method an estimate of the wave height or amplitude was also required in the numerical simulations the wave height was recorded at a distance of one ship length from the forward of the ship and the average amplitude over 8 10 complete cycles was used in the calculations the structural responses calculated were band pass filtered into low frequency lf and high frequency hf signals so that the coupled simulations can be compared against each other the band pass filter used to extract the wave frequency component lf has been between 0 1 and 1 2 hz and for the high frequency component that includes the 2 node wet frequency was 6 9 hz the time history signals were analysed using a python code with the inbuilt scipy module for signal processing 4 results and discussion this section presents comparisons of numerical predictions using one and two way coupling against the experimental results of chen et al 2001 watanabe et al 1989 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 and wu and hermundstad 2002 see section 2 when different wave heights are used these are denoted by l 50 and l 30 the numerical predictions of one and two way coupling are denoted as cfd 1 way and cfd 2 way respectively 4 1 heave and pitch motion in waves the incoming wave was monitored at one ship length 3 6m in front of the model for linear ship motions average wave amplitudes over the last stable 8 10 wave periods were used to calculate the response amplitude operators raos incoming waves were assumed stable and decrease in wave amplitude was assumed to be less than 6 for the wave frequencies investigated responses were plotted against the non dimensionlised wave frequency ω l g where ω is the incident wave frequency in two way simulations the total displacement of a point probe on the deck of the ship at lcg is used calculate the heave rao and in one way simulations the rigid body heave is computed using cfd see fig 10 it was reported in the experiments that the model experienced severe green water on deck and water spray chen et al 2001 the time instances shown in fig 9 for λ l 1 0 shows the evidence of violent free surface flows and green water in the cfd simulations please note that this occurred at frequencies λ l 0 9 1 5 but no bow slamming was detected the ship wave matching resonance for the cfd predictions occurs in the vicinity of ω l g 2 2 λ l 1 1 the position of this resonance is also confirmed by the measured results shown in fig 10 the two way simulations are larger than the measurements by 15 25 in the longer wave lengths ω l g 1 8 2 5 the heave calculated using the one way or rigid body simulations is slightly smaller than the two way nevertheless the coupled simulations do not show marked difference in heave predictions the possible reason for the difference could be due to the omission of viscous effects in the cfd simulations it is known that symmetric motions are not influenced strongly by viscosity but in the tests cases investigated a large amount of green water and water spraying was observed in the experiments this might be one of the reasons due to the differences in the predictions the two way coupling predictions of the pitch rao shown in fig 11 show good agreement with the experiments except in the non dimensional frequency range of 2 0 2 2 where the pitch is over predicted the magnitude of pitch angle is very small for this model in the range of 0 6 4 0 the predictions in this region ω l g 2 0 2 2 compare better with the measurements of the other experiments fonseca and guedes soares 2004 watanabe et al 1989 o dea et al 1992 noted that the pitch motion for a s175 model w r t varying wave steepness was virtually linear the measurements by chen et al 2001 exhibit a sharp decrease in the non dimensionalised frequency region 2 0 2 2 not noted by other experimentalists chen et al 2001 do not offer a specific reasoning about this odd behaviour the effect of distortion on pitch is very small when comparing the two way cfd fea and one way cfd1 way simulations the pitch response is over predicted in the one way simulations and this varies between 2 and 6 in general the heave and pitch motions are well predicted compared to the experiments and the differences between the two numerical methods are inconsequential 4 2 wave loads in regular head waves this section presents results in the form of first second and third harmonics of the wave encounter frequency the 2 node component was considered as the bending moment response in the vicinity of the 2 node wet natural frequency of the model numerical predictions of the first harmonic of amidships bending moment are shown in fig 12 the differences between the predictions and the measurements were distinguished in short and long waves regions the correspondence between the coupled simulations and the measurements is good in the region of λ l 1 0 1 3 close to the ship wave matching resonance in the longer wave region λ l 1 5 2 0 the predicted bending moments are lower than the measurements a maximum difference of 30 is observed at λ l 2 0 for both coupled simulations the one way simulations are slightly better than the two way simulations at λ l 1 5 in short waves λ l 0 9 all the numerical predictions are higher than the measurements however it must be noted that the experimental measurements exhibit some differences in this region and therefore the coupled predictions match well with watanabe et al 1989 at λ l 0 8 and 1 0 than against the other two experiments fig 13 shows the results from the comparative study using various established partially non linear methods and the model tests that was undertaken by issc 2000 the codes used were fundamentally modifications of linear strip theory to account for nonlinear effects in various ways the majority of the methods over predict the amidships bending moment in the region of λ l 0 7 1 2 and the uncertainties in the predictions for the range of wave frequencies investigated are quite high the presented coupled methods predicts the linear to a similar degree of accuracy if not better the uncertainties in the measurements are not addressed in the literature and hence it is not possible to quantify thoroughly the uncertainties between the predictions and the measurements finally when comparing the one and two way coupled simulations the results are in close agreement with each other at most frequencies and the maximum differences is less than 15 the s175 containership used in this study is comparatively rigid to modern containerships and the effect of flexibility modelled by the two way coupling is not noticeable in the first harmonic of the wave loads the one way coupling that is significantly faster computationally than the two way produces results with similar accuracy the second harmonic of amidships bending moments calculated using the coupled methods and the measurements are compared in fig 14 this component varies between 2 and 10 of the first harmonics in the measurements recorded by chen et al 2001 and is seen to be weaker than the other experiments and the numerical predictions the two way coupling predict the second harmonics in the range of 15 30 of the magnitude of the first harmonic and compares better with watanabe et al 1989 the coupled simulations predictions are in close proximity but the differences are larger than the first harmonics the one way coupling predictions are marginally larger at certain wave frequencies with respect to the third harmonics the comparison between the predictions and the experimental measurements chen et al 2001 are better as shown in fig 15 in the range of λ l 1 2 1 5 one way method predicts about 1 2 1 3 times stronger third harmonics than the two way method from the plots it is understood that the numerical predictions of the higher order harmonics of wave loads produce reliable results with sufficient engineering accuracy there are inevitable differences observed owing to uncertainties in measurements and the numerical methods when compared to the first harmonics the differences between the coupled methods in the higher order harmonics are slightly larger the nonlinearities in wave loads occurs due to severe green water that is shipped on the deck and the violent free surface flows these nonlinearities translate to higher order harmonic responses of the hull girder the nonlinear fluid actions are taken into account accurately in both the coupled cfd simulations and the effect of flexibility is not compelling for the relatively rigid s175 ship hence the results produced by both methods generally compare well with each other the 2 node component in the amidships bending moments for the range of wave frequencies investigated is shown in fig 16 there is close agreement between the two way simulations and the measurements for most wave frequencies except at λ l 1 0 and 1 2 the predictions at these two frequencies are nearly 6 times larger than the measurements these two frequencies correspond to the eighth and ninth order of the wave encounter frequency that coincides exactly with the wet frequency of the model this causes resonance and the high frequency vibrations are amplified especially in the absence of any structural damping lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2018 reported that the inclusion of structural damping in the fe model improved the predictions at these two frequencies and compared well with the measurements now the one way coupling predictions exhibits marked differences the 2 node high frequency components calculated are smaller than the measurements and the two way coupling it is an indication that the high frequency vibratory response is not captured well by the one way coupling method that omits certain key features in the fluid structure interactions mainly the added mass effects of deformable bodies to distinguish the two coupling methods used and the predicted response especially the high frequency components the time series signal is separated into low and high frequency using a band pass filter the results of these investigations are described in the next section fig 17 compares the hogging negative and sagging positive moment calculated using the one and two way coupling with the measurements and other numerical methods for h l 30 the nonlinearity is evident in the hogging and sagging loads and the coupled simulations predict this asymmetry very well compared to the other comparators 4 3 comparison of one way and two way coupling the band pass filter was used to extract the wave frequency first harmonic and the high frequency components closer to the 2 node wet frequency for two regular wavelengths λ l 1 1 and 1 3 for these two frequencies the first harmonics were found to be in close agreement with each other and the 2 node component predicted using the two methods differed by 30 λ l 1 1 and 62 λ l 1 3 in the frequency domain in figs 18 and 19 the two way and one way predictions for say λ l 1 1 are denoted as 1 1 t and 1 1 o respectively the time series vbm raw data low and high frequency components are denoted as data lf and hf respectively fig 18 shows the time histories of the total vbm amidships for λ l 1 1 as obtained from coupled analyses the vibratory responses computed using the two methods are different from each other as illustrated in this fig 19 however they become more apparent in fig 19 where they are separated into lf and hf components the lf component that includes the wave encounter frequency was extracted using a band pass filter 0 1 1 2 hz the hf band pass filter 6 9 hz extracts the structural responses close to the 2 node wet frequency 8 88 hz and hence it represents the whipping responses induced due to the severe green water shipped on the deck the encounter wave frequency response lf predicted using the two methods shows excellent agreement in the time domain see fig 19 the high frequency response hf displays distinctive differences in the predictions the two way predictions that compares well with the measurements in the frequency domain computes larger magnitude than the one way coupling in the time domain this observation is consistent in the case of λ l 1 3 shown in fig 21 the lf responses predicted by the two methods agree well however the hf component predicted by the two way coupling is in general stronger in the time series signal the total vbm time series shown in fig 20 gives an indication especially in hogging that the vibratory response in the one way coupling is larger but this is not the case when analysing using a band pass filter unfortunately the time series signal from the experiments are not available neverthelesss it is possible to make some general observations comparing the plots in figs 18 21 the 2 node component in frequency domain agrees well with the experiments and the one way predicts weaker responses it is also reflected when the hf time series of the present predictions are compared with each other it should be noted that when predicting the transient high frequency responses due to whipping in waves the two way coupled method produces accurate results this is due to the added mass effects that are implicitly taken into account in the two way coupling simualtions when predicting the whipping responses in regular or irregular waves the two way coupled simulations must be carried out and the time series analysis can be performed to study the transient vibrations in high frequency region this is of outmost importance when studying slamming induced whipping because it is not only the magnitude of the loads that are important but also the occurrence of the slamming event 4 4 the effect of mesh discretisation on one way simulations mesh discretisation around the body affects the vibratory responses predicted using a cfd method typically coarse discretisation results in an over prediction of the hydrodynamic damping and in turn this may lead to lower dynamic response oberhagemann et al 2012b the effect of a coarser mesh discretisation on the responses predicted using the one way coupling is reported in this section three wavelengths λ l 0 6 1 0 and 1 1 have been used as reference to assess and compare the results from numerical simulations accordingly cfd computations were performed for three wavelengths using a coarser mesh and the responses were calculated using only an one way method the details of the global mesh count and the grid arrangement is discussed in section 3 1 4 the coarse mesh was created from the medium mesh using a refinement factor of 2 in the near hull bow and stern and the wake refinement the mesh discretisation on the free surface has not been modified to ensure stable wave propagation the coarse and medium meshes contained a total global cell count of 3 3 m and 4 4 m respectively figs 22 and 23 show the comparison between two meshes for λ l 1 1 the results obtained on the coarser mesh for this wavelength demonstrate negligible differences in the low frequency lf and high frequency hf responses in the time series however in the case of λ l 1 0 see fig 24 that corresponds to the ship wave matching region there is a marked difference in the time series for the amidships vbm it is notable that in this wave matching region the high frequency vibrations are damped in the time history signal for the coarse mesh and a phase lag can be noted as the simulation progresses this observation satisfies the choice in terms of mesh discretisation see section 3 1 in fig 25 the magnitude of the wave frequency response or lf for the two meshes compares well omitting the obvious phase difference and notable differences appear in the hf response in the case of the short wavelength λ l 0 6 shown in figs 26 and 27 7 the predictions on the two meshes are identical indicating that the hydrodynamic damping is not affected by the mesh discretisation using the present configurations for shorter wave lengths it is noted that other wave frequencies exhibit a trend similar to λ l 1 1 the reason for showing the three frequencies is to demonstrate that the deviation in the predicted results occur only at the ship wave matching region due to the mesh discretisation the hydrodynamic damping is most sensitive in this resonant region and as we move away the results do not change drastically due to the mesh oberhagemann j et al 2012b 5 conclusions in this paper the experimental measurements of the flexible s 175 containership have been used to assess and compare predictions from one way and two way coupled time domain nonlinear ffsi computations experiments and computations were compared for a scenario corresponding to severe green water on decks resulting in nonlinear wave loads and high frequency whipping components in head seas in two way coupling the structural deformations were allowed to deform the fluid mesh thus representing closely the flexible model in regular wave head waves the study resulted in the following conclusions one and two way coupling methods predict well heave and pitch raos numerical predictions compare well with each other and with experimental results it is notable that for the ship type investigated the effect of flexibility that is implicit in the two way time domain hydroelastic simulations do not result in differences in the motion raos when compared with the rigid approximation in one way coupling such effects are not noticeable in frequency domain hydroelastic methods where the rigid and flexible ffsi idealisation are linear and uncoupled see bishop et al 1986 hirdaris and temarel 2009 the 1st harmonic of bending moment that represents the linear wave frequency contribution is predicted to a similar degree of accuracy when compared to measurements the results also compare well with other established nonlinear potential flow codes predictions of the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of the vbm amidships exhibit discrepancies for different ffsi models specifically one way coupling predicts stronger nonlinear responses particularly around the ship wave matching region the 2 node wave load component shows considerable differences and the one way coupling under predicts this component when compared to two way coupling and the measurements the effect of flexibility becomes evident in the high frequency contribution and two way simulations produce better estimations when compared to experiments the high frequency vibratory responses in vbm extracted using a band pass filter makes the difference between the two methods more evident the lf component representing the wave frequency are nearly identical however the hf component displays marked differences the effect of mesh discretisation using a coarser mesh can be noticed in the ship wave matching condition in this wave length the coarser mesh underestimates the wave loads and the high frequency components are heavily damped this effect does not occur in the other frequencies the computations were performed on a relatively rigid containership when compared to modern flexible ships thus from the evaluations presented it can be confirmed that the nonlinear wave loads represented as higher order harmonics are predicted well by one way coupling using cfd and fea the reason is because these nonlinear wave loads arise from fluid loading and not the structural responses and are implicitly accounted for in the cfd model in both one and two way methods one way coupling is computationally more efficient than two way coupled simulations however care has to be taken when evaluating the high frequency responses like whipping or springing in such cases the deformation of the ship even for a relatively rigid ship produces noticeable differences in the predictions the hydrodynamic actions due to the flexibility namely the added mass effect in the elastic deformation is not accounted for in the one way simulations and results in underestimation of wave loads for a more slender hull the differences could be alarming and can be detrimental thus the more accurate two way coupling idealisation should the preferred modelling ffsi
