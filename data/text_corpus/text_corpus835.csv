4175,groundwater gw is a vital resource for human consumption agriculture environmental sustainability and socio economic development in different parts of the world besides gw plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events however there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature therefore it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management especially during drought events in this study we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines svms combined with data assimilation da technique to predict the change in groundwater levels cgwls at 1 to 3 month time scales for 46 gw wells located at the northeast united states the in situ climate variables and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission informed groundwater anomalies data gwa are used to develop the models the results suggest that svms svm da models forced with limited climate variables i e precipitation solar radiation air temperature infrared surface temperature can forecast the cgwls up to 3 month lead times at most of the locations the addition of grace data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of svms at most of the stations where a strong relationship exists between the cgwls and the gwa the svm da model comparatively performed better than svms at most of the stations keywords groundwater support vector machine grace data assimilation 1 introduction groundwater constitutes one of the most significant freshwater resources shiklomanov and rodda 2003 it plays a vital role in the hydrologic cycle taylor et al 2013 and supplies water for human consumption and agriculture production in different parts of the world due to population growth and climate extremes freshwater aquifers are increasingly stressed especially in the arid and semiarid regions relying exclusively on groundwater sun 2013 the pace of groundwater depletion has doubled during the last several decades with increased water demand konikow 2011 wada et al 2011 wada et al 2012 quantifying groundwater resources spatial and temporal variability and developing appropriate models to predict groundwater availability over short to long term periods are essential to water resource management during drought events mishra and singh 2010 the groundwater accounts for 20 of the total water withdrawal in the usa which provides more than 90 of the water used for the rural domestic supplies barber 2009 this highlights the potential role of groundwater resources for socio economic development in the united states groundwater level forecasting is a valuable tool to support the sustainable management of water resources data driven stochastic models are suitable for short term forecasting due to their simplicity in model development and implementation over the past decades the data driven techniques such as neural network models adamowski and chan 2011 sun 2013 dudley et al 2017 guzman et al 2017 amaranto et al 2018 zanotti et al 2019 sun et al 2019 jeong et al 2020 wu et al 2021 self organized map som nourani et al 2015 chang et al 2016 boosted regression trees brt rosecrans et al 2017 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and m5 model trees mt rezaie balf et al 2017 and support vector machines khan and coulibaly 2006 yoon et al 2011 wei et al 2020 are widely used the complexity of the data driven models is less in terms of calibration parameter estimation and handling the different sources of uncertainties than the physically based models burrows and doherty 2016 gianni et al 2019 besides these models do not require information on the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer adamowski and chan 2011 zanotti et al 2019 the machine learning tools are also widely used in different types of groundwater assessment such as groundwater potential prediction chen et al 2021 mosavi et al 2021a salinity susceptibility mapping mosavi et al 2020 mosavi et al 2021b groundwater fluctuation prediction choubin and malekian 2017 nitrate assessment sajedi hosseini et al 2018 and other hydroclimate related research and applications kurtulus and razack 2010 he et al 2014 roushangar et al 2014 konapala and mishra 2020a panahi et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the data driven models can also overcome the complexity associated with data limitations parameter estimations in a different setting such as the complex groundwater systems banerjee et al 2009 supra permafrost groundwater level variation juan et al 2015 and coastal aquifers yoon et al 2011 taormina et al 2012 among different machine learning tools support vector machines svms have become increasingly popular in hydrology liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 previous studies highlighted the better performance of svms than the anns khan and coulibaly 2006 yoon et al 2011 the remote sensing products have several advantages alijanian et al 2017 alijanian et al 2019 chawla et al 2020 and are widely used for different applications such as water security chawla et al 2020 food security he et al 2020 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b and drought assessment mishra et al 2015 recently the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 enables satellite based monitoring of global water storage which provides the scientific community an unprecedented insight into terrestrial water storage tws variations around the world rodell et al 2018 the grace data has been commonly used to monitor groundwater storage variations rodell and famiglietti 2001 rodell et al 2007 long et al 2013 jing et al 2020b yin et al 2020 however these changes are monitored at a high coarser resolution it fails to provide groundwater storage change estimates at local regional scales at which most groundwater management schemes are applied castellazzi et al 2016 a limited number of studies evaluated the performance of coarse resolution grace data to predict in situ groundwater levels using machine learning models sun 2013 our study will complement the previous studies e g sun 2013 by further improving our understanding of the performance of grace data to predict in situ groundwater levels using machine learning based models the major difference between sun 2013 and our study are a higher number 46 nos of in situ groundwater wells located in different heterogenous are selected compared to a limited number 10 nos of stations b we implemented support vector machine svm and ensemble kalman filtering enkf to construct the svm data assimilation svm da model compared to the ann model in the previous study and c the performance of recent grace product rl 06 0 5 degree resolution was evaluated compared to the release 5 of grace level 2 product available at 1 degree resolution the prior results are not conclusive as the grace data s potential is not adequately explored for monitoring the in situ groundwater information in different heterogeneous aquifer conditions therefore it is important to investigate grace data s value for simulating in situ local scale groundwater changes with respect to the local climate variables which is the key motivation of this study although the performance of data assimilation techniques is investigated for different hydrologic applications they are yet to be investigated in groundwater level predictions especially by incorporating the grace data sets the overall objective of this study is to forecast the change in groundwater levels cgwls for the selected wells located in the northeast usa at 1 to 3 month lead times using the svms and the enkf da technique the key research questions that are addressed in this study are 1 to investigate the efficiency of svms for the prediction of cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales forced with limited climate variables 2 to assess the improvement of svms for the prediction of cgwls with grace as additional forcing variable and 3 to evaluate the performance of coupled svm da model for the prediction of cgwls at 1 to 3 month time scales the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of the study area which is followed by the data description highlighting in situ and grace data sets in section 3 the methodology section is described in section 4 and the implementation of the proposed methods is discussed in section 5 the results are provided in section 6 and followed by a discussion in section 7 finally the conclusions are provided in section 8 2 study area northeast us is one of the wettest parts of the us receiving 700 to 1600 mm of precipitation per year however due to population growth and increasing use of surface and groundwater resources the water stress gets aggravated during drought conditions averyt et al 2013 there is a 3 to 10 km3 depletion of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sand and gravel aquifers in the eastern coast between 1900 and 2008 usgs 2013 overuse of surface water reduces the recharge leading to groundwater depletion in addition land use has gone through significant change over the past several decades in the northeastern us the water supply in the northeast is mainly derived from surface waters which are heavily regulated to meet the water supply demand of urbanized areas such as new york city due to the expanding urbanized areas and high levels of impervious ground the infiltration has decreased over time leading to a decrease in groundwater recharge and low flow volumes usgs 2013 in addition to rapid land use change the recent increase in climate variability can affect local groundwater levels overall 46 well stations fig 1 located in the northeast united states are selected in this study these stations are mostly located within the new england and mid atlantic hydrologic units with mixed forest and deciduous forest fig s1 table s1 3 data description 3 1 in situ data the groundwater level data used in this study are collected from the usgs national water information system https waterdata usgs gov nwis gw for the northeast united states the data sets are collected at a daily time scale between 1st january 2007 to 31st december 2016 for 46 wells located in the northeast united states the data sets with missing values are not included in the analysis the observed in situ climate variables including air temperature t2m solar radiation sr precipitation p and the infrared surface temperature gt at a daily time scale for the same period is obtained from the united states climate reference network uscrn stations https www ncdc noaa gov crn qcdatasets html the in situ meteorological stations are selected such that they are located within a 1 degree resolution of the groundwater wells therefore each well site is represented by at least one in situ meteorological station within a 1 degree resolution with continuous daily climate variables i e t2m p sr and gt the observed meteorological data and the groundwater level data available daily are averaged to represent a monthly time scale the high pass hodrick prescott filter hp filter method sun 2013 is applied to generate the monthly cgwls time series by removing the long term trends from the aggregated monthly groundwater level data series 3 2 grace data terrestrial water storage tws can be defined as the summation of different forms of water on the land surface and in the subsurface famiglietti 2004 girotto and rodell 2019 in this study we selected the recently released monthly grace product rl 06 january 2007 to december 2016 available at 0 5 degree resolution obtained from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov the tws products in this version are obtained by using the mass concentration blocks mascons techniques the available dataset is derived based on the anomalies relative to january 2004 december 2009 as the baseline period therefore the tws datasets from grace are referred to as terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa as grace has no vertical resolution hydrological models built on physical processes can approximately provide groundwater storage changes by subtracting twsa derived from grace and vertical level changes associated with water storage at the canopy snow and soil moisture global land data assimilation system gldas models forced by global meteorological forcing data sheffield et al 2006 provide optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 gldas provides important information on major components of tws the noah lsm from nasa s global land data assimilation system was extensively used in previous grace studies long et al 2014 long et al 2017 jing et al 2020a sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020 noah lsm output from current gldas version 2 1 available from nasa s earthdata site http earthdata nasa gov was used in this study noah simulated terrestrial water storage twsnoah was calculated by integrating soil moisture in all four soil layers sml1 0 10 cm sml2 10 40 cm sml3 40 100 cm and sml4 100 200 cm accumulative snow water snw and total canopy water storage cws twsnoah is calculated using the following equation 7 tw s noah s m l 1 s m l 2 s m l 3 s m l 4 s n w c w s to be consistent with grace twsa twsagrace the long term mean during january 2004 to december 2009 was subtracted from twsnoah to obtain noah terrestrial water storage anomalies twsanoah the difference between twsagrace and twsanoah is used to quantify grace informed groundwater anomalies gwa gwa can be calculated with equation 8 8 gwa t w s a grace t w s a noah here gwa is incorporated as an additional forcing variable in svm and svm da predictive models for the prediction of cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales 4 methodology 4 1 support vector machine the support vector machine svm has been widely used in many disciplines to model and control complex engineering systems su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020b panahi et al 2020 in the hydro meteorological disciplines svms were greatly used for the multi layer soil moisture estimation liu et al 2010 yu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 flood stage forecasting chen et al 2010 prediction of lake water levels at 3 12 month scale khan and coulibaly 2006 long term drought forecast belayneh and adamowski 2012 belayneh et al 2014 liu et al 2017 groundwater levels forecast yoon et al 2011 and reservoir operation zhang et al 2018 in this study the nonlinear regression svms are used to predict the changes in groundwater level at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales the algorithm of svm maps the input space in a high dimensional feature space utilizing kernels vapnik 1995 a functional dependency f x between independent variables x 1 x 2 x m taken from x r m and dependent output y 1 y 2 y n with y r taken from a set n of independent and identify distributed observations is set through the following regularized function vapnik 1998 1 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b ε ξ i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 2 f x j 1 m w j x j b w r m b r where m is the number of the support vectors b is the bias w represents the vector weights for inputs to the output c is the penalty parameter that determines the tradeoff between the complexity of the function f x and the tolerance for error in the prediction ε is a constant called the tube size that represents the optimization performance ξ i and ξ i are slack variables that determine the degree to which input samples with error greater than ε would be panelized vapnik 1998 wang et al 2012 su et al 2018 accordingly the dual convex optimization problem shown in equation 1 can be solved using the lagrangian function as in equation 3 3 l w b ξ i ξ i α i α i η i η i 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i i 1 n α i ε ξ i y i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b i 1 n α i ε ξ i y i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b i 1 n η i ξ i η i ξ i where η i η i α i and α i are the lagrangian multipliers which satisfy the nonnegative constraint the lagrangian function l maximizes η i η i α i α i and minimizes w b ξ i and ξ i according to the kkt karush kuhn tucker condition su et al 2018 the optimization problem can be equivalently solved in its dual form as equation 4 4 max α i α i 1 2 j 1 n i 1 n α i α i α j α j k x i x j i 1 n α i α i y i i 1 n α i α i ε s t w i n α i α i x i 0 α i α i c i 1 n therefore the regression function of svm can be obtained as equation 5 5 f x i 1 n α i α i k x x j b where k x x j is the kernel function when svm is used to solve the nonlinear regression problem the nonlinear problem is mapped to a high dimensional space and the linear function is constructed in this space by selecting an appropriate kernel function the regression f x relies only on the kernel function k x x j generally the kernel function needs to meet the mercy s condition and can describe the distribution characteristics of training data in practice the radial kernel function rbf kernel shown in equation 6 is applied in nonlinear regression analysis due to its improved performance as highlighted in previous studies su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020a 6 k x x i exp γ x x i 2 besides selecting kernel function the svm regression model also requires a suitable kernel parameter γ penalty parameter c and the insensitive parameter ε in this study the rbf kernel function is selected while the trial and error method is adopted to identify these appropriate parameters γ c and ε similar to the previous studies gill and mckee 2007 liu et al 2010 yu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020a 4 2 data assimilation data assimilation da concept is a promising technique to optimally estimate hydrological variables by merging observed information or remote sensing data into models moradkhani et al 2005 montzka et al 2011 liu et al 2016 liu and mishra 2017 liu et al 2017 ensemble kalman filter enkf is a popular da technique and it has been widely used in hydrology related studies moradkhani et al 2005 li et al 2012 yin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu and mishra 2017 liu et al 2017 li et al 2020b enkf is a monte carlo approximation of a sequential bayesian filtering process which alternates between an ensemble forecast step and a state variable update step reichle et al 2002 the dual enkf technique is adopted in this paper which consists two steps generating an ensemble of model outputs and updating it when new observations become available 5 implementation of proposed methods 5 1 variable selection a preliminary analysis is performed based on the correlation analysis to identify input variables for the two selected models svm and svm da the climate variables i e p sr t2m gt and the grace informed groundwater anomalies gwa at different lag times 1 to 3 months are used as predictors while the in situ cgwls are used as predictand the correlation coefficient methods are widely used to select input variables in different machine learning applications sun 2013 liu et al 2016 sun et al 2019 irrgang et al 2020 it was observed that the correlation strength between the cgwls and the selected climate variables varies with changes in the landscape and climate patterns fig 2 the strength of individual climate variables with cgwls varies at different in situ well stations generally the correlation coefficient between the cgwls with the temperature related variables i e t2m gt sr is positive and significant at most of the well locations the correlation coefficient with the grace twsa is dominated negatively at most stations with a magnitude below 0 5 however the correlation coefficient with gwa is primarily positive at most locations especially at the stations with a high negative association with grace twsa in contrast a weak negative correlation was observed with respect to the precipitation the association between cgwls and the temperature related variables i e t2m gt sr is comparatively higher at the lagged 1 to 3 months compared to the current month this highlights that the temperature related variables at previous lagged 1 to 3 months are likely to influence in situ cgwls significantly the higher correlation was observed at two months lagged time scale between selected variables unlike the temperature related variables the association between cgwls and precipitation at the lagged one month was higher than other lagged values meanwhile the association with gwa at the lagged one month seems slightly stronger at most well stations besides a higher autocorrelation coefficient greater than 0 5 is observed at the lagged one month but then tends to decrease with the increase in lagged time fig s2 the autocorrelation coefficient of the cgwls is lower than 0 5 and 0 3 at the lagged two and three months at most of the stations based on the above analysis t2m p sr gt and gwa are selected as the potential input variables in the svms 5 2 implementation of svm and svm da models in this study two models svm and svm da are implemented to predict the cgwls at 1 to 3 month time scales the flowchart of the svm and svm da model is provided in fig 3 the variables selected in the previous step section 5 1 are used as input in the svm model development we evaluated three cases to predict the cgwls at subsequent one to three month time scales using air temperature t2m solar radiation sr precipitation p the infrared surface temperature gt and the grace informed groundwater anomalies gwa at previous lagged 1 to 2 months as the input predictor variables case 1 is designed to evaluate the potential of svm for the prediction of cgwl using limited climate variables p t sr t t2m t t 1 gt t t 1 as input ensemble in svm case 2 is designed to investigate the potential of grace informed data to predict in situ cgwls therefore grace information i e gwa is included as an additional predictor in addition to the climate variables used in case 1 the predictors for the case 2 include gwa t p t sr t t2m t t 1 and gt t t 1 in the svm model case 3 is designed to investigate the efficiency of the data assimilation technique for improving svm da for the prediction of cgwl using the same independent variables input as in case 2 for the prediction of cgwl at the subsequent two t 2 and three t 3 month lead times the predicted cgwl at subsequent one two month lead times is included as additional input in each case for example the predicted cgwls at one month lead time will be used as an additional input in the model to predict cgwls at a two month lead time the initial 5 year 60 months data are used to train the svm models while the following 5 year data used for prediction the details of input and output variables for three cases implemented in this study are provided in table 1 besides selecting the kernel parameter γ penalty parameter c and the insensitive parameter ε the uncorrelated variable selection is one of the core steps during the model development process vapnik 2013 the model performance may be influenced e g overfitting issues if the multiple correlated variables are included in the analysis in this study the rbf kernel function is selected and a trial and error method is adopted to identify these appropriate parameters γ c and ε similar to the previous studies liu et al 2016 su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020a as stated in previous literature liu et al 2016 the performance of svm may be influenced by the input variables cost function kernel parameter and regularization parameter the cross validation error function with mse seen as penalty parameter c value set to 5 insensitive parameter ε in this study the parameters in each case are listed in table 1 in the svm da model as the observed data is available at the forecasted time step t m m 1 2 n the dual enkf technique is applied to update the process to improve the svm prediction based on the dual enkf samuel et al 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 there are two separate state space representations for the state and the parameters through two interactive filters by updating model parameters and model states for the svm da in this study the model parameters are first updated and then the states the simulations from each step are considered separately therefore the svm da model includes two outputs one is from model parameters updated which is presented as yd then the observed cgwls are used to update the yd with the enkf technique to get the updated prediction yu which is the state update prediction the procedure of svm da is presented in fig 3 in the enkf da process the input variables e g t2m p sr gt error is assumed to be gaussian distribution with 1 of the mean of each input variable during the initial training ensemble the observed error and modeled error of cgwls are assumed to be gaussian distribution with a 1 variance of observed cgwls in the initial training ensemble the enkf technique can reach its maximum efficiency when updating ensemble size approaches around 15 liu et al 2016 therefore the updated ensemble size is set to be the same size as the training ensemble 5 3 evaluation criteria a number of metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models and each metric can capture the individual strength of the predictive models maier et al 2010 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 li et al 2020a we selected four goodness of fit gof statistics such as correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse to evaluate the performance of the proposed svm and svm da models these metrics are extensively used to test the model performances for hydrological estimation or prediction brocca et al 2011 yu et al 2012 shoaib et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 r is broadly used to evaluate the linear relationship between observed and simulated variables mae is used to measure the absolute residual while rmse is to calculate the standard deviation of the residuals nse determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance the formulation for each metric is shown in equation 9 to equation 12 as follows 9 r i 1 n y i y y i y i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 10 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 11 mae i 1 n y i y i n 12 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where y i is the observed and y i is the predicted cgwls at the i th time step generally the better models are represented by the smaller magnitude of the rmse and mae combined with larger r and the nse magnitude according to previous studies liu et al 2016 2017 sun et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 besides the normalized information contribution nic used in liu et al 2017 yan et al 2017 getirana et al 2020 is selected to evaluate the efficiency of the addition of gwa for the cgwls predictions at 1 to 3 month time scales the calculation procedure for nic of each metric is provided in equation 13 to 16 13 rms e nic rms e ol r m s e up rms e ol 14 ma e nic ma e ol m a e up ma e ol 15 r nic r up r ol 1 r ol 16 ns e nic ns e up n s e ol 1 n s e ol where gofol means the gof from the open loop while gofup means the gof derived from the updated experiment which belongs to case 2 to case 3 in this study the nic metric range from to 1 if nic 0 it indicates that the updated case improves the predictions compared to the control run case 1 if nic 0 the updated case does not add any skill if nic 0 the updated case performed poorly compared to the control run and if nic 1 the updated case achieve the maximum skill liu et al 2017 getirana et al 2020 6 results the performance for the prediction of cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales based on svm and svm da models are evaluated using multiple statistical metrics at selected stations figs 4 5 it was observed that the svm and svm da models performed reasonably well for the predictions of cgwls up to 3 month time scales at most of the selected stations according to the gof criteria the addition of grace information gwa as input variable slightly improved the performance of svm at some of the stations simultaneously the combination of svm da model greatly enhanced the performance of the individual svm model at most of the stations according to the positive nic values of r fig 4 nse fig 5 mae fig 6 and rmse fig 7 moreover svm or svm da performs better at the stations with the higher association between input variables i e t2m gwa and the cgwls fig 2 however the performance of svm and svm da models slightly decreased as the lead time increased from subsequent 1 to 3 month at some of the stations specifically in case 1 scenario the predicted cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month lead times compare well with the observed cgwls at most selected groundwater well stations most of these stations present a high magnitude of r greater than 0 5 fig 4 and nse above 0 fig 5 combined with a low magnitude of mae lower than 1 fig 6 and rmse lower than 1 fig 7 the performance of svm slightly decreased when the predicted time increased from one month to three months at some of the stations for example nearly 80 and 40 of the stations have an r value greater than 0 5 and 0 75 respectively fig 4 as the prediction time increased from one to three months the number of stations r greater than 0 5 reduces in addition the number of stations with r greater than 0 75 decreased significantly with the increase in prediction time a similar pattern was observed based on the ratio factor derived from nse fig 5 mae fig 6 and rmse fig 7 which further demonstrates the deterioration of svms for predicting cgwls at longer lead time the association between t2m gwa with cgwls plays a vital role in determining the performance of svm in the subsequent one month out of the 46 stations there are about 27 stations with a stronger association between cgwl with t2m r t 2 m 0 3 while 30 stations have a significant association with gwa r gwa 0 3 and about 18 stations have both significant associations with t2m and gwa r t 2 m 0 3 and r gwa 0 3 table 2 all the 18 stations with both significant association with t2m and gwa r t 2 m 0 3 and r gwa 0 3 performed well based on the gof statistics at subsequent one month lead time table 2 such findings demonstrated that the svm model is efficient for forecasting cgwls at subsequent monthly scale with limited climate variables as forcing data additionally the performance of the svm may be influenced by the local climate variables such as t2m however the performance at subsequent two to three months is slightly decreased compared to one month lead time in case 1 scenario case 2 scenario examines the addition of gwa as input variables for predicting cgwls at subsequent one to three month time scales the nic metrics are adopted to evaluate the efficiency of svm with gwa as additional input it is observed that case 2 compares well with case 1 at most of the selected stations demonstrated by the positive nic values for r fig 4 nse fig 5 mae fig 6 and rmse fig 7 only a few stations did not show further improvement by addition of grace data sets it is found that by including gwa grace informed data as additional predictors the performance of the svms increased for most of the stations fig 2 consistent with case 1 scenario the performance of svm with the addition of gwa as input is better at the subsequent one month lead time which decreased as the predicted time increased from one month to three month case 3 scenario is based on an integrated svm da model with the same input variables in case 2 the svm is updated with the dual enkf da technique at future time steps when the observed cgwls are available there are two updated outputs in the svm da processes the 1st update yd and the 2nd update yu the svm da technique dramatically improves the performance of svms for the prediction of cgwls based on the gofs and nic results at both updated processes fig 4 to fig 7 and table 2 the number of stations with improved predictions i e positive nics increased in the case 3 scenario at both the 1st and 2nd updated processes the performance of svm da slightly decreased at a few stations with the predicted time increased from a subsequent one month to three months overall most of the stations witnessed a significant positive r for the prediction of cgwls at the 1st and 2nd update while above 70 of stations also have a corresponding good gof of mae table 2 these findings demonstrated the advantages of svm da for predicting cgwls at subsequent one month and the dual da process is slightly more efficient than the one step da updated process the svm da models demonstrated better performance at subsequent two to three months lead times than the case 1 or case 2 scenario developed based on only svms 6 1 analysis of representative stations we selected six representative groundwater well stations representing both the good and poor performance of svm and svm da models these six stations are marked in fig 1 with a solid blue circle and related information is presented in table 3 the first three stations s1 to s3 present good performance while the following three stations s4 to s6 show poor performance according to the gofs the correlation coefficients for the good stations s1 to s3 between cgwls and the temperature related variables t2m sr gt is positive and significant r greater than 0 5 at current and lagged 1 to 2 months in contrast the correlation is comparatively weak for the poor stations s4 to s6 and negative at current and lagged months fig 8 and table s2 however the correlation coefficient between other input variables p twsa gwa and the corresponding cgwls varies among the selected six stations most stations present weak signals at current and lagged up to three months though the magnitude is marginally higher at the lagged 1 to 2 months for p and gwa the time series of cgwls and climate variables at most selected stations witnesses annual and seasonal trends fig 9 by comparison the trend of cgwls p and gwa is not strong while the temperature related variables i e t2m sr gt present a stronger seasonal and annual trend in general the trend of temperature related variables witnesses 1 to 3 months lagged time with the cgwls while the twsa presents opposite trend with cgwls illustrating the different association between cgwls and climate variables at different time scales the gofs between the predicted and observed cgwls at 1 to 3 months are provided in fig 10 and table s3 for the prediction of cgwls in subsequent one month the svm performs better at stations s1 to s3 than at stations s4 to s6 according to the four metrics r mae rmse and nse the addition of gwa in case 2 scenario improves the performance of svm at most selected stations according to the four metrics in case 3 scenario the svm da model dramatically improves the performance of svm solely at selected stations especially at the stations s4 to s6 similar findings can be observed for the predictions of cgwls at subsequent two to three month consistent with the gofs the time series of predicted cgwls at the subsequent 1 to 3 months coincide well with the observed cgwls at stations s1 to s3 in case 1 and case 2 scenarios using the svm model figs 11 13 as the lead time increased the performance of svm case 1 and case 2 scenario slightly degraded at the 3 month lead time the svm da model in case 3 scenario dramatically improves the performance of svm by assimilating observed cgwls with da technique especially at stations s4 to s6 where svm models did not perform well the performance based on the dual enkf is comparatively better at the 2nd updated process than the 1st updated process the scatter plots further demonstrate such statements figs s3 to s5 by comparison among the six selected stations the performance of svm in case 1 and case 2 at stations s4 to s6 is comparatively weaker at stations s1 to s3 according to the higher bias and poor gof metrics the higher bias at stations s4 to s6 can be associated with the abnormal trend of cgwls which cannot be captured by the svm using the limited input variables in addition the lower correlation strength between the cgwls and the input variables is found at stations s4 to s6 further illustrating such poor performance however the dual svm da model used in case 3 dramatically improves the performance of svm in the poor stations s4 to s6 as analyzed above the svm or svm da model can adequately predict the cgwls up to a 3 month lead time by using limited climate variables as input at most stations the performance of svm can be influenced by the local climate variables especially by the temperature related variables the addition of gwa as an input variable slightly improves the performance of svm the svm da model may overcome such a barrier by assimilating the observed cgwls at random times which is much more efficient to predict the cgwls at 1 to 3 month lead time 7 discussion the dynamics of groundwater resources are more complex than that of surface water besides groundwater monitoring networks are limited compared to surface water scanlon et al 2012 modeling groundwater level changes is particularly challenging because multiscale interactions between climate catchment and aquifer exhibit spatial heterogeneity besides the anthropogenic activities e g excessive groundwater use recharge rates affected by the land use change and climate extremes e g droughts induce non stationary behavior in groundwater levels the grace data can further improve groundwater management sustainability in semiarid regions mcguire et al 2012 a large amount of data is needed to develop physically based models to predict groundwater levels these data can be costly and difficult to obtain particularly in developing countries besides the uncertainties associated with meteorological geological hydrological and climatic data can increase the complexity of numerical model calibration and validation barzegar et al 2017 as a result despite capturing the physical processes successfully the numerical models produce unsatisfactory results sun et al 2016 several machine learning algorithms are recently used to monitor groundwater levels nourani et al 2015 sahoo et al 2017 panahi et al 2020 sharafati et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 the machine learning based algorithms can detect patterns and adapt to non linear dynamic behavior in a complex groundwater system these studies applied individual models such as genetic algorithm ga artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm each model has its strengths and weaknesses therefore the hybrid models can integrate individual models advantages to improve the model performance the integration of the data assimilation concept with svm can enhance the prediction of groundwater monitoring in complex geographic environments the performance of models seems to vary with a combination of climate and geophysical systems the machine learning ml methods are very useful in dynamic environments where the climate and human water demands vary with seasons future studies can implement human water demand as additional inputs to evaluate the performance of ml algorithms to predict groundwater changes in more heterogeneous environments the recent development in the new generation of deep learning dl methods can be very useful to model the complex aquifer systems to capture dynamics of groundwater changes in different landscapes due to the non linear association between climate and catchment variables appropriate interpretation frameworks konapala and mishra 2020b can provide more meaningful information and quantify the individual role of variables in groundwater related studies 8 conclusion in this study we investigated the performance of svms by incorporating a data assimilation framework to predict changes in groundwater levels at one to three month lead times this study further evaluated the performance of grace data as an additional variable to predict the in situ changes in groundwater levels the performance of grace data was assessed at 46 in situ well locations in northeast usa it was observed that svm and svm da models can adequately predict the change in groundwater levels up to 3 month lead time at most of the selected stations based on the limited climate variables i e precipitation air temperature solar radiation infrared surface temperature and the grace informed groundwater anomalies gwa at precedent lagged one to two month as input most importantly the addition of grace information gwa as additional input variables further improved the performance of svms simultaneously the svm da model greatly enhanced the performance of the individual svm model at most of the stations however the performance of svm and svm da models decreases as the lead time increased from subsequent one month to three months the performance of svm model can be influenced by the local climate variables especially by the temperature related variables the svm da model can overcome such a barrier by assimilating the observed cgwls at random times to update the model parameters and state which is much more efficient to predict the cgwls at 1 to 3 month lead time the modeling framework can be helpful for the stakeholders to predict the local groundwater resources ahead of time so that appropriate management

4175,groundwater gw is a vital resource for human consumption agriculture environmental sustainability and socio economic development in different parts of the world besides gw plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events however there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature therefore it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management especially during drought events in this study we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines svms combined with data assimilation da technique to predict the change in groundwater levels cgwls at 1 to 3 month time scales for 46 gw wells located at the northeast united states the in situ climate variables and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission informed groundwater anomalies data gwa are used to develop the models the results suggest that svms svm da models forced with limited climate variables i e precipitation solar radiation air temperature infrared surface temperature can forecast the cgwls up to 3 month lead times at most of the locations the addition of grace data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of svms at most of the stations where a strong relationship exists between the cgwls and the gwa the svm da model comparatively performed better than svms at most of the stations keywords groundwater support vector machine grace data assimilation 1 introduction groundwater constitutes one of the most significant freshwater resources shiklomanov and rodda 2003 it plays a vital role in the hydrologic cycle taylor et al 2013 and supplies water for human consumption and agriculture production in different parts of the world due to population growth and climate extremes freshwater aquifers are increasingly stressed especially in the arid and semiarid regions relying exclusively on groundwater sun 2013 the pace of groundwater depletion has doubled during the last several decades with increased water demand konikow 2011 wada et al 2011 wada et al 2012 quantifying groundwater resources spatial and temporal variability and developing appropriate models to predict groundwater availability over short to long term periods are essential to water resource management during drought events mishra and singh 2010 the groundwater accounts for 20 of the total water withdrawal in the usa which provides more than 90 of the water used for the rural domestic supplies barber 2009 this highlights the potential role of groundwater resources for socio economic development in the united states groundwater level forecasting is a valuable tool to support the sustainable management of water resources data driven stochastic models are suitable for short term forecasting due to their simplicity in model development and implementation over the past decades the data driven techniques such as neural network models adamowski and chan 2011 sun 2013 dudley et al 2017 guzman et al 2017 amaranto et al 2018 zanotti et al 2019 sun et al 2019 jeong

mt rezaie balf et al 2017 and support vector machines khan and coulibaly 2006 yoon et al 2011 wei et al 2020 are widely used the complexity of the data driven models is less in terms of calibration parameter estimation and handling the different sources of uncertainties than the physically based models burrows and doherty 2016 gianni et al 2019 besides these models do not require information on the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer adamowski and chan 2011 zanotti et al 2019 the machine learning tools are also widely used in different types of groundwater assessment such as groundwater potential prediction chen et al 2021 mosavi et al 2021a salinity susceptibility mapping mosavi et al 2020 mosavi et al 2021b groundwater fluctuation prediction choubin and malekian 2017

security he et al 2020 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b and drought assessment mishra et al 2015 recently the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 enables satellite based monitoring of global water storage which provides the scientific community an unprecedented insight into terrestrial water storage tws variations around the world rodell et al 2018 the grace data has been commonly used to monitor groundwater storage variations rodell and famiglietti 2001 rodell et al 2007 long et al 2013 jing et al 2020b yin et al 2020 however these changes are monitored at a high coarser resolution it fails to provide groundwater storage change estimates at local regional scales at which most groundwater management schemes are applied castellazzi et al 2016 a limited number of studies evaluated the performance of coarse resolution grace data to predict in situ groundwater levels using machine learning models sun 2013 our study will complement the previous studies e g sun 2013 by further improving our understanding of the performance of grace data to predict in situ groundwater levels using machine learning based models the major difference between sun 2013 and our study are a higher number 46 nos of in situ groundwater wells located in different heterogenous are selected compared to a limited number 10 nos of stations b we implemented support vector machine svm and ensemble kalman filtering enkf to construct the svm data assimilation svm da model compared to the ann model in the previous study and c the performance of recent grace product rl 06 0 5 degree resolution was evaluated compared to the release 5 of grace level 2 product available at 1 degree resolution the prior results are not conclusive as the grace data s potential is not adequately explored for monitoring the in situ groundwater information in different heterogeneous aquifer conditions therefore it is important to investigate grace data s value for simulating in situ local scale groundwater changes with respect to the local climate variables which is the key motivation of this study although the performance of data assimilation techniques is investigated for different hydrologic applications they are yet to be investigated in groundwater level predictions especially by incorporating the grace data sets the overall objective of this study is to forecast the change in groundwater levels cgwls for the selected wells located in the northeast usa at 1 to 3 month lead times using the svms and the enkf da technique the key research questions that are addressed in this study are 1 to investigate the efficiency of svms for the prediction of cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales forced with limited climate variables 2 to assess the improvement of svms for the prediction of cgwls with grace as additional forcing variable and 3 to evaluate the performance of coupled svm da model for the prediction of cgwls at 1 to 3 month time scales the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of the study area which is followed by the data description highlighting in situ and grace data sets in section 3 the methodology section is described in section 4 and the implementation of the proposed methods is discussed in section 5 the results are provided in section 6 and followed by a discussion in section 7 finally the conclusions are provided in section 8 2 study area northeast us is one of the wettest parts of the us receiving 700 to 1600 mm of precipitation per year however due to population growth and increasing use of surface and groundwater resources the water stress gets aggravated during drought conditions averyt et al 2013 there is a 3 to 10 km3 depletion of unconsolidated and semi consolidated sand and gravel aquifers in the eastern coast between 1900 and 2008 usgs 2013 overuse of surface water reduces the recharge leading to groundwater depletion in addition land use has gone through significant change over the past several decades in the northeastern us the water supply in the northeast is mainly derived from surface waters which are heavily regulated to meet the water supply demand of urbanized areas such as new york city due to the expanding urbanized areas and high levels of impervious ground the infiltration has decreased over time leading to a decrease in groundwater recharge and low flow volumes usgs 2013 in addition to rapid land use change the recent increase in climate variability can affect local groundwater levels overall 46 well stations fig 1 located in the northeast united states are selected in this study these stations are mostly located within the new england and mid atlantic hydrologic units with mixed forest and deciduous forest fig s1 table s1 3 data description 3 1 in situ data the groundwater level data used in this study are collected from the usgs national water information system https waterdata usgs gov nwis gw for the northeast united states the data sets are collected at a daily time scale between 1st january 2007 to 31st december 2016 for 46 wells located in the northeast united states the data sets with missing values are not included in the analysis the observed in situ climate variables including air temperature t2m solar radiation sr precipitation p and the infrared surface temperature gt at a daily time scale for the same period is obtained from the united states climate reference network uscrn stations https www ncdc noaa gov crn qcdatasets html the in situ meteorological stations are selected such that they are located within a 1 degree resolution of the groundwater wells therefore each well site is represented by at least one in situ meteorological station within a 1 degree resolution with continuous daily climate variables i e t2m p sr and gt the observed meteorological data and the groundwater level data available daily are averaged to represent a monthly time scale the high pass hodrick prescott filter hp filter method sun 2013 is applied to generate the monthly cgwls time series by removing the long term trends from the aggregated monthly groundwater level data series 3 2 grace data terrestrial water storage tws can be defined as the summation of different forms of water on the land surface and in the subsurface famiglietti 2004 girotto and rodell 2019 in this study we selected the recently released monthly grace product rl 06 january 2007 to december 2016 available at 0 5 degree resolution obtained from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov the tws products in this version are obtained by using the mass concentration blocks mascons techniques the available dataset is derived based on the anomalies relative to january 2004 december 2009 as the baseline period therefore the tws datasets from grace are referred to as terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa as grace has no vertical resolution hydrological models built on physical processes can approximately provide groundwater storage changes by subtracting twsa derived from grace and vertical level changes associated with water storage at the canopy snow and soil moisture global land data assimilation system gldas models forced by global meteorological forcing data sheffield et al 2006 provide optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 gldas provides important information on major components of tws the noah lsm from nasa s global land data assimilation system was extensively used in previous grace studies long et al 2014 long et al 2017 jing et al 2020a sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020 noah lsm output from current gldas version 2 1 available from nasa s earthdata site http earthdata nasa gov was used in this study noah simulated terrestrial water storage twsnoah was calculated by integrating soil moisture in all four soil layers sml1 0 10 cm sml2 10 40 cm sml3 40 100 cm and sml4 100 200 cm accumulative snow water snw and total canopy water storage cws twsnoah is calculated using the following equation 7 tw s noah s m l 1 s m l 2 s m l 3 s m l 4 s n w c w s to be consistent with grace twsa twsagrace the long term mean during january 2004

anomalies gwa gwa can be calculated with equation 8 8 gwa t w s a grace t w s a noah here gwa is incorporated as an additional forcing variable in svm and svm da predictive models for the prediction of cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales 4 methodology 4 1 support vector machine the support vector machine svm has been widely used in many disciplines to model and control complex engineering systems su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020b panahi et al 2020 in the hydro meteorological disciplines svms were greatly used for the multi layer soil moisture estimation liu et al 2010 yu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 flood stage forecasting chen et al 2010 prediction of lake water levels at 3 12 month scale khan and coulibaly 2006 long term drought forecast belayneh and adamowski 2012 belayneh et al 2014 liu et al 2017 groundwater levels forecast yoon et al 2011 and reservoir operation zhang et al 2018 in this study the nonlinear regression svms are used to predict the changes in groundwater level at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales the algorithm of svm maps the input space in a high dimensional feature space utilizing kernels vapnik 1995 a functional dependency f x between independent variables x 1 x 2 x m taken from x r m and dependent output y 1 y 2 y n with y r taken from a set n of independent and identify distributed observations is set through the following regularized function vapnik 1998 1 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b ε ξ i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 2 f x j 1 m w j x j b w r m b r where m is the number of the support vectors b is the bias w represents the vector weights for inputs to the output c is the penalty parameter that determines the tradeoff between the complexity of the function f x and the tolerance for error in the prediction ε is a constant called the tube size that represents the optimization performance ξ i and ξ i are slack variables that determine the degree to which input samples with error greater than ε would be panelized vapnik 1998 wang et al 2012 su et al 2018 accordingly the dual convex optimization problem shown in equation 1 can be solved using the lagrangian function as in equation 3 3 l w b ξ i ξ i α i α i η i η i 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i i 1 n α i ε ξ i y i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b i 1 n α i ε ξ i y i j 1 m i 1 n w j x ji b i 1 n η i ξ i η i ξ i where η i η i α i and α i are the lagrangian multipliers which satisfy the nonnegative constraint the lagrangian function l maximizes η i η i α i α i and minimizes w b ξ i and ξ i according to the kkt karush kuhn tucker condition su et al 2018 the optimization problem can be equivalently solved in its dual form as equation 4 4 max α i α i 1 2 j 1 n i 1 n α i α i α j α j k x i x j i 1 n α i α i y i i 1 n α i α i ε s t w i n α i α i x i 0 α i α i c i 1 n therefore the regression function of svm can be obtained as equation 5 5 f x i 1 n α i α i k x x j b where k x x j is the kernel function when svm is used to solve the nonlinear regression problem the nonlinear problem is mapped to a high dimensional space and the linear function is constructed in this space by selecting an appropriate kernel function the regression f x relies only on the kernel function k x x j generally the kernel function needs to meet the mercy s condition and can describe the distribution characteristics of training data in practice the radial kernel function rbf kernel shown in equation 6 is applied in nonlinear regression analysis due to its improved performance as highlighted in previous studies su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020a 6 k x x i exp γ x x i 2 besides selecting kernel function the svm regression model also requires a suitable kernel parameter γ penalty parameter c and the insensitive parameter ε in this study the rbf kernel function is selected while the trial and error method is adopted to identify these appropriate parameters γ c and ε similar to the previous studies gill and mckee 2007 liu et al 2010 yu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020a 4 2 data assimilation data assimilation da concept is a promising technique to optimally estimate hydrological variables by merging observed information or remote sensing data into models moradkhani et al 2005 montzka et al 2011 liu et al 2016 liu and mishra 2017 liu et al 2017 ensemble kalman filter enkf is a popular da technique and it has been widely used in hydrology related studies moradkhani et al 2005 li et al 2012 yin et al 2015 liu et al 2016 liu and mishra 2017 liu et al 2017 li et al 2020b enkf is a monte carlo approximation of a sequential bayesian filtering process which alternates between an ensemble forecast step and a state variable update step reichle et al 2002 the dual enkf technique is adopted in this paper which consists two steps generating an ensemble of model outputs and updating it when new observations become available 5 implementation of proposed methods 5 1 variable selection a preliminary analysis is performed based on the correlation analysis to identify input variables for the two selected models svm and svm da the climate variables i e p sr t2m gt and the grace informed groundwater anomalies gwa at different lag times 1 to 3 months are used as predictors while the in situ cgwls are used as predictand the correlation coefficient methods are widely used to select input variables in different machine learning applications sun 2013 liu et al 2016 sun et al 2019 irrgang et al 2020 it was observed that the correlation strength between the cgwls and the selected climate variables varies with changes in the landscape and climate patterns fig 2 the strength of individual climate variables with cgwls varies at different in situ well stations generally the correlation coefficient between the cgwls with the temperature related variables i e t2m gt sr is positive and significant at most of the well locations the correlation coefficient with the grace twsa is dominated negatively at most stations with a magnitude below 0 5 however the correlation coefficient with gwa is primarily positive at most locations especially at the stations with a high negative association with grace twsa in contrast a weak negative correlation was observed with respect to the precipitation the association between cgwls and the temperature related variables i e t2m gt sr is comparatively higher at the lagged 1 to 3 months compared to the current month this highlights that the temperature related variables at previous lagged 1 to 3 months are likely to influence in situ cgwls significantly the higher correlation was observed at two months lagged time scale between selected variables unlike the temperature related variables the association between cgwls and precipitation at the lagged one month was higher than other lagged values meanwhile the association with gwa at the lagged one month seems slightly stronger at most well stations besides a higher autocorrelation coefficient greater than 0 5 is observed at the lagged one month but then tends to decrease with the increase in lagged time fig s2 the autocorrelation coefficient of the cgwls is lower than 0 5 and 0 3 at the lagged two and three months at most of the stations based on the above analysis t2m p sr gt and gwa are selected as the potential input variables in the svms 5 2 implementation of svm and svm da models in this study two models svm and svm da are implemented to predict the cgwls at 1 to 3 month time scales the flowchart of the svm and svm da model is provided in fig 3 the variables selected in the previous step section 5 1 are used as input in the svm model development we evaluated three cases to predict the cgwls at subsequent one to three month time scales using air temperature t2m solar radiation sr precipitation p the infrared surface temperature gt and the grace informed groundwater anomalies gwa at previous lagged 1 to 2 months as the input predictor variables case 1 is designed to evaluate the potential of svm for the prediction of cgwl using limited climate variables p t sr t t2m t t 1 gt t t 1 as input ensemble in svm case 2 is designed to investigate the potential of grace informed data to predict in situ cgwls therefore grace information i e gwa is included as an additional predictor in addition to the climate variables used in case 1 the predictors for the case 2 include gwa t p t sr t t2m t t 1 and gt t t 1 in the svm model case 3 is designed to investigate the efficiency of the data assimilation technique for improving svm da for the prediction of cgwl using the same independent variables input as in case 2 for the prediction of cgwl at the subsequent two t 2 and three t 3 month lead times the predicted cgwl at subsequent one two month lead times is included as additional input in each case for example the predicted cgwls at one month lead time will be used as an additional input in the model to predict cgwls at a two month lead time the initial 5 year 60 months data are used to train the svm models while the following 5 year data used for prediction the details of input and output variables for three cases implemented in this study are provided in table 1 besides selecting the kernel parameter γ penalty parameter c and the insensitive parameter ε the uncorrelated variable selection is one of the core steps during the model development process vapnik 2013 the model performance may be influenced e g overfitting issues if the multiple correlated variables are included in the analysis in this study the rbf kernel function is selected and a trial and error method is adopted to identify these appropriate parameters γ c and ε similar to the previous studies liu et al 2016 su et al 2018 al fugara et al 2020a as stated in previous literature liu et al 2016 the performance of svm may be influenced by the input variables cost function kernel parameter and regularization parameter the cross validation error function with mse seen as penalty parameter c value set to 5 insensitive parameter ε in this study the parameters in each case are listed in table 1 in the svm da model as the observed data is available at the forecasted time step t m m 1 2 n the dual enkf technique is applied to update the process to improve the svm prediction based on the dual enkf samuel et al 2014 liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 there are two separate state space representations for the state and the parameters through two interactive filters by updating model parameters and model states for the svm da in this study the model parameters are first updated and then the states the simulations from each step are considered separately therefore the svm da model includes two outputs one is from model parameters updated which is presented as yd then the observed cgwls are used to update the yd with the enkf technique to get the updated prediction yu which is the state update prediction the procedure of svm da is presented in fig 3 in the enkf da process the input variables e g t2m p sr gt error is assumed to be gaussian distribution with 1 of the mean of each input variable during the initial training ensemble the observed error and modeled error of cgwls are assumed to be gaussian distribution with a 1 variance of observed cgwls in the initial training ensemble the enkf technique can reach its maximum efficiency when updating ensemble size approaches around 15 liu et al 2016 therefore the updated ensemble size is set to be the same size as the training ensemble 5 3 evaluation criteria a number of metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models and each metric can capture the individual strength of the predictive models maier et al 2010 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 li et al 2020a we selected four goodness of fit gof statistics such as correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse to evaluate the performance of the proposed svm and svm da models these metrics are extensively used to test the model performances for hydrological estimation or prediction brocca et al 2011 yu et al 2012 shoaib et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 r is broadly used to evaluate the linear relationship between observed and simulated variables mae is used to measure the absolute residual while rmse is to calculate the standard deviation of the residuals nse determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance the formulation for each metric is shown in equation 9 to equation 12 as follows 9 r i 1 n y i y y i y i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 10 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 11 mae i 1 n y i y i n 12 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n where y i is the observed and y i is the predicted cgwls at the i th time step generally the better models are represented by the smaller magnitude of the rmse and mae combined with larger r and the nse magnitude according to previous studies liu et al 2016 2017 sun et al 2019 zanotti et al 2019 besides the normalized information contribution nic used in liu et al 2017 yan et al 2017 getirana et al 2020 is selected to evaluate the efficiency of the addition of gwa for the cgwls predictions at 1 to 3 month time scales the calculation procedure for nic of each metric is

from the open loop while gofup means the gof derived from the updated experiment which belongs to case 2 to case 3 in this study the nic metric range from to 1 if nic 0 it indicates that the updated case improves the predictions compared to the control run case 1 if nic 0 the updated case does not add any skill if nic 0 the updated case performed poorly compared to the control run and if nic 1 the updated case achieve the maximum skill liu et al 2017 getirana et al 2020 6 results the performance for the prediction of cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month time scales based on svm and svm da models are evaluated using multiple statistical metrics at selected stations figs 4 5 it was observed that the svm and svm da models performed reasonably well for the predictions of cgwls up to 3 month time scales at most of the selected stations according to the gof criteria the addition of grace information gwa as input variable slightly improved the performance of svm at some of the stations simultaneously the combination of svm da model greatly enhanced the performance of the individual svm model at most of the stations according to the positive nic values of r fig 4 nse fig 5 mae fig 6 and rmse fig 7 moreover svm or svm da performs better at the stations with the higher association between input variables i e t2m gwa and the cgwls fig 2 however the performance of svm and svm da models slightly decreased as the lead time increased from subsequent 1 to 3 month at some of the stations specifically in case 1 scenario the predicted cgwls at subsequent 1 to 3 month lead times compare well with the observed cgwls at most selected groundwater well stations most of these stations present a high magnitude of r greater than 0 5 fig 4 and nse above 0 fig 5 combined with a low magnitude of mae lower than 1 fig 6 and rmse lower than 1 fig 7 the performance of svm slightly decreased when the predicted time increased from one month to three months at some of the stations for example nearly 80 and 40 of the stations have an r value greater than 0 5 and 0 75 respectively fig 4 as the prediction time increased from one to three months the number of stations r greater than 0 5 reduces in addition the number of stations with r greater than 0 75 decreased significantly with the increase in prediction time a similar pattern was observed based on the ratio factor derived from nse fig 5 mae fig 6 and rmse fig 7 which further demonstrates the deterioration of svms for predicting cgwls at longer lead time the association between t2m gwa with cgwls plays a vital role in determining the performance of svm in the subsequent one month out of the 46 stations there are about 27 stations with a stronger association between cgwl with t2m r t 2 m 0 3 while 30 stations have a significant association with gwa r gwa 0 3 and about 18 stations have both significant associations with t2m and gwa r t 2 m 0 3 and r gwa 0 3 table 2 all the 18 stations with both significant association with t2m and gwa r t 2 m 0 3 and r gwa 0 3 performed well based on the gof statistics at subsequent one month lead time table 2 such findings demonstrated that the svm model is efficient for forecasting cgwls at subsequent monthly scale with limited climate variables as forcing data additionally the performance of the svm may be influenced by the local climate variables such as t2m however the performance at subsequent two to three months is slightly decreased compared to one month lead time in case 1 scenario case 2 scenario examines the addition of gwa as input variables for predicting cgwls at subsequent one to three month time scales the nic metrics are adopted to evaluate the efficiency of svm with gwa as additional input it is observed that case 2 compares well with case 1 at most of the selected stations demonstrated by the positive nic values for r fig 4 nse fig 5 mae fig 6 and rmse fig 7 only a few stations did not show further improvement by addition of grace data sets it is found that by including gwa grace informed data as additional predictors the performance of the svms increased for most of the stations fig 2 consistent with case 1 scenario the performance of svm with the addition of gwa as input is better at the subsequent one month lead time which decreased as the predicted time increased from one month to three month case 3 scenario is based on an integrated svm da model with the same input variables in case 2 the svm is updated with the dual enkf da technique at future time steps when the observed cgwls are available there are two updated outputs in the svm da processes the 1st update yd and the 2nd update yu the svm da technique dramatically improves the performance of svms for the prediction of cgwls based on the gofs and nic results at both updated processes fig 4 to fig 7 and table 2 the number of stations with improved predictions i e positive nics increased in the case 3 scenario at both the 1st and 2nd updated processes the performance of svm da slightly decreased at a few stations with the predicted time increased from a subsequent one month to three months overall most of the stations witnessed a significant positive r for the prediction of cgwls at the 1st and 2nd update while above 70 of stations also have a corresponding good gof of mae table 2 these findings demonstrated the advantages of svm da for predicting cgwls at subsequent one month and the dual da process is slightly more efficient than the one step da updated process the svm da models demonstrated better performance at subsequent two to three months lead times than the case 1 or case 2 scenario developed based on only svms 6 1 analysis of representative stations we selected six representative groundwater well stations representing both the good and poor performance of svm and svm da models these six stations are marked in fig 1 with a solid blue circle and related information is presented in table 3 the first three stations s1 to s3 present good performance while the following three stations s4 to s6 show poor performance according to the gofs the correlation coefficients for the good stations s1 to s3 between cgwls and the temperature related variables t2m sr gt is positive and significant r greater than 0 5 at current and lagged 1 to 2 months in contrast the correlation is comparatively weak for the poor stations s4 to s6 and negative at current and lagged months fig 8 and table s2 however the correlation coefficient between other input variables p twsa gwa and the corresponding cgwls varies among the selected six stations most stations present weak signals at current and lagged up to three months though the magnitude is marginally higher at the lagged 1 to 2 months for p and gwa the time series of cgwls and climate variables at most selected stations witnesses annual and seasonal trends fig 9 by comparison the trend of cgwls p and gwa is not strong while the temperature related variables i e t2m sr gt present a stronger seasonal and annual trend in general the trend of temperature related variables witnesses 1 to 3 months lagged time with the cgwls while the twsa presents opposite trend with cgwls illustrating the different association between cgwls and climate variables at different time scales the gofs between the predicted and observed cgwls at 1 to 3 months are provided in fig 10 and table s3 for the prediction of cgwls in subsequent one month the svm performs better at stations s1 to s3 than at stations s4 to s6 according to the four metrics r mae rmse and nse the addition of gwa in case 2 scenario improves the performance of svm at most selected stations according to the four metrics in case 3 scenario the svm da model dramatically improves the performance of svm solely at selected stations especially at the stations s4 to s6 similar findings can be observed for the predictions of cgwls at subsequent two to three month consistent with the gofs the time series of predicted cgwls at the subsequent 1 to 3 months coincide well with the observed cgwls at stations s1 to s3 in case 1 and case 2 scenarios using the svm model figs 11 13 as the lead time increased the performance of svm case 1 and case 2 scenario slightly degraded at the 3 month lead time the svm da model in case 3 scenario dramatically improves the performance of svm by assimilating observed cgwls with da technique especially at stations s4 to s6 where svm models did not perform well the performance based on the dual enkf is comparatively better at the 2nd updated process than the 1st updated process the scatter plots further demonstrate such statements figs s3 to s5 by comparison among the six selected stations the performance of svm in case 1 and case 2 at stations s4 to s6 is comparatively weaker at stations s1 to s3 according to the higher bias and poor gof metrics the higher bias at stations s4 to s6 can be associated with the abnormal trend of cgwls which cannot be captured by the svm using the limited input variables in addition the lower correlation strength between the cgwls and the input variables is found at stations s4 to s6 further illustrating such poor performance however the dual svm da model used in case 3 dramatically improves the performance of svm in the poor stations s4 to s6 as analyzed above the svm or svm da model can adequately predict the cgwls up to a 3 month lead time by using limited climate variables as input at most stations the performance of svm can be influenced by the local climate variables especially by the temperature related variables the addition of gwa as an input variable slightly improves the performance of svm the svm da model may overcome such a barrier by assimilating the observed cgwls at random times which is much more efficient to predict the cgwls at 1 to 3 month lead time 7 discussion the dynamics of groundwater resources are more complex than that of surface water besides groundwater monitoring networks are limited compared to surface water scanlon et al 2012 modeling groundwater level changes is particularly challenging because multiscale interactions between climate catchment and aquifer exhibit spatial heterogeneity besides the anthropogenic activities e g excessive groundwater use recharge rates affected by the land use change and climate extremes e g droughts induce non stationary behavior in groundwater levels the grace data can further improve groundwater management sustainability in semiarid regions mcguire et al 2012 a large amount of data is needed to develop physically based models to predict groundwater levels these data can be costly and difficult to obtain particularly in developing countries besides the uncertainties associated with meteorological geological hydrological and climatic data can increase the complexity of numerical model calibration and validation barzegar et al 2017 as a result despite capturing the physical processes successfully the numerical models produce unsatisfactory results sun et al 2016 several machine learning algorithms are recently used to monitor groundwater levels nourani et al 2015 sahoo et al 2017 panahi et al 2020 sharafati et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 the machine learning based algorithms can detect patterns and adapt to non linear dynamic behavior in a complex groundwater system these studies applied individual models such as genetic algorithm ga artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm each model has its strengths and weaknesses therefore the hybrid models can integrate individual models advantages to improve the model performance the integration of the data assimilation concept with svm can enhance the prediction of groundwater monitoring in complex geographic environments the performance of models seems to vary with a combination of climate and geophysical systems the machine learning ml methods are very useful in dynamic environments where the climate and human water demands vary with seasons future studies can implement human water demand as additional inputs to evaluate the performance of ml algorithms to predict groundwater changes in more heterogeneous environments the recent development in the new generation of deep learning dl methods can be very useful to model the complex aquifer systems to capture dynamics of groundwater changes in different landscapes due to the non linear association between climate and catchment variables appropriate interpretation frameworks konapala and mishra 2020b can provide more meaningful information and quantify the individual role of variables in groundwater related studies 8 conclusion in this study we investigated the performance of svms by incorporating a data assimilation framework to predict changes in groundwater levels at one to three month lead times this study further evaluated the performance of grace data as an additional variable to predict the in situ changes in groundwater levels the performance of grace data was assessed at 46 in situ well locations in northeast usa it was observed that svm and svm da models can adequately predict the change in groundwater levels up to 3 month lead time at most of the selected stations based on the limited climate variables i e precipitation air temperature solar radiation infrared surface temperature and the grace informed groundwater anomalies gwa at precedent lagged one to two month as input most importantly the addition of grace information gwa as additional input variables further improved the performance of svms simultaneously the svm da model greatly enhanced the performance of the individual svm model at most of the stations however the performance of svm and svm da models decreases as the lead time increased from subsequent one month to three months the performance of svm model can be influenced by the local climate variables especially by the temperature related variables the svm da model can overcome such a barrier by assimilating the observed cgwls at random times to update the model parameters and state which is much more efficient to predict the cgwls at 1 to 3 month lead time the modeling framework can be helpful for the stakeholders to predict the local groundwater resources ahead of time so that appropriate management

4176,breakthrough curves btcs are known as adequate evidence to characterize karst aquifers which mainly specified by dual flow systems matrix and conduit as well as some degree of connection between dual media conduit flow process version 2 cfpv2 is a discrete conduit continuum model applying which it is possible to simulate such characteristics in this research first cfpv2 was employed to evaluate the effect of several factors including hydraulic conductivity exchange flow tracing distance hydraulic gradient and conduit diameter and roughness on btcs in a synthetic karst aquifer then 253 btcs from 24 dye tracing tests conducted in karstic aquifers of iran were analyzed to evaluate the effect of hydraulic gradient and tracing distance on the btcs with taking into account the effect of medium type matrix or conduit and karst development these tests were conducted under either natural or elevated man made hydraulic gradient conditions the results revealed that peak concentration decreased with enlarging conduit diameter because of considerable flow rate likewise it decreases over longer distances specifically in the elevated man made hydraulic conditions however with increasing hydraulic gradient peak concentration and its timing have upward and downward trends respectively when btcs start to demonstrate tailing and become flattened it could be an indication of low matrix hydraulic conductivity or lower hydraulic gradient in conduit as a result of less exchange flow from the matrix into conduits based on this study a new intermixture of flow and solute transport parameters was engineered to classify karst development high peak concentration short peak time high velocity particularly over long distances and under the natural hydraulic gradient conditions and feasible conduit flow regime whether laminar or turbulent suggested as indication of well developed karstic system keywords tracing test breakthrough curve conduit flow process karst synthetic modeling 1 introduction karst formations cover about 11 of iran s surface area raeisi and kowsar 1997 and about 20 of the world surface ford and williams 2007 karst regions in iran because of hosting major dam sites shabab boroujeni et al 2019 providing drinking water afrasiabian 2007 alem et al 2017 containing mines zarasvandi et al 2008 tourist attraction vardanjani et al 2017 and environmental issues entezari et al 2016 are prime of importance generally karst aquifers consist of conduits and solution fractures which are the main pathways of flow hosted by the matrix which stores the majority of groundwater ford and williams 2007 due to inherent heterogeneity of karst aquifers the pattern and structure of conduits are not usually identified using conventional hydrogeological approaches mohammadi and raeisi 2007 numerous well known methods have been developed for characterizing karst aquifers including geomorphology water balance analysis of spring

equation leap and kaplan 1988 tracing tests are usually performed using solutes e g dye tracer as tracer although electrolytic tracer e g sodium chloride colloid and even a synthetic dna göppert and goldscheider 2008 aquilanti et al 2013 have been used although the early utilization of tracer tests has consisted of the preliminary evaluation of velocity and flow paths multiple tests in a same site recently applied in detailed researches to ascertain the connection of conduits and leakage paths for instance since the results of a tracer test are valid at the injection and sampling points replication of the test by changing the injection point could improve the spatial validity of the results moreover the effects of flow rate and hydraulic gradient on tracer tests have been highlighted mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b worthington 1991 in particular multiple tracing tests data provide detail insight to hydraulic and transport characteristics geyer et al 2007 and patterns of conduit borghi et al 2016 in karst aquifers white and annable 2018 studied tracing tests applied in the upper floridian aquifer over 122 years and concluded that velocity distribution has a wide range and dominant being of conduit flow regime in transport differs among drainage basins based on the results of 14 dye tracing tests under different hydrological boundary conditions from normandy france duran et al 2016 have acquired some equations to explain the relationship between environment parameters and karst responses from unique results obtained by tracer tests undoubtedly the estimation of groundwater velocity because of its impact on contaminant transport and leakage from dam sites is the most important one groundwater velocity in karst aquifers depends on the degree of karst development and the presence of karst features such as sinkholes caves and solution conduits groundwater velocity can be used to determine the flow regime based on a few hydraulic criteria such as reynolds number although the flow regime in karst aquifers was classified by shuster and white 1971 into two end members called diffuse and conduit flow regimes the range of groundwater velocity in these flow regimes has not been suggested generally diffuse and conduit flow occur through the flow paths with diameter less and more than centimeters respectively white 1988 however milanovic 1981 presented a range between 0 002 and 0 5 ms 1 for the conduit flow velocity and worthington et al 2001 suggested 0 022 ms 1 as the global average channel flow moreover based on astm 1998 when flow velocity in a tube is 0 001 ms 1 flow regime is laminar i e slow flow otherwise it is turbulent i e fast flow concentration time curve or breakthrough curve btc is the basis for quantitative analysis of a tracing test assuming an instantaneous point injection the typical shape of the breakthrough curve and the selected parameters of btc such as peak concentration cp m l 3 and peak time tp t are presented in fig 1 simply the average or peak velocity vp lt 1 is estimated using the following equation field 2002 1 v p l s t p where l l is direct distance between the injection point and sampling point s is tortuosity factor a wide range of 1 1 to 3 was suggested for the tortuosity factor in karst aquifers worthington 1991 field 2002 assari and mohammadi 2017 several factors affect the shape of btcs including the mass of injected dye how conservative is the dye spring flowrate hydraulic gradient transport dynamics in rivers jobson 1997 the extent of the recharge areas mull et al 1988 and hydraulic geometry of the karst aquifers field and nash 1997 moreover conduit networks and their characteristics can affect the results of tracing test borghi et al 2016 lauber et al 2014 mobile and immobile fluid regions field and pinsky 2000 göppert and goldscheider 2008 and pools hauns et al 2001 in flow paths can produce the tailing of btcs in the following section the effective factors on btcs configuration are further discussed assuming a typical karst aquifer including conduit and matrix media the transport equation can be formulated in 1 d with the direction identifying the conduit axis as birk 2002 clark 2011 2 c t d l 2 c x 2 v x c x s c where c m l 3 is the solute concentration t t is the time v x lt 1 is groundwater velocity in direction x and d l l 2 t 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient s c m l 3 t 1 is a source term employed here to represent diffusive mass flux between conduit and the matrix the shape of btc i e the left side of eq 2 is regulated by the simultaneous effect of advection dispersion and exchange flow between matrix and conduit media i e the three terms in the right side of eq 2 respectively the first term on the right side of eq 2 presents the effect of dispersion process on the shape of btc even though dispersion can be more effective on solute transport in a porous media aquifer the focus of this research is to highlight the effect of advection processes directly related to groundwater velocity and flow distance on solute transport in karst aquifers because of the higher groundwater velocity dispersion is computed based on taylor approach whether the flow regime is laminar taylor 1953 or turbulent taylor 1954 based on taylor 1953 1954 dispersion depends on the velocity and conduit diameter in cave dye tracing results showed that dispersion spatially varies with flow velocity lauber et al 2014 in another study long flow distances result in higher dispersivity and dispersion hauns et al 2001 in addition the mixing between the host matrix and conduit in longer distances of conduit flow paths is another reason for higher dispersion ronayne 2013 when dispersion varies spatially in conduit it produces the skewness and tailing of btcs li 2011 the second term on the right side of eq 2 denotes the advection and directly depends on groundwater velocity the hagen poiseuille equation is applicable to compute the laminar flow velocity in conduits as shoemaker et al 2008 3 v d 2 32 ρ g μ i where v is the conduit flow velocity lt 1 µ is the water dynamic viscosity ml 1t 1 ρ is the fluid density m l 3 d is the conduit diameter l g l t 2 is acceleration due to gravity and i unitless is hydraulic gradient moreover the darcy weisbach equation was suggested to estimate the conduit flow velocity under turbulent flow regime shoemaker et al 2008 v 2 g d f i where f unitless is the friction factor and computed by colebrook white formula shoemaker et al 2008 5 1 f 2 l o g ε 3 71 d 2 51 r f where r is reynolds number and ε l is mean roughness height of the conduit wall the third term in the right side of eq 2 indicates how the water in the conduits interacts with the matrix wall across the boundary layer it depends on the conduit diameter the difference between the concentration at the matrix surface and the solute concentration in the conduit and a mass transfer coefficient birk 2002 in order to handle groundwater flow through karst aquifers the conduit flow process cfp was utilized that is of discrete conduit continuum dcc models in which the continuum matrix is connected to discrete conduit by an exchange flow term shoemaker et al 2008 the exchange flow is dependent on an exchange coefficient and the head difference between the matrix and conduit it is possible to define the geometry length diameter and height of the conduit networks and also to simulate flow in conduits whether it is pressurized or free surface using cfp cfpv2 has been recently developed based on combination of cfpm1 and eq 2 to compute the spatial and temporal distribution of concentration in a karst aquifer that contains conduit and matrix media reimann et al 2018 and has been successfully applied in karst aquifers kavousi et al 2020 cfpm1 considers conduits flow whether it is laminar or turbulent which should be definitely taken into account in karst aquifers particularly in those with enlarged flow features giese et al 2018 in this investigation cfpv2 was used to show the effect of diameter distance coupling between the matrix and conduit hydraulic gradient and roughness height on the shape of btcs hence cfpv2 not only numerically facilitates to parametrize but also perfectly serves to investigate and overcome some of the limitations of dye tracing methods such as understanding the degree of coupling between the two media and flow state i e laminar and turbulent the shape of btcs is controlled by conduit characteristics such as its diameter length and roughness height the interaction between the matrix and conduit hydraulic gradient and tracing conditions of karst aquifers e g type of injection sampling points and tracing scale in this research a synthetic karst model was developed using cfpv2 to evaluate the role of these effective factors on btcs moreover 253 btcs from 24 dye tracing tests in karst aquifers from different parts of iran were collected then a few available and effective variables e g peak concentration peak time tracing distance hydraulic gradient and velocity were derived the main objectives of this review study are to 1 parametrize the effect of several effective variables such as the diameter length and roughness of conduits matrix hydraulic conductivity exchange flow and hydraulic gradient using synthetic modeling by cfpv2 and 2 evaluate the role of hydraulic gradient and tracing distance as well as media type matrix or conduit using filed data on the result of dye tracing tests i e btcs 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the field data set and their reliability karst features in iran include in a range from small karrens and low flow rate springs as indicators of less advanced karst to high flow rate springs and poljes such as dasht e arjan jamali et al 2015 as indicators of developed karst areas caves such as alisadr and katalekhor vardanjani et al 2017 and sinkholes in some areas like abarhkoh soldo et al 2020 are of other significant features also representing the developed karst in iran to explore better these characteristics of karst systems in iran tracing tests have been employed in iran which are described as follows in order to compare the results of tracing tests under different hydrogeological conditions twenty four tests were collected from different karstic regions of iran fig 2 the general characteristics of the selected dye tracer tests are presented in table s1 the available dye tracer tests table s1 belong to different geographical geological as well as hydrogeological settings moreover these tests are different in terms of type of injection point number and distance of sampling points type and mass of the injected dye and hydraulic gradient a total of 253 btcs from the different type of sampling points e g spring river observation well drainage well and artesian well were collected the distance between sampling and injection points ranges from 10 m to 10 km table s1 the mass of different dye tracer e g uranine eosin and rhodamine wt ranged from 1 to 50 kg the collected dye tracer tests table s1 have been carried out to assess different goals including detection of the possible leakage paths before asadi 1997 fars state water company 1996 bagheri et al 2006 mehr and raeisi 2019 and after behrouj peely et al 2018 gorbani et al 2005 dam construction determination of the general flow direction adinehvand et al 2017 delineation of the catchment area of spring iran karst research center 2002 raeisi et al 1999 specification of the discharge point of a ploje mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b and characterization of karst development and flow regime mohammadi et al 2007a mohammadi et al 2007b kalantari and mohammadi 2011 in particular soltani et al 2008 concluded that local karstification in some measure has occurred at the kowsar dam site which is consistent with some local solution features of the karst formation in another study interpretation of tracer test revealed that conduits networks have not developed at mirzaye shirazi kavar dam site khalaj and rahanjam 2012 the development of karst at shamiran dam site has been reported to be high at some paths but not to be homogeneous based on several peaks in btcs jahani 2000 having assessed flow regimes the results revealed that conduit regime is the dominant flow type based on the estimation of dye tracing velocity in the garin karst region khanlari and moomeni 2012 in another region in the zagros mountains mohammadi et al 2007a b concluded that the flow regime is diffuse and karst is not well developed in an atresian karst aquifer in the khersan3 dam site at bidvaz dam site the dominant flow was concluded to be turbulent flow based on btcs nasseh et al 2013 likewise diffuse flow regime was concluded as the dominant flow type based on low velocity at the doosti dam site mozafari et al 2012 based on low flow velocity and multiple peaks of the btc of a spring karimi and ashjari 2010 suggested a diffuse and siphon flow system for such a behavior the diffuse flow regime was also suggested at the sazbon dam site based on the characteristics of btcs raeisi et al 2005 the interpretation of a dye tracer in combination with the water balance equation revealed a single conduit to carry water out from the ponor of the arjan polje to the domeasb springs only mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b these tests are also conducted to propose the flow model of the lagharak polje considering the kuhrang iii water conveyance tunnel janparvar et al 2015 the reliability of the field data set was evaluated using the procedure employed by zech et al 2015 2019 with adaptations and legitimacy to the objectives of this study we needed to extract cp and tp directly and calculate velocity matrix hydraulic conductivity and conduit diameter using btcs in this perspective of reliability the data were classified into three groups of high reliability r1 moderate reliability r2 and low reliability r3 zech et al 2015 zech et al 2019 the first criterion was that the sampling interval time must be selected somehow that it captured the real peak concentration and its corresponding time the tests with explicit peak concentration were assigned as r1 in addition we selected the tests with conservative tracers and sinkholes as the most reliable set of data r1 the tests in which an observation well was the injection point were categorized as r2 finally the tracing tests in which the btcs did not have a distinct peak concentration with many fluctuations e g most river samples and few well samples were categorized as r3 regarding the flow paths they are detected using the tracing tests results but in the sites with more complexities such as the ones with the grout curtain in dam sites it is most challenging to define the tortuosity coefficient therefore the tests conducted in the dam sites were defined as r2 and the tests carried out under natural condition were assigned as r1 injection site type was another important factor in having assigned reliability in this context the tests with a sinkhole as the injection point were considered in the r1 category and the tests where the injection site was a well were put under the r2 category for the purpose of this research just the tests with r1 and r2 classes were chosen for analysis 2 1 1 hydrogeological overview of the selected tests several limestone formations have the potential for karstification and being as a karst aquifer in iran the majority of the selected tests 18 tests were performed in asmari formation as the main aquifer system moreover 3 1 and 2 tests belong to sarvak lar and tirgan limestone formations respectively surface indications of karst development such as sinkholes and caverns were reported in the asmari limestone there are also some sinkholes of about 100 m in diameter in the upper jurassic limestone of the lar formation in the poshte naz area of the alborz zone kalantari and mohammadi 2011 the flow rate of springs varies from 10 l s from tirgan limestone formation mozafari et al 2012 to 5 m3 s sarkur spring mohammadi et al 2018 in the sarvak limestone formation preliminary survey elucidated that 24 tests were executed in unconfined karst aquifers and one test in an artesian aquifer although the selected tests belong to different geographical locations in iran fig 2 these tests are grouped into two distinct hydrogeological conditions 1 low flow i e low hydraulic gradient and 2 high flow i e elevated hydraulic gradient the first group of the tests were taken place under altered hydrogeological condition by man made structures such as the reservoir of a dam table s1 however the second group of the tests were performed to delineate hydraulic connection between a sinkhole polje and an observation well and the downstream sampling points such as springs wells and river under natural i e low flow groundwater flow system table s1 10 and 14 tests were performed under low and high hydraulic gradient conditions respectively hydraulic gradient in the karstic systems which could be the result of head change in both matrix and conduit ranges from 0 002 to 0 14 and from 0 0003 to 1 16 in tests under low and high hydraulic gradient conditions respectively table s1 based on literature review the media through which flow occur might be dominantly matrix diffuse flow or a well developed conduit conduit flow this is further discussed in section 4 3 2 1 2 the characteristics of the injection and sampling points among the selected tracer tests 18 5 and 1 tests were performed using a well a sinkhole and a fracture as the injection point respectively in the majority of the tests under high hydraulic gradient because there were no sinkholes observation wells as the injection points were selected in such a way with the optimum chance of encountering a conduit flow path however the injection point of tracer tests under natural hydraulic gradient condition was sinkhole fracture or well a considerable volume of water was used to surely push the dye into the aquifer for all types of injection points the selected sampling points can be classified into different types including wells e g observation pumping drainage and exploratory wells river spring and wetlands the distance between the injection and the sampling points ranges from 22 m to 18 km and from 95 m to 20 5 km under the low and high hydraulic gradient conditions respectively in order to simplify for further analysis and compare the tracer tests the available btc of the tracer tests are classified into 6 groups based on the type of injection and sampling points 1 well well w w 2 well spring w s 3 well river w r 4 sinkhole well s w 5 sinkhole spring s s and 6 sinkhole river s r 2 2 synthetic modeling approach since groundwater velocity is large in karst aquifers with a global average of 0 022 m s worthington et al 2001 the advection is largely the dominant process in solute transport however groundwater velocity in conduits is a function of hydraulic gradient conduit diameter and roughness height of the conduit wall eqs 3 and 4 moreover dispersion of the tracer mass is more pronounced with increasing distance from the injection point before analyzing the collected practical btcs from field conditions numerous btcs were produced using a synthetic karst model to evaluate the effect of tracing distance l hydraulic gradient i matrix hydraulic conductivity k exchange coefficient a conduit diameter d and roughness height ε on the characters of a btc e g vp cp tp and tailing a conceptual karst model covering typical characteristics of dual flow system i e conduit and matrix and dynamically interaction between them was considered for numerical modeling fig 2 which is basically similar to birk et al 2006 the synthetic model consists of a single conduit hosted by the matrix with two no flow boundaries on the sides and a constant head boundary at the downstream the scopes of the model domain are 2500 m easting and 2500 northing with equal number of rows and columns as 25 top and bottom of the model are defined at 750 m and 450 m respectively a spring with a constant head at the downstream of the conduit with an elevation of 592 m was presumed as discharge point groundwater flow and tracer transport were simulated in transient condition of 4 months with 60 stress periods starting from half an hour interval in the two first days of simulation to increasing gradually with weekly time pace in the last month the amount of 5 kg mass was assumed to be instantly injected at the injection point as a sinkhole or a well close to the conduit fig 3 btcs were obtained at the spring node six effective parameters i e l i k a d and ε were selected to study their contribution on the shape of btcs in detail the variations range of under evaluation parameters in the numerical modeling is shown in table 1 although the values were theoretically selected to be logical the assigned values are plausible ones in field sites the surrounding boundary conditions and the conduit in the middle of the conceptual model are kept the same for all simulations in order to avoid the complexity and confusion when interpreting the results the synthetic model was run as a basis scenario to produce an initial btc with initial values of l 2200 m i 0 0004 k 1 00 10 5 m s a 3 10 4 m s d 3 m and ε 1 00 10 6 m six scenarios are assumed to evaluate the effect of selected parameters on btcs in total 36 btcs are simulated in each scenario all the input parameters are kept constant except the under evaluation parameter the simulated btcs through each scenario are interpreted to highlight the pure effect of a single parameter on the characteristics of btcs the sampling site in all simulations at which btcs are created is the spring in scenario 1 in order to study the effect of tracing distance four sampling sites supposedly observation wells are assumed at distances of 100 500 1000 and 1500 m and a spring at 2200 m from the injection point to obtain btcs moreover all btcs in scenario 1 were reproduced assuming a tortuosity factor of two therefore in total 10 btcs are simulated to explore the effect of tracing distance in the second scenario with considering the effect of hydraulic gradient groundwater head at the upstream is presumed to be changed from low flow starting from 600 m hydraulic gradient is 0 0004 to high flow conditions with highest head of 667 m hydraulic gradient is 0 0016 in fact changing upstream head from 600 to 667 makes simulating the effect of a man made reservoir in the dam sites possible scenario 3 is focused on the effect of hydraulic conductivity of the matrix within the range of its possible values in carbonate formations freeze and cherry 1979 despite the fact that the grout curtain was not specifically assigned to the numerical model assigning the lowest bound of hydraulic conductivity of about 5 10 7 m s would simulate its effect in scenario 4 the effect of exchange coefficient was investigated and since no measurements of it were reported its variations were kept in a way to maintain the stability of the numerical solution conduit diameter and conduit roughness height are two other input parameters which are studied using scenarios 5 and 6 respectively table 1 a diameter of 0 01 m was proposed by white and white 2005 as the lower range for conduit flow moreover a range of 0 5 to 5 m is usually considered as relevant diameter for conduits worthington and soley 2017 the lower bound of the conduit roughness height which is 1 10 8 m was assumed to simulate a conduit with smooth walls streeter et al 1998 its upper range 2 5 m was supposed in a way that it seems logic in a conduit with 3 m diameter 3 results 3 1 characterization of btcs from synthetic modeling 3 1 1 tracing distance and tortuosity in order to assess the effect of flow distance and tortuosity s on the shape of btcs five observation points along the conduit including the spring at the outlet were selected to obtain btc using cfpv2 fig 4 a first the model was run under no tortuosity effect then tortuosity factor was considered to be 2 the results revealed that lengthening the tracing distance e g 100 2200 m caused cp to decrease e g 45 12 ppb tp to become longer e g 24 to 49 h and vp to increase e g 24 49 m h fig 4a and table s2 when tortuosity is considered in the simulations cp decreases tp lengthens and vp becomes greater because it essentially increases the length of flow path as the tracer took more time to come out of a spring vp is potentially smaller accordingly it is more likely to have a lower cp because some dilution processes such as dispersion are more effective likewise study of a dual conduits system by wang et al 2020 showed when the total length of the conduit system stretched out cp lessened and dispersion intensified the well defined dispersion process is an outcome of the stronger effect of mixing processes in the longer distance 3 1 2 hydraulic gradient since the hydraulic head at the downstream of the conduit i e at the spring was defined to be constant different hydraulic gradient along the conduit was established by assigning the different hydraulic head to the upstream of the conduit six btcs were generated at the spring as the outlet of the conduit under six hydraulic gradient conditions fig 4b the hydraulic gradient was calculated from the upstream to downstream in the matrix when the hydraulic gradient increased e g from 0 0001 to 0 001 vp increased e g from 17 to 120 m h which results in higher cp e g from 10 8 to 12 ppb however under higher hydraulic gradient the flow transferred faster which leads to smaller tp e g from 129 to 18 h 3 1 3 matrix hydraulic conductivity the effect of hydraulic conductivities of the matrix on the shape of btcs is presented in fig 4c decreasing of k caused a long tail in the shape of btcs due to the fact that the tracer mass was released much more slowly moreover cp decreases and tp increases as a result of k reduction which is because vp lessens corresponding to lower hydraulic conductivities for example when k increases from 5 10 7 to 1 10 5 m s cp increases from 2 to 12 ppb tp shortens from 492 to 45 h and vp increases from 4 to 49 m h 3 1 4 exchange flow the exchange coefficient represents the degree of hydraulic connection between the conduit and the host matrix and how much water exchanges between the two media to investigate the effect of a on btc at the spring five different values were assigned to the exchange coefficient in the synthetic model however all the other parameters were kept the same in the simulations to obtain btcs fig 4d with increasing a from smaller values to higher values e g 1 65 10 6 to 3 10 2 m s cp increases e g 2 to 12 ppb tp shortens e g 126 to 43 h and vp becomes greater e g 17 to 51 m h tailing of btcs is also observed as another effect of low a due to the resistance of conduit wall against water transferring from the matrix into conduit therefore mass of the tracer is mainly transported by advection as the dominant process in comparison to dispersion when the stronger coupling between conduit and the matrix is established by assigning the higher value to a 3 1 5 conduit diameter the btcs belongs to variations of conduit diameter are presented in fig 4e and table s2 according to the simulations results cp becomes considerably smaller in larger conduits such as 3 cp 6 ppb and 5 m cp 1 ppb than tighter conduits such as 0 01 cp 884 ppb and 0 50 m cp 252 ppb the reason could be considerable flow rate through wider cross section of conduits with greater diameter tp is shorter in less open conduits so that it is 86 times longer in the conduit with d 5 m than in that of d 0 50 m vp is distinctively greater in smaller conduits e g d 0 01 m vp 738 m h and d 0 50 m vp 697 m h than in meter sized conduits e g d 3 m vp 20 m h and d 5 m vp 9 m h 3 1 6 conduit roughness height the roughness height is an effective variable on the value of friction factor this factor has a reverse relationship with velocity due to the darcy weisbach equation eq 4 so it is expected the rougher a conduit means the less velocity however the variations of roughness height have negligible impact on vp and tp fig 4f and table s2 for example when ε is dramatically changed from 1 10 8 to 2 5 m tp is only varied by one hour from 45 to 44 h likewise vp is just modified from 49 to 50 m h on the other hand cp seems to show some sensitivity to the roughness height variations cp becomes less e g 12 8 ppb where ε is set to be greater e g 1 10 8 to 2 5 m fig 4f the mixing processes over cross section of flow can be the reasons to intensify dispersion by homogenizing the mass of different flow lines as the conduit wall gets more irregular and rougher hauns et al 2001 3 1 7 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the target variables i e cp tp and vp as the characteristics of btcs in response to variation of the selected input parameters i e d and ε i k a and l is studied through sensitivity analysis fig 5 two ratios σ and λ are computed as the amount of variation of each input parameter and target variable respectively 6 σ ip n ip b 7 λ tv n tv b where tv b and ip b refer to the target variable and corresponding input parameter assuming a basic value respectively and tv n and ip n are the target variable and corresponding input parameter assigning a new value respectively comparing of σ and λ highlights that how much the under evaluation variables i e cp tp and vp is affected if the selected input parameters change over a known range fig 5 the variations of each target variable in response to variation of different input parameters are determined by distinct trend regression type i e linear exponential logarithmic power and polynomial the distinguishable trends in relation to decreasing increasing of the evaluated parameters are the exact representative of the variations discussed in the previous sections based on results cp varies in order of more sensitivity with conduit diameter hydraulic conductivity and tracing distance tp is more affected by hydraulic gradient conduit diameter and tracing distance the variation of vp is more sensitive to conduit diameter hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity cp tp and vp show no considerable sensitivity to ε these results are compatible with the nature of karstic systems because conduits are the main pathways of groundwater flow and solute transport therefore their geometrical parameters particularly diameter which controls the cross section of flow velocity and flow rate are expected to affect the shape of btcs considerably furthermore based on equations 2 4 and 5 conduit roughness height would not change velocity concentration and time so much as other parameters such as diameter and hydraulic gradient although studied parameters affected btcs with different intensity some of them such as exchange coefficient and conduit roughness height have no conventional and direct methods for measuring in field conditions and they are estimated indirectly however tracing distance and hydraulic gradient are measured easily in filed sites moreover conduit diameter and hydraulic conductivity can be estimated using the darcy law applicable to the matrix and eqs 3 and 4 for conduits accordingly the effect of three parameters in field sites e g tracing distance hydraulic gradient and conduit diameter on the shape of btcs is investigated based on field data in the following section 3 2 field data evaluation 3 2 1 evaluation the effect of hydraulic gradient cp was extracted from 253 btcs and its variation in the sampling points was evaluated a wide range from 0 015 to 35546 ppb was observed for cp due to the different dye mass used in the different hydrogeological conditions of the sites in order to eliminate the effect of dye mass cp was divided by the injected dye mass m0 to be normalized the effect of hydraulic gradient and distance from the injection point on the normalized cp was compared under low and high flow conditions the selected tracer tests covered a wide range of hydraulic gradient from 0 0003 to 1 16 under high flow condition because of several tests were obtained from dam sites that have reservoir as an elevated constant head fig 6 a however under the low flow i e natural condition tracer tests were performed in a relatively same hydraulic gradient at different aquifers the results revealed the normalized cp tended to increase as hydraulic gradient increased because of higher hydraulic gradient caused higher velocity which is in agreement with the results of numerical modeling figs 4b and 6a accordingly advection is the dominant process in tracer transport when hydraulic gradient is higher the normalized cp of spring points e g w s and s s increases as a smooth trend with increasing of the hydraulic gradient however a huge variation observed in the points of wells e g w w due to the point character of a well that represents the local karst zone around the well this finding is consistent with the importance of a spring as a global representative of the hydrogeological characteristics of karst aquifers in comparison to a well that has a small chance of 10 to drill into a major conduit of karst aquifers worthington et al 2000 mohammadi and raeisi 2007 tp relies on the occurrence time of cp and the average groundwater velocity is estimated based on tp based on the collected data tp with an average of 489 h ranged from 3 to 2712 h since the collected btcs have been recorded in different condition of hydraulic gradient as well as distances the variation of tp versus hydraulic gradient and tracing distance is evaluated fig 6b illustrates the variation of tp versus hydraulic gradient based on the collected btcs as shown in fig 4b from the numerical molding results the higher hydraulic gradient caused decreasing in tp however the trend of reducing tp is not the same for the whole range of the hydraulic gradient for example when the hydraulic gradient is lower than 0 10 the function of decreasing tp is almost linear but for the hydraulic gradient higher than 0 10 a remarkable drop is witnessed for tp it seems that the wide range of tp extracted from btcs of wells e g w w data in fig 6b is extensively affected by hydraulic gradient due to point characters of wells in comparison to the regional characters of springs the drop in tp is observed in btcs from springs i e w s n data in fig 6b could be attributed to the effect of high karst development vp was estimated based on eq 1 for the collected btcs as mentioned in the previous section the estimated vp depends on the particular characteristics of the selected btcs such as hydraulic gradient the tracing distance and the medium type i e matrix or conduit vp with an average of 12 m h ranged from 0 10 to 121 m h the relatively high value of variance of vp 597 is an indication of high variability and site dependency of vp the variation of vp in relation to hydraulic gradient and tracing distance are studied based on the collected btcs although the relationship of vp with hydraulic gradient depends on the tracing tests it does not exhibit a clear trend for all btcs fig 6c for example for some data under high flow conditions i e hydraulic gradient 0 10 vp in wells w w data in fig 6c decreased with increasing hydraulic gradient but at some other vp increased similar to what was discussed in the effect of hydraulic gradient in the simulations results section 3 1 2 the btcs in wells under high hydraulic gradient belong to dam sites that some of btcs were affected by the performance of the grout curtain accordingly vp does not increase or even decrease in response to increasing of hydraulic gradient due to high head loss occurred by the adequate performance of the grout curtain the high vp computed based on the btcs of springs w s and s s data in fig 6c could be an indication of the contribution of major conduits in solute transport and somehow the degree of karst development in the springs 3 2 2 evaluation the effect of tracing distance generally the largest values of the normalized cp belong to btcs of wells i e w w due to the fact that these wells are closer to the injection points as illustrated in fig 4a from the simulations results nonetheless under natural condition some springs i e s s have the greatest normalized cp in spite of having long tracing distances this is because of a viable conduit flow path moreover the normalized cp under high flow condition is larger than low flow condition fig 6d despite the results revealed a general decreasing trend for the normalized cp versus the distance between the sampling sites from the injection point fig 6d the rate of decreasing depends on the flow condition i e low and high flow conditions and type of injection sampling points since the groundwater velocity is greater under the high hydraulic gradient condition the decreasing rate of the normalized cp versus distance is slower due to the dominant effect of advection in tracer transport in comparison to dispersion in terms of the sampling points the variation of the normalized cp versus distance in springs e g the w s and s s types showed a smooth trend in comparison to wells e g w w type the dramatic variations of the normalized cp versus distance in wells are due to the effect of local characteristics of karst aquifer nearby each well the variation of tp versus tracing distance is shown in fig 6e the results reveal that tp has generally a greater value when the tracing distance is longer however the rate of increasing tp over distance is variant at different tests and even in the different flow paths in the same test as discussed earlier based on the numerical results tracing distance changing hydraulic gradient and the degree of connection between conduits and the matrix might be the reasons for variations of tp but the other important factor that should be considered is the medium through which flow occurs which is discussed in section 4 3 even though the data reported from dye tracing tests conducted in the dam sites i e w w mm in fig 6e show higher tp even in short direct distances the real distances are longer due to the effect of the grout curtain assari and mohammadi 2017 vp of the collected btcs except for some data of wells w w data in fig 6f reported from elevated hydraulic gradient conditions exhibits a clear increasing trend with distance fig 6f which is in reasonable agreement with the discussion of the simulations results in section 3 1 1 some of the btcs of springs under natural condition have the highest vp which is around 100 m h and is greater than the global average channel flow velocity of 78 m h worthington 1994 this could be an indication of karst development since these data were sampled from longer tracing distances generally hydrodynamic characteristics of karst aquifers such as hydraulic conductivity and velocity are a function of the scale of measurements nassimi and mohammadi 2016 kiraly 2003 the major and enlarged karst conduits are captured by hydraulic tests done in a large scale or basin scale such as the collected btcs from springs w s and s s data in fig 6f in contrast small scale hydraulic features e g joints and small solution conduit even the matrix behavior can be functioned by local and small scale well tests w w data in fig 6f the variability of vp in the btcs of wells small scale tests is created by the impact of local heterogeneity around each well on the flow and solute transport 3 3 comparison with tracing tests outside of iran in order to compare the results of the selected btcs including tp and vp in iran with the tracing tests results in the world the set of data provided by worthington and soley 2017 was used these data were collected to investigate where turbulence flow occurs and to introduce some approaches to identify turbulent flow regime in karst settings since no data on cp and hydraulic gradient were available just the variations of tp and vp were assessed over tracing distance since the selected data outside iran were mostly obtained in karst springs with major karst conduits only a part of the collected data of iran that belong to karst springs under natural conditions w s and s s in fig 6 were selected for the comparison between available data from iran and some parts of the world based on the available data tp in the world ranged from a minimum of 0 021 h in norway to a maximum of 2030 h in france overall it is clear that tp increases over longer distances for the global data fig 7 a however tp excluding for a few data decreases with increasing distance in iran the underlying reason is that the data from iran are from two types of flow regimes i e diffuse and conduit whereas the global data are from conduit flow regime only a longer tp was estimated in btcs of iran in comparison to the btcs collected in other countries for example the average tp in canada is about 38 h while it is about 843 h in iran which is about 22 times longer the reason should be 1 the higher degree of karst development which causes a shorter tp and residence time and 2 the hydrogeological discrepancies between the data from iran and the world are the reason for the diversity in tp accordingly the shorter tp in btcs from the large distance sampling point such as springs can be interpreted as an indication of the major karst conduit based on 3 6 m h velocity and global average channel flow velocity 78 m h two lines are drawn in fig 7 the situation of tracing sites in relation to these lines can be regarded as a degree of karstification in this fig 7a the data below these lines represent the sites with higher degree of karstification the variation of vp versus distance in iran in comparison to other countries is presented in fig 7b the velocity of the karstic systems based on the data outside iran varies from a minimum of 27 m h in spain to a maximum of 1008 m h in norway with an average of 171 m h however the average groundwater velocity of the collected data in iran is estimated 25 m h approximately 7 times smaller than the average of the other parts of the world the reason could be due to the fact that karst in iran is not as developed as it is for some other countries such as canada and the united states due to differences in climate e g the rate and annual amount of precipitation geology e g texture and lithology of the carbonate rocks and hydrogeology e g hydraulic gradient and the effect of the base of erosion making a clear and reliable conclusion on this subject requires more detailed data and long term research 4 discussion 4 1 the statistics of peak time peak concentration and peak velocity the histogram of tp starting from the first two days of sampling intervals to the last month is shown in fig 8 a in order to capture the exact value of cp and corresponding tp the right intervals of sampling time should be carefully considered generally sampling initiates with short intervals e g 1 or 2 h and gradually increases to a daily interval over a week from the injection time as approach proposed by field 2003 entitled efficient hydrologic tracer test design ehtd tp ranges from 15 to 2712 h and from 3 to 2440 h under natural i e low flow and elevated i e high flow hydraulic gradient conditions respectively the histogram of tp illustrated a multimodal type suggestion different development of karst in the btcs fig 8a the most frequent interval times of tp are in the first two days second week and second month of the sampling each with 19 of all frequencies fig 8a the finding suggests that time to peak concentration tp depends on the characteristics of the karst aquifer in each site as well as the tracing distance and varies from a few hours to more than a few weeks however based on the available btcs it can be concluded the sampling interval was properly selected hence the peak time was nearly captured in the selected btcs cp varies over a wide range from 0 015 to 746 ppb and from 0 18 to 35546 ppb under natural i e low flow and elevated i e high flow hydraulic gradient conditions respectively since 85 of the btcs have cp 50 ppb fig 8b the threshold concentration for detecting dye by naked eye worthington and smart 2003 it seems that the amount of mass injection was properly chosen to some extent in majority of the tests it is usually complicated to inject the right amount of the mass in order to remain in the range of the instruments e g 0 1 ppb and naked eye e g 50 ppb detection limits because there might exist some degree of heterogeneity of karst development however economic and environmental considerations should be assessed before choosing the amount of the mass injection the normalized cp with an average of 2 26 10 5 varies from 10 9 which is among the data from natural or low flow conditions to 0 002 belongs to the elevated high flow conditions data the histogram of vp based on the selected btcs is presented in fig 8c the most frequent 122 data vp is 3 6 m h fig 8c the computed vp ranges from 0 1 to 121 m h with geometric mean of 4 m h however vp ranges from 0 055 to 121 m h and from 0 054 to 39 m h under natural i e low flow and elevated i e high flow hydraulic gradient conditions respectively the median 3 5 m h and geometric mean 4 m h of vp in the selected tests are less than the global average conduit flow velocity 78 m h suggested by worthington et al 2001 this could mean based on the available data karst aquifers in iran are generally less developed in comparison to the global data 4 2 factors affecting peak concentration and peak time although theoretically the shape of btcs in terms of cp and tp is controlled by the interaction of advection dispersion and exchange flow the results from the practical tests elucidated some signs belong to hydrogeological condition i e range of hydraulic gradient and tracing distance and type of injection sampling points for example the standard deviation sd of cp in distances 500 m 3443 is larger than longer distances 102 however cp was observed with smaller sd of 95 and higher values of 2800 under the natural and elevated hydraulic gradient conditions respectively as tracing distance increased cp tends to decrease due to the influencing of mechanical dispersion and the dilution of solute although the majority of btcs of the wells possibly approaching the matrix flow regime confirm this functioning of cp versus tracing distance the quick flow through the enlarged conduits may opposite with this trend some w s natural data in contrast tp increased as the tracing distance measured longer overall the rate of increasing tp over the tracing distance in springs is steeper than wells since the hydraulic gradient causes a direct impact on groundwater velocity it is expected that increasing the hydraulic gradient influences the shape of btcs in terms of decreasing of tp and increasing of cp these general trends were observed in the majority of btcs of wells where represent the matrix flow regime but a few btcs of the springs that possibly classified as the conduit flow regime did not match with the other data some w s natural data 4 3 determination of groundwater flow regime and development of karst the theoretical relationship of velocity v versus hydraulic gradient i is presented in fig 9 a c for matrix darcy flow assuming different hydraulic conductivity and conduit laminar and turbulent flow assuming different diameter of conduit respectively in order to differentiate the relationship between v and i the graphs in fig 9 are divided into four zones 1 v 3 6 i 0 05 2 v 3 6 i 0 05 3 v 3 6 i 0 05 and 4 v 3 6 i 0 05 3 6 m h was selected because it is introduced by astm 1998 for classification of conduit and diffuse flow regime although 0 05 is a rather high value hydraulic gradient for most natural karst settings ford and williams 2007 it is selected considering that the hydraulic gradient in some dam reservoir e g karun is even 1 despite the fact that exchange flow take places between the matrix and conduits in karst aquifers it is assumed in fig 9 that the groundwater flows just through one medium matrix or conduit in the karstic aquifers as shown in fig 9a it is likely that most of the btcs in wells belong to the matrix flow type with equivalent hydraulic conductivity ranging from 1 to 50 m h e g points in the zone 4 in fig 9a in addition most of btcs in wells collected from the karst aquifers with relatively high hydraulic gradient condition in dam sites behave as the matrix and the flow type is probably laminar because of the massive injection of cement along the grout curtain e g points in zone 2 in fig 9a however the majority of points of springs with relatively high velocity particularly those with low hydraulic gradient could not be recognized as matrix flow type due to the overestimation of hydraulic conductivity about 500 m h e g points in zone 1 in fig 9a the area between the reliable range of matrix hydraulic conductivity i e between the lines of 0 2 to 50 m h in fig 9a belongs to the matrix laminar flow type that covered most parts of zones 2 v 3 6 i 0 05 and 4 v 3 6 i 0 05 the oval shape in fig 9a the lines in fig 9b illustrate the relationship between v and i assuming different conduit diameter under laminar flow regime through conduit based on the hagen poiseuille equation since flow regime in zone 3 v 3 6 i 0 05 is likely to be laminar the dominant flow regime in some of the spring sites and wells could be explained by laminar conduit flow e g points in zone 3 fig 9b the equivalent diameter of conduit under laminar flow regime can be suggested in the range of 0 10 to 1 m the oval shape in fig 9b it seems that the selection of the equivalent conduit diameter for data under high velocity is not reliable assuming laminar flow in fig 9b because of large diameters for these data considering reynolds number 2000 as the critical number for turning from laminar to turbulent flow in conduits it is likely that under condition of zone 3 v 3 6 i 0 05 the flow regime is laminar in conduits furthermore reynolds number was estimated in a range from 14 to 317 for the most of the springs e g points in zone 3 fig 9b in order to reproduce the turbulent flow regime through conduits the darcy weisbach equation is used the values for friction factor in karst conduit could vary from 0 10 to 340 ford 2003 with the presumption of friction factor 100 the variation of velocity under turbulent flow regime versus hydraulic gradient for different diameter of conduit is illustrated in fig 9c as the parallel lines the lines are largely plotted in zone 1 v 3 6 i 0 05 a few samples of the springs could be declared as conduit turbulent flow regime e g points next to the lines in zone 1 fig 9c the equivalent diameter of these possible conduits ranges from 0 05 to 1 m fig 9c most of the data are not included as the conduit with turbulent regime because extremely high friction factor 100 is needed which is not reliable based on worthington and soley 2017 when the flow rate of a single channel to spring is higher than 1 l s the probability of occurring turbulent flow increases the springs e g points next to the lines in zone 1 fig 9c which have been concluded to be fed by the turbulent conduit flow regime discharge at the rate of 1000 l s and the flow is likely to happen in a single channel e g arjan polje in mohammadi et al 2018 sarkur spring in mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b although the comparison of the results of btcs with the theoretical concept of flow regimes is restricted to the assumption of flow through a single medium it elucidates some degree of consistency with the practical hydrogeological condition for instance the majority of btcs from the wells and a few springs matched with the lines of the matrix laminar flow regime the oval shape in fig 9a moreover the majority of btcs from the springs and a few wells are consistent with the laminar conduit flow regime the oval shape in fig 9b however a few springs with high discharge follow the lines of the turbulent conduit flow regime the oval shape in fig 9c since it is highly probable that the collected btcs were formed as the contribution of more than one medium the equivalent hydraulic conductivity or equivalent conduit diameter were overestimated to generalize the results and make a connection between the discussed parameters i tp cp and vp and the development of karst in karst aquifers a 3 d graph of vp tp and i is presented in fig 10 since i is dimensionless vp and tp are divided by 3 6 as the threshold between slow and fast flow and tt the time in a btc curve when the concentration returns to the background this way considering the numerical model results fig 4 c d tailing which is associated with all the btcs from the dam sites and the effect of matrix hydraulic conductivity and exchange flow are also considered to be dimensionless respectively three reference lines are drawn for vp 3 6 1 tp tt 0 50 and hydraulic gradient is 0 05 to classify the graph into seven subsections including least karstified two less karstified sections two karstified sections most karstified and a transition zone taking what were discussed by far into account such as the role of the grout curtain in the dam sites flow regime and possible conduit diameter the tracing sites in iran are well matched with the definition of each subsection in fig 10 for example the wells which are mostly in the vicinity of the grout curtain located in the least and less karstified subsections while some springs those concluded to have turbulent conduit flow are in the most karstified subsection 5 conclusion btcs are studied with the aid of numerical modeling and field data from iran under natural and elevated man made e g dam sites hydraulic gradient conditions the results showed that with enlarging conduit diameter and over long tracing distances cp becomes smaller however when hydraulic gradient ascends btcs are reshaped to have greater cp and shorter tp flattened and longer tailed btcs which might be usually associated with small cp long tp and low vp could be the results of low matrix hydraulic conductivity and exchange flow in addition tp lengthens over longer distances unless the man made hydrogeological barrier e g grout curtain in the dam sites causes it to have greater value even under short distances vp is higher under the natural hydraulic gradient condition even when the hydraulic gradient is low and increases with tracing distance a combination of flow and solute transport parameters was structured to classify karst development based on feasible media type and flow regime under low hydraulic gradient conditions and long distances when tp is short vp and cp have approximately great magnitude it is most likely that btc was collected from the relatively well developed karstic system assessing vp and tp over tracing distance from the available tracing test data around the world suggested a lower degree of karst development in iran in comparison to the world however more extensive and broader investigation is necessary to discuss the karst development globally credit authorship contribution statement ahmad behrouj peely

4176,breakthrough curves btcs are known as adequate evidence to characterize karst aquifers which mainly specified by dual flow systems matrix and conduit as well as some degree of connection between dual media conduit flow process version 2 cfpv2 is a discrete conduit continuum model applying which it is possible to simulate such characteristics in this research first cfpv2 was employed to evaluate the effect of several factors including hydraulic conductivity exchange flow tracing distance hydraulic gradient and conduit diameter and roughness on btcs in a synthetic karst aquifer then 253 btcs from 24 dye tracing tests conducted in karstic aquifers of iran were analyzed to evaluate the effect of hydraulic gradient and tracing distance on the btcs with taking into account the effect of medium type matrix or conduit and karst development these tests were conducted under either natural or elevated man made hydraulic gradient conditions the results revealed that peak concentration decreased with enlarging conduit diameter because of considerable flow rate likewise it decreases over longer distances specifically in the elevated man made hydraulic conditions however with increasing hydraulic gradient peak concentration and its timing have upward and downward trends respectively when btcs start to demonstrate tailing and become flattened it could be an indication of low matrix hydraulic conductivity or lower hydraulic gradient in conduit as a result of less exchange flow from the matrix into conduits based on this study a new intermixture of flow and solute transport parameters was engineered to classify karst development high peak concentration short peak time high velocity particularly over long distances and under the natural hydraulic gradient conditions and feasible conduit flow regime whether laminar or turbulent suggested as indication of well developed karstic system keywords tracing test breakthrough curve conduit flow process karst

environmental issues entezari et al 2016 are prime of importance generally karst aquifers consist of conduits and solution fractures which are the main pathways of flow hosted by the matrix which stores the majority of groundwater ford and williams 2007 due to inherent heterogeneity of karst aquifers the pattern and structure of conduits are not usually identified using conventional

equation leap and kaplan 1988 tracing tests are usually performed using solutes e g dye tracer as tracer although electrolytic tracer e g sodium chloride colloid and even a synthetic dna göppert and goldscheider 2008 aquilanti et al 2013 have been used although the early utilization of tracer tests has consisted of the preliminary evaluation of velocity and flow paths multiple tests in a same site recently applied in detailed researches to ascertain the connection of conduits and leakage paths for instance since the results of a tracer test are valid at the injection and sampling points replication of the test by changing the injection point could improve the spatial validity of the results moreover the effects of flow rate and hydraulic gradient on tracer tests have been highlighted mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b worthington 1991 in particular multiple tracing tests data provide detail insight to hydraulic and transport characteristics geyer et al 2007 and patterns of conduit borghi et al 2016 in karst aquifers white and annable 2018 studied tracing tests applied in the upper floridian aquifer over 122 years and concluded that velocity distribution has a wide range and dominant being of conduit flow regime in transport differs among drainage basins based on the results of 14 dye tracing tests under different hydrological boundary conditions from normandy france duran et al 2016 have acquired some equations to explain the relationship between environment parameters and karst responses from unique results obtained by tracer tests undoubtedly the estimation of groundwater velocity because of its impact on contaminant transport and leakage from dam sites is the most important one groundwater velocity in karst aquifers depends on the degree of karst development and the presence of karst features such as sinkholes caves and solution conduits groundwater velocity can be used to determine the flow regime based on a few hydraulic criteria such as reynolds number although the flow regime in karst aquifers was classified by shuster and white 1971 into two end members called diffuse and conduit flow regimes the range of groundwater velocity in these flow regimes has not been suggested generally diffuse and conduit flow occur through the flow paths with diameter less and more than centimeters respectively white 1988 however milanovic 1981 presented a range between 0 002 and 0 5 ms 1 for the conduit flow velocity and worthington et al 2001 suggested 0 022 ms 1 as the global average channel flow moreover based on astm 1998 when flow velocity in a tube is 0 001 ms 1 flow regime is laminar i e slow flow otherwise it is turbulent i e fast flow concentration time curve or breakthrough curve btc is the basis for quantitative analysis of a tracing test assuming an instantaneous point injection the typical shape of the breakthrough curve and the selected parameters of btc such as peak concentration cp m l 3 and peak time tp t are presented in fig 1 simply the average or peak velocity vp lt 1 is estimated using the following equation field 2002 1 v p l s t p where l l is direct distance between the injection point and sampling point s is tortuosity factor a wide range of 1 1 to 3 was suggested for the tortuosity factor in karst aquifers worthington 1991 field 2002 assari and mohammadi 2017 several factors affect the shape of btcs including the mass of injected dye how conservative is the dye spring flowrate hydraulic gradient transport dynamics in rivers jobson 1997 the extent of the recharge areas mull et al 1988 and hydraulic geometry of the karst aquifers field and nash 1997 moreover conduit networks and their characteristics can affect the results of tracing test borghi et al 2016 lauber et al 2014 mobile and immobile fluid regions field and pinsky 2000 göppert and goldscheider 2008 and pools hauns et al 2001 in flow paths can produce the tailing of btcs in the following section the effective factors on btcs configuration are further discussed assuming a typical karst aquifer including conduit and matrix media the transport equation can be formulated in 1 d with the direction identifying the conduit axis as birk 2002 clark 2011 2 c t d l 2 c x 2 v x c x s c where c m l 3 is the solute concentration t t is the time v x lt 1 is groundwater velocity in direction x and d l l 2 t 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient s c m l 3 t 1 is a source term employed here to represent diffusive mass flux between conduit and the matrix the shape of btc i e the left side of eq 2 is regulated by the simultaneous effect of advection dispersion and exchange flow between matrix and conduit media i e the three terms in the right side of eq 2 respectively the first term on the right side of eq 2 presents the effect of dispersion process on the shape of btc even though dispersion can be more effective on solute transport in a porous media aquifer the focus of this research is to highlight the effect of advection processes directly related to groundwater velocity and flow distance on solute transport in karst aquifers because of the higher groundwater velocity dispersion is computed based on taylor approach whether the flow regime is laminar taylor 1953 or turbulent taylor 1954 based on taylor 1953 1954 dispersion depends on the velocity and conduit diameter in cave dye tracing results showed that dispersion spatially varies with flow velocity lauber et al 2014 in another study long flow distances result in higher dispersivity and dispersion hauns et al 2001 in addition the mixing between the host matrix and conduit in longer distances of conduit flow paths is another reason for higher dispersion ronayne 2013 when dispersion varies spatially in conduit it produces the skewness and tailing of btcs li 2011 the second term on the right side of eq 2 denotes the advection and directly depends on groundwater velocity the hagen poiseuille equation is applicable to compute the laminar flow velocity in conduits as shoemaker et al 2008 3 v d 2 32 ρ g μ i where v is the conduit flow velocity lt 1 µ is the water dynamic viscosity ml 1t 1 ρ is the fluid density m l 3 d is the conduit diameter l g l t 2 is acceleration due to gravity and i unitless is hydraulic gradient moreover the darcy weisbach equation was suggested to estimate the conduit flow velocity under turbulent flow regime shoemaker et al 2008 v 2 g d f i where f unitless is the friction factor and computed by colebrook white formula shoemaker et al 2008 5 1 f 2 l o g ε 3 71 d 2 51 r f where r is reynolds number and ε l is mean roughness height of the conduit wall the third term in the right side of eq 2 indicates how the water in the conduits interacts with the matrix wall across the boundary layer it depends on the conduit diameter the difference between the concentration at the matrix surface and the solute concentration in the conduit and a mass transfer coefficient birk 2002 in order to handle groundwater flow through karst aquifers the conduit flow process cfp was utilized that is of discrete conduit continuum dcc models in which the continuum matrix is connected to discrete conduit by an exchange flow term shoemaker et al 2008 the exchange flow is dependent on an exchange coefficient and the head difference between the matrix and conduit it is possible to define the geometry length diameter and height of the conduit networks and also to simulate flow in conduits whether it is pressurized or free surface using cfp cfpv2 has been recently developed based on combination of cfpm1 and eq 2 to compute the spatial and temporal distribution of concentration in a karst aquifer that contains conduit and matrix media reimann et al 2018 and has been successfully applied in karst aquifers kavousi et al 2020 cfpm1 considers conduits flow whether it is laminar or turbulent which should be definitely taken into account in karst aquifers particularly in those with enlarged flow features giese et al 2018 in this investigation cfpv2 was used to show the effect of diameter distance coupling between the matrix and conduit hydraulic gradient and roughness height on the shape of btcs hence cfpv2 not only numerically facilitates to parametrize but also perfectly serves to investigate and overcome some of the limitations of dye tracing methods such as understanding the degree of coupling between the two media and flow state i e laminar and turbulent the shape of btcs is controlled by conduit characteristics such as its diameter length and roughness height the interaction between the matrix and conduit hydraulic gradient and tracing conditions of karst aquifers e g type of injection sampling points and tracing scale in this research a synthetic karst model was developed using cfpv2 to evaluate the role of these effective factors on btcs moreover 253 btcs from 24 dye tracing tests in karst aquifers from different parts of iran were collected then a few available and effective variables e g peak concentration peak time tracing distance hydraulic gradient and velocity were derived the main objectives of this review study are to 1 parametrize the effect of several effective variables such as the diameter length and roughness of conduits matrix hydraulic conductivity exchange flow and hydraulic gradient using synthetic modeling by cfpv2 and 2 evaluate the role of hydraulic gradient and tracing distance as well as media type matrix or conduit using filed data on the result of dye tracing tests i e btcs 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the field data set and their reliability karst features in iran include in a range from small karrens and low flow rate springs as indicators of less advanced karst to high flow rate springs and poljes such as dasht e arjan jamali et al 2015 as indicators of developed karst areas caves such as alisadr and katalekhor vardanjani et al 2017 and sinkholes in some areas like abarhkoh soldo et al 2020 are of other significant features also representing the developed karst in iran to explore better these characteristics of karst systems in iran tracing tests have been employed in iran which are described as follows in order to compare the results of tracing tests under different hydrogeological conditions twenty four tests were collected from different karstic regions of iran fig 2 the general characteristics of the selected dye tracer tests are presented in table s1 the available dye tracer tests table s1 belong to different geographical geological as well as hydrogeological settings moreover these tests are different in terms of type of injection point number and distance of sampling points type and mass of the injected dye and hydraulic gradient a total of 253 btcs from the different type of sampling points e g spring river observation well drainage well and artesian well were collected the distance between sampling and injection points ranges from 10 m to 10 km table s1 the mass of different dye tracer e g uranine eosin and rhodamine wt ranged from 1 to 50 kg the collected dye tracer tests table s1 have been carried out to assess different goals including detection of the possible leakage paths before asadi 1997 fars state water company 1996 bagheri et al 2006 mehr and raeisi 2019 and after behrouj peely et al 2018 gorbani et al 2005 dam construction determination of the general flow direction adinehvand et al 2017 delineation of the catchment area of spring iran karst research center 2002 raeisi et al 1999 specification of the discharge point of a ploje mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b and characterization of karst development and flow regime mohammadi et al 2007a mohammadi et al 2007b kalantari and mohammadi 2011 in particular soltani et al 2008 concluded that local karstification in some measure has occurred at the kowsar dam site which is consistent with some local solution features of the karst formation in another study interpretation of tracer test revealed that conduits networks have not developed at mirzaye shirazi kavar dam site khalaj and rahanjam 2012 the development of karst at shamiran dam site has been reported to be high at some paths but not to be homogeneous based on several peaks in btcs jahani 2000 having assessed flow regimes the results revealed that conduit regime is the dominant flow type based on the estimation of dye tracing velocity in the garin karst region khanlari and moomeni 2012 in another region in the zagros mountains mohammadi et al 2007a b concluded that the flow regime is diffuse and karst is not well developed in an atresian karst aquifer in the khersan3 dam site at bidvaz dam site the dominant flow was concluded to be turbulent flow based on btcs nasseh et al 2013 likewise diffuse flow regime was concluded as the dominant flow type based on low velocity at the doosti dam site mozafari et al 2012 based on low flow velocity and multiple peaks of the btc of a spring karimi and ashjari 2010 suggested a diffuse and siphon flow system for such a behavior the diffuse flow regime was also suggested at the sazbon dam site based on the characteristics of btcs raeisi et al 2005 the interpretation of a dye tracer in combination with the water balance equation revealed a single conduit to carry water out from the ponor of the arjan polje to the domeasb springs only mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b these tests are also conducted to propose the flow model of the lagharak polje considering the kuhrang iii water conveyance tunnel janparvar et al 2015 the reliability of the field data set was evaluated using the procedure employed by zech et al 2015 2019 with adaptations and legitimacy to the objectives of this study we needed to extract cp and tp directly and calculate velocity matrix hydraulic conductivity and conduit diameter using btcs in this perspective of reliability the data were classified into three groups of high reliability r1 moderate reliability r2 and low reliability r3 zech et al 2015 zech et al 2019 the first criterion was that the sampling interval time must be selected somehow that it captured the real peak concentration and its corresponding time the tests with explicit peak concentration were assigned as r1 in addition we selected the tests with conservative tracers and sinkholes as the most reliable set of data r1 the tests in which an observation well was the injection point were categorized as r2 finally the tracing tests in which the btcs did not have a distinct peak concentration with many fluctuations e g most river samples and few well samples were categorized as r3 regarding the flow paths they are detected using the tracing tests results but in the sites with more complexities such as the ones with the grout curtain in dam sites it is most challenging to define the tortuosity coefficient therefore the tests conducted in the dam sites were defined as r2 and the tests carried out under natural condition were assigned as r1 injection site type was another important factor in having assigned reliability in this context the tests with a sinkhole as the injection point were considered in the r1 category and the tests where the injection site was a well were put under the r2 category for the purpose of this research just the tests with r1 and r2 classes were chosen for analysis 2 1 1 hydrogeological overview of the selected tests several limestone formations have the potential for karstification and being as a karst aquifer in iran the majority of the selected tests 18 tests were performed in asmari formation as the main aquifer system moreover 3 1 and 2 tests belong to sarvak lar and tirgan limestone formations respectively surface indications of karst development such as sinkholes and caverns were reported in the asmari limestone there are also some sinkholes of about 100 m in diameter in the upper jurassic limestone of the lar formation in the poshte naz area of the alborz zone kalantari and mohammadi 2011 the flow rate of springs varies from 10 l s from tirgan limestone formation mozafari et al 2012 to 5 m3 s sarkur spring mohammadi et al 2018 in the sarvak limestone formation preliminary survey elucidated that 24 tests were executed in unconfined karst aquifers and one test in an artesian aquifer although the selected tests belong to different geographical locations in iran fig 2 these tests are grouped into two distinct hydrogeological conditions 1 low flow i e low hydraulic gradient and 2 high flow i e elevated hydraulic gradient the first group of the tests were taken place under altered hydrogeological condition by man made structures such as the reservoir of a dam table s1 however the second group of the tests were performed to delineate hydraulic connection between a sinkhole polje and an observation well and the downstream sampling points such as springs wells and river under natural i e low flow groundwater flow system table s1 10 and 14 tests were performed under low and high hydraulic gradient conditions respectively hydraulic gradient in the karstic systems which could be the result of head change in both matrix and conduit ranges from 0 002 to 0 14 and from 0 0003 to 1 16 in tests under low and high hydraulic gradient conditions respectively table s1 based on literature review the media through which flow occur might be dominantly matrix diffuse flow or a well developed conduit conduit flow this is further discussed in section 4 3 2 1 2 the characteristics of the injection and sampling points among the selected tracer tests 18 5 and 1 tests were performed using a well a sinkhole and a fracture as the injection point respectively in the majority of the tests under high hydraulic gradient because there were no sinkholes observation wells as the injection points were selected in such a way with the optimum chance of encountering a conduit flow path however the injection point of tracer tests under natural hydraulic gradient condition was sinkhole fracture or well a considerable volume of water was used to surely push the dye into the aquifer for all types of injection points the selected sampling points can be classified into different types including wells e g observation pumping drainage and exploratory wells river spring and wetlands the distance between the injection and the sampling points ranges from 22 m to 18 km and from 95 m to 20 5 km under the low and high hydraulic gradient conditions respectively in order to simplify for further analysis and compare the tracer tests the available btc of the tracer tests are classified into 6 groups based on the type of injection and sampling points 1 well well w w 2 well spring w s 3 well river w r 4 sinkhole well s w 5 sinkhole spring s s and 6 sinkhole river s r 2 2 synthetic modeling approach since groundwater velocity is large in karst aquifers with a global average of 0 022 m s worthington et al 2001 the advection is largely the dominant process in solute transport however groundwater velocity in conduits is a function of hydraulic gradient conduit diameter and roughness height of the conduit wall eqs 3 and 4 moreover dispersion of the tracer mass is more pronounced with increasing distance from the injection point before analyzing the collected practical btcs from field conditions numerous btcs were produced using a synthetic karst model to evaluate the effect of tracing distance l hydraulic gradient i matrix hydraulic conductivity k exchange coefficient a conduit diameter d and roughness height ε on the characters of a btc e g vp cp tp and tailing a conceptual karst model covering typical characteristics of dual flow system i e conduit and matrix and dynamically interaction between them was considered for numerical modeling fig 2 which is basically similar to birk et al 2006 the synthetic model consists of a single conduit hosted by the matrix with two no flow boundaries on the sides and a constant head boundary at the downstream the scopes of the model domain are 2500 m easting and 2500 northing with equal number of rows and columns as 25 top and bottom of the model are defined at 750 m and 450 m respectively a spring with a constant head at the downstream of the conduit with an elevation of 592 m was presumed as discharge point groundwater flow and tracer transport were simulated in transient condition of 4 months with 60 stress periods starting from half an hour interval in the two first days of simulation to increasing gradually with weekly time pace in the last month the amount of 5 kg mass was assumed to be instantly injected at the injection point as a sinkhole or a well close to the conduit fig 3 btcs were obtained at the spring node six effective parameters i e l i k a d and ε were selected to study their contribution on the shape of btcs in detail the variations range of under evaluation parameters in the numerical modeling is shown in table 1 although the values were theoretically selected to be logical the assigned values are plausible ones in field sites the surrounding boundary conditions and the conduit in the middle of the conceptual model are kept the same for all simulations in order to avoid the complexity and confusion when interpreting the results the synthetic model was run as a basis scenario to produce an initial btc with initial values of l 2200 m i 0 0004 k 1 00 10 5 m s a 3 10 4 m s d 3 m and ε 1 00 10 6 m six scenarios are assumed to evaluate the effect of selected parameters on btcs in total 36 btcs are simulated in each scenario all the input parameters are kept constant except the under evaluation parameter the simulated btcs through each scenario are interpreted to highlight the pure effect of a single parameter on the characteristics of btcs the sampling site in all simulations at which btcs are created is the spring in scenario 1 in order to study the effect of tracing distance four sampling sites supposedly observation wells are assumed at distances of 100 500 1000 and 1500 m and a spring at 2200 m from the injection point to obtain btcs moreover all btcs in scenario 1 were reproduced assuming a tortuosity factor of two therefore in total 10 btcs are simulated to explore the effect of tracing distance in the second scenario with considering the effect of hydraulic gradient groundwater head at the upstream is presumed to be changed from low flow starting from 600 m hydraulic gradient is 0 0004 to high flow conditions with highest head of 667 m hydraulic gradient is 0 0016 in fact changing upstream head from 600 to 667 makes simulating the effect of a man made reservoir in the dam sites possible scenario 3 is focused on the effect of hydraulic conductivity of the matrix within the range of its possible values in carbonate formations freeze and cherry 1979 despite the fact that the grout curtain was not specifically assigned to the numerical model assigning the lowest bound of hydraulic conductivity of about 5 10 7 m s would simulate its effect in scenario 4 the effect of exchange coefficient was investigated and since no measurements of it were reported its variations were kept in a way to maintain the stability of the numerical solution conduit diameter and conduit roughness height are two other input parameters which are studied using scenarios 5 and 6 respectively table 1 a diameter of 0 01 m was proposed by white and white 2005 as the lower range for conduit flow moreover a range of 0 5 to 5 m is usually considered as relevant diameter for conduits worthington and soley 2017 the lower bound of the conduit roughness height which is 1 10 8 m was assumed to simulate a conduit with smooth walls streeter et al 1998 its upper range 2 5 m was supposed in a way that it seems logic in a conduit with 3 m diameter 3 results 3 1 characterization of btcs from synthetic modeling 3 1 1 tracing distance and tortuosity in order to assess the effect of flow distance and tortuosity s on the shape of btcs five observation points along the conduit including the spring at the outlet were selected to obtain btc using cfpv2 fig 4 a first the model was run under no tortuosity effect then tortuosity factor was considered to be 2 the results revealed that lengthening the tracing distance e g 100 2200 m caused cp to decrease e g 45 12 ppb tp to become longer e g 24 to 49 h and vp to increase e g 24 49 m h fig 4a and table s2 when tortuosity is considered in the simulations cp decreases tp lengthens and vp becomes greater because it essentially increases the length of flow path as the tracer took more time to come out of a spring vp is potentially smaller accordingly it is more likely to have a lower cp because some dilution processes such as dispersion are more effective likewise study of a dual conduits system by wang et al 2020 showed when the total length of the conduit system stretched out cp lessened and dispersion intensified the well defined dispersion process is an outcome of the stronger effect of mixing processes in the longer distance 3 1 2 hydraulic gradient since the hydraulic head at the downstream of the conduit i e at the spring was defined to be constant different hydraulic gradient along the conduit was established by assigning the different hydraulic head to the upstream of the conduit six btcs were generated at the spring as the outlet of the conduit under six hydraulic gradient conditions fig 4b the hydraulic gradient was calculated from the upstream to downstream in the matrix when the hydraulic gradient increased e g from 0 0001 to 0 001 vp increased e g from 17 to 120 m h which results in higher cp e g from 10 8 to 12 ppb however under higher hydraulic gradient the flow transferred faster which leads to smaller tp e g from 129 to 18 h 3 1 3 matrix hydraulic conductivity the effect of hydraulic conductivities of the matrix on the shape of btcs is presented in fig 4c decreasing of k caused a long tail in the shape of btcs due to the fact that the tracer mass was released much more slowly moreover cp decreases and tp increases as a result of k reduction which is because vp lessens corresponding to lower hydraulic conductivities for example when k increases from 5 10 7 to 1 10 5 m s cp increases from 2 to 12 ppb tp shortens from 492 to 45 h and vp increases from 4 to 49 m h 3 1 4 exchange flow the exchange coefficient represents the degree of hydraulic connection between the conduit and the host matrix and how much water exchanges between the two media to investigate the effect of a on btc at the spring five different values were assigned to the exchange coefficient in the synthetic model however all the other parameters were kept the same in the simulations to obtain btcs fig 4d with increasing a from smaller values to higher values e g 1 65 10 6 to 3 10 2 m s cp increases e g 2 to 12 ppb tp shortens e g 126 to 43 h and vp becomes greater e g 17 to 51 m h tailing of btcs is also observed as another effect of low a due to the resistance of conduit wall against water transferring from the matrix into conduit therefore mass of the tracer is mainly transported by advection as the dominant process in comparison to dispersion when the stronger coupling between conduit and the matrix is established by assigning the higher value to a 3 1 5 conduit diameter the btcs belongs to variations of conduit diameter are presented in fig 4e and table s2 according to the simulations results cp becomes considerably smaller in larger conduits such as 3 cp 6 ppb and 5 m cp 1 ppb than tighter conduits such as 0 01 cp 884 ppb and 0 50 m cp 252 ppb the reason could be considerable flow rate through wider cross section of conduits with greater diameter tp is shorter in less open conduits so that it is 86 times longer in the conduit with d 5 m than in that of d 0 50 m vp is distinctively greater in smaller conduits e g d 0 01 m vp 738 m h and d 0 50 m vp 697 m h than in meter sized conduits e g d 3 m vp 20 m h and d 5 m vp 9 m h 3 1 6 conduit roughness height the roughness height is an effective variable on the value of friction factor this factor has a reverse relationship with velocity due to the darcy weisbach equation eq 4 so it is expected the rougher a conduit means the less velocity however the variations of roughness height have negligible impact on vp and tp fig 4f and table s2 for example when ε is dramatically changed from 1 10 8 to 2 5 m tp is only varied by one hour from 45 to 44 h likewise vp is just modified from 49 to 50 m h on the other hand cp seems to show some sensitivity to the roughness height variations cp becomes less e g 12 8 ppb where ε is set to be greater e g 1 10 8 to 2 5 m fig 4f the mixing processes over cross section of flow can be the reasons to intensify dispersion by homogenizing the mass of different flow lines as the conduit wall gets more irregular and rougher hauns et al 2001 3 1 7 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the target variables i e cp tp and vp as the characteristics of btcs in response to variation of the selected input parameters i e d and ε i k a and l is studied through sensitivity analysis fig 5 two ratios σ and λ are computed as the amount of variation of each input parameter and target variable respectively 6 σ ip n ip b 7 λ tv n tv b where tv b and ip b refer to the target variable and corresponding input parameter assuming a basic value respectively and tv n and ip n are the target variable and corresponding input parameter assigning a new value respectively comparing of σ and λ highlights that how much the under evaluation variables i e cp tp and vp is affected if the selected input parameters change over a known range fig 5 the variations of each target variable in response to variation of different input parameters are determined by distinct trend regression type i e linear exponential logarithmic power and polynomial the distinguishable trends in relation to decreasing increasing of the evaluated parameters are the exact representative of the variations discussed in the previous sections based on results cp varies in order of more sensitivity with conduit diameter hydraulic conductivity and tracing distance tp is more affected by hydraulic gradient conduit diameter and tracing distance the variation of vp is more sensitive to conduit diameter hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity cp tp and vp show no considerable sensitivity to ε these results are compatible with the nature of karstic systems because conduits are the main pathways of groundwater flow and solute transport therefore their geometrical parameters particularly diameter which controls the cross section of flow velocity and flow rate are expected to affect the shape of btcs considerably furthermore based on equations 2 4 and 5 conduit roughness height would not change velocity concentration and time so much as other parameters such as diameter and hydraulic gradient although studied parameters affected btcs with different intensity some of them such as exchange coefficient and conduit roughness height have no conventional and direct methods for measuring in field conditions and they are estimated indirectly however tracing distance and hydraulic gradient are measured easily in filed sites moreover conduit diameter and hydraulic conductivity can be estimated using the darcy law applicable to the matrix and eqs 3 and 4 for conduits accordingly the effect of three parameters in field sites e g tracing distance hydraulic gradient and conduit diameter on the shape of btcs is investigated based on field data in the following section 3 2 field data evaluation 3 2 1 evaluation the effect of hydraulic gradient cp was extracted from 253 btcs and its variation in the sampling points was evaluated a wide range from 0 015 to 35546 ppb was observed for cp due to the different dye mass used in the different hydrogeological conditions of the sites in order to eliminate the effect of dye mass cp was divided by the injected dye mass m0 to be normalized the effect of hydraulic gradient and distance from the injection point on the normalized cp was compared under low and high flow conditions the selected tracer tests covered a wide range of hydraulic gradient from 0 0003 to 1 16 under high flow condition because of several tests were obtained from dam sites that have reservoir as an elevated constant head fig 6 a however under the low flow i e natural condition tracer tests were performed in a relatively same hydraulic gradient at different aquifers the results revealed the normalized cp tended to increase as hydraulic gradient increased because of higher hydraulic gradient caused higher velocity which is in agreement with the results of numerical modeling figs 4b and 6a accordingly advection is the dominant process in tracer transport when hydraulic gradient is higher the normalized cp of spring points e g w s and s s increases as a smooth trend with increasing of the hydraulic gradient however a huge variation observed in the points of wells e g w w due to the point character of a well that represents the local karst zone around the well this finding is consistent with the importance of a spring as a global representative of the hydrogeological characteristics of karst aquifers in comparison to a well that has a small chance of 10 to drill into a major conduit of karst aquifers worthington et al 2000 mohammadi and raeisi 2007 tp relies on the occurrence time of cp and the average groundwater velocity is estimated based on tp based on the collected data tp with an average of 489 h ranged from 3 to 2712 h since the collected btcs have been recorded in different condition of hydraulic gradient as well as distances the variation of tp versus hydraulic gradient and tracing distance is evaluated fig 6b illustrates the variation of tp versus hydraulic gradient based on the collected btcs as shown in fig 4b from the numerical molding results the higher hydraulic gradient caused decreasing in tp however the trend of reducing tp is not the same for the whole range of the hydraulic gradient for example when the hydraulic gradient is lower than 0 10 the function of decreasing tp is almost linear but for the hydraulic gradient higher than 0 10 a remarkable drop is witnessed for tp it seems that the wide range of tp extracted from btcs of wells e g w w data in fig 6b is extensively affected by hydraulic gradient due to point characters of wells in comparison to the regional characters of springs the drop in tp is observed in btcs from springs i e w s n data in fig 6b could be attributed to the effect of high karst development vp was estimated based on eq 1 for the collected btcs as mentioned in the previous section the estimated vp depends on the particular characteristics of the selected btcs such as hydraulic gradient the tracing distance and the medium type i e matrix or conduit vp with an average of 12 m h ranged from 0 10 to 121 m h the relatively high value of variance of vp 597 is an indication of high variability and site dependency of vp the variation of vp in relation to hydraulic gradient and tracing distance are studied based on the collected btcs although the relationship of vp with hydraulic gradient depends on the tracing tests it does not exhibit a clear trend for all btcs fig 6c for example for some data under high flow conditions i e hydraulic gradient 0 10 vp in wells w w data in fig 6c decreased with increasing hydraulic gradient but at some other vp increased similar to what was discussed in the effect of hydraulic gradient in the simulations results section 3 1 2 the btcs in wells under high hydraulic gradient belong to dam sites that some of btcs were affected by the performance of the grout curtain accordingly vp does not increase or even decrease in response to increasing of hydraulic gradient due to high head loss occurred by the adequate performance of the grout curtain the high vp computed based on the btcs of springs w s and s s data in fig 6c could be an indication of the contribution of major conduits in solute transport and somehow the degree of karst development in the springs 3 2 2 evaluation the effect of tracing distance generally the largest values of the normalized cp belong to btcs of wells i e w w due to the fact that these wells are closer to the injection points as illustrated in fig 4a from the simulations results nonetheless under natural condition some springs i e s s have the greatest normalized cp in spite of having long tracing distances this is because of a viable conduit flow path moreover the normalized cp under high flow condition is larger than low flow condition fig 6d despite the results revealed a general decreasing trend for the normalized cp versus the distance between the sampling sites from the injection point fig 6d the rate of decreasing depends on the flow condition i e low and high flow conditions and type of injection sampling points since the groundwater velocity is greater under the high hydraulic gradient condition the decreasing rate of the normalized cp versus distance is slower due to the dominant effect of advection in tracer transport in comparison to dispersion in terms of the sampling points the variation of the normalized cp versus distance in springs e g the w s and s s types showed a smooth trend in comparison to wells e g w w type the dramatic variations of the normalized cp versus distance in wells are due to the effect of local characteristics of karst aquifer nearby each well the variation of tp versus tracing distance is shown in fig 6e the results reveal that tp has generally a greater value when the tracing distance is longer however the rate of increasing tp over distance is variant at different tests and even in the different flow paths in the same test as discussed earlier based on the numerical results tracing distance changing hydraulic gradient and the degree of connection between conduits and the matrix might be the reasons for variations of tp but the other important factor that should be considered is the medium through which flow occurs which is discussed in section 4 3 even though the data reported from dye tracing tests conducted in the dam sites i e w w mm in fig 6e show higher tp even in short direct distances the real distances are longer due to the effect of the grout curtain assari and mohammadi 2017 vp of the collected btcs except for some data of wells w w data in fig 6f reported from elevated hydraulic gradient conditions exhibits a clear increasing trend with distance fig 6f which is in reasonable agreement with the discussion of the simulations results in section 3 1 1 some of the btcs of springs under natural condition have the highest vp which is around 100 m h and is greater than the global average channel flow velocity of 78 m h worthington 1994 this could be an indication of karst development since these data were sampled from longer tracing distances generally hydrodynamic characteristics of karst aquifers such as hydraulic conductivity and velocity are a function of the scale of measurements nassimi and mohammadi 2016 kiraly 2003 the major and enlarged karst conduits are captured by hydraulic tests done in a large scale or basin scale such as the collected btcs from springs w s and s s data in fig 6f in contrast small scale hydraulic features e g joints and small solution conduit even the matrix behavior can be functioned by local and small scale well tests w w data in fig 6f the variability of vp in the btcs of wells small scale tests is created by the impact of local heterogeneity around each well on the flow and solute transport 3 3 comparison with tracing tests outside of iran in order to compare the results of the selected btcs including tp and vp in iran with the tracing tests results in the world the set of data provided by worthington and soley 2017 was used these data were collected to investigate where turbulence flow occurs and to introduce some approaches to identify turbulent flow regime in karst settings since no data on cp and hydraulic gradient were available just the variations of tp and vp were assessed over tracing distance since the selected data outside iran were mostly obtained in karst springs with major karst conduits only a part of the collected data of iran that belong to karst springs under natural conditions w s and s s in fig 6 were selected for the comparison between available data from iran and some parts of the world based on the available data tp in the world ranged from a minimum of 0 021 h in norway to a maximum of 2030 h in france overall it is clear that tp increases over longer distances for the global data fig 7 a however tp excluding for a few data decreases with increasing distance in iran the underlying reason is that the data from iran are from two types of flow regimes i e diffuse and conduit whereas the global data are from conduit flow regime only a longer tp was estimated in btcs of iran in comparison to the btcs collected in other countries for example the average tp in canada is about 38 h while it is about 843 h in iran which is about 22 times longer the reason should be 1 the higher degree of karst development which causes a shorter tp and residence time and 2 the hydrogeological discrepancies between the data from iran and the world are the reason for the diversity in tp accordingly the shorter tp in btcs from the large distance sampling point such as springs can be interpreted as an indication of the major karst conduit based on 3 6 m h velocity and global average channel flow velocity 78 m h two lines are drawn in fig 7 the situation of tracing sites in relation to these lines can be regarded as a degree of karstification in this fig 7a the data below these lines represent the sites with higher degree of karstification the variation of vp versus distance in iran in comparison to other countries is presented in fig 7b the velocity of the karstic systems based on the data outside iran varies from a minimum of 27 m h in spain to a maximum of 1008 m h in norway with an average of 171 m h however the average groundwater velocity of the collected data in iran is estimated 25 m h approximately 7 times smaller than the average of the other parts of the world the reason could be due to the fact that karst in iran is not as developed as it is for some other countries such as canada and the united states due to differences in climate e g the rate and annual amount of precipitation geology e g texture and lithology of the carbonate rocks and hydrogeology e g hydraulic gradient and the effect of the base of erosion making a clear and reliable conclusion on this subject requires more detailed data and long term research 4 discussion 4 1 the statistics of peak time peak concentration and peak velocity the histogram of tp starting from the first two days of sampling intervals to the last month is shown in fig 8 a in order to capture the exact value of cp and corresponding tp the right intervals of sampling time should be carefully considered generally sampling initiates with short intervals e g 1 or 2 h and gradually increases to a daily interval over a week from the injection time as approach proposed by field 2003 entitled efficient hydrologic tracer test design ehtd tp ranges from 15 to 2712 h and from 3 to 2440 h under natural i e low flow and elevated i e high flow hydraulic gradient conditions respectively the histogram of tp illustrated a multimodal type suggestion different development of karst in the btcs fig 8a the most frequent interval times of tp are in the first two days second week and second month of the sampling each with 19 of all frequencies fig 8a the finding suggests that time to peak concentration tp depends on the characteristics of the karst aquifer in each site as well as the tracing distance and varies from a few hours to more than a few weeks however based on the available btcs it can be concluded the sampling interval was properly selected hence the peak time was nearly captured in the selected btcs cp varies over a wide range from 0 015 to 746 ppb and from 0 18 to 35546 ppb under natural i e low flow and elevated i e high flow hydraulic gradient conditions respectively since 85 of the btcs have cp 50 ppb fig 8b the threshold concentration for detecting dye by naked eye worthington and smart 2003 it seems that the amount of mass injection was properly chosen to some extent in majority of the tests it is usually complicated to inject the right amount of the mass in order to remain in the range of the instruments e g 0 1 ppb and naked eye e g 50 ppb detection limits because there might exist some degree of heterogeneity of karst development however economic and environmental considerations should be assessed before choosing the amount of the mass injection the normalized cp with an average of 2 26 10 5 varies from 10 9 which is among the data from natural or low flow conditions to 0 002 belongs to the elevated high flow conditions data the histogram of vp based on the selected btcs is presented in fig 8c the most frequent 122 data vp is 3 6 m h fig 8c the computed vp ranges from 0 1 to 121 m h with geometric mean of 4 m h however vp ranges from 0 055 to 121 m h and from 0 054 to 39 m h under natural i e low flow and elevated i e high flow hydraulic gradient conditions respectively the median 3 5 m h and geometric mean 4 m h of vp in the selected tests are less than the global average conduit flow velocity 78 m h suggested by worthington et al 2001 this could mean based on the available data karst aquifers in iran are generally less developed in comparison to the global data 4 2 factors affecting peak concentration and peak time although theoretically the shape of btcs in terms of cp and tp is controlled by the interaction of advection dispersion and exchange flow the results from the practical tests elucidated some signs belong to hydrogeological condition i e range of hydraulic gradient and tracing distance and type of injection sampling points for example the standard deviation sd of cp in distances 500 m 3443 is larger than longer distances 102 however cp was observed with smaller sd of 95 and higher values of 2800 under the natural and elevated hydraulic gradient conditions respectively as tracing distance increased cp tends to decrease due to the influencing of mechanical dispersion and the dilution of solute although the majority of btcs of the wells possibly approaching the matrix flow regime confirm this functioning of cp versus tracing distance the quick flow through the enlarged conduits may opposite with this trend some w s natural data in contrast tp increased as the tracing distance measured longer overall the rate of increasing tp over the tracing distance in springs is steeper than wells since the hydraulic gradient causes a direct impact on groundwater velocity it is expected that increasing the hydraulic gradient influences the shape of btcs in terms of decreasing of tp and increasing of cp these general trends were observed in the majority of btcs of wells where represent the matrix flow regime but a few btcs of the springs that possibly classified as the conduit flow regime did not match with the other data some w s natural data 4 3 determination of groundwater flow regime and development of karst the theoretical relationship of velocity v versus hydraulic gradient i is presented in fig 9 a c for matrix darcy flow assuming different hydraulic conductivity and conduit laminar and turbulent flow assuming different diameter of conduit respectively in order to differentiate the relationship between v and i the graphs in fig 9 are divided into four zones 1 v 3 6 i 0 05 2 v 3 6 i 0 05 3 v 3 6 i 0 05 and 4 v 3 6 i 0 05 3 6 m h was selected because it is introduced by astm 1998 for classification of conduit and diffuse flow regime although 0 05 is a rather high value hydraulic gradient for most natural karst settings ford and williams 2007 it is selected considering that the hydraulic gradient in some dam reservoir e g karun is even 1 despite the fact that exchange flow take places between the matrix and conduits in karst aquifers it is assumed in fig 9 that the groundwater flows just through one medium matrix or conduit in the karstic aquifers as shown in fig 9a it is likely that most of the btcs in wells belong to the matrix flow type with equivalent hydraulic conductivity ranging from 1 to 50 m h e g points in the zone 4 in fig 9a in addition most of btcs in wells collected from the karst aquifers with relatively high hydraulic gradient condition in dam sites behave as the matrix and the flow type is probably laminar because of the massive injection of cement along the grout curtain e g points in zone 2 in fig 9a however the majority of points of springs with relatively high velocity particularly those with low hydraulic gradient could not be recognized as matrix flow type due to the overestimation of hydraulic conductivity about 500 m h e g points in zone 1 in fig 9a the area between the reliable range of matrix hydraulic conductivity i e between the lines of 0 2 to 50 m h in fig 9a belongs to the matrix laminar flow type that covered most parts of zones 2 v 3 6 i 0 05 and 4 v 3 6 i 0 05 the oval shape in fig 9a the lines in fig 9b illustrate the relationship between v and i assuming different conduit diameter under laminar flow regime through conduit based on the hagen poiseuille equation since flow regime in zone 3 v 3 6 i 0 05 is likely to be laminar the dominant flow regime in some of the spring sites and wells could be explained by laminar conduit flow e g points in zone 3 fig 9b the equivalent diameter of conduit under laminar flow regime can be suggested in the range of 0 10 to 1 m the oval shape in fig 9b it seems that the selection of the equivalent conduit diameter for data under high velocity is not reliable assuming laminar flow in fig 9b because of large diameters for these data considering reynolds number 2000 as the critical number for turning from laminar to turbulent flow in conduits it is likely that under condition of zone 3 v 3 6 i 0 05 the flow regime is laminar in conduits furthermore reynolds number was estimated in a range from 14 to 317 for the most of the springs e g points in zone 3 fig 9b in order to reproduce the turbulent flow regime through conduits the darcy weisbach equation is used the values for friction factor in karst conduit could vary from 0 10 to 340 ford 2003 with the presumption of friction factor 100 the variation of velocity under turbulent flow regime versus hydraulic gradient for different diameter of conduit is illustrated in fig 9c as the parallel lines the lines are largely plotted in zone 1 v 3 6 i 0 05 a few samples of the springs could be declared as conduit turbulent flow regime e g points next to the lines in zone 1 fig 9c the equivalent diameter of these possible conduits ranges from 0 05 to 1 m fig 9c most of the data are not included as the conduit with turbulent regime because extremely high friction factor 100 is needed which is not reliable based on worthington and soley 2017 when the flow rate of a single channel to spring is higher than 1 l s the probability of occurring turbulent flow increases the springs e g points next to the lines in zone 1 fig 9c which have been concluded to be fed by the turbulent conduit flow regime discharge at the rate of 1000 l s and the flow is likely to happen in a single channel e g arjan polje in mohammadi et al 2018 sarkur spring in mohammadi et al 2019a mohammadi et al 2019b although the comparison of the results of btcs with the theoretical concept of flow regimes is restricted to the assumption of flow through a single medium it elucidates some degree of consistency with the practical hydrogeological condition for instance the majority of btcs from the wells and a few springs matched with the lines of the matrix laminar flow regime the oval shape in fig 9a moreover the majority of btcs from the springs and a few wells are consistent with the laminar conduit flow regime the oval shape in fig 9b however a few springs with high discharge follow the lines of the turbulent conduit flow regime the oval shape in fig 9c since it is highly probable that the collected btcs were formed as the contribution of more than one medium the equivalent hydraulic conductivity or equivalent conduit diameter were overestimated to generalize the results and make a connection between the discussed parameters i tp cp and vp and the development of karst in karst aquifers a 3 d graph of vp tp and i is presented in fig 10 since i is dimensionless vp and tp are divided by 3 6 as the threshold between slow and fast flow and tt the time in a btc curve when the concentration returns to the background this way considering the numerical model results fig 4 c d tailing which is associated with all the btcs from the dam sites and the effect of matrix hydraulic conductivity and exchange flow are also considered to be dimensionless respectively three reference lines are drawn for vp 3 6 1 tp tt 0 50 and hydraulic gradient is 0 05 to classify the graph into seven subsections including least karstified two less karstified sections two karstified sections most karstified and a transition zone taking what were discussed by far into account such as the role of the grout curtain in the dam sites flow regime and possible conduit diameter the tracing sites in iran are well matched with the definition of each subsection in fig 10 for example the wells which are mostly in the vicinity of the grout curtain located in the least and less karstified subsections while some springs those concluded to have turbulent conduit flow are in the most karstified subsection 5 conclusion btcs are studied with the aid of numerical modeling and field data from iran under natural and elevated man made e g dam sites hydraulic gradient conditions the results showed that with enlarging conduit diameter and over long tracing distances cp becomes smaller however when hydraulic gradient ascends btcs are reshaped to have greater cp and shorter tp flattened and longer tailed btcs which might be usually associated with small cp long tp and low vp could be the results of low matrix hydraulic conductivity and exchange flow in addition tp lengthens over longer distances unless the man made hydrogeological barrier e g grout curtain in the dam sites causes it to have greater value even under short distances vp is higher under the natural hydraulic gradient condition even when the hydraulic gradient is low and increases with tracing distance a combination of flow and solute transport parameters was structured to classify karst development based on feasible media type and flow regime under low hydraulic gradient conditions and long distances when tp is short vp and cp have approximately great magnitude it is most likely that btc was collected from the relatively well developed karstic system assessing vp and tp over tracing distance from the available tracing test data around the world suggested a lower degree of karst development in iran in comparison to the world however more extensive and broader investigation is necessary to discuss the karst development globally credit authorship contribution statement ahmad behrouj peely

4177,the accurate modelling of urban flooding constitutes an integral part of flood risk assessment and management in residential and industrial areas interactions between drainage networks and surface runoff flows are commonly modelled based on weir orifice equations however this approach has not been satisfactorily validated in unsteady flow conditions due to uncertainties in estimating the discharge coefficients and associated head losses this study utilises experimental data of flow exchange between the sewer flow and the floodplain through a manhole without a lid to develop two alternate approaches that simulate this interaction and describe the associated exchange flow a quasi steady model links the exchange flow to the total head in the sewer pipe and the head losses in the sewer and the manhole whilst a dynamic model takes also into account the evolution of the water level within the manhole at discrete time steps the developed numerical models are subsequently validated against large scale experimental data for unsteady sewer flow conditions featuring variable exchange to the surface results confirmed that both models can accurately replicate experimental conditions with improved performance when compared to existing methodologies based only on weir or orifice equations keywords sewer surface flow interactions urban flood modelling drainage systems head losses unsteady flow urban hydraulics 1 introduction urban flooding events tend to become more frequent due to the increase of urbanization and changes in rainfall patterns linked with climate change an accurate quantification of flood risk is important for assessing relative vulnerability under given and predicted rainfall events in order to develop cost effective asset investments and flood mitigation approaches in urban areas hydrodynamics associated with flood events is particularly complex because such events commonly include interactions between surface flows runoff and flows within urban drainage networks schmitt et al 2004 rubinato et al 2019 the risk of flooding is commonly evaluated using hydraulic modelling tools which utilize a number of empirical and semi empirical relationships and associated parameters to simulate processes such as runoff and frictional turbulent energy losses including relationships to describe interactions between surface flows and drainage networks djordjević et al 2005 leandro et al 2009 seyoum et al 2012 however despite recent advances in remote sensing and open access data moy de vitry et al 2017 moy de vitry and leitão 2020 there is a general paucity of high resolution datasets for flood model validation tscheikner gratl et al 2016 typical datasets consisting of point depth of flow observations during flood events are insufficient to fully overcome parameter non identifiability equifinality issues in complex flood models or provide a detailed evaluation of modelling representations for individual model components such as above below ground flow exchange beven 2006 dottori et al 2013 arrault et al 2016 datasets collected during detailed controlled laboratory studies can be used to validate hydraulic models martins et al 2017 martins et al 2018 and or provide an improved understanding of physical processes and flood model parameters such as energy loss coefficients hare 1983 however transferring findings from scaled laboratory studies into practice can be challenging for example due to its significance in urban flood modelling a number of experimental studies have investigated common representations of flow exchange between surface flows and urban drainage networks through hydraulic structures such as manholes and gullies flow exchange through such structures can be bi directional net exchange to the surface or the drainage network and hydraulic conditions associated with these situations are generally unsteady and highly three dimensional lopes et al 2015 beg et al 2018 within network scale urban flood models such interactions are commonly represented by simple weir orifice equations with net flows given as a function of hydraulic pressure head difference between surface flow and the drainage network the geometrical properties of the structure and an energy loss term nasello and tucciarelli 2005 chen et al 2007 seyoum et al 2012 to evaluate this approach some studies have calibrated validated urban drainage flood models based on physical models of urban catchments with multiple exchange structures bazin et al 2014 fraga et al 2015 noh et al 2016 dong et al 2021 whilst other work has directly measured flow rates through individual interaction structures allowing a direct comparison between exchange equations and measurements for example rubinato et al 2017 conducted a detailed experimental study of the weir and orifice equations representation of exchange flows through a scaled open manhole in both drainage and surcharging conditions in steady flow conditions with subcritical surface flows discharge coefficients were calibrated based on flow pressure and depth measurements in the pipe network and on the surface and found to be constant over the range of tested flow conditions however calculated coefficients were sensitive to flow depth pressure values used within the calibration which may in practice be calculated with different methods and vary over the longitudinal profile of the hydraulic structure in addition when calibrated relationships were used to validate a numerical model against a range of unsteady flow events meaningful differences were observed between predicted and observed exchange volumes several other laboratory studies have been conducted to calibrate weir orifice equations for a range of grate types and steady flow conditions martins et al 2014 focused on drainage flows into a gully pot while gómez et al 2019 and rubinato et al 2018a investigated drainage flows though different grate types and kemper and schlenkhoff 2019 analyzed supercritical flows over road drainage grates all these studies have provided a wide range of recommended discharge coefficients likely due to the sensitivity of energy loss processes to the geometry of different structures but also potentially due to methodological differences in the definition of surface and drainage system hydraulic head e g measurement location how geometrical properties are defined e g calculation of grate void spaces or the wetted perimeter and how partially fully submerged grate manhole openings are considered hence the accurate representation of flood inundation processes in urban areas may require site specific calibration of discharge coefficients dong et al 2021 which is unfeasible in most practical applications based on the studies described above a number of issues concerning the suitability of weir orifice type methodologies to describe above below ground flow interaction can be identified as follows 1 outstanding uncertainty regarding the discharge coefficient which past work has shown to differ significantly from common standard values for classical weirs orifices and thus requires site specific calibration or experimental numerical studies for accurate identification martins et al 2014 gómez et al 2019 2 lack of understanding of the hydraulically effective area of a drainage inlet during shallow flows and how this changes with flow depth and or velocity martins et al 2018 3 the sensitivity of the calculated exchange discharge and or discharge coefficient to the measurement of hydraulic head bazin et al 2014 rubinato et al 2018b which can vary significantly within and across hydraulic structures marsalek 1985 4 a lack of successful validation of the approach in unsteady flow exchange conditions through individual structures rubinato et al 2017 flows which surcharge from or enter into drainage systems may also be considered as diverging or converging junction flows respectively both of which have been extensively studied on a fundamental level mcnown 1954 graber 2010 although commonly in pipe diameters much smaller than those found in drainage networks bazin et al 2014 separated the path of surcharging or drainage pipe flow into successive sections corresponding each to a specific head loss linear head loss in the pipe head loss at a division or a junction or head loss between the surface and the sewer grate it is also possible to conceptualize an interaction node such as a manhole as a storage element with levels that rise and fall depending on net inflows and outflows through a time varying event hence by utilizing more universal concepts associated with energy losses in diverging and converging flows more generally applicable methodologies may be determined this paper develops and presents two analytical modelling approaches to represent exchange flows between piped drainage and surface flows via exchange structures such as manholes and gullies a number of experimental datasets described in rubinato et al 2017 are used to calibrate the models in steady flow conditions and validate the models using a series of unsteady flow events the models performance is compared to both experimental data as well the widely used weir orifice based approaches that represent the current state of the art 2 data from large scale laboratory experiments the experiments were conducted within a facility constructed from pvc in the water laboratory of the civil and structural engineering department at the university of sheffield rubinato 2015 this experimental facility consists of a sewer pipe system with no slope that is linked via a manhole to a hypothetical urban floodplain characterized by a slope of 0 001 fig 1 provides a schematic diagram of the experimental setup the sewer system was constructed based on a 1 6 geometrical scale of a typical uk urban drainage system while the urban floodplain is 4 m wide and 8 m long and it is 0 478 m above the invert level of the pipe this height is denoted as zcrest the internal diameter of the manhole dm is equal to 240 mm while the internal diameter of the sewer pipe dp is equal to 75 mm both upstream and downstream of the manhole in the following the cross section of the manhole and of the sewer pipe are denoted as am and ap respectively flow discharges were measured with electromagnetic flowmeters in the floodplain upstream q 1 and downstream q 2 of the manhole and in the sewer pipes also upstream q 3 and downstream q 4 of the manhole qe denotes the exchange flow between the top of the manhole and the surface flow in the laboratory experiments qe was not measured directly but for steady state flow conditions it can be estimated from the difference between q 3 and q 4 which were both measured pressure sensors provided the pressure head in the floodplain upstream of the manhole hp1 and in the sewer pipes upstream hp3 and downstream hp4 of the manhole the pressure heads in pipes with unsteady flow were smoothened in this study by using the median value of five to eight seconds depending on the case the horizontal distances of the pressure sensors from the nearest edge of the manhole were l1 340 mm for the pressure sensor in the floodplain and l3 230 mm and l4 400 mm for the pressure sensors in the sewer pipes upstream and downstream of the manhole respectively fig 1 more details about the experimental facility the instrumentation and the test program are provided in rubinato 2015 and rubinato et al 2017 rubinato et al 2017 analyzed both steady and unsteady flow cases and their extensive dataset is reanalyzed in the present study this dataset is the only currently openly available dataset on unsteady flow through an individual drainage exchange structure the only additional data that are analyzed herein and were not presented in rubinato et al 2017 are the pressure head data hp4 in the downstream sewer pipe rubinato 2015 from the steady state tests 15 cases with the non surcharging sewer scenario 1 in fig 2 and eight cases with the surcharging sewer scenario 3 in fig 2 condition are considered here for the nine unsteady flow tests the flow on the floodplain was maintained constant at 8 15 l s while a flood hydrograph was run through the sewer pipe replicating surface to sewer and sewer to surface flow exchange conditions during each unsteady test during the experiments discharge and pressure measurements were recorded every dt 0 05 s for steady flow experiments the flow depth at the surface was measured at the location of the pressure sensor fig 1 while for the unsteady flow experiments the flow depth was estimated from the equation of manning with a manning roughness coefficient equal to 0 009 from prior calibration similar to an approach adopted in rubinato et al 2017 3 methods the modelling methodologies analysed here aim at computing the exchange discharge qe between a manhole and the surface during an unsteady event in a dual drainage system the exchange discharge qe is defined positive when the exchange flow goes towards the floodplain surcharging sewer the two models that are presented in this section are referred to as quasi steady model and dynamic model respectively in our quasi steady model we follow a similar approach as rubinato et al 2017 which regards the pipe manhole system as a flow junction qe 0 or bifurcation qe 0 nonetheless compared to the weir orifice flow exchange approach evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 we claim that our quasi steady model introduces more physics in the calculation of qe firstly we link the exchange flow discharge to the total head in the upstream pipe while rubinato et al 2017 considered only the pressure head secondly for the case of surcharging flow from the manhole to the floodplain we account explicitly for four different contributions to the overall head losses between the pipe and the surface similar to bazin et al 2014 for flow exchange between a street and an underground drainage pipe subsequently we utilise the bernoulli equation to describe the flow exchange whereas the approach tested in rubinato et al 2017 lumped the influence of all head losses into a single calibrated orifice equation discharge coefficient this is detailed in section3 5 in our new dynamic model we additionally take into account the evolution with time of the water level hm in the manhole during an unsteady flow event this evolution cannot be expressed in quasi steady models and it provides a better representation of transient effects in the computation of the exchange discharge qe because the storage capacity in the manhole is accounted for explicitly calibration of the models was performed in steady flow conditions due to the ability to directly measure the flow rate and hence identify the energy loss parameters without the need for more complex model calibration methodologies e g noh et al 2016 model validation or evaluation is commonly undertaken after model calibration as a method of determining the ability of the model to replicate observed parameters without further modifications from the user mcmillan et al 2016 to quantify any resulting uncertainties when simulating dynamic events in this study validation was performed in unsteady flow conditions the models are presented analytically in the following subsections 3 1 flow scenarios the model evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 as well as the two models presented here share the same typology of flow scenarios but some refinements are introduced here for this purpose we define notation hm to refer to the flow head at the interaction node manhole which may be approximated using different methods for the different models the reference datum is the sewer pipe invert fig 1 three different flow scenarios may occur fig 2 depending on the value of the head hm in the manhole with respect to the elevation of the floodplain zcrest and the head of the flow in the floodplain hs which is equal to q 1 w hs 2 2 g zcrest hs where w and hs are the width of and the flow depth in the floodplain respectively scenario 1 free weir flow from the floodplain to the manhole qe 0 if the head in the manhole is lower than the level of the floodplain hm zcrest scenario 2 submerged weir or orifice flow from the floodplain to the manhole qe 0 if the head in the manhole is higher than the level of the floodplain but lower than the head of the surface flow zcrest hm hs scenario 3 overflow from surcharging sewer to the floodplain qe 0 if the head in the manhole is greater than the head of the surface flow hm hs 3 2 approximation of head within the manhole pipe network based on the different models the models presented herein and the models evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 differ in the level of detail in which they define and estimate for different flow conditions the total head of the flow in the manhole and hence the head of the sewer network flow at the point it interacts with the surface flow rubinato et al 2017 calibrated the orifice flow exchange equation based on the pressure head hp 3 at the location of the pressure sensor in the upstream pipe in the quasi steady model we approximate hm by h 3 δhtot with h 3 q 3 ap 2 2 g hp 3 the total head at the pressure sensor in the upstream pipe and δhtot the total head losses between the location of this pressure sensor and the point of flow interaction fig 2 see details in section3 5 1 for non surcharging conditions head losses due to qe do not occur as there is no upward flow in the manhole and the total head losses δhtot are noted as δh0 in the dynamic model hm is simply taken equal to the water depth hm in the manhole assuming the velocity head in the manhole is negligible note that the variable hm is not considered in the other two models 3 3 mass balance in the manhole like in a pipe junction or bifurcation the mass balance in the quasi steady model can be written as 1 q 4 q 3 q e where the upstream discharge q 3 in the pipe is a prescribed boundary condition and the exchange discharge qe is predicted by the model therefore the discharge q 4 in the downstream pipe can be determined directly from eq 1 unlike the quasi steady model the dynamic model considers the manhole as a tank in which the volume of water varies in time with the contributing discharges according to 2 a m d h m dt q 3 q e q 4 like in the quasi steady model the upstream pipe discharge q 3 is a prescribed boundary condition and the exchange discharge qe is estimated by the model however eq 2 is now necessary to update the value of hm for the subsequent time step therefore in the dynamic model the discharge q 4 in the downstream pipe needs to be computed separately this step is further described in section3 5 2 in steady flow conditions the mass balance in eq 2 reduces to eq 1 as in the quasi steady model 3 4 non surcharging sewer surface to sewer exchange for non surcharging flow conditions qe 0 the quasi steady and the dynamic model have similar exchange equations with the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 with the only difference being the utilization of the total head in the surface flow instead of just using the flow depth in scenario1 hm zcrest a weir equation is used to describe free flow from the floodplain to the manhole 3 q e 2 3 c 1 π d m 2 g h s z crest 3 with c 1 a discharge coefficient to be calibrated in scenario2 zcrest hm hs a submerged weir equation is used when hs zcrest am π dm 4 q e c 2 π d m h s z crest 2 g h s h m where c 2 is also a discharge coefficient whose value needs to be determined when hs zcrest am π dm a submerged orifice equation may be used rubinato et al 2017 however this threshold is not exceeded in our study rubinato et al 2017 used experimental observations in steady conditions to calibrate parameters c 1 and c 2 here we recalibrated the value of c 1 with the same data as rubinato et al 2017 for scenario 1 see the expected values in fig 6 in rubinato et al 2017 but with the surface flow head instead of the flow depth eq 3 the calibration performed by rubinato et al 2017 for parameter c 2 involved less data points and led to discontinuities in the computed exchange flow discharge at the transition between scenarios 1 and 2 see figure 10 in rubinato et al 2017 therefore in the models introduced here we simply set c 2 2 3 c 1 which ensures continuity between the exchange discharges computed by eqs 3 and 4 when hm zcrest compared to the strategy followed by rubinato et al 2017 the continuity between scenarios 1 and 2 is ensured here at the expense of an accurate agreement with calibration data for scenario2 but the number of available experimental data for scenario 2 is limited and this scenario occurs in practice only for a very short period of time during unsteady flow events at the onset and at the end of surcharging flow rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph therefore the impact of this choice on the overall accuracy of the computed exchange volume over a surcharging flow event is expected to be very small all calibration parameters are summarized in table 1 3 5 surcharging sewer 3 5 1 quasi steady model in the quasi steady model the overflow discharge from the surcharging manhole to the floodplain is computed from a bernoulli equation written between the upstream sewer pipe at the pressure sensor location and the surface flow and by taking into account the total head losses δhtot along the flow path head losses occur at four different locations as shown in fig 2 in scenario 3 hence δhtot δh 1 δh 2 δh 3 δh 4 linear head losses δh 1 are noted along the sewer pipe due to friction and head losses δh 2 occur due to flow division and expansion of the cross section at the junction where the sewer pipe meets the manhole additional energy is dissipated as the water flows upward through the manhole with frictional linear head losses δh 3 and finally head losses δh 4 occur as the water exits the manhole to the street head losses between the sewer pipe and the surface flow can therefore be described by idelchik 2007 bazin et al 2014 5 h 3 h s f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 δ h 1 k 2 q 3 2 2 g a p 2 δ h 2 f m z crest d p d m q e 2 2 g a m 2 δ h 3 k 4 α 4 2 q e 2 2 g a m 2 δ h 4 where f is a friction coefficient denoted as fp 3 and fm for the upstream sewer pipe and the manhole respectively the friction coefficient f is estimated with the formula of barr machiels et al 2011 as a function of the roughness height ks which is considered equal to 0 0005 mm both for the sewer pipe and the manhole based on a previous calibration performed by beg et al 2020 in eq 5 the parameter α 4 is the ratio of flow velocity exiting the manhole to the flow velocity inside the manhole with α 4 2 being equal to 0 95 idelchik 2007 while the coefficient k 4 is associated with local head losses at the exit of the manhole and is considered equal to 1 idelchik 2007 hence the only remaining parameter to be determined in eq 5 is the coefficient k 2 associated with head losses due to expansion of the flow from the sewer pipe to the manhole this parameter is likely to require calibration because the available values in the literature either correspond to ratios am ap of less than one e g in idelchik 2007 or to pipes of equal cross sectional area e g in hager 2010 while in this case the am ap ratio is greater than ten as a result the available values may not be applicable 3 5 1 1 calibration procedure by rearranging eq 5 with the standard values of parameters k 4 and α4 the numerical value of k 2 can be computed as 6 k 2 2 g a p 2 q 3 2 h 3 h s f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 f m z crest d p d m q e 2 2 g a m 2 k 4 α 4 2 q e 2 2 g a m 2 where all quantities in the right hand side of eq 6 can be evaluated from experimental steady flow observations of q 3 q 1 hs hp 3 and qe note that the total head hs in the floodplain is measured upstream and not downstream of the manhole as a result potential head changes of the surface flow due to the interaction of floodplain flow with the surcharging jet are ignored however these head changes are negligible because the floodplain is very wide and hence the overall difference in surface flow depth and velocity upstream and downstream of the manhole is negligible rubinato et al 2018b when plotting the values of k 2 from eq 6 as a function of the portion of the pipe inflow discharge being exchanged with the surface qe q 3 it appears that the parameter k 2 varies almost linearly with qe q 3 section4 1 1 therefore we consider the following linear function to parameterize k 2 7 k 2 α q e q 3 β where parameters α and β need to be calibrated with experimental data as shown in section4 1 1 3 5 1 2 applying the quasi steady model to classify the different flow scenarios e g the transition point between non surcharging and surcharging flows δh 0 see section3 2 is first needed in scenarios 1 and 2 there is no upward flow in the manhole and hence no head losses due to qe by substituting qe 0 in eqs 5 and 7 it follows that the head loss δh 0 introduced in section3 2 may be evaluated by 8 δ h 0 β f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 to classify scenarios 2 and 3 transition to surcharging flows hm is compared to hs with hm taken equal to h 3 δh 0 in this form if h m is lower than hs then there is no surcharge and no upward flow in the manhole while if h m is greater than hs then upward surcharging flow occurs in the latter case the total head in the manhole hm should then be approximated by h 3 δh tot which is smaller than h 3 δh 0 because of the inclusion of additional positive parameters in the head losses eq 5 after the calibration of the parameter k 2 the exchange discharge qe in surcharging flow conditions scenario 3 can be estimated with eq 5 through an iterative process by testing values of qe until the two sides of the equation converge the needed input parameters are the flow discharge and pressure in the upstream sewer pipe the flow discharge at the floodplain and the geometric characteristics of the drainage system and the floodplain 3 5 2 dynamic model similarly to rubinato et al 2017 the dynamic model for surcharging sewer uses simply an orifice equation to estimate the surcharging discharge nevertheless in this case the head in the equation is taken here equal to the water depth in the manhole hm 9 q e c 3 a m 2 g h m h s in this case to determine qe the discharge q 4 is first needed to compute the water depth in the manhole with eq 2 subsequently the computed water depth can be used for the estimation of the exchange discharge with eq 9 in the dynamic model the discharge q 4 is estimated by applying the bernoulli equation between the top of the surcharging manhole jet and the position of the pressure sensor in the downstream sewer pipe fig 1 where a head h 4 boundary condition is set local head losses between the manhole jet and h 4 are expressed similarly to the quasi steady model to simplify the computations the head losses in the manhole i e δh 3 and δh 4 in eq 5 are omitted because they are considered negligible as shown by the results of the quasi steady model section 4 1 1 hence the bernoulli equation between the water surface in the manhole and a point in the downstream sewer pipe that is located at a distance l 4 from the downstream edge of the manhole takes into account local contraction losses as the flow exits the manhole as well as frictional losses in the pipe assuming the losses from the contraction form a similar relationship with the flow partition as in eq 7 the bernoulli equation with the aid of eq 1 can be written as 10 h m h 4 α q 3 q 4 q 4 β f p 4 l 4 d p q 4 2 2 g a p 2 where fp 4 is the friction coefficient for flow in the downstream sewer pipe 3 5 2 1 calibration procedure based on observed data of steady surcharging flow parameters α and β in eq 10 may be determined by a linear regression with q 3 q 4 q 4 being the independent variable however this requires the prior knowledge of hm this is attained by applying the bernoulli equation between the location of the pressure transducer in the sewer pipe upstream of the manhole and the top of the surcharging manhole jet as follows 11 h 3 h m f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 k 2 q 3 2 2 g a p 2 this equation has a similar structure to eq 5 but the head losses in the manhole and in the overflow are considered negligible similar to eq 10 while the coefficient k 2 differs from k 2 of eq 5 because of the utilization of hm the combination of eqs 9 and 11 along with the division of both sides of the resulting equation with the velocity head in the upstream sewer pipe and the relationship q 3 q 4 qe in steady surcharging flow conditions lead to the following non dimensional equation 12 h 3 h s 2 g a p 2 q 3 2 f p 3 l 3 d p a p 2 a m 2 c 3 2 q 3 q 4 q 3 2 k 2 based on observed data of steady surcharging flow the discharge coefficient c 3 can now be estimated with polynomial regression analysis of eq 12 with q 3 q 4 q 3 being the independent variable the water depth hm in the manhole for steady flow conditions can be subsequently calculated with eq 9 or eq 11 and finally the parameters α and β in eq 10 can be estimated by linear regression 3 5 2 2 applying the dynamic model given knowledge of the discharge coefficient c 3 and the parameters α and β the exchange discharge qe and the discharge in the downstream sewer pipe q 4 for surcharging conditions can be estimated for each time step with eqs 9 and 10 respectively the water depth in the manhole is updated at each time step in unsteady flow conditions with eq 2 the data requirements of the dynamic model are the flow discharge and pressure in the upstream sewer pipe the pressure in the downstream sewer pipe the flow discharge at the floodplain and the geometric characteristics of the drainage system and the floodplain 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration of models with steady flow data for surcharging flow conditions 4 1 1 quasi steady model for each of the eight steady state surcharging flow tests conducted by rubinato et al 2017 the numerical value of k 2 was computed from the experimental observations using eq 6 when the values of k 2 are plotted against the observed ratios qe q 3 the data points follow a linear trend as demonstrated in fig 3 a this confirms the relevance of the parametrization proposed in eq 7 by applying linear regression the coefficients in eq 7 are evaluated as α 0 232 and β 1 009 fig 3a subsequently the computed total head losses from the sewer pipe to the surface as modelled based on the right hand side of eq 5 and with the aid of eq 7 are compared to the observed head difference h 3 h s as shown in fig 3b the computed values agree well with the measurements for the sake of comparison the total head losses were also computed by estimating the parameter k 2 with the formulae of idelchik 2007 and hager 2010 as described in the appendix both of these models underestimate the total head losses fig 3b the calibrated quasi steady model performs slightly better than the formula of idelchik 2007 and significantly better than the formula of hager 2010 although less accurate than the model calibrated here the formula of idelchik 2007 still provides a useful value of k 2 to estimate the total head loss in the absence of calibration data fig 4 shows the head losses that occur at each segment of the system for scenario 3 fig 2 the total head losses δhtot depend mostly on the head losses in the second section of the system δh 2 where the sewer pipe meets the manhole specifically for the eight steady flow experiments of rubinato et al 2017 with surcharging flow δh 2 constitutes more than 95 of the total head losses whereas δh 1 is less than 5 and δh 3 and δh 4 are approximately 0 01 and 0 1 respectively due to the small contribution of δh 4 to the total head loss the latter is not particularly sensitive to parameters k 4 and α4 which justifies the use of standard values 4 1 2 dynamic model based on the measurements of rubinato et al 2017 for steady surcharging flow the observed values of the left hand side of eq 12 can be plotted as a function of the measured values of q 3 q 4 q 3 as shown in fig 5 a a linear regression with q 3 q 4 q 3 2 being the independent variable leads to ap 2 c 3 am 2 0 340 from which it can be deduced that the discharge coefficient c 3 for the dynamic model is equal to 0 168 the discharge coefficient that was generated with this method is remarkably similar to that estimated by rubinato et al 2017 table 1 despite the fact that the two methods have notable differences it should be noted that in eq 12 k 2 was considered to be independent of q 3 q 4 q 3 because otherwise a linear dependency would lead to an unrealistic value of c 3 subsequently hm is calculated from eq 9 which allows the application of linear regression in eq 10 for the determination of parameters α and β fig 5b shows that the linear regression fits the data well with α 1 660 and β 0 496 alternatively in the case of eq 11 being used for the calculation of hm the parameters α and β differ by less than 1 the resulting modelled exchange discharges q e by the quasi steady and the dynamic models agree well with the experimental data of rubinato et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 the results are also compared to the results obtained with the orifice equation calibrated experimentally by rubinato et al 2017 the perfect agreement of the dynamic model is owed to the fact that hm was calculated with eq 9 during the calibration process however for the validation with unsteady flow conditions hm will be calculated with eq 2 rubinato et al 2017 estimated expected values and upper and lower values of the exchange discharge based on an error parameter associated with the instrumentation error our models are compared to the expected values of rubinato et al 2017 which overestimate the exchange discharge by approximately 2 5 l s fig 6 this bias corresponds to the intercept visible in fig 8 in rubinato et al 2017 which is indeed of the order of 2 5 l s 4 2 validation of models with unsteady flow data fig 7 presents a comparison of the results of the new quasi steady and dynamic models to the experimental observations and the computations presented in rubinato et al 2017 for the nine unsteady experiments reported by rubinato et al 2017 the numerical results of rubinato et al 2017 displayed in this figure were obtained by using the values of the discharge coefficients c 1 c 2 and c 3 calibrated with steady flow experiments expected values in table 3 of rubinato et al 2017 and the observed values of hp 3 while hs was calculated with the equation of manning the evolution of the depth hm in the manhole is computed only by the dynamic model left column in fig 7 in all cases the dynamic model exhibits a better agreement with the measured data compared to the quasi steady model and to the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 table 2 both at the rising and the falling limbs of the hydrographs right column in fig 7 the quasi steady model performs generally better than the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 which overestimates the exchange discharge this is consistent with the overestimation of the exchange discharge by the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 when there is surcharge under steady flow conditions as highlighted in fig 6 the flow in the drainage system is mostly classified as scenarios 1 and 3 fig 2 with scenario 2 occurring only for brief transitional periods of time fig 7 and table 2 while the transition between scenarios 1 and 2 is smooth the transition between scenarios 2 and 3 can be abrupt as shown by the dynamic model in fig 7 although the raw pressure input data measurements in the sewer pipes were filtered to smoothen the time series the dynamic model is still sensitive to the unsteadiness of the flow which leads to rapid fluctuations between scenarios 3 and 2 i e manhole surcharge or drainage this sensitivity is particularly evident in tests 1 4 and 7 where the peaks of the hydrographs are the lowest and the quasi steady and dynamic models particularly the former are not always able to classify correctly when the flow enters scenario 3 in which q 3 q 4 0 table 2 for the computations performed with the quasi steady model and by rubinato et al 2017 the calculated exchange discharge qe is considered equal to the value of q 3 q 4 according to eq 1 in contrast in reality the exchange discharge qe differs from the value of q 3 q 4 during transient phases as a result of variations in the storage in the manhole as expressed by eq 2 here the experimental dataset reports only q 3 q 4 due to the infeasibility of measuring continuously the evolution of qe in the laboratory setup rubinato 2015 only the dynamic model gives access to both qe and q 3 q 4 as these quantities are computed separately by this model fig 8 shows a comparison between these two discharges obtained from the dynamic model from which significant overlap can be observed for the largest part of the hydrograph aside from at the start and the end of the unsteady sections at the end of the unsteady section of the hydrograph the suction that is observed in the manhole as the water depth decreases in the transition from scenario 2 submerged weir to scenario 1 free weir is only partially captured by the q 3 q 4 results this is due to the transient nature of the dynamic model and its ability to represent the evolution of storage in the manhole the abrupt changes between scenarios 2 and 3 are also evident in the hydrographs of qe where the exchange discharge fluctuates between positive and negative values before it stabilizes these abrupt transitions in the exchange discharge correspond to the white areas between scenarios 2 and 3 in fig 7 left column despite this sensitivity in the computation of the exchange discharge the dynamic model results of q 3 q 4 agree well with the experimental data a quantitative evaluation of the unsteady modelling results for the discharge in the manhole is provided in table 2 which shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient between the results of each model and the corresponding measurements for the unsteady part of each hydrograph the nse coefficient is consistently higher for the dynamic model followed by the quasi steady model the performance of both models improves as the surcharge becomes more intense while the difference between the two models is the lowest for tests 3 5 6 8 and 9 which are cases with high hydrograph peaks and longest duration of the unsteady section fig 7 the modelled and measured net water volumes that are exchanged between the sewer and the floodplain are compared in fig 9 a very good agreement is obtained for the dynamic model in some cases e g tests1 and2 the quasi steady model seems to predict the exchanged volume as well as the dynamic model despite the fact that the overall evolution of the exchange discharge is less accurate than the dynamic model fig 7 in reality the dynamic model is more reliable since it captures better the governing physics nonetheless considering that the quasi steady model exhibits a good agreement with the experiments in cases where the flow unsteady hydrograph is long and the suction effect becomes small it can be inferred that this model remains also valuable especially given the fact that it does not require a downstream boundary condition when compared to the dynamic model 5 concluding remarks in light of climate change and with the anticipation of an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events the accurate design of drainage systems and accurate evaluation of flood risk is of paramount importance for the resilience of urban areas this study developed a quasi steady and a dynamic model for the determination of the exchange discharge between a sewer pipe and the surface floodplain through a manhole in a typical setup of an urban drainage system both models can be utilized for a complete unsteady hydrograph ranging from inflow from the floodplain into non surcharging sewer to overflow of the surcharging sewer when compared to the commonly utilized weir orifice approach to calculating exchange volumes nasello and tucciarelli 2005 seyoum et al 2012 the quasi steady model explicitly accounts for the head losses along the flow path from the sewer pipe to the surface and links the exchange flow to the total head in the sewer pipe minus the occurring head losses the dynamic model also takes into account the head losses but is also able to estimate the evolution of the water level in the manhole with the aid of one additional boundary condition at the downstream sewer pipe the models were calibrated with steady flow data from large scale experiments from rubinato et al 2017 and were validated against unsteady flow conditions in the same experimental setup both models exhibited good agreement with the experimental measurements with the dynamic model performing a little better with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for the unsteady section of each tested hydrograph ranging between 0 667 and 0 982 the dynamic model captured better the physics of the problem since it was able to reproduce to a certain degree the suction in the manhole that was observed at the falling limb of the hydrograph both models performed significantly better than the standard weir orifice formulations for exchange volume as evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 past work suggests lumping head losses into a single coefficient which has resulted in a wide range of calibrated discharge coefficients these existing methods may be sensitive to the choice of boundary condition measurement location as well as to the method of calculation of pipe surface hydraulic head rubinato et al 2018a the utilization of the models at larger geometrical scales can be facilitated by using non dimensional variables such as the froude number within the hypothetical surface and the reynolds numbers in the pipe and in the manhole the values of these non dimensional variables are provided in rubinato et al 2017 the hydraulic conditions replicated include fully turbulent pipe flows and subcritical flow conditions in reasonably flat floodplains a topic of further work would be to consider scale effects and transferability of energy loss parameters to full size systems as well as the transferability of the findings and parameter sensitivity to different flow conditions and geometrical configurations given an understanding of the relevant boundary conditions via measurements or hydrodynamic modelling the methodology of this study could be applied to systems with multiple interaction nodes and or with lids covering the manholes further experimental work could consider the calibration of energy loss parameters in such systems and sensitivity of flood modelling predictions to these parameters besides the development of the two models and the demonstration of their satisfactory predictive capabilities in unsteady flow conditions this study also suggests that the head losses that occur in the considered dual drainage system consist mostly of the head losses due to the flow expansion at the location where the sewer pipe meets the manhole frictional head losses in the sewer pipe are an order of magnitude smaller while the frictional head losses in the manhole and the head losses where the flow exits the manhole at the surface are negligible due to the significantly lower velocities involved therefore in order to produce more transferable standardized energy loss coefficients to describe flow exchange from sewer systems to surface flows it is suggested that future work focuses on measuring sub surface pipe exchange structure hydraulic losses in flood high flow conditions it is noted that an extensive body of work already exists on head losses through such structures in non surcharging flooding conditions e g marsalek 1985 pedersen and mark 1990 and the feasibility of data from these studies to provide initial estimates of energy losses for use in flood conditions could be investigated credit authorship contribution statement

4177,the accurate modelling of urban flooding constitutes an integral part of flood risk assessment and management in residential and industrial areas interactions between drainage networks and surface runoff flows are commonly modelled based on weir orifice equations however this approach has not been satisfactorily validated in unsteady flow conditions due to uncertainties in estimating the discharge coefficients and associated head losses this study utilises experimental data of flow exchange between the sewer flow and the floodplain through a manhole without a lid to develop two alternate approaches that simulate this interaction and describe the associated exchange flow a quasi steady model links the exchange flow to the total head in the sewer pipe and the head losses in the sewer and the manhole whilst a dynamic model takes also into account the evolution of the water level within the manhole at discrete time steps the developed numerical models are subsequently validated against large scale experimental data for unsteady sewer flow conditions featuring variable exchange to the surface results confirmed that both models can accurately replicate experimental conditions with improved performance when compared to existing methodologies based only on weir or orifice equations keywords sewer surface flow interactions urban flood modelling drainage systems head losses unsteady flow urban hydraulics 1 introduction urban flooding events tend to become more frequent due to the increase of urbanization and changes in rainfall patterns linked with climate change an accurate quantification of flood risk is important for assessing relative vulnerability under given and predicted rainfall events in order to develop cost effective asset investments and flood mitigation approaches in urban areas hydrodynamics associated with flood events is particularly complex because such events commonly include interactions between surface flows runoff and flows within urban drainage networks schmitt et al 2004 rubinato et al 2019 the risk of flooding is commonly evaluated using hydraulic modelling tools which utilize a number of empirical and semi empirical relationships and associated parameters to simulate processes such as runoff and frictional turbulent energy losses including relationships to describe interactions between surface flows and drainage networks djordjević et al 2005 leandro et al 2009 seyoum et al 2012 however despite recent advances in remote sensing and open access data moy de vitry et al 2017 moy de vitry and leitão 2020 there is a general paucity of high resolution datasets for flood model validation tscheikner gratl et al 2016 typical datasets consisting of point depth of flow observations during flood events are insufficient to fully overcome parameter non identifiability equifinality issues in complex flood models or provide a detailed evaluation of modelling representations for individual model components such as above below ground flow exchange beven 2006 dottori et al 2013 arrault et al 2016 datasets collected during detailed controlled laboratory studies can be used to validate hydraulic models martins et al 2017 martins et al 2018 and or provide an improved understanding of physical processes and flood model parameters such as energy loss coefficients hare 1983 however transferring findings from scaled laboratory studies into practice can be challenging for example due to its significance in urban flood modelling a number of experimental studies have investigated common representations of flow exchange between surface flows and urban drainage networks through hydraulic structures such as manholes and gullies flow exchange through such structures can be bi directional net exchange to the surface or the drainage network and hydraulic conditions associated with these situations are generally unsteady and highly three dimensional lopes et al 2015 beg et al 2018 within network scale urban flood models such interactions are commonly represented by simple weir orifice equations with net flows given as a function of hydraulic pressure head difference between surface flow and the drainage network the geometrical properties of the structure and an energy loss term nasello and tucciarelli 2005 chen et al 2007 seyoum et al 2012 to evaluate this approach some studies have calibrated validated urban drainage flood models based on physical models of urban catchments with multiple exchange structures bazin et al 2014 fraga et al 2015 noh et al 2016 dong et al 2021 whilst other work has directly measured flow rates through individual interaction structures allowing a direct comparison between exchange equations and measurements for example rubinato et al 2017 conducted a detailed experimental study of the weir and orifice equations representation of exchange flows through a scaled open manhole in both drainage and surcharging conditions in steady flow conditions with subcritical surface flows discharge coefficients were calibrated based on flow pressure and depth measurements in the pipe network and on the surface and found to be constant over the range of tested flow conditions however calculated coefficients were sensitive to flow depth pressure values used within the calibration which may in practice be calculated with different methods and vary over the longitudinal profile of the hydraulic structure in addition when calibrated relationships were used to validate a numerical model against a range of unsteady flow events meaningful differences were observed between predicted and observed exchange volumes several other laboratory studies have been conducted to calibrate weir orifice equations for a range of grate types and steady flow conditions martins et al 2014 focused on drainage flows into a gully pot while gómez et al 2019 and rubinato et al 2018a investigated drainage flows though different grate types and kemper and schlenkhoff 2019 analyzed supercritical flows over road drainage grates all these studies have provided a wide range of recommended discharge coefficients likely due to the sensitivity of energy loss processes to the geometry of different structures but also potentially due to methodological differences in the definition of surface and drainage system hydraulic head e g measurement location how geometrical properties are defined e g calculation of grate void spaces or the wetted perimeter and how partially fully submerged grate manhole openings are considered hence the accurate representation of flood inundation processes in urban areas may require site specific calibration of discharge coefficients dong et al 2021 which is unfeasible in most practical applications based on the studies described above a number of issues concerning the suitability of weir orifice type methodologies to describe above below ground flow interaction can be identified as follows 1 outstanding uncertainty regarding the discharge coefficient which past work has shown to differ significantly from common standard values for classical weirs orifices and thus requires site specific calibration or experimental numerical studies for accurate identification martins et al 2014 gómez et al 2019 2 lack of understanding of the hydraulically effective area of a drainage inlet during shallow flows and how this changes with flow depth and or velocity martins et al 2018 3 the sensitivity of the calculated exchange discharge and or discharge coefficient to the measurement of hydraulic head bazin et al 2014 rubinato et al 2018b which can vary significantly within and across hydraulic structures marsalek 1985 4 a lack of successful validation of the approach in unsteady flow exchange conditions through individual structures rubinato et al 2017 flows which surcharge from or enter into drainage systems may also be considered as diverging or converging junction flows respectively both of which have been extensively studied on a fundamental level mcnown 1954 graber 2010 although commonly in pipe diameters much smaller than those found in drainage networks bazin et al 2014 separated the path of surcharging or drainage pipe flow into successive sections corresponding each to a specific head loss linear head loss in the pipe head loss at a division or a junction or head loss between the surface and the sewer grate it is also possible to conceptualize an interaction node such as a manhole as a storage element with levels that rise and fall depending on net inflows and outflows through a time varying event hence by utilizing more universal concepts associated with energy losses in diverging and converging flows more generally applicable methodologies may be determined this paper develops and presents two analytical modelling approaches to represent exchange flows between piped drainage and surface flows via exchange structures such as manholes and gullies a number of experimental datasets described in rubinato et al 2017 are used to calibrate the models in steady flow conditions and validate the models using a series of unsteady flow events the models performance is compared to both experimental data as well the widely used weir orifice based approaches that represent the current state of the art 2 data from large scale laboratory experiments the experiments were conducted within a facility constructed from pvc in the water laboratory of the civil and structural engineering department at the university of sheffield rubinato 2015 this experimental facility consists of a sewer pipe system with no slope that is linked via a manhole to a hypothetical urban floodplain characterized by a slope of 0 001 fig 1 provides a schematic diagram of the experimental setup the sewer system was constructed based on a 1 6 geometrical scale of a typical uk urban drainage system while the urban floodplain is 4 m wide and 8 m long and it is 0 478 m above the invert level of the pipe this height is denoted as zcrest the internal diameter of the manhole dm is equal to 240 mm while the internal diameter of the sewer pipe dp is equal to 75 mm both upstream and downstream of the manhole in the following the cross section of the manhole and of the sewer pipe are denoted as am and ap respectively flow discharges were measured with electromagnetic flowmeters in the floodplain upstream q 1 and downstream q 2 of the manhole and in the sewer pipes also upstream q 3 and downstream q 4 of the manhole qe denotes the exchange flow between the top of the manhole and the surface flow in the laboratory experiments qe was not measured directly but for steady state flow conditions it can be estimated from the difference between q 3 and q 4 which were both measured pressure sensors provided the pressure head in the floodplain upstream of the manhole hp1 and in the sewer pipes upstream hp3 and downstream hp4 of the manhole the pressure heads in pipes with unsteady flow were smoothened in this study by using the median value of five to eight seconds depending on the case the horizontal distances of the pressure sensors from the nearest edge of the manhole were l1 340 mm for the pressure sensor in the floodplain and l3 230 mm and l4 400 mm for the pressure sensors in the sewer pipes upstream and downstream of the manhole respectively fig 1 more details about the experimental facility the instrumentation and the test program are provided in rubinato 2015 and rubinato et al 2017 rubinato et al 2017 analyzed both steady and unsteady flow cases and their extensive dataset is reanalyzed in the present study this dataset is the only currently openly available dataset on unsteady flow through an individual drainage exchange structure the only additional data that are analyzed herein and were not presented in rubinato et al 2017 are the pressure head data hp4 in the downstream sewer pipe rubinato 2015 from the steady state tests 15 cases with the non surcharging sewer scenario 1 in fig 2 and eight cases with the surcharging sewer scenario 3 in fig 2 condition are considered here for the nine unsteady flow tests the flow on the floodplain was maintained constant at 8 15 l s while a flood hydrograph was run through the sewer pipe replicating surface to sewer and sewer to surface flow exchange conditions during each unsteady test during the experiments discharge and pressure measurements were recorded every dt 0 05 s for steady flow experiments the flow depth at the surface was measured at the location of the pressure sensor fig 1 while for the unsteady flow experiments the flow depth was estimated from the equation of manning with a manning roughness coefficient equal to 0 009 from prior calibration similar to an approach adopted in rubinato et al 2017 3 methods the modelling methodologies analysed here aim at computing the exchange discharge qe between a manhole and the surface during an unsteady event in a dual drainage system the exchange discharge qe is defined positive when the exchange flow goes towards the floodplain surcharging sewer the two models that are presented in this section are referred to as quasi steady model and dynamic model respectively in our quasi steady model we follow a similar approach as rubinato et al 2017 which regards the pipe manhole system as a flow junction qe 0 or bifurcation qe 0 nonetheless compared to the weir orifice flow exchange approach evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 we claim that our quasi steady model introduces more physics in the calculation of qe firstly we link the exchange flow discharge to the total head in the upstream pipe while rubinato et al 2017 considered only the pressure head secondly for the case of surcharging flow from the manhole to the floodplain we account explicitly for four different contributions to the overall head losses between the pipe and the surface similar to bazin et al 2014 for flow exchange between a street and an underground drainage pipe subsequently we utilise the bernoulli equation to describe the flow exchange whereas the approach tested in rubinato et al 2017 lumped the influence of all head losses into a single calibrated orifice equation discharge coefficient this is detailed in section3 5 in our new dynamic model we additionally take into account the evolution with time of the water level hm in the manhole during an unsteady flow event this evolution cannot be expressed in quasi steady models and it provides a better representation of transient effects in the computation of the exchange discharge qe because the storage capacity in the manhole is accounted for explicitly calibration of the models was performed in steady flow conditions due to the ability to directly measure the flow rate and hence identify the energy loss parameters without the need for more complex model calibration methodologies e g noh et al 2016 model validation or evaluation is commonly undertaken after model calibration as a method of determining the ability of the model to replicate observed parameters without further modifications from the user mcmillan et al 2016 to quantify any resulting uncertainties when simulating dynamic events in this study validation was performed in unsteady flow conditions the models are presented analytically in the following subsections 3 1 flow scenarios the model evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 as well as the two models presented here share the same typology of flow scenarios but some refinements are introduced here for this purpose we define notation hm to refer to the flow head at the interaction node manhole which may be approximated using different methods for the different models the reference datum is the sewer pipe invert fig 1 three different flow scenarios may occur fig 2 depending on the value of the head hm in the manhole with respect to the elevation of the floodplain zcrest and the head of the flow in the floodplain hs which is equal to q 1 w hs 2 2 g zcrest hs where w and hs are the width of and the flow depth in the floodplain respectively scenario 1 free weir flow from the floodplain to the manhole qe 0 if the head in the manhole is lower than the level of the floodplain hm zcrest scenario 2 submerged weir or orifice flow from the floodplain to the manhole qe 0 if the head in the manhole is higher than the level of the floodplain but lower than the head of the surface flow zcrest hm hs scenario 3 overflow from surcharging sewer to the floodplain qe 0 if the head in the manhole is greater than the head of the surface flow hm hs 3 2 approximation of head within the manhole pipe network based on the different models the models presented herein and the models evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 differ in the level of detail in which they define and estimate for different flow conditions the total head of the flow in the manhole and hence the head of the sewer network flow at the point it interacts with the surface flow rubinato et al 2017 calibrated the orifice flow exchange equation based on the pressure head hp 3 at the location of the pressure sensor in the upstream pipe in the quasi steady model we approximate hm by h 3 δhtot with h 3 q 3 ap 2 2 g hp 3 the total head at the pressure sensor in the upstream pipe and δhtot the total head losses between the location of this pressure sensor and the point of flow interaction fig 2 see details in section3 5 1 for non surcharging conditions head losses due to qe do not occur as there is no upward flow in the manhole and the total head losses δhtot are noted as δh0 in the dynamic model hm is simply taken equal to the water depth hm in the manhole assuming the velocity head in the manhole is negligible note that the variable hm is not considered in the other two models 3 3 mass balance in the manhole like in a pipe junction or bifurcation the mass balance in the quasi steady model can be written as 1 q 4 q 3 q e where the upstream discharge q 3 in the pipe is a prescribed boundary condition and the exchange discharge qe is predicted by the model therefore the discharge q 4 in the downstream pipe can be determined directly from eq 1 unlike the quasi steady model the dynamic model considers the manhole as a tank in which the volume of water varies in time with the contributing discharges according to 2 a m d h m dt q 3 q e q 4 like in the quasi steady model the upstream pipe discharge q 3 is a prescribed boundary condition and the exchange discharge qe is estimated by the model however eq 2 is now necessary to update the value of hm for the subsequent time step therefore in the dynamic model the discharge q 4 in the downstream pipe needs to be computed separately this step is further described in section3 5 2 in steady flow conditions the mass balance in eq 2 reduces to eq 1 as in the quasi steady model 3 4 non surcharging sewer surface to sewer exchange for non surcharging flow conditions qe 0 the quasi steady and the dynamic model have similar exchange equations with the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 with the only difference being the utilization of the total head in the surface flow instead of just using the flow depth in scenario1 hm zcrest a weir equation is used to describe free flow from the floodplain to the manhole 3 q e 2 3 c 1 π d m 2 g h s z crest 3 with c 1 a discharge coefficient to be calibrated in scenario2 zcrest hm hs a submerged weir equation is used when hs zcrest am π dm 4 q e c 2 π d m h s z crest 2 g h s h m where c 2 is also a discharge coefficient whose value needs to be determined when hs zcrest am π dm a submerged orifice equation may be used rubinato et al 2017 however this threshold is not exceeded in our study rubinato et al 2017 used experimental observations in steady conditions to calibrate parameters c 1 and c 2 here we recalibrated the value of c 1 with the same data as rubinato et al 2017 for scenario 1 see the expected values in fig 6 in rubinato et al 2017 but with the surface flow head instead of the flow depth eq 3 the calibration performed by rubinato et al 2017 for parameter c 2 involved less data points and led to discontinuities in the computed exchange flow discharge at the transition between scenarios 1 and 2 see figure 10 in rubinato et al 2017 therefore in the models introduced here we simply set c 2 2 3 c 1 which ensures continuity between the exchange discharges computed by eqs 3 and 4 when hm zcrest compared to the strategy followed by rubinato et al 2017 the continuity between scenarios 1 and 2 is ensured here at the expense of an accurate agreement with calibration data for scenario2 but the number of available experimental data for scenario 2 is limited and this scenario occurs in practice only for a very short period of time during unsteady flow events at the onset and at the end of surcharging flow rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph therefore the impact of this choice on the overall accuracy of the computed exchange volume over a surcharging flow event is expected to be very small all calibration parameters are summarized in table 1 3 5 surcharging sewer 3 5 1 quasi steady model in the quasi steady model the overflow discharge from the surcharging manhole to the floodplain is computed from a bernoulli equation written between the upstream sewer pipe at the pressure sensor location and the surface flow and by taking into account the total head losses δhtot along the flow path head losses occur at four different locations as shown in fig 2 in scenario 3 hence δhtot δh 1 δh 2 δh 3 δh 4 linear head losses δh 1 are noted along the sewer pipe due to friction and head losses δh 2 occur due to flow division and expansion of the cross section at the junction where the sewer pipe meets the manhole additional energy is dissipated as the water flows upward through the manhole with frictional linear head losses δh 3 and finally head losses δh 4 occur as the water exits the manhole to the street head losses between the sewer pipe and the surface flow can therefore be described by idelchik 2007 bazin et al 2014 5 h 3 h s f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 δ h 1 k 2 q 3 2 2 g a p 2 δ h 2 f m z crest d p d m q e 2 2 g a m 2 δ h 3 k 4 α 4 2 q e 2 2 g a m 2 δ h 4 where f is a friction coefficient denoted as fp 3 and fm for the upstream sewer pipe and the manhole respectively the friction coefficient f is estimated with the formula of barr machiels et al 2011 as a function of the roughness height ks which is considered equal to 0 0005 mm both for the sewer pipe and the manhole based on a previous calibration performed by beg et al 2020 in eq 5 the parameter α 4 is the ratio of flow velocity exiting the manhole to the flow velocity inside the manhole with α 4 2 being equal to 0 95 idelchik 2007 while the coefficient k 4 is associated with local head losses at the exit of the manhole and is considered equal to 1 idelchik 2007 hence the only remaining parameter to be determined in eq 5 is the coefficient k 2 associated with head losses due to expansion of the flow from the sewer pipe to the manhole this parameter is likely to require calibration because the available values in the literature either correspond to ratios am ap of less than one e g in idelchik 2007 or to pipes of equal cross sectional area e g in hager 2010 while in this case the am ap ratio is greater than ten as a result the available values may not be applicable 3 5 1 1 calibration procedure by rearranging eq 5 with the standard values of parameters k 4 and α4 the numerical value of k 2 can be computed as 6 k 2 2 g a p 2 q 3 2 h 3 h s f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 f m z crest d p d m q e 2 2 g a m 2 k 4 α 4 2 q e 2 2 g a m 2 where all quantities in the right hand side of eq 6 can be evaluated from experimental steady flow observations of q 3 q 1 hs hp 3 and qe note that the total head hs in the floodplain is measured upstream and not downstream of the manhole as a result potential head changes of the surface flow due to the interaction of floodplain flow with the surcharging jet are ignored however these head changes are negligible because the floodplain is very wide and hence the overall difference in surface flow depth and velocity upstream and downstream of the manhole is negligible rubinato et al 2018b when plotting the values of k 2 from eq 6 as a function of the portion of the pipe inflow discharge being exchanged with the surface qe q 3 it appears that the parameter k 2 varies almost linearly with qe q 3 section4 1 1 therefore we consider the following linear function to parameterize k 2 7 k 2 α q e q 3 β where parameters α and β need to be calibrated with experimental data as shown in section4 1 1 3 5 1 2 applying the quasi steady model to classify the different flow scenarios e g the transition point between non surcharging and surcharging flows δh 0 see section3 2 is first needed in scenarios 1 and 2 there is no upward flow in the manhole and hence no head losses due to qe by substituting qe 0 in eqs 5 and 7 it follows that the head loss δh 0 introduced in section3 2 may be evaluated by 8 δ h 0 β f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 to classify scenarios 2 and 3 transition to surcharging flows hm is compared to hs with hm taken equal to h 3 δh 0 in this form if h m is lower than hs then there is no surcharge and no upward flow in the manhole while if h m is greater than hs then upward surcharging flow occurs in the latter case the total head in the manhole hm should then be approximated by h 3 δh tot which is smaller than h 3 δh 0 because of the inclusion of additional positive parameters in the head losses eq 5 after the calibration of the parameter k 2 the exchange discharge qe in surcharging flow conditions scenario 3 can be estimated with eq 5 through an iterative process by testing values of qe until the two sides of the equation converge the needed input parameters are the flow discharge and pressure in the upstream sewer pipe the flow discharge at the floodplain and the geometric characteristics of the drainage system and the floodplain 3 5 2 dynamic model similarly to rubinato et al 2017 the dynamic model for surcharging sewer uses simply an orifice equation to estimate the surcharging discharge nevertheless in this case the head in the equation is taken here equal to the water depth in the manhole hm 9 q e c 3 a m 2 g h m h s in this case to determine qe the discharge q 4 is first needed to compute the water depth in the manhole with eq 2 subsequently the computed water depth can be used for the estimation of the exchange discharge with eq 9 in the dynamic model the discharge q 4 is estimated by applying the bernoulli equation between the top of the surcharging manhole jet and the position of the pressure sensor in the downstream sewer pipe fig 1 where a head h 4 boundary condition is set local head losses between the manhole jet and h 4 are expressed similarly to the quasi steady model to simplify the computations the head losses in the manhole i e δh 3 and δh 4 in eq 5 are omitted because they are considered negligible as shown by the results of the quasi steady model section 4 1 1 hence the bernoulli equation between the water surface in the manhole and a point in the downstream sewer pipe that is located at a distance l 4 from the downstream edge of the manhole takes into account local contraction losses as the flow exits the manhole as well as frictional losses in the pipe assuming the losses from the contraction form a similar relationship with the flow partition as in eq 7 the bernoulli equation with the aid of eq 1 can be written as 10 h m h 4 α q 3 q 4 q 4 β f p 4 l 4 d p q 4 2 2 g a p 2 where fp 4 is the friction coefficient for flow in the downstream sewer pipe 3 5 2 1 calibration procedure based on observed data of steady surcharging flow parameters α and β in eq 10 may be determined by a linear regression with q 3 q 4 q 4 being the independent variable however this requires the prior knowledge of hm this is attained by applying the bernoulli equation between the location of the pressure transducer in the sewer pipe upstream of the manhole and the top of the surcharging manhole jet as follows 11 h 3 h m f p 3 l 3 d p q 3 2 2 g a p 2 k 2 q 3 2 2 g a p 2 this equation has a similar structure to eq 5 but the head losses in the manhole and in the overflow are considered negligible similar to eq 10 while the coefficient k 2 differs from k 2 of eq 5 because of the utilization of hm the combination of eqs 9 and 11 along with the division of both sides of the resulting equation with the velocity head in the upstream sewer pipe and the relationship q 3 q 4 qe in steady surcharging flow conditions lead to the following non dimensional equation 12 h 3 h s 2 g a p 2 q 3 2 f p 3 l 3 d p a p 2 a m 2 c 3 2 q 3 q 4 q 3 2 k 2 based on observed data of steady surcharging flow the discharge coefficient c 3 can now be estimated with polynomial regression analysis of eq 12 with q 3 q 4 q 3 being the independent variable the water depth hm in the manhole for steady flow conditions can be subsequently calculated with eq 9 or eq 11 and finally the parameters α and β in eq 10 can be estimated by linear regression 3 5 2 2 applying the dynamic model given knowledge of the discharge coefficient c 3 and the parameters α and β the exchange discharge qe and the discharge in the downstream sewer pipe q 4 for surcharging conditions can be estimated for each time step with eqs 9 and 10 respectively the water depth in the manhole is updated at each time step in unsteady flow conditions with eq 2 the data requirements of the dynamic model are the flow discharge and pressure in the upstream sewer pipe the pressure in the downstream sewer pipe the flow discharge at the floodplain and the geometric characteristics of the drainage system and the floodplain 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration of models with steady flow data for surcharging flow conditions 4 1 1 quasi steady model for each of the eight steady state surcharging flow tests conducted by rubinato et al 2017 the numerical value of k 2 was computed from the experimental observations using eq 6 when the values of k 2 are plotted against the observed ratios qe q 3 the data points follow a linear trend as demonstrated in fig 3 a this confirms the relevance of the parametrization proposed in eq 7 by applying linear regression the coefficients in eq 7 are evaluated as α 0 232 and β 1 009 fig 3a subsequently the computed total head losses from the sewer pipe to the surface as modelled based on the right hand side of eq 5 and with the aid of eq 7 are compared to the observed head difference h 3 h s as shown in fig 3b the computed values agree well with the measurements for the sake of comparison the total head losses were also computed by estimating the parameter k 2 with the formulae of idelchik 2007 and hager 2010 as described in the appendix both of these models underestimate the total head losses fig 3b the calibrated quasi steady model performs slightly better than the formula of idelchik 2007 and significantly better than the formula of hager 2010 although less accurate than the model calibrated here the formula of idelchik 2007 still provides a useful value of k 2 to estimate the total head loss in the absence of calibration data fig 4 shows the head losses that occur at each segment of the system for scenario 3 fig 2 the total head losses δhtot depend mostly on the head losses in the second section of the system δh 2 where the sewer pipe meets the manhole specifically for the eight steady flow experiments of rubinato et al 2017 with surcharging flow δh 2 constitutes more than 95 of the total head losses whereas δh 1 is less than 5 and δh 3 and δh 4 are approximately 0 01 and 0 1 respectively due to the small contribution of δh 4 to the total head loss the latter is not particularly sensitive to parameters k 4 and α4 which justifies the use of standard values 4 1 2 dynamic model based on the measurements of rubinato et al 2017 for steady surcharging flow the observed values of the left hand side of eq 12 can be plotted as a function of the measured values of q 3 q 4 q 3 as shown in fig 5 a a linear regression with q 3 q 4 q 3 2 being the independent variable leads to ap 2 c 3 am 2 0 340 from which it can be deduced that the discharge coefficient c 3 for the dynamic model is equal to 0 168 the discharge coefficient that was generated with this method is remarkably similar to that estimated by rubinato et al 2017 table 1 despite the fact that the two methods have notable differences it should be noted that in eq 12 k 2 was considered to be independent of q 3 q 4 q 3 because otherwise a linear dependency would lead to an unrealistic value of c 3 subsequently hm is calculated from eq 9 which allows the application of linear regression in eq 10 for the determination of parameters α and β fig 5b shows that the linear regression fits the data well with α 1 660 and β 0 496 alternatively in the case of eq 11 being used for the calculation of hm the parameters α and β differ by less than 1 the resulting modelled exchange discharges q e by the quasi steady and the dynamic models agree well with the experimental data of rubinato et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 the results are also compared to the results obtained with the orifice equation calibrated experimentally by rubinato et al 2017 the perfect agreement of the dynamic model is owed to the fact that hm was calculated with eq 9 during the calibration process however for the validation with unsteady flow conditions hm will be calculated with eq 2 rubinato et al 2017 estimated expected values and upper and lower values of the exchange discharge based on an error parameter associated with the instrumentation error our models are compared to the expected values of rubinato et al 2017 which overestimate the exchange discharge by approximately 2 5 l s fig 6 this bias corresponds to the intercept visible in fig 8 in rubinato et al 2017 which is indeed of the order of 2 5 l s 4 2 validation of models with unsteady flow data fig 7 presents a comparison of the results of the new quasi steady and dynamic models to the experimental observations and the computations presented in rubinato et al 2017 for the nine unsteady experiments reported by rubinato et al 2017 the numerical results of rubinato et al 2017 displayed in this figure were obtained by using the values of the discharge coefficients c 1 c 2 and c 3 calibrated with steady flow experiments expected values in table 3 of rubinato et al 2017 and the observed values of hp 3 while hs was calculated with the equation of manning the evolution of the depth hm in the manhole is computed only by the dynamic model left column in fig 7 in all cases the dynamic model exhibits a better agreement with the measured data compared to the quasi steady model and to the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 table 2 both at the rising and the falling limbs of the hydrographs right column in fig 7 the quasi steady model performs generally better than the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 which overestimates the exchange discharge this is consistent with the overestimation of the exchange discharge by the model tested in rubinato et al 2017 when there is surcharge under steady flow conditions as highlighted in fig 6 the flow in the drainage system is mostly classified as scenarios 1 and 3 fig 2 with scenario 2 occurring only for brief transitional periods of time fig 7 and table 2 while the transition between scenarios 1 and 2 is smooth the transition between scenarios 2 and 3 can be abrupt as shown by the dynamic model in fig 7 although the raw pressure input data measurements in the sewer pipes were filtered to smoothen the time series the dynamic model is still sensitive to the unsteadiness of the flow which leads to rapid fluctuations between scenarios 3 and 2 i e manhole surcharge or drainage this sensitivity is particularly evident in tests 1 4 and 7 where the peaks of the hydrographs are the lowest and the quasi steady and dynamic models particularly the former are not always able to classify correctly when the flow enters scenario 3 in which q 3 q 4 0 table 2 for the computations performed with the quasi steady model and by rubinato et al 2017 the calculated exchange discharge qe is considered equal to the value of q 3 q 4 according to eq 1 in contrast in reality the exchange discharge qe differs from the value of q 3 q 4 during transient phases as a result of variations in the storage in the manhole as expressed by eq 2 here the experimental dataset reports only q 3 q 4 due to the infeasibility of measuring continuously the evolution of qe in the laboratory setup rubinato 2015 only the dynamic model gives access to both qe and q 3 q 4 as these quantities are computed separately by this model fig 8 shows a comparison between these two discharges obtained from the dynamic model from which significant overlap can be observed for the largest part of the hydrograph aside from at the start and the end of the unsteady sections at the end of the unsteady section of the hydrograph the suction that is observed in the manhole as the water depth decreases in the transition from scenario 2 submerged weir to scenario 1 free weir is only partially captured by the q 3 q 4 results this is due to the transient nature of the dynamic model and its ability to represent the evolution of storage in the manhole the abrupt changes between scenarios 2 and 3 are also evident in the hydrographs of qe where the exchange discharge fluctuates between positive and negative values before it stabilizes these abrupt transitions in the exchange discharge correspond to the white areas between scenarios 2 and 3 in fig 7 left column despite this sensitivity in the computation of the exchange discharge the dynamic model results of q 3 q 4 agree well with the experimental data a quantitative evaluation of the unsteady modelling results for the discharge in the manhole is provided in table 2 which shows the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient between the results of each model and the corresponding measurements for the unsteady part of each hydrograph the nse coefficient is consistently higher for the dynamic model followed by the quasi steady model the performance of both models improves as the surcharge becomes more intense while the difference between the two models is the lowest for tests 3 5 6 8 and 9 which are cases with high hydrograph peaks and longest duration of the unsteady section fig 7 the modelled and measured net water volumes that are exchanged between the sewer and the floodplain are compared in fig 9 a very good agreement is obtained for the dynamic model in some cases e g tests1 and2 the quasi steady model seems to predict the exchanged volume as well as the dynamic model despite the fact that the overall evolution of the exchange discharge is less accurate than the dynamic model fig 7 in reality the dynamic model is more reliable since it captures better the governing physics nonetheless considering that the quasi steady model exhibits a good agreement with the experiments in cases where the flow unsteady hydrograph is long and the suction effect becomes small it can be inferred that this model remains also valuable especially given the fact that it does not require a downstream boundary condition when compared to the dynamic model 5 concluding remarks in light of climate change and with the anticipation of an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events the accurate design of drainage systems and accurate evaluation of flood risk is of paramount importance for the resilience of urban areas this study developed a quasi steady and a dynamic model for the determination of the exchange discharge between a sewer pipe and the surface floodplain through a manhole in a typical setup of an urban drainage system both models can be utilized for a complete unsteady hydrograph ranging from inflow from the floodplain into non surcharging sewer to overflow of the surcharging sewer when compared to the commonly utilized weir orifice approach to calculating exchange volumes nasello and tucciarelli 2005 seyoum et al 2012 the quasi steady model explicitly accounts for the head losses along the flow path from the sewer pipe to the surface and links the exchange flow to the total head in the sewer pipe minus the occurring head losses the dynamic model also takes into account the head losses but is also able to estimate the evolution of the water level in the manhole with the aid of one additional boundary condition at the downstream sewer pipe the models were calibrated with steady flow data from large scale experiments from rubinato et al 2017 and were validated against unsteady flow conditions in the same experimental setup both models exhibited good agreement with the experimental measurements with the dynamic model performing a little better with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for the unsteady section of each tested hydrograph ranging between 0 667 and 0 982 the dynamic model captured better the physics of the problem since it was able to reproduce to a certain degree the suction in the manhole that was observed at the falling limb of the hydrograph both models performed significantly better than the standard weir orifice formulations for exchange volume as evaluated in rubinato et al 2017 past work suggests lumping head losses into a single coefficient which has resulted in a wide range of calibrated discharge coefficients these existing methods may be sensitive to the choice of boundary condition measurement location as well as to the method of calculation of pipe surface hydraulic head rubinato et al 2018a the utilization of the models at larger geometrical scales can be facilitated by using non dimensional variables such as the froude number within the hypothetical surface and the reynolds numbers in the pipe and in the manhole the values of these non dimensional variables are provided in rubinato et al 2017 the hydraulic conditions replicated include fully turbulent pipe flows and subcritical flow conditions in reasonably flat floodplains a topic of further work would be to consider scale effects and transferability of energy loss parameters to full size systems as well as the transferability of the findings and parameter sensitivity to different flow conditions and geometrical configurations given an understanding of the relevant boundary conditions via measurements or hydrodynamic modelling the methodology of this study could be applied to systems with multiple interaction nodes and or with lids covering the manholes further experimental work could consider the calibration of energy loss parameters in such systems and sensitivity of flood modelling predictions to these parameters besides the development of the two models and the demonstration of their satisfactory predictive capabilities in unsteady flow conditions this study also suggests that the head losses that occur in the considered dual drainage system consist mostly of the head losses due to the flow expansion at the location where the sewer pipe meets the manhole frictional head losses in the sewer pipe are an order of magnitude smaller while the frictional head losses in the manhole and the head losses where the flow exits the manhole at the surface are negligible due to the significantly lower velocities involved therefore in order to produce more transferable standardized energy loss coefficients to describe flow exchange from sewer systems to surface flows it is suggested that future work focuses on measuring sub surface pipe exchange structure hydraulic losses in flood high flow conditions it is noted that an extensive body of work already exists on head losses through such structures in non surcharging flooding conditions e g marsalek 1985 pedersen and mark 1990 and the feasibility of data from these studies to provide initial estimates of energy losses for use in flood conditions could be investigated credit authorship contribution statement

diffusion bulk heat transfer 1 introduction net solar radiation at the land surface rn is partitioned into the latent e and sensible heat fluxes into the ground g and ambient air h understanding this partitioning is of paramount importance in studying the global energy water and carbon cycles wong et al 1979 schimel et al 1997 katul et al 2012 fisher et al 2017 and has motivated numerous studies in the past century wang and dickinson 2012 the bowen 1926 ratio method and the penman 1948 eddy diffusion energy balance combination approach are two classical examples these fluxes are measurable locally at field scales using ground based sensors the ground heat flux is often more readily measurable for example using heat flux plates mayocchi and bristow 1995 sauer et al 2007 while direct measurements of h and e are more challenging high precision weighing lysimeters are the most direct means to measure e but they are costly to build and operate howell et al 1991 moorhead et al 2019 the eddy covariance systems based on sonic anemometry are widely used to estimate h e as the covariance of air temperature specific humidity and vertical wind velocity swinbank 1951 baldocchi et al 2001 direct measurement of these surface fluxes is not feasible at large spatial scales where remote sensing offers a promising alternative fisher et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 remote sensing inference of these fluxes often relies on their physical connections with surface skin temperature which can be obtained from air or space borne observations of upwelling surface radiances in thermal infrared wavelengths prata et al 1995 jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 such an inference is often under constrained and thus requires additional information for example in addition to surface temperature remote sensing retrieval of h requires an estimate of air temperature wind velocity and bulk transfer coefficient of heat su 2002 jia et al 2003 to reduce the uncertainty of inference land surface energy balance equation and interrelations between its components provide additional information bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007 the motivation is that if at least two interrelations between fluxes are characterized accurately based on the remote sensing observations the surface energy balance equation can be solved with reduced uncertainty bowen 1926 was one of the first to study the h e physical connection based on an analogy between the diffusive transfer of heat and water vapor in the ambient air relying on more readily measurable variables such as air temperature and vapor pressure the bowen ratio β h e adds a constraint to the energy balance equation yet the problem of inferring surface fluxes remains ill posed with two equations and three unknowns wang and bras 2009 2011 demonstrated that g and h are strongly linked as the partition of net radiation based on the theory of maximum entropy production while a third relationship between g and h is highly desirable such a relationship is poorly understood due to the fundamental difference between the timescale of dominant transport mechanisms of heat in the atmosphere and soil in effect while temperature in soil depth changes diurnally turbulent transport mechanisms of heat in atmosphere operate in sub hourly scales this paper attempts to narrow down this knowledge gap here we propose a new relationship between g and h at the daily timescale this relationship is theoretically derived for bare soil and is evaluated for a variety of bare to vegetated sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 ground and sensible heat flux relationship conductive and advective flux of heat in unsaturated zone through molecular diffusion and laminar flow of liquid water may be expressed as sakai et al 2011 1 g c s k s t s z v w c w t s t rs in eq 1 and following equations the subscripts s a and w denote soil air and water respectively when the subscripts are dropped for brevity the corresponding variables can represent either soil or air media note that soil is here referred to the bulk soil including all its components particles and water in eq 1 g w m 2 is the ground heat flux at distance z m from the surface t k the temperature at z c j m 3 k 1 the heat capacity k m2 s 1 the thermal diffusivity ck λ w m 1 k 1 the thermal conductivity and v m s 1 the flow velocity note that ts trs is the temperature difference between the background soil and flowing water that drives the advective heat transfer in soil in contrast to soil heat in the atmospheric surface layer is transferred via turbulent flow according to the first order turbulence closure theory known as k theory turbulent sensible heat flux h w m 2 is expressed as stull 1988 2 h c a k a t a z where ka is the eddy diffusivity and other variables are the same as above but for air denoted by subscript a eddy diffusivity ka is often parameterized in terms of friction velocity u and a length scale linearly proportional to z through the von karman constant under neutral atmospheric condition and is substantially larger than the molecular diffusivity ks thus one can estimate daily 24 hour mean sensible heat flux as follows 3 h c a k a t a z c a k a t a z cov k a t a z where the overbar denotes the daily mean and cov the covariance using the laplace transformation of the diffusion equation in a semi infinite medium of soil or air the spatial gradient of temperature can be expressed in terms of the half order time derivative of temperature wang and bras 1998 1999 4 t z 1 π k 0 t dt z τ t τ where t is the time and τ is the integration variable eq 4 indicates that a time series of temperature at a single level z contains adequate information to estimate the vertical gradient of temperature at the same level the covariance term in eq 3 depends on sub daily fluctuations of the eddy diffusivity and temperature gradient k a k a t a z t a z through eq 4 connecting t a z to t a one can consider that the covariance term is proportional to k a k a t a t a a linear relationship between ka and u can be considered assuming that the structure of turbulence in the proximity of the surface is primarily governed by the shear production under varying thermal stability thus the above covariance term is proportional to u u t a t a assuming a reference air temperature tra corresponding to zero friction velocity u 0 the latter term can be further reduced to be proportional to u t a t ra that resembles the known bulk heat transfer approximation of the turbulent heat flux stull 1988 pp 262 therefore we suggest approximating eq 3 as follows 5 h c a k a t a z v a c a t a t ra where va is an air velocity term proportional to u which can be estimated directly from measured data see eq a23 in appendix a this representation suggests an analogy between the turbulent heat flow in air eq 5 and the conductive advective heat flow in soil at daily timescale eq 1 although va does not exist in the first order closure of reynolds decomposition of turbulence it manifests itself when the flux is averaged over longer than turbulence timescales the analogy between soil and air heat transfer in conjunction with the temperature continuity at the land surface connects daily h and g as follows see the derivation in appendix a 6 h i a i s g v a c a t rs t ra where i c k 0 5 j s 0 5 m 2 k 1 is the thermal inertia note that h in eq 6 stands for the daily averaged sensible heat flux h to ease notation in general the soil and air parameters in this equation can vary in time and space in the simplest scenario considering the long term g h correlation parameters ia is va ca trs and tra may be assumed to be constant over time at a given location yielding a linear g h relationship combining eq 6 with the surface energy balance equation r n g h e and the bowen s 1926 ratio β h e provides a new way of partitioning net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes as follows 7 r n g μ g ξ h μ g ξ β 1 e which leads to 8 g r n ξ 1 β 1 1 μ 1 β 1 h r n ξ μ 1 1 μ 1 β 1 e r n ξ μ 1 1 β 1 μ 1 where μ i a i s and ξ v a c a t rs t ra we emphasize that the above derivations are primarily applicable for bare soil the regulatory role of the vegetation canopy layer is not explicitly accounted for and can only be partially considered through model calibration this issue is further demonstrated later in the results and discussion section 2 2 ground and sensible heat flux linkage to surface temperature eq 1 and 5 may be written in a unified form of 9 f c k t z v f c f t t r where f is the sensible heat flux in soil g or atmosphere h vf is the fluid velocity term vw in soil or va in atmosphere and cf is the heat capacity of the fluid cw in soil or ca assuming constant soil and air thermal properties

it yields g or h when soil or air thermal properties are used respectively 2 3 validation and parameter estimation of proposed relationships the derived relationships were evaluated using measurements from six ameriflux sites in north america listed in table 1 including us src in arizona kurc 2016 us srg in arizona scott 2016a us whs in arizona scott 2016b us ton in california baldocchi 2016 us crt in ohio chen 2016 and ca qcu in quebec margolis 2016 these sites were chosen based on the availability of data of t g and h for multiple years with a broad range of land cover types from open shrublands to evergreen needleleaf forests the nearest to surface soil temperature data were used as the surrogate of surface temperature see the sensing depth in table 1 in addition heat fluxes g and h were modeled at z 0 soil air interface and were compared with the near surface measured fluxes assuming that the heat stored in the layer between z 0 and the measurement depth height is negligible all the flux tower half hourly data were averaged over 24 hour periods missing daily data were filled with a linear interpolation a few outliers less than 1 of daily data defined as values more than three standard deviations away from the median were detected and removed in this analysis the first half of the acquired data was used for model parameter estimation and the second half was used for model validation the proposed model parameters were estimated for each site using an analytical approach in particular eqs a22 to a26 are used to estimate the model parameters from measured g h and t data at the six sites through empirical parameterization of the lag time between h and measured temperature data the physical parameters in eqs a24 and a25 include heat capacity for air as ca 1300 j m 3 k 1 and for soil as c s c w θ c p 1 θ s where cw 4 18 106 j m 3 k 1 and cp 1 42 106 j m 3 k 1 are heat capacities of soil water and solid particles respectively θ is the soil water content and θs is the saturated water content since the values of cw and cp are relatively close to each other θ and θs values do not significantly change the soil heat capacity thus θ 0 2 and θs 0 4 are assumed for all the studied sites the estimated model parameters are listed in table 1 which were used for the validation of the new g h relationship eq 6 and the relationship linking the ground and sensible heat fluxes to the time series of surface temperatures eq 15 3 results and discussion fig 1 presents the estimates of ground heat flux from time series of land surface temperature using the analytical solution sadeghi et al 2019 of the linear advection diffusion equation eq 15 with constant advection velocity and thermal diffusion coefficient the results reaffirm that the assumed linear transport mechanism adequately explains the seasonal dynamics of daily ground heat flux solely based on surface temperature variations the results confirm previous findings wang and bras 1999 wang 2012 that the land surface temperature contains adequate information to infer ground heat flux owing to the fact that the information of soil temperature gradient can be retrieved from the temporal variations of surface soil temperature these results suggest that the advective flux of heat due to soil water movements e g infiltration redistribution preferential flow is also implicitly encoded in the temporal variation of surface temperature opening the possibility of using remote sensing observations of surface soil temperature for global monitoring of ground heat flux bennett et al 2008 purdy et al 2016 fig 2 shows the daily mean modeled sensible heat flux according to eq 15 compared with the field observations the estimates of the diffusive component of the fluxes rely on temperature gradient at the land atmosphere interface with the constant diffusivity obtained from eq 4 the shaded time intervals referred to as advection dominant periods isolate those days during which the bulk advective transport mechanism governs the direction of heat flux from colder ground toward the warmer air this bulk transfer is primarily due to the mean friction velocity rather than the mean vertical velocity see the materials and methods section note that the vertical velocity could be non zero due to the convergence divergence of the flow field webb et al 1980 lee 1998 paw u et al 2000 but is neglected in this analysis the agreements between estimates and measurements of the fluxes fig 2 demonstrate that the surface temperature encodes adequate information of not only ground heat flux but also sensible heat flux at daily and longer time scales this inference has shown to be more accurate for g as compared to h fig 1 vs 2 presumably because the transfer coefficients for soil has lower variability than those of air and parametrization of atmospheric heat flux is oversimplified this is more pronounced at the us crt cropland station near lake erie where the variations of measured h are significantly different from those of temperature gradients suggesting time varying parameters in eq 5 this phenomenon is arguably attributed to substantial seasonal and interannual changes in land cover at this site during the study period chu et al 2014 given the fact that the modulation effects of the canopy layer on the fluxes are not explicitly accounted for in the presented approach as mentioned earlier the first half of the data at each site e g from january 2009 to june 2011 in us src was used for calculating the proposed model parameters via analytically derived relationships eqs a22 to a26 figs 1 and 2 showing almost identical performance of the model over the calibration and validation periods confirm that the proposed analytical calibration approach is robust and physically consistent it is found that the proposed approach is not overly sensitive to the length of the calibration period and hence we were able to obtain similar results not shown for brevity using only one year of measured data for calibration this robustness promises the performance of the model outside the calibration period and may be useful to fill some data gaps where longer soil temperature data are available as compared to heat flux data e g us ton site in fig 1 as discussed the proposed advective diffusive transport mechanism sheds more light on the long term quest for partitioning net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes solely based on surface temperature data caparrini et al 2003 in particular since the surface temperature provides the boundary conditions for the transport processes the entire soil and air thermal fields can be reconstructed merely from surface temperature data fig 3 shows an example that observations of land surface temperature all by itself suffice to estimate the daily average profiles of temperature and heat flux in soil and air columns temperature is continuous as expected while sensible heat flux is discontinuous at the soil air interface due to the heat source at the land atmosphere interface and the difference in the thermal properties of air and soil see table 1 in particular the heat capacity of air is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of soil water matrix the daily averaged eddy diffusivity of air is about 8 orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusion of heat in soil and the mean air velocity explaining the bulk heat transfer is 4 orders of magnitude larger than the mean vertical velocity of unsaturated water flow in soil these differences cause much steeper vertical changes of temperature and heat flux in the soil than in the air the derived relationship between daily h and g in eq 6 is evaluated in fig 4 the results demonstrate that uncertainty of the relationship increases over higher latitudes for example in sites us crt and ca qcu the increased uncertainty can be largely related to temporal variability of the model parameters as well as the lack of its ability to explicitly account for the thermodynamic effects of the canopy layer together with the bowen ratio which can also be estimated from readily available meteorological data mccoll et al 2019 mccoll and rigden 2020 salvucci and gentine 2013 the g h relationship turns the surface energy balance equation into a determined system of equations 3 equations and 3 unknowns leading to a closed form approximation of the energy fluxes described in eq 8 fig 5 shows the predictive skill of this model quantifying latent heat flux given the bowen ratio from flux tower measurements the reference latent heat flux is calculated as e r n g h to avoid potential surface energy balance closure errors to account for possible uncertainties the measured bowen ratios are corrupted with a 50 uniformly distributed random noise the averaged root mean square errors of the estimates arising from both the uncertainties in the g h relationship and bowen ratio remain however below 10 of the magnitude of latent heat flux fig 5 the derived g h connection provides a new way of using surface energy balance equation in remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration for example remote sensing algorithms of evapotranspiration often assume that ground heat flux is a fraction of net solar radiation daughtry et al 1990 kustas and daughtry 1990 bastiaanssen et al 1998 purdy et al 2016 this class of empirical relationships imposes zero values for the ground heat flux when net radiation approaches to zero the proposed g h function has a non zero intercept fig 4 which implicitly accounts for the soil heat loss due to nighttime or cold season longwave radiative cooling accounting for this heat loss is expected to improve the estimates of global evapotranspiration if the proposed g h relationship is integrated into remote sensing algorithms 4 concluding remarks the provided analyses and discussions demonstrate that the land surface temperature contains essential information to infer temporal variations of ground and sensible heat flux at daily timescale based on a bulk heat transfer parameterization of turbulent fluxes of heat in atmospheric boundary layer in the context of a linear advection diffusion equation a new relationship is derived linking daily mean sensible and ground heat flux the proposed relationship combined with bowen ratio provides a new paradigm for partitioning the net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes at the earth surface credit authorship contribution statement m sadeghi conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis

lead to physically significant parameters for the proposed analytical model eq 15 hence to estimate the model parameters we derived the following analytical relationships which yield the best physically meaningful set of parameters for the derivations we first need to quantify the heat transfer by diffusion only and advection only note that setting vf 0 in the proposed general solution

wavelengths prata et al 1995 jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 such an inference is often under constrained and thus requires additional information for example in addition to surface temperature remote sensing retrieval of h requires an estimate of air temperature wind velocity and bulk transfer coefficient of heat su 2002 jia et al 2003 to reduce the uncertainty of inference land surface energy balance equation and interrelations between its components provide additional information bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007 the motivation is that if at least two interrelations between fluxes are characterized accurately based on the remote sensing observations the surface energy balance equation can be solved with reduced uncertainty bowen 1926 was one of the first to study the h e physical connection based on an analogy between the diffusive transfer of heat and water vapor in the ambient air relying on more readily measurable variables such as air temperature and vapor pressure the bowen ratio β h e adds a constraint to the energy balance equation yet the problem of inferring surface fluxes remains ill posed with two equations and three unknowns wang and bras 2009 2011 demonstrated that g and h are strongly linked as the partition of net radiation based on the theory of maximum entropy production while a third relationship between g and h is highly desirable such a relationship is poorly understood due to the fundamental difference between the timescale of dominant transport mechanisms of heat in the atmosphere and soil in effect while temperature in soil depth changes diurnally turbulent transport mechanisms of heat in atmosphere operate in sub hourly scales this paper attempts to narrow down this knowledge gap here we propose a new relationship between g and h at the daily timescale this relationship is theoretically derived for bare soil and is evaluated for a variety of bare to vegetated sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 ground and sensible heat flux relationship conductive and advective flux of heat in unsaturated zone through molecular diffusion and laminar flow of liquid water may be expressed as sakai et al 2011 1 g c s k s t s z v w c w t s t rs in eq 1 and following equations the subscripts s a and w denote soil air and water respectively when the subscripts are dropped for brevity the corresponding variables can represent either soil or air media note that soil is here referred to the bulk soil including all its components particles and water in eq 1 g w m 2 is the ground heat flux at distance z m from the surface t k the temperature at z c j m 3 k 1 the heat capacity k m2 s 1 the thermal diffusivity ck λ w m 1 k 1 the thermal conductivity and v m s 1 the flow velocity note that ts trs is the temperature difference between the background soil and flowing water that drives the advective heat transfer in soil in contrast to soil heat in the atmospheric surface layer is transferred via turbulent flow according to the first order turbulence closure theory known as k theory turbulent sensible heat flux h w m 2 is expressed as stull 1988 2 h c a k a t a z where ka is the eddy diffusivity and other variables are the same as above but for air denoted by subscript a eddy diffusivity ka is often parameterized in terms of friction velocity u and a length scale linearly proportional to z through the von karman constant under neutral atmospheric condition and is substantially larger than the molecular diffusivity ks thus one can estimate daily 24 hour mean sensible heat flux as follows 3 h c a k a t a z c a k a t a z cov k a t a z where the overbar denotes the daily mean and cov the covariance using the laplace transformation of the diffusion equation in a semi infinite medium of soil or air the spatial gradient of temperature can be expressed in terms of the half order time derivative of temperature wang and bras 1998 1999 4 t z 1 π k 0 t dt z τ t τ where t is the time and τ is the integration variable eq 4 indicates that a time series of temperature at a single level z contains adequate information to estimate the vertical gradient of temperature at the same level the covariance term in eq 3 depends on sub daily fluctuations of the eddy diffusivity and temperature gradient k a k a t a z t a z through eq 4 connecting t a z to t a one can consider that the covariance term is proportional to k a k a t a t a a linear relationship between ka and u can be considered assuming that the structure of turbulence in the proximity of the surface is primarily governed by the shear production under varying thermal stability thus the above covariance term is proportional to u u t a t a assuming a reference air temperature tra corresponding to zero friction velocity u 0 the latter term can be further reduced to be proportional to u t a t ra that resembles the known bulk heat transfer approximation of the turbulent heat flux stull 1988 pp 262 therefore we suggest approximating eq 3 as follows 5 h c a k a t a z v a c a t a t ra where va is an air velocity term proportional to u which can be estimated directly from measured data see eq a23 in appendix a this representation suggests an analogy between the turbulent heat flow in air eq 5 and the conductive advective heat flow in soil at daily timescale eq 1 although va does not exist in the first order closure of reynolds decomposition of turbulence it manifests itself when the flux is averaged over longer than turbulence timescales the analogy between soil and air heat transfer in conjunction with the temperature continuity at the land surface connects daily h and g as follows see the derivation in appendix a 6 h i a i s g v a c a t rs t ra where i c k 0 5 j s 0 5 m 2 k 1 is the thermal inertia note that h in eq 6 stands for the daily averaged sensible heat flux h to ease notation in general the soil and air parameters in this equation can vary in time and space in the simplest scenario considering the long term g h correlation parameters ia is va ca trs and tra may be assumed to be constant over time at a given location yielding a linear g h relationship combining eq 6 with the surface energy balance equation r n g h e and the bowen s 1926 ratio β h e provides a new way of partitioning net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes as follows 7 r n g μ g ξ h μ g ξ β 1 e which leads to 8 g r n ξ 1 β 1 1 μ 1 β 1 h r n ξ μ 1 1 μ 1 β 1 e r n ξ μ 1 1 β 1 μ 1 where μ i a i s and ξ v a c a t rs t ra we emphasize that the above derivations are primarily applicable for bare soil the regulatory role of the vegetation canopy layer is not explicitly accounted for and can only be partially considered through model calibration this issue is further demonstrated later in the results and discussion section 2 2 ground and sensible heat flux linkage to surface temperature eq 1 and 5 may be written in a unified form of 9 f c k t z v f c f t t r where f is the sensible heat flux in soil g or atmosphere h vf is the fluid velocity term vw in soil or va in atmosphere and cf is the heat capacity of the fluid cw in soil or ca assuming constant soil and air thermal properties

it yields g or h when soil or air thermal properties are used respectively 2 3 validation and parameter estimation of proposed relationships the derived relationships were evaluated using measurements from six ameriflux sites in north america listed in table 1 including us src in arizona kurc 2016 us srg in arizona scott 2016a us whs in arizona scott 2016b us ton in california baldocchi 2016 us crt in ohio chen 2016 and ca qcu in quebec margolis 2016 these sites were chosen based on the availability of data of t g and h for multiple years with a broad range of land cover types from open shrublands to evergreen needleleaf forests the nearest to surface soil temperature data were used as the surrogate of surface temperature see the sensing depth in table 1 in addition heat fluxes g and h were modeled at z 0 soil air interface and were compared with the near surface measured fluxes assuming that the heat stored in the layer between z 0 and the measurement depth height is negligible all the flux tower half hourly data were averaged over 24 hour periods missing daily data were filled with a linear interpolation a few outliers less than 1 of daily data defined as values more than three standard deviations away from the median were detected and removed in this analysis the first half of the acquired data was used for model parameter estimation and the second half was used for model validation the proposed model parameters were estimated for each site using an analytical approach in particular eqs a22 to a26 are used to estimate the model parameters from measured g h and t data at the six sites through empirical parameterization of the lag time between h and measured temperature data the physical parameters in eqs a24 and a25 include heat capacity for air as ca 1300 j m 3 k 1 and for soil as c s c w θ c p 1 θ s where cw 4 18 106 j m 3 k 1 and cp 1 42 106 j m 3 k 1 are heat capacities of soil water and solid particles respectively θ is the soil water content and θs is the saturated water content since the values of cw and cp are relatively close to each other θ and θs values do not significantly change the soil heat capacity thus θ 0 2 and θs 0 4 are assumed for all the studied sites the estimated model parameters are listed in table 1 which were used for the validation of the new g h relationship eq 6 and the relationship linking the ground and sensible heat fluxes to the time series of surface temperatures eq 15 3 results and discussion fig 1 presents the estimates of ground heat flux from time series of land surface temperature using the analytical solution sadeghi et al 2019 of the linear advection diffusion equation eq 15 with constant advection velocity and thermal diffusion coefficient the results reaffirm that the assumed linear transport mechanism adequately explains the seasonal dynamics of daily ground heat flux solely based on surface temperature variations the results confirm previous findings wang and bras 1999 wang 2012 that the land surface temperature contains adequate information to infer ground heat flux owing to the fact that the information of soil temperature gradient can be retrieved from the temporal variations of surface soil temperature these results suggest that the advective flux of heat due to soil water movements e g infiltration redistribution preferential flow is also implicitly encoded in the temporal variation of surface temperature opening the possibility of using remote sensing observations of surface soil temperature for global monitoring of ground heat flux bennett et al 2008 purdy et al 2016 fig 2 shows the daily mean modeled sensible heat flux according to eq 15 compared with the field observations the estimates of the diffusive component of the fluxes rely on temperature gradient at the land atmosphere interface with the constant diffusivity obtained from eq 4 the shaded time intervals referred to as advection dominant periods isolate those days during which the bulk advective transport mechanism governs the direction of heat flux from colder ground toward the warmer air this bulk transfer is primarily due to the mean friction velocity rather than the mean vertical velocity see the materials and methods section note that the vertical velocity could be non zero due to the convergence divergence of the flow field webb et al 1980 lee 1998 paw u et al 2000 but is neglected in this analysis the agreements between estimates and measurements of the fluxes fig 2 demonstrate that the surface temperature encodes adequate information of not only ground heat flux but also sensible heat flux at daily and longer time scales this inference has shown to be more accurate for g as compared to h fig 1 vs 2 presumably because the transfer coefficients for soil has lower variability than those of air and parametrization of atmospheric heat flux is oversimplified this is more pronounced at the us crt cropland station near lake erie where the variations of measured h are significantly different from those of temperature gradients suggesting time varying parameters in eq 5 this phenomenon is arguably attributed to substantial seasonal and interannual changes in land cover at this site during the study period chu et al 2014 given the fact that the modulation effects of the canopy layer on the fluxes are not explicitly accounted for in the presented approach as mentioned earlier the first half of the data at each site e g from january 2009 to june 2011 in us src was used for calculating the proposed model parameters via analytically derived relationships eqs a22 to a26 figs 1 and 2 showing almost identical performance of the model over the calibration and validation periods confirm that the proposed analytical calibration approach is robust and physically consistent it is found that the proposed approach is not overly sensitive to the length of the calibration period and hence we were able to obtain similar results not shown for brevity using only one year of measured data for calibration this robustness promises the performance of the model outside the calibration period and may be useful to fill some data gaps where longer soil temperature data are available as compared to heat flux data e g us ton site in fig 1 as discussed the proposed advective diffusive transport mechanism sheds more light on the long term quest for partitioning net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes solely based on surface temperature data caparrini et al 2003 in particular since the surface temperature provides the boundary conditions for the transport processes the entire soil and air thermal fields can be reconstructed merely from surface temperature data fig 3 shows an example that observations of land surface temperature all by itself suffice to estimate the daily average profiles of temperature and heat flux in soil and air columns temperature is continuous as expected while sensible heat flux is discontinuous at the soil air interface due to the heat source at the land atmosphere interface and the difference in the thermal properties of air and soil see table 1 in particular the heat capacity of air is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of soil water matrix the daily averaged eddy diffusivity of air is about 8 orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusion of heat in soil and the mean air velocity explaining the bulk heat transfer is 4 orders of magnitude larger than the mean vertical velocity of unsaturated water flow in soil these differences cause much steeper vertical changes of temperature and heat flux in the soil than in the air the derived relationship between daily h and g in eq 6 is evaluated in fig 4 the results demonstrate that uncertainty of the relationship increases over higher latitudes for example in sites us crt and ca qcu the increased uncertainty can be largely related to temporal variability of the model parameters as well as the lack of its ability to explicitly account for the thermodynamic effects of the canopy layer together with the bowen ratio which can also be estimated from readily available meteorological data mccoll et al 2019 mccoll and rigden 2020 salvucci and gentine 2013 the g h relationship turns the surface energy balance equation into a determined system of equations 3 equations and 3 unknowns leading to a closed form approximation of the energy fluxes described in eq 8 fig 5 shows the predictive skill of this model quantifying latent heat flux given the bowen ratio from flux tower measurements the reference latent heat flux is calculated as e r n g h to avoid potential surface energy balance closure errors to account for possible uncertainties the measured bowen ratios are corrupted with a 50 uniformly distributed random noise the averaged root mean square errors of the estimates arising from both the uncertainties in the g h relationship and bowen ratio remain however below 10 of the magnitude of latent heat flux fig 5 the derived g h connection provides a new way of using surface energy balance equation in remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration for example remote sensing algorithms of evapotranspiration often assume that ground heat flux is a fraction of net solar radiation daughtry et al 1990 kustas and daughtry 1990 bastiaanssen et al 1998 purdy et al 2016 this class of empirical relationships imposes zero values for the ground heat flux when net radiation approaches to zero the proposed g h function has a non zero intercept fig 4 which implicitly accounts for the soil heat loss due to nighttime or cold season longwave radiative cooling accounting for this heat loss is expected to improve the estimates of global evapotranspiration if the proposed g h relationship is integrated into remote sensing algorithms 4 concluding remarks the provided analyses and discussions demonstrate that the land surface temperature contains essential information to infer temporal variations of ground and sensible heat flux at daily timescale based on a bulk heat transfer parameterization of turbulent fluxes of heat in atmospheric boundary layer in the context of a linear advection diffusion equation a new relationship is derived linking daily mean sensible and ground heat flux the proposed relationship combined with bowen ratio provides a new paradigm for partitioning the net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes at the earth surface credit authorship contribution statement m sadeghi conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis

lead to physically significant parameters for the proposed analytical model eq 15 hence to estimate the model parameters we derived the following analytical relationships which yield the best physically meaningful set of parameters for the derivations we first need to quantify the heat transfer by diffusion only and advection only note that setting vf 0 in the proposed general solution does not yield the diffusion only solution as it yields indefinite numbers number divided by zero we consider the heat diffusion equation of the form a9 t t k 2 t z 2 and the following boundary and

4179,in this study a non bayesian nonparametric model for characterization of the hydraulic properties of a basin scale aquifer is proposed based on the natural stimulus of recharge from precipitation via a geostatistical principal component adaptation evolution strategy we modified an existing model to use a low dimensional projection onto the principal component space as well as improve computational efficiency and memory requirements to illustrate the scalability of the proposed model we estimated about 10 million unknown hydraulic conductivities hcs which required only 35 min or less on a modern workstation to test the estimation accuracy the proposed model was employed to estimate several aquifer hc fields using timeseries data of groundwater levels of more than 60 days at 16 monitoring wells with the recharge rate provided two cases were considered when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available and unavailable in addition inversions were performed using perfectly known and erroneous recharge rates using various test configurations we found that the estimation was better when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available for inaccurately determined recharge rates the estimation accuracy generally deteriorated but the structural features of the estimated hc fields were similar to those obtained using the correctly assigned recharge rate regardless of the availability of hc measurements at the monitoring wells the proposed model estimated the distribution of hc reasonably well even when incorrect prior statistics of the mean and correlation scales were provided by demonstrating that an aquifer can be characterized at the basin scale using recharge from precipitation the relevance of the proposed model which had high computational efficiency was evident keywords basin scale aquifer characterization natural stimuli recharge rate evolution strategy geostatistics principal components 1 introduction with the exponential increase in population due to rapid urbanization and increasing extreme climate events caused by global climate change mccarthy et al 2001 groundwater storage as a major source of freshwater has become crucial as regional aquifers are connected through various flow paths the reliable management of groundwater resources must be carefully designed and implemented over a large area to minimize the impact of groundwater exploitation and pollution owing to the relevance of water resources and interactions between water bodies numerous studies even continental scale studies have been conducted e g maxwell et al 2015 de graaf et al 2020 which can contribute to insights into hydrological process interactions and water resource management when basin scale planning is employed water resources in surface and subsurface bodies can be managed more systematically and efficiently than otherwise yeh et al 2008 graymore et al 2008 therefore implementing basin scale monitoring programs that will help identify the hydraulic characteristics of aquifers for the basin scale management of groundwater resources is essential typically the equivalent homogeneous hydraulic properties of an aquifer based on type curve analysis of a single well test can be obtained from aquifer tests such as pumping and slug tests followed by the interpretation of the observed data zhou et al 2014 however conventional aquifer tests are limited because they do not allow the estimation of fine scale spatial changes in hydraulic properties that fluctuate within the support volume to estimate spatially varying hydraulic properties various models to characterize the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties via an inverse analysis of aquifer test data have been proposed among these models quasilinear or bayesian linear models kitanidis 1995 yeh et al 1996 are the most popular and numerous studies aimed at enhancing their accuracy and reducing their computation costs have been conducted cirpka and kitanidis 2000 yeh and liu 2000 liu et al 2002 2013 2014 nowak et al 2003 nowak and cirpka 2004 2006 cardiff and kitanidis 2009 nowak 2009 yin and illman 2009a 2009b saibaba and kitanidis 2012 ambikasaran et al 2013 kitanidis and lee 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 lin et al 2017 zha et al 2018 jeong and park 2019 ghorbanidehno et al 2020 in the two abovementioned models spatial and spatiotemporal changes in hydraulic head or tracer concentrations due to pumping or solute transport respectively at multiple monitoring locations were inversely analyzed through a successive linearization of an objective function to obtain the hydraulic properties of an aquifer however the value of the data is typically limited to the extent affected by the artificially imposed hydraulic stress i e pumping or by the effective solute transport distance moreover the range characterized by one such test is much smaller than the basin scale in areas with high permeability the situation can be exacerbated by a strong hydraulic diffusion process therefore the characterization of aquifer properties over a large area requires several hydraulic tests and a well designed monitoring network but pumping tests and monitoring well installations over a large area are expensive thus the inverse method has rarely been applied to basin scale characterization problems despite claims regarding its potential yeh et al 2008 in this situation as an alternative to artificial stress naturally imposed aquifer stresses natural stimuli such as precipitation atmospheric pressure changes tidal effects and river stage changes that influence large areas can be viably used in areas with a shallow water table recharge from precipitation exerts a substantial hydraulic stress on unconfined aquifers introducing a recharged water flux causes water table fluctuations the magnitude of which reflects the hydraulic properties of the aquifer park and parker 2008 park et al 2011 2021 park 2012 these water table fluctuations can be recorded at high frequency in the form of timeseries data at groundwater monitoring wells for example more than 1000 official groundwater monitoring wells are currently operated by government funded public corporations in south korea which measure hourly water table levels and provide daily data however the data obtained from these wells are mostly used only for qualitative trend analysis such as overall increases or decreases in groundwater levels gwls these data have rarely been used for systematic and in depth analysis combined with well established variably saturated flow models in particular with the recharge distribution gwl data can be used for the hydraulic characterization of aquifers over a large area to the best of our knowledge these water table fluctuation data have not been assimilated to characterize basin scale aquifers to address the abovementioned limitation in this study we propose a computationally efficient non bayesian nonparametric inverse model based on an evolution strategy es its potential is demonstrated by applying it to synthesized basin scale characterization scenarios unlike optimization based inversion models ess are generally robust to the low sensitivity of water table fluctuation observations this study follows a geostatistical es park 2020 as the key model for aquifer characterization however park s work 2020 was based on conventional methods of adapting the covariance matrix hence their model was not sufficiently computationally scalable to apply to a basin scale domain with a large number of grid cells therefore we modified the previous model by approximating the computationally cumbersome covariance matrix with a small number of principal components pcs for maximizing computational efficiency e g lee and kitanidis 2014 the proposed geostatistical es was subsequently tested through small synthetic basin scale aquifer characterization applications based on the synthesized idealized aquifer and simple boundary conditions the scalability of the proposed model was tested and the estimation accuracy of the hydraulic conductivity hc distribution using the groundwater table fluctuation measurements was demonstrated in addition the applicability of the proposed model to water table fluctuation based aquifer characterization was investigated via numerical tests 2 theoretical developments 2 1 improvement of geostatistical pc adaptation es gpca es for computational efficiency 2 1 1 summary of the previous model an es is classified as a global optimization model it is a non bayesian nonparametric model that minimizes an objective function over generations based on mutation and selection rules in this study generation means iteration of an estimation loop mutation uses information from intragenerational among the selected members and intergenerational between generations relationships to induce better reproduction of the population in the next generation conventionally this information is stored in a covariance matrix i e covariance matrix adaptation es cma es which evolves over generations in this respect ess show similarities to bayesian models in terms of optimizing the state vector using the covariance relationship however while selecting an algorithm a certain number of individuals are selected including the best fitted individuals to inform the next generation estimation via es in this respect follows a stochastic process with multiple possible estimates being made in each generation this study is similar to the previous studies hansen and ostermeier 2001 park 2020 in that it derives an optimal state vector e g distribution of hydraulic parameters through an es but with different details the most notable difference between the previous and current studies is that the previous studies repeatedly adapted the covariance matrix for estimations whereas this study directly updated the pc for improved computation efficiency this modification did not require large dense matrix operations during the estimation process therefore only a small memory footprint was required to estimate the domain of multiple grid cells in addition only a small matrix operation was allowed in the ensemble kalman filter enkf e g the covariance update operation used at each generation further improving computational efficiency compared with the previous study park 2020 in the es the basic equation for sampling the i th spatial state vectors i e the realization of a current unknown estimate

adapted n u n u covariance matrix c g i e s g s g t c g in general ess an accurate initial estimation of the underlying covariance matrix that defines the relation between the locations of two unknown values is crucial to achieving fast convergence the geostatistical es introduced a reasonable initial covariance function via the conditioning of informed state variables through gaussian process regression or kriging however while covariance matrices can contain detailed information on the relationship among unknown values maintaining the covariance matrix is computationally cumbersome watersheds typically have very large spatial scales and high resolution estimation is often required in this case the storage and processing of complete covariance matrices c with cell counts of hundreds of thousands or more e g approximately 500 gb memory is required for storing a covariance matrix of 250 000 unknowns alone are often impractical this situation can be exacerbated when there is more than one unknown hydraulic parameter at each cell thus extensive efforts have been made to reduce the rank of the large matrices either covariance or hessian matrices they are identical in a gaussian context in the field of hydrogeology liu et al 2014 kitanidis and lee 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 zha et al 2018 similar low rank approximation methods can be adopted in es therefore we extended the strategy to obtain and store pcs of a covariance matrix rather than an entire covariance matrix in addition a method for directly updating the pcs without the need to reconstruct the covariance matrix was developed 2 1 2 improvements resulting from this study to perform a pc analysis pca on a high dimensional covariance matrix a randomized algorithm the cur matrix decomposition is applied mahoney and drineas 2009 saibaba et al 2016 wang et al 2021 to approximate the first few pcs using sparsely sampled rows of the large dense covariance matrix therefore the procedure of estimating the initial pcs is as follows 1 divide the covariance matrix into m partitions along the row direction 2 calculate the pcs of each partition by sparsely sampling the rows 3 store the partition wise pcs in the storage matrix 4 obtain the pcs approximating the entire covariance matrix from the storage matrix if conditioning information is present the conditional sampled covariance matrix corresponding to a partition m c m in the entire partitions is as follows 3 c m c 0 m c 1 m t c 2 1 c 1 where c m has dimensions of b n u b is the number of sampled rows c 0 m b n u is the sparsely sampled covariance matrix without conditioning c 1 o n u is a correlation matrix between all locations and observed locations corresponding to the sampled rows o is the number of observations c 2 o o is the correlation matrix among the observed locations and c 1 m o b corresponds to m 1 b 1 through mb rows of c 1 the entries of c 0 m c 1 and c 2 are calculated from a covariance function from the partitioned matrix a subset of singular values and vectors was obtained up to the k 0 th rank in terms of a singular value using the lanczos bidiagonalization method larsen 1998 baglama and reichel 2005 4 u m σ m v m t c m where u m n u k 0 is the left singular vector σ m k 0 k 0 is a diagonal matrix with the k 0 th largest singular values in order and v m n u k 0 is the right singular vector based on computation rate and storage we consistently used an empirically determined value of k 0 40 the obtained singular vectors were accumulated to a singular vector storage matrix for m 1 2 m 5 u 0 u 1 u 2 u m as high frequency sampling provides redundant information information accumulation was performed at sparse intervals the singular vector storage matrix of u 0 has the dimensions of n u k 0 m where k 0 m n u and the singular values were arranged as follows 6 σ 0 σ 1 0 0 0 0 σ 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 σ m where the singular value storage matrix σ 0 has the dimensions of k 0 m k 0 m from the stored information n pc n pc n u pcs are obtained using the following 7 u p 0 σ p 0 v p 0 t u 0 σ 0 a n d 8 σ p 0 σ p 0 σ p 0 2 where the matrix u p 0 includes the singular vectors pc vectors at

directions n pc n pc the arrow represents substitution for computational efficiency small numbers of pcs n pc 2 0 were used for the entire case although a larger number of pcs might be used we confirmed via computational experiments that doing so yielded no significant improvement in the estimation performance using the derived pcs eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 9 y i g 1 m g σ g u p g σ p g z which is the basic equation for sampling the spatial state vectors of this study whereas eq 1 is the equation obtained from park 2020 in the es portions of the successful parents previous generation and offspring current generation are competitively involved in the evolution of the next offspring adaptation of u p g and σ p g such that 10 y g 1 y g 1 y μ ρ g where ρ is the mixing number μ here ρ 2 was consistently used where λ 10 and the minimum value of μ was set to 2 with the estimation update obtained via evolution an additional estimation update following the analysis covariance update in the enkf was employed the general equation of the estimation update by assimilating the observed data based on the enkf is as follows 11 p g 1 λ 1 λ g λ g λ g λ g t where p g n u n obs n u n obs is the ensemble covariance matrix of estimations λ g y t h est t t n u n obs λ n obs is the number of the hydraulic head y n u λ is a collection of estimated state vectors i e y i 1 λ g h est n obs λ is a collection of estimated hydraulic head values i e h est f y f is the forward model and λ g n u n obs λ is a matrix with replications of the ensemble mean vector of λ g then the kalman gain matrix k g n u n obs n obs and the updated state matrix λ g u n u n obs λ are respectively expressed as follows 12 k g p g h 1 t h 1 p g h 1 t r 1 a n d 13 λ g u λ g k g o r h 1 λ g ε o where h 1 n obs n u n obs is the observation matrix r ε o ε o t n obs 1 n obs n obs ε o n obs λ is the observation error matrix of measured hydraulic heads and o r n obs λ is the data matrix with the replicated hydraulic head measurement vector h obs in the above equations computation of p g involves a larger computational burden than that of a complete covariance matrix therefore to avoid complete computation of p g in obtaining k g a rank n e approximation of u l g σ l g v l g t λ g λ g was employed using an n e a subset of singular values and vectors where u l g σ l g and v l g have dimensions of n u n obs n e n e n e and n e n e respectively in this study n e was determined to be similar to n pc or k 0 based on the truncated singular vectors and values p g can be approximated by u l g σ l g 2 u l g t then eq 12 can be rewritten as follows 14 k g u l g σ l g 2 u lh g t u lh g σ l g 2 u lh g t r 1 where u lh g is equal to h 1 u l g which has small dimensions of n obs n e therefore the kalman gain matrix can be obtained using affordable computations without p g and the computational time of the enkf process is significantly less than that of park 2020 at the end of each generation the pcs of u p g and σ p g were updated to u p g 1 and σ p g 1 based on the information from simulations in that generation in this update the following cumulations of vectors and

cumulation coefficient given to p c g and c kf is the cumulation coefficient given to λ g u λ g u the value of c 1 is determined to be 1 10 log n u 1 based on an algorithm proposed by loshchilov 2014 rather than updating the covariance matrix directly updating the pcs can provide significant computational benefits in terms of central processing unit cpu time and memory usage 2 2 performance metrics for estimation to quantify model performance various metrics such as the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsec nash and sutcliffe 1970 standardized rmse srmse correlation coefficient cc and structural similarity index ssim wang et al 2004 were employed in each estimation the nsec was employed to measure the fitness between the synthetic true and estimated values it is defined as follows 18 nsec 1 t 1 t h e t h o t 2 t 1 t h t t h t 2 where h e t is the estimated head at time t h t t is the true head at time t and h t is the mean value of the true heads the range of nsec is from to 1 and nsec 1 when the estimations are identical to the true heads thresholds for checking whether an inverse model results in a satisfactory estimation are given between 0 5 nsec 0 65 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 srmse was given by the regular rmse divided by the standard deviation of the targeted values which was primarily used to comprehensively measure the corresponding grid differences between the true and estimated hydraulic properties cc was used to measure the grid based similarity of the patterns between the true and estimated hydraulic properties although srmse and cc have often been used to measure overall similarity between true and estimated fields they are limited in their ability to represent the degree of structural similarity however ssim could be used to quantify the similarity in the structural pattern between true and estimated log hc fields sánchez león et al 2020 the formula for ssim is as follows 19 ssim 2 μ t μ e c 1 2 σ te c 2 μ t 2 μ e 2 c 1 σ t 2 σ e 2 c 2 where μ t and μ e are the means of the true and estimated fields respectively σ t 2 and σ e 2 are the variances of the true and estimated fields respectively σ te is the covariance between the true and estimated fields for c 1 and c 2 of eq 19 an extremely small number 2 22 10 16 was used 2 3 hypothetical heterogeneous model domain to evaluate the scalability and estimation accuracy of the proposed model a two dimensional 10 10 km heterogeneous hc field was created fig 1 a to represent a small basin scale aquifer the storage coefficient storativity was assumed to be 4 10 2 over the domain and the thickness in the vertical direction was set to 100 m the lower portion of the domain was bounded by an impermeable layer and the upper portion had an unconfined condition as the vertical scale was significantly smaller than the horizontal scale 1 100 the heterogeneity along the vertical direction was ignored therefore the domain could be considered a two dimensional unconfined aquifer the domain shape and boundary conditions of the case for the scalability test are depicted in fig 1a the eastern and western margins are the specified head boundaries with h 100 m in addition a strong hydraulic stress was assigned in the middle of the domain with h 80 m pw in fig 1a this strong hydraulic stress was assumed to be large scale pumping or civil works such as underground excavation or tunneling which drains large amounts of groundwater to facilitate construction for the southern and northern margins boundary conditions with a specified flux of zero h y 0 were assigned to test the scalability of the proposed model the domain was discretized with various grid sizes including 250 250 100 100 50 50 25 25 12 5 12 5 6 25 6 25 and 3 125 3 125 m grid cells corresponding to numbers of 1600 10 000 40 000 160 000 640 000 2 560 000 and 10 240 000 grid cells respectively in the scalability tests we assumed that there was no recharge therefore the main cause of gwl changes was a strong hydraulic stress in the middle of the domain for testing the estimation accuracy of hc distribution using temporally varying recharge rates the domain extent was set identically to that of the domain used for the scalability test in this test the domain was consistently discretized with a 50 50 m grid cell resulting in 40 000 grid cells the domain had a thin unsaturated zone above the water table and temporally varying recharge from precipitation was assumed to directly induce fluctuations in gwls the domain shape and boundary conditions for the predictability test are depicted in fig 1b the eastern margin is the specified head boundary with h 100 m whereas boundary conditions with a specified flux of zero h y 0 were assigned for other margins in the accuracy tests recharge from precipitation was assumed and the gwl changes were mainly due to a temporarily varying recharge rate at 16 randomly distributed monitoring wells ow in fig 1 only six are shown in the figure the transient hydraulic heads were measured with a measurement error of 0 01 m in the scalability tests the monitoring duration was 1 day and the monitoring interval was 0 2 days therefore 80 transient hydraulic head values were used for the estimations in the accuracy test recharge data for 60 days fig 4 was synthesized by referring to the precipitation rate and the recharge to precipitation ratio typically observed in the field sites the mean recharge rate was set to 1 5 10 3 m d with 28 recharge events therefore the simulation period was 60 days and 960 hydraulic head values 60 head values per well 16 monitoring wells were assimilated in the estimation the reason for using only the gwl for a short period was to consider that only short term data were available in some areas and show that the proposed model is valid in this case in the scalability tests estimations were performed assuming that a previously measured hc value was available at each monitoring well further in the accuracy tests we considered two additional configurations in which the hc measurements at each monitoring well were either available or unavailable when the measured hc values exist prior information i e mean and covariance for the estimation at g 0 was obtained from the values of the 16 monitoring wells therefore the obtained mean value depended on the location of each monitoring well and might differ from the actual mean value if hc measurements were available at the monitoring wells estimating hc data reflected a 0 5 log transformed measurement error when there were no hc values measured at the monitoring wells the mean and covariance were arbitrarily determined where the log transformed hc of 1 was consistently assumed as the prior mean value in the domain the hc fields were generated using the unconditional sequential gaussian simulation sgsim deutsch and journel 1992 the spherical variogram model was used and the correlation scales were arbitrarily input wherein the scale along the x direction was generally longer than that along the y direction for the proposed model x 500 m and y 500 m were consistently used as the correlation scales of initial pcs whereas the correlation scales used in sgsim for constructing the reference fields were x 5000 m and y 1500 m in the actual case no accurate spatial correlation of lengths could be obtained unless detailed investigations of the area were performed for each realization from sgsim a log transformed mean of 2 5 hc of approximately 12 18 m d and a variance of 2 0 were assumed 2 4 computation setup in the scalability tests a workstation equipped with two 2 7 ghz 24 core cpus 48 cores with 512 gb memory was used with windows 10 operating system and matlab 2020a using the parallel computing toolbox usgs modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 was used to simulate groundwater recharge and fluctuations without invasive modification of the code because the forward model runs in each generation were independent the computational efficiency could be increased through parallel computation notably for comparison we performed a few inversions for cases with unknown values of 40 000 or less using a personal computer equipped with a single 1 3 ghz 4 core cpu with 16 gb memory the efficient memory usage and computational algorithm developed in the proposed model significantly reduced computing resource requirements and the cpu times for the inversions between two machines were confirmed to be almost identical based on a problem with 40 000 unknown values the cpu time of the personal computer was only a few seconds longer than that of the high performance workstation which was because only a small number of forward model runs λ were used regardless the workstation was used for all implementations to handle large unknown cases with faster results 3 results and discussion 3 1 model scalability to demonstrate the proposed model s scalability the cpu times and number of forward model runs of seven cases with different numbers of unknowns 1600 case 1 1 10 000 case 1 2 40 000 case 1 3 160 000 case 1 4 640 000 case 1 5 2 560 000 case 1 6 and 10 240 000 case 1 7 were compared based on the cases the number of forward runs per estimation n fr and cumulative cpu times required for preprocessing t prep forward runs t fr and optimizations t op were compared with each other for the cpu times t prep is the time spent to estimate the initial pcs representing the spatial correlation of the targeted values a maximum of 10 generations g max 10 was used for all estimations when comparing cpu times because all estimations converged to a predefined simulation ending criterion srmse between h obs and h est of less than 0 5 m before reaching 10 generations in all estimations five hydraulic head measurements were assumed to be available at each monitoring well for which the interval was consistently 0 2 days therefore the total simulation time was 1 day in addition only n pc 20 20 largest pcs in terms of singular value was used for updating the estimations and 10 or less forward runs were performed per generation the number of forward model runs was set to gradually decrease based on the srmse of each generation under this configuration one expects o λ g max forward model runs with o n u n obs n pc matrix operation costs table 1 summarizes the number of forward model runs and the corresponding cpu times in all estimations the srmse and cc values between the targets and estimated hc fields were less than 1 5 and greater than 0 7 respectively the ssim values were greater than 0 65 for all cases indicating that the structure of the estimated hc field was similar to that of the true field overall the observations suggested that acceptable estimations were performed by the proposed model during the scalability tests as shown in table 1 the estimation with more than ten million unknowns terminated at 2143 1 s approximately 35 7 min or 0 6 h which indicated a significant computational efficiency improvement compared with that of park 2020 in park s work 2020 the cpu times for 1600 10 000 and 40 000 unknowns were 28 124 and 1640 s respectively further comparisons could not be made because the previous model was unable to handle a large number of grid cells due to the large memory requirement for saving and updating the covariance matrix by contrast only a relatively small amount of memory was required to handle a few pcs in the proposed model by comparing the results the computational efficiency of the proposed model yielded an improvement of 244 times more than the previous model based on the 40 000 unknowns case although all estimations were terminated at 10 generations the numbers of forward model runs were different because of different convergence histories in most estimations 50 80 of the total cpu time was spent on forward model runs moreover the number of forward model runs performed for each estimation was about 50 suggesting that the proposed model could be effectively used to characterize a subsurface using a nonlinear simulator e g a multiphase flow simulator which required a much longer single run time than that of the proposed model considering that less than 100 000 grids are typically used in many of the practical two dimensional groundwater flow modeling simulations it will take a few tens to a maximum of 100 s for estimating hc distribution using the proposed model when the forward model setting is similar to that of the present study therefore the proposed model could be practically used on a generic personal computer rather than requiring high performance computing resources it is encouraging that the time spent for actual optimization t op was almost negligible compared with the total estimation time at most 15 of the total estimation time in the given cases demonstrating the high computational efficiency of the proposed model fig 2 shows the estimation results of case 1 5 with 640 000 unknown hc values in this estimation the largest matrix to be stored in memory was only approximately 76 8 mb suggesting that the estimation could be performed on a relatively low performance computer the cc and srmse between the log transformed target fig 2a and estimated fig 2b hc were 0 692 and 0 489 respectively based on the distribution of monitoring wells many of the unobserved low and high hc structures were confirmed to be correctly estimated which could be determined more quantitatively from the calculated ssim value the ssim value from fig 2a and b was 0 663 indicating a reasonable structural similarity fig 2c and d show the similarity of gwls at the end of the simulation 1 day based on the hc fields in fig 2a and b respectively the distributions of true fig 2c and estimated fig 2d gwls showed considerable similarity in their spatial patterns fig 3 shows the true circle and estimated solid line level changes for each observation over time the average nsec value obtained from the gwls was 0 96 when the monitoring data showing level changes of less than 0 5 m monitoring wells 14 and 15 were excluded the average value close to 1 indicated that the spatiotemporal gwl changes observed from the sparsely distributed monitoring wells were precisely reproduced by the estimation at the end of the modflow simulation the nsec value between the true and estimated hydraulic heads of all grid cells in the model domain fig 2c and d was 0 97 indicating a strong similarity between the two hydraulic heads based on the overall analysis the hc field and gwl distributions in fig 2b and d are reliable estimates of the given data 3 2 estimation based on groundwater fluctuation in response to precipitation for estimation based on an inverse analysis the key factor in determining the size of an aquifer domain might be the extent of hydraulic interference i e the zone of influence of a pumping or slug test in aquifers with extremely high hc the extent of hydraulic interference by an aquifer test can be strongly constrained and characterization will be restricted within a narrow range this situation can be alleviated by introducing natural stimuli for which the process by which the stimuli induced gwl changes are well understood many natural sources are associated with gwl changes among them the process of gwl changes due to recharge from precipitation is remarkable in flat areas with a shallow water table groundwater recharge occurs over a large area thereby affecting groundwater dynamics across a watershed from which the spatial hydraulic properties of an aquifer can be estimated an additional advantage of aquifer characterization using groundwater recharge is that it requires no hydraulic tomography setup systematic pumping and observation distribution therefore the distribution of hydraulic properties can be grasped within an aquifer through inverse analysis with only data obtained from existing wells i e without the need to install additional wells in this context aquifer characterization using groundwater recharge can be a cost effective method especially over a large area whereas hydraulic tomography using existing pumping signal can be cost effective e g liu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge there is no known method for determining the exact amount of groundwater recharge scanlon et al 2002 healy and cook 2002 and uncertainty in the recharge rate estimate can propagate to the hydraulic property estimation therefore the feasibility of using groundwater fluctuation due to recharge to estimate hc distribution based on the proposed model was explored to characterize the hc of an aquifer groundwater recharge from precipitation was assumed to be the primary source of gwl change therefore in the modflow simulation the recharge rate shown in fig 1c was applied to the entire water table in addition a few tests were conducted to determine the effect of an incorrectly estimated recharge rate on hc estimation to produce an initial gwl a steady state flow simulation was performed before the transient simulation wherein a steady state recharge rate of 1 5 10 3 m d corresponding to the mean of the transient recharge rate fig 1c was used in the transient simulation a vector comprising 60 daily recharge rates was used as the input of the modflow simulation and the transient levels for 60 days were simulated unlike case 1 it was assumed that daily observations were made in 16 monitoring wells consequently 960 transient observation data points were obtained other than the groundwater recharge rate the hydraulic property statistics mean and standard deviation of log transformed hc and storage coefficient were the same as those in case 1 when the hc measurement of each well was available case 2 statistics such as the mean of the measurements at the monitoring wells could be reflected in the estimations based on the proposed model therefore in case 2 the mean was estimated from the samples of which the value could be different from the actual value 2 5 log transformed hc here a measurement error of 5 10 1 was assumed if the hc measurement was unavailable at each well case 3 an arbitrarily determined mean value which differed from the actual value of the true hc field was used as prior information in case 3 the prior mean value of the 1 0 log transformed hc was used fig 5 a and b respectively show the true hc field of case 2 and the estimated field based on gwl changes resulting from a series of 60 day recharge events in addition fig 5c and d show the true and estimated hydraulic head distributions at the end of the modflow simulation respectively the mean and variance of the estimated hc field of case 2 were 2 57 and 1 44 respectively indicating that the mean was close to that of the true field 2 5 whereas the variance was slightly underestimated compared to the true field 2 0 these results were unintentionally chosen as the best estimates which could be confirmed from the matlab code execution accompanying this manuscript visual inspection of the estimations revealed that the estimated hc and hydraulic head distribution showed considerable similarity to the true distributions in the estimation cpu times of 1 8 15 56 and 4 95 s were spent for preprocessing forward model runs and optimizations respectively therefore the total estimation time was less than 25 s the number of forward model runs for the estimation was 43 from the estimation the cc and srmse values between the target and estimated hc fields were 0 852 and 0 561 respectively fig 6 shows the observed hydrographs at the monitoring wells and the corresponding estimated hydrographs the nsec value between the observed and estimated hydrographs was 0 962 suggesting that the observations of gwl changes were well reflected in the estimation the ssim value between the true and estimated hc was 0 806 table 2 summarizes the estimated performance metrics for cases 2 5 the overall metrics indicated that a rational estimation was made for the true hc field further the groundwater flow simulation calibrated by the proposed model can predict future gwl changes hence it may be useful in the watershed management of groundwater resources fig 7 a and b show variance or relative estimation uncertainty maps respectively for the start g 0 and end g 10 of the estimation these uncertainty maps were obtained from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of u p 0 σ p 0 u p 0 σ p 0 t initial covariance matrix g 0 and u p g 10 σ p g 10 u p g 10 σ p g 10 t covariance matrix at g 10 the diagonal component of the covariance matrix could be obtained only with some operations using pcs without calculating the covariance matrix in this study the variance is termed the relative estimation uncertainty because the norm of the initial covariance matrix was forced to be unity i e σ p 0 σ p 0 1 as shown in fig 7a and b the uncertainties were significantly reduced over 10 generations of estimations following the estimation of g 10 we could visually confirm that some estimation uncertainty remained i e the distribution pattern differed from the initial pattern the relative estimation uncertainty map could be practically employed to determine the location of additional monitoring wells and the reliability of the estimated hc at a specific location although some measurement error was assumed the rational estimation result might be due to the use of the measured hc values for each monitoring well however in practical situations it is more common for each monitoring well to have no hc measurement therefore hc was estimated without direct information at the monitoring wells case 3 the results are shown in fig 8 in case 3 estimations over 20 generations g 20 were performed considering the slower rate of error reduction than in case 2 the slower rate of error reduction was due to the lack of direct information in case 3 unlike in case 2 as the number of generations increased the cpu times for the forward model runs and optimizations increased to 29 13 and 8 37 s respectively conversely the time for preprocessing slightly reduced to 1 15 s because the hc information was unconditioned in the estimation process of initial pcs the number of forward model runs for the estimation was 74 fig 5e and f show the estimated hc and hydraulic head distributions respectively although the similarity with the true map was not as good as the estimation conditioned by the hc measurements in fig 5b the estimated hc and hydraulic head distribution were reasonable showing consistency in terms of the locations of high and low values the mean and variance of the estimated hc field were 2 49 and 1 6 respectively the cc and srmse values between the target and estimated hc fields were 0 807 and 0 633 respectively the nsec value between the observed and estimated hydrographs fig 6b was 0 607 suggesting that the estimation reflects most of the information from gwl changes the ssim value between the true and estimated hc was 0 744 although the amount of information considerably decreased compared with case 2 the overall metrics suggested that the quality of the estimate of case 3 did not significantly decrease fig 7c and d show relative estimation uncertainty distributions for the start g 0 and end g 20 of estimation respectively the initial uncertainty of case 3 significantly differed from that of case 2 fig 7a and the distribution was closer to homogeneity the homogeneous uncertainty distribution was attributed to the absence of hc values at the monitoring well locations the slightly uneven distribution of uncertainty in fig 7c was due to the sparse sampling of the covariance matrix fig 7e and f show the scatterplots that compare the true and estimated hcs at all grid cells of cases 2 and 3 respectively the gray diagonal line is the one to one line i e where the true and estimated values coincide in addition as the color changed from blue to red the density of scatter points increased in fig 7 the scatter points generally follow the one to one line but case 2 s estimation tended to have a narrower distribution along the one to one line compared with case 2 in both plots underestimation and overestimation of high and low hc values respectively were evident resulting in reduced variance estimates compared with the actual values such smoothed estimations are commonly observed when sparse head measurements of a diffuse nature are used lee et al 2018 further improvements on the underestimated and overestimated values might be possible when tracer data are assimilated cirpka and kitanidis 2000 nowak and cirpka 2006 kang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 sánchez león et al 2020 however this is beyond the scope of this study fig 8 shows some initial and final pcs that constitute the g 0 and 20 estimates of case 3 the pcs were ordered from the largest to smallest singular value from pcs 1 8 the g 0 pcs were obtained from the covariance function used for composing the initial covariance matrix whereas the g 20 pcs were the results of their adaptation over 20 generations to the information provided gwls in the monitoring wells pcs with large singular values changed through adaptation over generations and showed different structures than the initial pcs because pc adaptation process is included within the algorithm the gpca es technique did not require a separate process to estimate the structural parameters such as correlation scales and their orientations 3 3 impact of inaccurately determined recharge rate the hc estimation in the previous section assumed that the recharge rate was accurately known however determining recharge rates at the basin scale typically involves a considerable amount of uncertainty and the rates can be inaccurately determined inaccurate recharge rates may introduce additional errors in estimating hc distribution therefore examining the influence of recharge rate containing errors on the estimated hc is necessary to assess the influence of an inaccurately determined recharge rate hc was estimated using the developed model by applying 40 increased case 4 and 40 decreased case 5 amounts compared with the actual rate then the results were compared with those presented in the previous section other than the recharge rate changes the conditions were identical to those of case 3 in the previous section fig 9 a shows the estimated hc based on a 40 recharge rate increase relative to the reference rate used in cases 2 and 3 the cpu times of the estimation were almost identical to those of case 3 from the figure the overall structural characteristics of the estimated hc were similar to those of the true field whereas the area showing high hc slightly expanded the ssim value between the true and estimated hc field was 0 718 and the srmse value was 0 798 quantitatively suggesting that the estimation reasonably represented the actual hc distribution pattern however the mean of the estimated field was 3 16 with a variance of 1 41 obviously the mean value overestimated that of the true field 2 5 which could be attributed to the recharge rate overestimation the overestimation could also be observed in the scatterplot of the true and estimated hcs at all grid cells in fig 9b in the figure most scatter points were congested on the upper portion of the diagonal line indicating that hc values were overestimated in addition the overestimated recharge rate might be observed in the inconsistent patterns between the estimated and true hydrographs fig 10 a shows the observed and estimated hydrographs at the monitoring well locations of case 4 wherein the fluctuation patterns of the gwls did not agree as in the previous cases cases 2 and 3 in all monitoring wells the actual hydrograph gently fluctuated whereas the estimated hydrograph fluctuated more sharply this inconsistency in the patterns of the hydrographs was revealed in the mean nsec value between the true and estimated hydrographs 0 122 the corresponding mean nsec value in case 3 was 0 607 table 2 fig 9c shows the results based on the estimation of a 40 recharge rate decrease case 5 relative to the reference the cpu estimation time was almost identical to that of case 3 the overall structural characteristics of the estimated hc field showed similarity with the true field similar to case 4 the ssim between the true and estimated hc field was 0 735 and the srmse value was 0 656 these values indicated that the performance in estimating the structural pattern was better than that of case 4 and close to that of case 3 the mean of the estimated field was 2 43 with a variance of 1 42 which was closer to the mean of the true field 2 5 than in case 4 therefore the effect of an underestimated recharge rate was not clearly reflected in the estimated hc field as observed in case 4 the scatterplot of the true and estimated hcs at all grid cells in fig 9d also supported this observation wherein the general distribution of the scatter points was along the one to one line of the graph similar to case 4 the effect of the underestimated recharge rate was recognizable from the gwl fluctuation patterns of the estimated and observed hydrographs fig 10b shows that the observed hydrographs fluctuated more sharply than the estimated hydrographs the degradation of the estimated hydrographs relative to the observed hydrographs could be quantitatively assessed using the mean nsec value which had a value of 0 396 the corresponding mean nsec value was 0 607 in case 2 table 2 based on the above results it can be stated that the structural characteristics of spatial hc distribution can be understood to some extent based on the proposed inverse analysis of gwl fluctuation due to precipitation even if the recharge rate used differs from the actual rate in addition if the assigned recharge rate considerably differs from the actual rate it can be recognized by comparing the gwl fluctuation patterns in the observed and estimated hydrographs it was shown that in terms of estimating hc the actual recharge rate underestimation was less erroneous than overestimation this observation might have important implications in terms of the practical implementation of this approach this study assumed a constant recharge rate across the entire basin further investigation is needed for validation of the approach although it is not shown in the above examples the estimation accuracy was highly sensitive to the number and distribution of monitoring wells if the distribution of the monitoring wells did not sufficiently constrain the statistical characteristics of the hc field the quality of the estimation could no longer be improved further if the number of monitoring wells was significantly limited the estimation became a more ill posed underdetermined problem and potentially fell to a local minimum without sufficient prior information in this case even if reasonable fitting of hydraulic head data was achieved the estimated hc field could be different from the desirable distribution particularly for diffusion problems such as the groundwater flow studies kitanidis 2015 4 summary and conclusions in this study a gpca es was applied to basin scale aquifer characterization problems based on the natural stimulus of recharge from precipitation for application to a basin scale area with a large number of unknowns improving the computational efficiency and memory usage of an existing model park 2020 was necessary accordingly the existing model was improved to rely only on a few pcs and not on a computationally cumbersome covariance matrix to demonstrate scalability the proposed model was applied to various discretized domains with several grid cells from a few thousand to 10 million from the application the developed model rationally estimated 10 million unknown hc values within 2150 s using a system equipped with two 2 7 ghz 24 core cpus 48 cores and 512 gb memory thereby confirming high scalability following the scalability test an estimation accuracy test was performed where the proposed model was employed to characterize hc distributions based on gwl fluctuation due to precipitation the timeseries data of gwls for 60 days were provided by 16 monitoring wells and the recharge rate was used in this test we considered two cases when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available and unavailable in addition we tested cases with perfectly known and erroneous recharge rates the estimation was better when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available where the recharge rate was inaccurately determined the accuracy generally deteriorated but the structural features of the estimated hc fields were similar to those of the estimation using the correctly determined recharge rate the strength of the proposed model is that the estimation could be done even if exact statistics such as mean variance and spatial correlation scales were unavailable this capability is possible because the proposed model performs global optimization by contrast certain similar conventional studies have assumed accurate prior knowledge which is not always available in practice this study showed that basin scale estimation is feasible when using groundwater recharge from precipitation as the source of gwl fluctuation by adopting natural stimuli such as the recharge rate the size of a domain to be estimated through an inverse analysis is virtually unlimited the scalability of the model is a crucial issue the proposed model could be applied to various hydrogeological problems due to the high computational efficiency and estimation accuracy and it was less constrained by prior information availability the proposed model can be combined with a nonlinear model requiring a longer simulation time for subsurface characterization because the estimation by the proposed model requires only a small number of forward model runs since the proposed model can efficiently estimate large hydraulic parameters it will be effectively used for modeling target interactions of various water bodies on a regional scale e g maxwell et al 2015

4179,in this study a non bayesian nonparametric model for characterization of the hydraulic properties of a basin scale aquifer is proposed based on the natural stimulus of recharge from precipitation via a geostatistical principal component adaptation evolution strategy we modified an existing model to use a low dimensional projection onto the principal component space as well as improve computational efficiency and memory requirements to illustrate the scalability of the proposed model we estimated about 10 million unknown hydraulic conductivities hcs which required only 35 min or less on a modern workstation to test the estimation accuracy the proposed model was employed to estimate several aquifer hc fields using timeseries data of groundwater levels of more than 60 days at 16 monitoring wells with the recharge rate provided two cases were considered when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available and unavailable in addition inversions were performed using perfectly known and erroneous recharge rates using various test configurations we found that the estimation was better when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available for inaccurately determined recharge rates the estimation accuracy generally deteriorated but the structural features of the estimated hc fields were similar to those obtained using the correctly assigned recharge rate regardless of the availability of hc measurements at the monitoring wells the proposed model estimated the distribution of hc reasonably well even when incorrect prior statistics of the mean and correlation scales were provided by demonstrating that an aquifer can be characterized at the basin scale using recharge from precipitation the relevance of the proposed model which had high computational efficiency was evident keywords basin scale aquifer characterization natural stimuli recharge rate evolution strategy geostatistics principal components 1 introduction with the exponential increase in population due to rapid urbanization and increasing extreme climate events caused by global climate change mccarthy et al 2001 groundwater storage as a major source of freshwater has become crucial as regional aquifers are connected through various flow paths the reliable management of groundwater resources must be carefully designed and implemented over a large area to minimize the impact of groundwater exploitation and pollution owing to the relevance of water resources and interactions between water bodies numerous studies even continental scale studies have been conducted e g maxwell et al 2015 de graaf et al 2020 which can contribute to insights into hydrological process interactions and water resource management when basin scale planning is employed water resources in surface and subsurface bodies can be managed more systematically and efficiently than otherwise yeh et al 2008 graymore et al 2008 therefore implementing basin scale monitoring programs that will help identify the hydraulic characteristics of aquifers for the basin scale management of groundwater resources is essential typically the equivalent homogeneous hydraulic properties of an aquifer based on type curve analysis of a single well test can be obtained from aquifer tests such as pumping and slug tests followed by the interpretation of the observed data zhou et al 2014 however conventional aquifer tests are limited because they do not allow the estimation of fine scale spatial changes in hydraulic properties that fluctuate within the support volume to estimate spatially varying hydraulic properties various models to characterize the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties via an inverse analysis of aquifer test data have been proposed among these models quasilinear or bayesian linear models kitanidis 1995 yeh et al 1996 are the most popular and numerous studies aimed at enhancing their accuracy and reducing their computation costs have been conducted cirpka and kitanidis 2000 yeh and liu 2000 liu et al 2002 2013 2014 nowak et al 2003 nowak and cirpka 2004 2006 cardiff and kitanidis 2009 nowak 2009 yin and illman 2009a 2009b saibaba and kitanidis 2012 ambikasaran et al 2013 kitanidis and lee 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 lin et al 2017 zha et al 2018 jeong and park 2019 ghorbanidehno et al 2020 in the two abovementioned models spatial and spatiotemporal changes in hydraulic head or tracer concentrations due to pumping or solute transport respectively at multiple monitoring locations were inversely analyzed through a successive linearization of an objective function to obtain the hydraulic properties of an aquifer however the value of the data is typically limited to the extent affected by the artificially imposed hydraulic stress i e pumping or by the effective solute transport distance moreover the range characterized by one such test is much smaller than the basin scale in areas with high permeability the situation can be exacerbated by a strong hydraulic diffusion process therefore the characterization of aquifer properties over a large area requires several hydraulic tests and a well designed monitoring network but pumping tests and monitoring well installations over a large area are expensive thus the inverse method has rarely been applied to basin scale characterization problems despite claims regarding its potential yeh et al 2008 in this situation as an alternative to artificial stress naturally imposed aquifer stresses natural stimuli such as precipitation atmospheric pressure changes tidal effects and river stage changes that influence large areas can be viably used in areas with a shallow water table recharge from precipitation exerts a substantial hydraulic stress on unconfined aquifers introducing a recharged water flux causes water table fluctuations the magnitude of which reflects the hydraulic properties of the aquifer park and parker 2008 park et al 2011 2021 park 2012 these water table fluctuations can be recorded at high frequency in the form of timeseries data at groundwater monitoring wells for example more than 1000 official groundwater monitoring wells are currently operated by government funded public corporations in south korea which measure hourly water table levels and provide daily data however the data obtained from these wells are mostly used only for qualitative trend analysis such as overall increases or decreases in groundwater levels gwls these data have rarely been used for systematic and in depth analysis combined with well established variably saturated flow models in particular with the recharge distribution gwl data can be used for the hydraulic characterization of aquifers over a large area to the best of our knowledge these water table fluctuation data have not been assimilated to characterize basin scale aquifers to address the abovementioned limitation in this study we propose a computationally efficient non bayesian nonparametric inverse model based on an evolution strategy es its potential is demonstrated by applying it to synthesized basin scale characterization scenarios unlike optimization based inversion models ess are generally robust to the low sensitivity of water table fluctuation observations this study follows a geostatistical es park 2020 as the key model for aquifer characterization however park s work 2020 was based on conventional methods of adapting the covariance matrix hence their model was not sufficiently computationally scalable to apply to a basin scale domain with a large number of grid cells therefore we modified the previous model by approximating the computationally cumbersome covariance matrix with a small number of principal components pcs for maximizing computational efficiency e g lee and kitanidis 2014 the proposed geostatistical es was subsequently tested through small synthetic basin scale aquifer characterization applications based on the synthesized idealized aquifer and simple boundary conditions the scalability of the proposed model was tested and the estimation accuracy of the hydraulic conductivity hc distribution using the groundwater table fluctuation measurements was demonstrated in addition the applicability of the proposed model to water table fluctuation based aquifer characterization was investigated via numerical tests 2 theoretical developments 2 1 improvement of geostatistical pc adaptation es gpca es for computational efficiency 2 1 1 summary of the previous model an es is classified as a global optimization model it is a non bayesian nonparametric model that minimizes an objective function over generations based on mutation and selection rules in this study generation means iteration of an estimation loop mutation uses information from intragenerational among the selected members and intergenerational between generations relationships to induce better reproduction of the population in the next generation conventionally this information is stored in a covariance matrix i e covariance matrix adaptation es cma es which evolves over generations in this respect ess show similarities to bayesian models in terms of optimizing the state vector using the covariance relationship however while selecting an algorithm a certain number of individuals are selected including the best fitted individuals to inform the next generation estimation via es in this respect follows a stochastic process with multiple possible estimates being made in each generation this study is similar to the previous studies hansen and ostermeier 2001 park 2020 in that it derives an optimal state vector e g distribution of hydraulic parameters through an es but with different details the most notable difference between the previous and current studies is that the previous studies repeatedly adapted the covariance matrix for estimations whereas this study directly updated the pc for improved computation efficiency this modification did not require large dense matrix operations during the estimation process therefore only a small memory footprint was required to estimate the domain of multiple grid cells in addition only a small matrix operation was allowed in the ensemble kalman filter enkf e g the covariance update operation used at each generation further improving computational efficiency compared with the previous study park 2020 in the es the basic equation for sampling the i th spatial state vectors i e the realization of a current unknown estimate y i such as hc at the estimation stage generation g 1 is defined as a linear stochastic model 1 y i g 1 m g σ g s g z i where g is the generation count up to the maximum number of generations iterations g max m g is the mean state vector with a size of n u 1 σ g is the step size s g is the mutation operation which will be explained later and z i is an n u 1 uncorrelated gaussian random vector sampled from n 0 i the population size i e the number of realizations is λ which is equal to the number of forward runs at the generation g in eq 1 y i g 1 is the n u 1 state vector n u is the dimension of the unknown spatial field and i indicates the i th individual estimate realization the mean state vector m g 1 at generation g 1 is determined from the weighted mean up to the μ th best of the population based on the following fitness measurement 2 m g 1 j 1 μ ω j y j λ g 1 where ω j is the unbiased positive weight coefficient ω j log μ 1 2 log j μ log μ 1 2 log i 1 μ i hansen and ostermeier 2001 y j λ g 1 is the j th best fitted state vector among the population λ the fitness is determined based on the root mean squared error rmse between the observed and estimated hydraulic heads μ is typically set to λ 2 in many ess the self adaptation of s g is the essential component for example in cma es the most popular version of the es s g is obtained from the square root of the adapted n u n u covariance matrix c g i e s g s g t c g in general ess an accurate initial estimation of the underlying covariance matrix that defines the relation between the locations of two unknown values is crucial to achieving fast convergence the geostatistical es introduced a reasonable initial covariance function via the conditioning of informed state variables through gaussian process regression or kriging however while covariance matrices can contain detailed information on the relationship among unknown values maintaining the covariance matrix is computationally cumbersome watersheds typically have very large spatial scales and high resolution estimation is often required in this case the storage and processing of complete covariance matrices c with cell counts of hundreds of thousands or more e g approximately 500 gb memory is required for storing a covariance matrix of 250 000 unknowns alone are often impractical this situation can be exacerbated when there is more than one unknown hydraulic parameter at each cell thus extensive efforts have been made to reduce the rank of the large matrices either covariance or hessian matrices they are identical in a gaussian context in the field of hydrogeology liu et al 2014 kitanidis and lee 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 zha et al 2018 similar low rank approximation methods can be adopted in es therefore we extended the strategy to obtain and store pcs of a covariance matrix rather than an entire covariance matrix in addition a method for directly updating the pcs without the need to reconstruct the covariance matrix was developed 2 1 2 improvements resulting from this study to perform a pc analysis pca on a high dimensional covariance matrix a randomized algorithm the cur matrix decomposition is applied mahoney and drineas 2009 saibaba et al 2016 wang et al 2021 to approximate the first few pcs using sparsely sampled rows of the large dense covariance matrix therefore the procedure of estimating the initial pcs is as follows 1 divide the covariance matrix into m partitions along the row direction 2 calculate the pcs of each partition by sparsely sampling the rows 3 store the partition wise pcs in the storage matrix 4 obtain the pcs approximating the entire covariance matrix from the storage matrix if conditioning information is present the conditional sampled covariance matrix corresponding to a partition m c m in the entire partitions is as follows 3 c m c 0 m c 1 m t c 2 1 c 1 where c m has dimensions of b n u b is the number of sampled rows c 0 m b n u is the sparsely sampled covariance matrix without conditioning c 1 o n u is a correlation matrix between all locations and observed locations corresponding to the sampled rows o is the number of observations c 2 o o is the correlation matrix among the observed locations and c 1 m o b corresponds to m 1 b 1 through mb rows of c 1 the entries of c 0 m c 1 and c 2 are calculated from a covariance function from the partitioned matrix a subset of singular values and vectors was obtained up to the k 0 th rank in terms of a singular value using the lanczos bidiagonalization method larsen 1998 baglama and reichel 2005 4 u m σ m v m t c m where u m n u k 0 is the left singular vector σ m k 0 k 0 is a diagonal matrix with the k 0 th largest singular values in order and v m n u k 0 is the right singular vector based on computation rate and storage we consistently used an empirically determined value of k 0 40 the obtained singular vectors were accumulated to a singular vector storage matrix for m 1 2 m 5 u 0 u 1 u 2 u m as high frequency sampling provides redundant information information accumulation was performed at sparse intervals the singular vector storage matrix of u 0 has the dimensions of n u k 0 m where k 0 m n u and the singular values were arranged as follows 6 σ 0 σ 1 0 0 0 0 σ 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 σ m where the singular value storage matrix σ 0 has the dimensions of k 0 m k 0 m from the stored information n pc n pc n u pcs are obtained using the following 7 u p 0 σ p 0 v p 0 t u 0 σ 0 a n d 8 σ p 0 σ p 0 σ p 0 2 where the matrix u p 0 includes the singular vectors pc vectors at the initial generation g 0 with dimensions of n u n pc σ p 0 is a diagonal matrix with the singular values pc values n pc n pc normalized by the euclidean norm and v p is a matrix with the principal directions n pc n pc the arrow represents substitution for computational efficiency small numbers of pcs n pc 2 0 were used for the entire case although a larger number of pcs might be used we confirmed via computational experiments that doing so yielded no significant improvement in the estimation performance using the derived pcs eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 9 y i g 1 m g σ g u p g σ p g z which is the basic equation for sampling the spatial state vectors of this study whereas eq 1 is the equation obtained from park 2020 in the es portions of the successful parents previous generation and offspring current generation are competitively involved in the evolution of the next offspring adaptation of u p g and σ p g such that 10 y g 1 y g 1 y μ ρ g where ρ is the mixing number μ here ρ 2 was consistently used where λ 10 and the minimum value of μ was set to 2 with the estimation update obtained via evolution an additional estimation update following the analysis covariance update in the enkf was employed the general equation of the estimation update by assimilating the observed data based on the enkf is as follows 11 p g 1 λ 1 λ g λ g λ g λ g t where p g n u n obs n u n obs is the ensemble covariance matrix of estimations λ g y t h est t t n u n obs λ n obs is the number of the hydraulic head y n u λ is a collection of estimated state vectors i e y i 1 λ g h est n obs λ is a collection of estimated hydraulic head values i e h est f y f is the forward model and λ g n u n obs λ is a matrix with replications of the ensemble mean vector of λ g then the kalman gain matrix k g n u n obs n obs and the updated state matrix λ g u n u n obs λ are respectively expressed as follows 12 k g p g h 1 t h 1 p g h 1 t r 1 a n d 13 λ g u λ g k g o r h 1 λ g ε o where h 1 n obs n u n obs is the observation matrix r ε o ε o t n obs 1 n obs n obs ε o n obs λ is the observation error matrix of measured hydraulic heads and o r n obs λ is the data matrix with the replicated hydraulic head measurement vector h obs in the above equations computation of p g involves a larger computational burden than that of a complete covariance matrix therefore to avoid complete computation of p g in obtaining k g a rank n e approximation of u l g σ l g v l g t λ g λ g was employed using an n e a subset of singular values and vectors where u l g σ l g and v l g have dimensions of n u n obs n e n e n e and n e n e respectively in this study n e was determined to be similar to n pc or k 0 based on the truncated singular vectors and values p g can be approximated by u l g σ l g 2 u l g t then eq 12 can be rewritten as follows 14 k g u l g σ l g 2 u lh g t u lh g σ l g 2 u lh g t r 1 where u lh g is equal to h 1 u l g which has small dimensions of n obs n e therefore the kalman gain matrix can be obtained using affordable computations without p g and the computational time of the enkf process is significantly less than that of park 2020 at the end of each generation the pcs of u p g and σ p g were updated to u p g 1 and σ p g 1 based on the information from simulations in that generation in this update the following cumulations of vectors and matrices with information regarding favorable evolution directions were used brand 2006 instead of a direct cumulation based on covariance matrices as in the conventional cma es approach 15 u p g u u

cumulation coefficient given to p c g and c kf is the cumulation coefficient given to λ g u λ g u the value of c 1 is determined to be 1 10 log n u 1 based on an algorithm proposed by loshchilov 2014 rather than updating the covariance matrix directly updating the pcs can provide significant computational benefits in terms of central processing unit cpu time and memory usage 2 2 performance metrics for estimation to quantify model performance various metrics such as the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsec nash and sutcliffe 1970 standardized rmse srmse correlation coefficient cc and structural similarity index ssim wang et al 2004 were employed in each estimation the nsec was employed to measure the fitness between the synthetic true and estimated values it is defined as follows 18 nsec 1 t 1 t h e t h o t 2 t 1 t h t t h t 2 where h e t is the estimated head at time t h t t is the true head at time t and h t is the mean value of the true heads the range of nsec is from to 1 and nsec 1 when the estimations are identical to the true heads thresholds for checking whether an inverse model results in a satisfactory estimation are given between 0 5 nsec 0 65 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 srmse was given by the regular rmse divided by the standard deviation of the targeted values which was primarily used to comprehensively measure the corresponding grid differences between the true and estimated hydraulic properties cc was used to measure the grid based similarity of the patterns between the true and estimated hydraulic properties although srmse and cc have often been used to measure overall similarity between true and estimated fields they are limited in their ability to represent the degree of structural similarity however ssim could be used to quantify the similarity in the structural pattern between true and estimated log hc fields sánchez león et al 2020 the formula for ssim is as follows 19 ssim 2 μ t μ e c 1 2 σ te c 2 μ t 2 μ e 2 c 1 σ t 2 σ e 2 c 2 where μ t and μ e are the means of the true and estimated fields respectively σ t 2 and σ e 2 are the variances of the true and estimated fields respectively σ te is the covariance between the true and estimated fields for c 1 and c 2 of eq 19 an extremely small number 2 22 10 16 was used 2 3 hypothetical heterogeneous model domain to evaluate the scalability and estimation accuracy of the proposed model a two dimensional 10 10 km heterogeneous hc field was created fig 1 a to represent a small basin scale aquifer the storage coefficient storativity was assumed to be 4 10 2 over the domain and the thickness in the vertical direction was set to 100 m the lower portion of the domain was bounded by an impermeable layer and the upper portion had an unconfined condition as the vertical scale was significantly smaller than the horizontal scale 1 100 the heterogeneity along the vertical direction was ignored therefore the domain could be considered a two dimensional unconfined aquifer the domain shape and boundary conditions of the case for the scalability test are depicted in fig 1a the eastern and western margins are the specified head boundaries with h 100 m in addition a strong hydraulic stress was assigned in the middle of the domain with h 80 m pw in fig 1a this strong hydraulic stress was assumed to be large scale pumping or civil works such as underground excavation or tunneling which drains large amounts of groundwater to facilitate construction for the southern and northern margins boundary conditions with a specified flux of zero h y 0 were assigned to test the scalability of the proposed model the domain was discretized with various grid sizes including 250 250 100 100 50 50 25 25 12 5 12 5 6 25 6 25 and 3 125 3 125 m grid cells corresponding to numbers of 1600 10 000 40 000 160 000 640 000 2 560 000 and 10 240 000 grid cells respectively in the scalability tests we assumed that there was no recharge therefore the main cause of gwl changes was a strong hydraulic stress in the middle of the domain for testing the estimation accuracy of hc distribution using temporally varying recharge rates the domain extent was set identically to that of the domain used for the scalability test in this test the domain was consistently discretized with a 50 50 m grid cell resulting in 40 000 grid cells the domain had a thin unsaturated zone above the water table and temporally varying recharge from precipitation was assumed to directly induce fluctuations in gwls the domain shape and boundary conditions for the predictability test are depicted in fig 1b the eastern margin is the specified head boundary with h 100 m whereas boundary conditions with a specified flux of zero h y 0 were assigned for other margins in the accuracy tests recharge from precipitation was assumed and the gwl changes were mainly due to a temporarily varying recharge rate at 16 randomly distributed monitoring wells ow in fig 1 only six are shown in the figure the transient hydraulic heads were measured with a measurement error of 0 01 m in the scalability tests the monitoring duration was 1 day and the monitoring interval was 0 2 days therefore 80 transient hydraulic head values were used for the estimations in the accuracy test recharge data for 60 days fig 4 was synthesized by referring to the precipitation rate and the recharge to precipitation ratio typically observed in the field sites the mean recharge rate was set to 1 5 10 3 m d with 28 recharge events therefore the simulation period was 60 days and 960 hydraulic head values 60 head values per well 16 monitoring wells were assimilated in the estimation the reason for using only the gwl for a short period was to consider that only short term data were available in some areas and show that the proposed model is valid in this case in the scalability tests estimations were performed assuming that a previously measured hc value was available at each monitoring well further in the accuracy tests we considered two additional configurations in which the hc measurements at each monitoring well were either available or unavailable when the measured hc values exist prior information i e mean and covariance for the estimation at g 0 was obtained from the values of the 16 monitoring wells therefore the obtained mean value depended on the location of each monitoring well and might differ from the actual mean value if hc measurements were available at the monitoring wells estimating hc data reflected a 0 5 log transformed measurement error when there were no hc values measured at the monitoring wells the mean and covariance were arbitrarily determined where the log transformed hc of 1 was consistently assumed as the prior mean value in the domain the hc fields were generated using the unconditional sequential gaussian simulation sgsim deutsch and journel 1992 the spherical variogram model was used and the correlation scales were arbitrarily input wherein the scale along the x direction was generally longer than that along the y direction for the proposed model x 500 m and y 500 m were consistently used as the correlation scales of initial pcs whereas the correlation scales used in sgsim for constructing the reference fields were x 5000 m and y 1500 m in the actual case no accurate spatial correlation of lengths could be obtained unless detailed investigations of the area were performed for each realization from sgsim a log transformed mean of 2 5 hc of approximately 12 18 m d and a variance of 2 0 were assumed 2 4 computation setup in the scalability tests a workstation equipped with two 2 7 ghz 24 core cpus 48 cores with 512 gb memory was used with windows 10 operating system and matlab 2020a using the parallel computing toolbox usgs modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 was used to simulate groundwater recharge and fluctuations without invasive modification of the code because the forward model runs in each generation were independent the computational efficiency could be increased through parallel computation notably for comparison we performed a few inversions for cases with unknown values of 40 000 or less using a personal computer equipped with a single 1 3 ghz 4 core cpu with 16 gb memory the efficient memory usage and computational algorithm developed in the proposed model significantly reduced computing resource requirements and the cpu times for the inversions between two machines were confirmed to be almost identical based on a problem with 40 000 unknown values the cpu time of the personal computer was only a few seconds longer than that of the high performance workstation which was because only a small number of forward model runs λ were used regardless the workstation was used for all implementations to handle large unknown cases with faster results 3 results and discussion 3 1 model scalability to demonstrate the proposed model s scalability the cpu times and number of forward model runs of seven cases with different numbers of unknowns 1600 case 1 1 10 000 case 1 2 40 000 case 1 3 160 000 case 1 4 640 000 case 1 5 2 560 000 case 1 6 and 10 240 000 case 1 7 were compared based on the cases the number of forward runs per estimation n fr and cumulative cpu times required for preprocessing t prep forward runs t fr and optimizations t op were compared with each other for the cpu times t prep is the time spent to estimate the initial pcs representing the spatial correlation of the targeted values a maximum of 10 generations g max 10 was used for all estimations when comparing cpu times because all estimations converged to a predefined simulation ending criterion srmse between h obs and h est of less than 0 5 m before reaching 10 generations in all estimations five hydraulic head measurements were assumed to be available at each monitoring well for which the interval was consistently 0 2 days therefore the total simulation time was 1 day in addition only n pc 20 20 largest pcs in terms of singular value was used for updating the estimations and 10 or less forward runs were performed per generation the number of forward model runs was set to gradually decrease based on the srmse of each generation under this configuration one expects o λ g max forward model runs with o n u n obs n pc matrix operation costs table 1 summarizes the number of forward model runs and the corresponding cpu times in all estimations the srmse and cc values between the targets and estimated hc fields were less than 1 5 and greater than 0 7 respectively the ssim values were greater than 0 65 for all cases indicating that the structure of the estimated hc field was similar to that of the true field overall the observations suggested that acceptable estimations were performed by the proposed model during the scalability tests as shown in table 1 the estimation with more than ten million unknowns terminated at 2143 1 s approximately 35 7 min or 0 6 h which indicated a significant computational efficiency improvement compared with that of park 2020 in park s work 2020 the cpu times for 1600 10 000 and 40 000 unknowns were 28 124 and 1640 s respectively further comparisons could not be made because the previous model was unable to handle a large number of grid cells due to the large memory requirement for saving and updating the covariance matrix by contrast only a relatively small amount of memory was required to handle a few pcs in the proposed model by comparing the results the computational efficiency of the proposed model yielded an improvement of 244 times more than the previous model based on the 40 000 unknowns case although all estimations were terminated at 10 generations the numbers of forward model runs were different because of different convergence histories in most estimations 50 80 of the total cpu time was spent on forward model runs moreover the number of forward model runs performed for each estimation was about 50 suggesting that the proposed model could be effectively used to characterize a subsurface using a nonlinear simulator e g a multiphase flow simulator which required a much longer single run time than that of the proposed model considering that less than 100 000 grids are typically used in many of the practical two dimensional groundwater flow modeling simulations it will take a few tens to a maximum of 100 s for estimating hc distribution using the proposed model when the forward model setting is similar to that of the present study therefore the proposed model could be practically used on a generic personal computer rather than requiring high performance computing resources it is encouraging that the time spent for actual optimization t op was almost negligible compared with the total estimation time at most 15 of the total estimation time in the given cases demonstrating the high computational efficiency of the proposed model fig 2 shows the estimation results of case 1 5 with 640 000 unknown hc values in this estimation the largest matrix to be stored in memory was only approximately 76 8 mb suggesting that the estimation could be performed on a relatively low performance computer the cc and srmse between the log transformed target fig 2a and estimated fig 2b hc were 0 692 and 0 489 respectively based on the distribution of monitoring wells many of the unobserved low and high hc structures were confirmed to be correctly estimated which could be determined more quantitatively from the calculated ssim value the ssim value from fig 2a and b was 0 663 indicating a reasonable structural similarity fig 2c and d show the similarity of gwls at the end of the simulation 1 day based on the hc fields in fig 2a and b respectively the distributions of true fig 2c and estimated fig 2d gwls showed considerable similarity in their spatial patterns fig 3 shows the true circle and estimated solid line level changes for each observation over time the average nsec value obtained from the gwls was 0 96 when the monitoring data showing level changes of less than 0 5 m monitoring wells 14 and 15 were excluded the average value close to 1 indicated that the spatiotemporal gwl changes observed from the sparsely distributed monitoring wells were precisely reproduced by the estimation at the end of the modflow simulation the nsec value between the true and estimated hydraulic heads of all grid cells in the model domain fig 2c and d was 0 97 indicating a strong similarity between the two hydraulic heads based on the overall analysis the hc field and gwl distributions in fig 2b and d are reliable estimates of the given data 3 2 estimation based on groundwater fluctuation in response to precipitation for estimation based on an inverse analysis the key factor in determining the size of an aquifer domain might be the extent of hydraulic interference i e the zone of influence of a pumping or slug test in aquifers with extremely high hc the extent of hydraulic interference by an aquifer test can be strongly constrained and characterization will be restricted within a narrow range this situation can be alleviated by introducing natural stimuli for which the process by which the stimuli induced gwl changes are well understood many natural sources are associated with gwl changes among them the process of gwl changes due to recharge from precipitation is remarkable in flat areas with a shallow water table groundwater recharge occurs over a large area thereby affecting groundwater dynamics across a watershed from which the spatial hydraulic properties of an aquifer can be estimated an additional advantage of aquifer characterization using groundwater recharge is that it requires no hydraulic tomography setup systematic pumping and observation distribution therefore the distribution of hydraulic properties can be grasped within an aquifer through inverse analysis with only data obtained from existing wells i e without the need to install additional wells in this context aquifer characterization using groundwater recharge can be a cost effective method especially over a large area whereas hydraulic tomography using existing pumping signal can be cost effective e g liu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge there is no known method for determining the exact amount of groundwater recharge scanlon et al 2002 healy and cook 2002 and uncertainty in the recharge rate estimate can propagate to the hydraulic property estimation therefore the feasibility of using groundwater fluctuation due to recharge to estimate hc distribution based on the proposed model was explored to characterize the hc of an aquifer groundwater recharge from precipitation was assumed to be the primary source of gwl change therefore in the modflow simulation the recharge rate shown in fig 1c was applied to the entire water table in addition a few tests were conducted to determine the effect of an incorrectly estimated recharge rate on hc estimation to produce an initial gwl a steady state flow simulation was performed before the transient simulation wherein a steady state recharge rate of 1 5 10 3 m d corresponding to the mean of the transient recharge rate fig 1c was used in the transient simulation a vector comprising 60 daily recharge rates was used as the input of the modflow simulation and the transient levels for 60 days were simulated unlike case 1 it was assumed that daily observations were made in 16 monitoring wells consequently 960 transient observation data points were obtained other than the groundwater recharge rate the hydraulic property statistics mean and standard deviation of log transformed hc and storage coefficient were the same as those in case 1 when the hc measurement of each well was available case 2 statistics such as the mean of the measurements at the monitoring wells could be reflected in the estimations based on the proposed model therefore in case 2 the mean was estimated from the samples of which the value could be different from the actual value 2 5 log transformed hc here a measurement error of 5 10 1 was assumed if the hc measurement was unavailable at each well case 3 an arbitrarily determined mean value which differed from the actual value of the true hc field was used as prior information in case 3 the prior mean value of the 1 0 log transformed hc was used fig 5 a and b respectively show the true hc field of case 2 and the estimated field based on gwl changes resulting from a series of 60 day recharge events in addition fig 5c and d show the true and estimated hydraulic head distributions at the end of the modflow simulation respectively the mean and variance of the estimated hc field of case 2 were 2 57 and 1 44 respectively indicating that the mean was close to that of the true field 2 5 whereas the variance was slightly underestimated compared to the true field 2 0 these results were unintentionally chosen as the best estimates which could be confirmed from the matlab code execution accompanying this manuscript visual inspection of the estimations revealed that the estimated hc and hydraulic head distribution showed considerable similarity to the true distributions in the estimation cpu times of 1 8 15 56 and 4 95 s were spent for preprocessing forward model runs and optimizations respectively therefore the total estimation time was less than 25 s the number of forward model runs for the estimation was 43 from the estimation the cc and srmse values between the target and estimated hc fields were 0 852 and 0 561 respectively fig 6 shows the observed hydrographs at the monitoring wells and the corresponding estimated hydrographs the nsec value between the observed and estimated hydrographs was 0 962 suggesting that the observations of gwl changes were well reflected in the estimation the ssim value between the true and estimated hc was 0 806 table 2 summarizes the estimated performance metrics for cases 2 5 the overall metrics indicated that a rational estimation was made for the true hc field further the groundwater flow simulation calibrated by the proposed model can predict future gwl changes hence it may be useful in the watershed management of groundwater resources fig 7 a and b show variance or relative estimation uncertainty maps respectively for the start g 0 and end g 10 of the estimation these uncertainty maps were obtained from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of u p 0 σ p 0 u p 0 σ p 0 t initial covariance matrix g 0 and u p g 10 σ p g 10 u p g 10 σ p g 10 t covariance matrix at g 10 the diagonal component of the covariance matrix could be obtained only with some operations using pcs without calculating the covariance matrix in this study the variance is termed the relative estimation uncertainty because the norm of the initial covariance matrix was forced to be unity i e σ p 0 σ p 0 1 as shown in fig 7a and b the uncertainties were significantly reduced over 10 generations of estimations following the estimation of g 10 we could visually confirm that some estimation uncertainty remained i e the distribution pattern differed from the initial pattern the relative estimation uncertainty map could be practically employed to determine the location of additional monitoring wells and the reliability of the estimated hc at a specific location although some measurement error was assumed the rational estimation result might be due to the use of the measured hc values for each monitoring well however in practical situations it is more common for each monitoring well to have no hc measurement therefore hc was estimated without direct information at the monitoring wells case 3 the results are shown in fig 8 in case 3 estimations over 20 generations g 20 were performed considering the slower rate of error reduction than in case 2 the slower rate of error reduction was due to the lack of direct information in case 3 unlike in case 2 as the number of generations increased the cpu times for the forward model runs and optimizations increased to 29 13 and 8 37 s respectively conversely the time for preprocessing slightly reduced to 1 15 s because the hc information was unconditioned in the estimation process of initial pcs the number of forward model runs for the estimation was 74 fig 5e and f show the estimated hc and hydraulic head distributions respectively although the similarity with the true map was not as good as the estimation conditioned by the hc measurements in fig 5b the estimated hc and hydraulic head distribution were reasonable showing consistency in terms of the locations of high and low values the mean and variance of the estimated hc field were 2 49 and 1 6 respectively the cc and srmse values between the target and estimated hc fields were 0 807 and 0 633 respectively the nsec value between the observed and estimated hydrographs fig 6b was 0 607 suggesting that the estimation reflects most of the information from gwl changes the ssim value between the true and estimated hc was 0 744 although the amount of information considerably decreased compared with case 2 the overall metrics suggested that the quality of the estimate of case 3 did not significantly decrease fig 7c and d show relative estimation uncertainty distributions for the start g 0 and end g 20 of estimation respectively the initial uncertainty of case 3 significantly differed from that of case 2 fig 7a and the distribution was closer to homogeneity the homogeneous uncertainty distribution was attributed to the absence of hc values at the monitoring well locations the slightly uneven distribution of uncertainty in fig 7c was due to the sparse sampling of the covariance matrix fig 7e and f show the scatterplots that compare the true and estimated hcs at all grid cells of cases 2 and 3 respectively the gray diagonal line is the one to one line i e where the true and estimated values coincide in addition as the color changed from blue to red the density of scatter points increased in fig 7 the scatter points generally follow the one to one line but case 2 s estimation tended to have a narrower distribution along the one to one line compared with case 2 in both plots underestimation and overestimation of high and low hc values respectively were evident resulting in reduced variance estimates compared with the actual values such smoothed estimations are commonly observed when sparse head measurements of a diffuse nature are used lee et al 2018 further improvements on the underestimated and overestimated values might be possible when tracer data are assimilated cirpka and kitanidis 2000 nowak and cirpka 2006 kang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 sánchez león et al 2020 however this is beyond the scope of this study fig 8 shows some initial and final pcs that constitute the g 0 and 20 estimates of case 3 the pcs were ordered from the largest to smallest singular value from pcs 1 8 the g 0 pcs were obtained from the covariance function used for composing the initial covariance matrix whereas the g 20 pcs were the results of their adaptation over 20 generations to the information provided gwls in the monitoring wells pcs with large singular values changed through adaptation over generations and showed different structures than the initial pcs because pc adaptation process is included within the algorithm the gpca es technique did not require a separate process to estimate the structural parameters such as correlation scales and their orientations 3 3 impact of inaccurately determined recharge rate the hc estimation in the previous section assumed that the recharge rate was accurately known however determining recharge rates at the basin scale typically involves a considerable amount of uncertainty and the rates can be inaccurately determined inaccurate recharge rates may introduce additional errors in estimating hc distribution therefore examining the influence of recharge rate containing errors on the estimated hc is necessary to assess the influence of an inaccurately determined recharge rate hc was estimated using the developed model by applying 40 increased case 4 and 40 decreased case 5 amounts compared with the actual rate then the results were compared with those presented in the previous section other than the recharge rate changes the conditions were identical to those of case 3 in the previous section fig 9 a shows the estimated hc based on a 40 recharge rate increase relative to the reference rate used in cases 2 and 3 the cpu times of the estimation were almost identical to those of case 3 from the figure the overall structural characteristics of the estimated hc were similar to those of the true field whereas the area showing high hc slightly expanded the ssim value between the true and estimated hc field was 0 718 and the srmse value was 0 798 quantitatively suggesting that the estimation reasonably represented the actual hc distribution pattern however the mean of the estimated field was 3 16 with a variance of 1 41 obviously the mean value overestimated that of the true field 2 5 which could be attributed to the recharge rate overestimation the overestimation could also be observed in the scatterplot of the true and estimated hcs at all grid cells in fig 9b in the figure most scatter points were congested on the upper portion of the diagonal line indicating that hc values were overestimated in addition the overestimated recharge rate might be observed in the inconsistent patterns between the estimated and true hydrographs fig 10 a shows the observed and estimated hydrographs at the monitoring well locations of case 4 wherein the fluctuation patterns of the gwls did not agree as in the previous cases cases 2 and 3 in all monitoring wells the actual hydrograph gently fluctuated whereas the estimated hydrograph fluctuated more sharply this inconsistency in the patterns of the hydrographs was revealed in the mean nsec value between the true and estimated hydrographs 0 122 the corresponding mean nsec value in case 3 was 0 607 table 2 fig 9c shows the results based on the estimation of a 40 recharge rate decrease case 5 relative to the reference the cpu estimation time was almost identical to that of case 3 the overall structural characteristics of the estimated hc field showed similarity with the true field similar to case 4 the ssim between the true and estimated hc field was 0 735 and the srmse value was 0 656 these values indicated that the performance in estimating the structural pattern was better than that of case 4 and close to that of case 3 the mean of the estimated field was 2 43 with a variance of 1 42 which was closer to the mean of the true field 2 5 than in case 4 therefore the effect of an underestimated recharge rate was not clearly reflected in the estimated hc field as observed in case 4 the scatterplot of the true and estimated hcs at all grid cells in fig 9d also supported this observation wherein the general distribution of the scatter points was along the one to one line of the graph similar to case 4 the effect of the underestimated recharge rate was recognizable from the gwl fluctuation patterns of the estimated and observed hydrographs fig 10b shows that the observed hydrographs fluctuated more sharply than the estimated hydrographs the degradation of the estimated hydrographs relative to the observed hydrographs could be quantitatively assessed using the mean nsec value which had a value of 0 396 the corresponding mean nsec value was 0 607 in case 2 table 2 based on the above results it can be stated that the structural characteristics of spatial hc distribution can be understood to some extent based on the proposed inverse analysis of gwl fluctuation due to precipitation even if the recharge rate used differs from the actual rate in addition if the assigned recharge rate considerably differs from the actual rate it can be recognized by comparing the gwl fluctuation patterns in the observed and estimated hydrographs it was shown that in terms of estimating hc the actual recharge rate underestimation was less erroneous than overestimation this observation might have important implications in terms of the practical implementation of this approach this study assumed a constant recharge rate across the entire basin further investigation is needed for validation of the approach although it is not shown in the above examples the estimation accuracy was highly sensitive to the number and distribution of monitoring wells if the distribution of the monitoring wells did not sufficiently constrain the statistical characteristics of the hc field the quality of the estimation could no longer be improved further if the number of monitoring wells was significantly limited the estimation became a more ill posed underdetermined problem and potentially fell to a local minimum without sufficient prior information in this case even if reasonable fitting of hydraulic head data was achieved the estimated hc field could be different from the desirable distribution particularly for diffusion problems such as the groundwater flow studies kitanidis 2015 4 summary and conclusions in this study a gpca es was applied to basin scale aquifer characterization problems based on the natural stimulus of recharge from precipitation for application to a basin scale area with a large number of unknowns improving the computational efficiency and memory usage of an existing model park 2020 was necessary accordingly the existing model was improved to rely only on a few pcs and not on a computationally cumbersome covariance matrix to demonstrate scalability the proposed model was applied to various discretized domains with several grid cells from a few thousand to 10 million from the application the developed model rationally estimated 10 million unknown hc values within 2150 s using a system equipped with two 2 7 ghz 24 core cpus 48 cores and 512 gb memory thereby confirming high scalability following the scalability test an estimation accuracy test was performed where the proposed model was employed to characterize hc distributions based on gwl fluctuation due to precipitation the timeseries data of gwls for 60 days were provided by 16 monitoring wells and the recharge rate was used in this test we considered two cases when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available and unavailable in addition we tested cases with perfectly known and erroneous recharge rates the estimation was better when hc measurements at the monitoring wells were available where the recharge rate was inaccurately determined the accuracy generally deteriorated but the structural features of the estimated hc fields were similar to those of the estimation using the correctly determined recharge rate the strength of the proposed model is that the estimation could be done even if exact statistics such as mean variance and spatial correlation scales were unavailable this capability is possible because the proposed model performs global optimization by contrast certain similar conventional studies have assumed accurate prior knowledge which is not always available in practice this study showed that basin scale estimation is feasible when using groundwater recharge from precipitation as the source of gwl fluctuation by adopting natural stimuli such as the recharge rate the size of a domain to be estimated through an inverse analysis is virtually unlimited the scalability of the model is a crucial issue the proposed model could be applied to various hydrogeological problems due to the high computational efficiency and estimation accuracy and it was less constrained by prior information availability the proposed model can be combined with a nonlinear model requiring a longer simulation time for subsurface characterization because the estimation by the proposed model requires only a small number of forward model runs since the proposed model can efficiently estimate large hydraulic parameters it will be effectively used for modeling target interactions of various water bodies on a regional scale e g maxwell et al 2015
