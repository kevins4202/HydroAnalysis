11885,the ghiss watershed located in a mediterranean semi arid area is currently experiencing a prolonged drought the scarcity of potable surface water has driven the population and the government to intensify the exploration of groundwater resources conventional methods used for groundwater exploration are generally expensive time consuming and are limited in space therefore we suggest with the present study the application of geospatial techniques geographical information systems gis and remote sensing and multi criteria decision analysis as a non conventional and more accessible method of groundwater exploration in the ghiss basin accordingly eleven factors of high importance concerning the delineation of groundwater potential zones were weighted depending on their relative importance using the analytical hierarchy process s ahp pairwise comparison matrix the gis based analysis of multiple thematic layers drainage density lineament density roughness lithology land use and land cover elevation curvature topographic wetness index topographic position index rainfall and slope has revealed that poor and moderate groundwater potential constitute respectively 7 58 59 km2 and 55 460 35 km2 of the area while good and very good groundwater potential represent respectively 35 292 95 km2 and only 3 25 11 km2 of the area our model results were validated using depth to water level dwl data of the ghiss watershed and this comparison showed an acceptable conformity 70 with gwpzs mapped for the ghiss basin it was also determined that the degree of conformity to generated gwpz models using fewer parameters is comparable to those using more parameters our results indicate that two parameters lineament density and lithology were sufficient to obtain a similar conformity 68 with depth to water level data graphical abstract image 1 keywords gwpz modeling gis remote sensing ahp fewer parameters al hoceima 1 introduction groundwater is the most valuable source of freshwater resources worldwide this precious natural resource provides an important share of potable water for the needs of both rural and urban areas furthermore its availability in significant quantity and high quality contributes to sustainable development of nations due to its usage in vital activities poor resource management and ongoing increases in water consumption due to continuing population growth has resulted in a shortage of conventional surface water in many regions often surface water sources are unevenly distributed in space and in time and do not meet basic population requirements to alleviate surface water scarcity and to avoid its degradation there is recourse to groundwater exploitation as an alternative nevertheless continued overexploitation of aquifers due to various anthropogenic activities renders this precious resource threatened by continuous depletion in addition to aquifer exhaustion the unplanned reliance on groundwater can consequently contribute to environmental degradation and seawater intrusion in coastal areas samani 2021 therefore groundwater usage requires sustainable and wise management especially in arid and semi arid areas which are more affected by water shortage yifru et al 2020 an important step toward a robust management of groundwater exploitation is mapping groundwater potential zones gwpzs for this purpose different methods based on indirect analysis are employed such as geophysical survey hydrogeological investigations and test drilling arulbalaji et al 2019 shishaye and abdi 2016 yeh et al 2009 these traditional techniques are still the most widely used in morocco for studies related to groundwater exploration and are considered very costly time consuming and limited to easy access regions aykut 2021 consequently the hydrogeology of the study area is not well investigated and it is limited to a restricted area of the basin chafouq et al 2016 2017 himi et al 2017 kouz et al 2018 the province of al hoceima is a semi arid region and lacks conventional surface water sources according to estimates from onee 2017 water needs should rise from 11 8 mcm year in 2017 to 15 2 mcm year by the year of 2040 consequently the estimated deficit is forecasted to rise from 2 8 mcm year 2017 to 12 2 mcm year by 2040 table 1 therefore a thorough understanding of groundwater distribution in the study area is necessary for more effective water resources management anantha et al 2021 singh et al 2018 towards this end integration of spatial analysis tools such as geographic information systems gis and remote sensing rs as a preliminary step could help decision makers understand the spatial distribution of groundwater techniques utilizing such tools are rapid low cost and can analyze an extensive region arulbalaji et al 2019 patra et al 2018 siddi raju et al 2019 tweed et al 2007 yeh et al 2009 ziani et al 2021 moreover such techniques can consider a vast amount of spatial data when assessing potential groundwater sources arulbalaji et al 2019 singh et al 2018 many authors have noted the high reliability of results obtained from geospatial techniques arefin 2020 arulbalaji et al 2019 rao and jugran 2003 sahoo et al 2015 the combination of these techniques with the multi criteria decision analysis mcda has also been shown to be effective in the delineation of groundwater potential zones alikhanov et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 arunbose et al 2021 bourjila et al 2020 jesiya and gopinath 2020 pathak et al 2021 singh et al 2021 thus one of the objectives of the current study is to map the groundwater potential zones in the ghiss basin by integrating gis remote sensing and analytical hierarchy process ahp techniques we intend by the creation of this map to identify the location of potential productive wells in the study area and also provide a digital database that can be utilized by decision makers in developing effective sustainable groundwater management plans to cope with the lack of surface water in the region the delineation of groundwater potential zones requires a careful selection of the type and number of factors the factors controlling groundwater occurrence have already been identified by specialists and include lineament density geology lithology elevation geomorphology soil drainage density slope land use land cover lulc rainfall topographic wetness index twi roughness curvature etc the number of factors that have been used to delineate gwpzs differs from one study to another for example the authors arunbose et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 sutradhar et al 2021a singh et al 2021 aykut 2021 jesiya and gopinath 2020 devi and nair 2021 and murasingh et al 2018 have used 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 and 6 parameters in their analyses respectively furthermore some studies have assessed the sensitivity of the influencing factors e g verma and patel 2021 and revealed that lithology lineament density and geomorphology are the most influential factors in the delineation of groundwater potential zones in lower the rihand river basin india and pathak et al 2021 have showed that lineament density and hydrogeomorphology are the most influential in the mountainous region of nepal himalaya however no studies have been carried out to assess the influence of reducing the number of parameters on the reliability of the calculated gwpzs models accordingly the second objective of this study is to understand how a reduced number of factors affects the validity of the delineated gwpzs for this purpose we will develop ten gwpzs models each calculated with a different set of factors the main gwpzs model will be calculated using eleven factors while the rest will be calculated using fewer factors reducing at each time the factor with the lowest weight until keeping only two factors a comparison will be made to determine whether the use of fewer factors is sufficient to demarcate groundwater potential zones if so then studies related to the delineation of gwpzs can rely on fewer factors relying on fewer factors in modeling gwpzs would facilitate better management practice in areas where there is a lack of data like most of the mountainous regions of morocco table 2 provides a list of abbreviations that we use in this paper 2 description of the study area the ghiss basin is located southwest of al hoceima city in northern morocco between 34 48 n and 35 11 n latitude 03 49 w and 04 26 w longitude fig 1 the basin covers a geographical area of approximately 837 square kilometers characterized by a rugged and complex terrain with an altitude range from 6 to 2032 m msl the ghiss river which is around 80 km in length is a sixth order stream and it drains from southwest to northeast flowing into the mediterranean sea the river basin is bordered from the north by the boufrah snada bouskour basin and the nekor basin from the south its slopes are steep at more than 35 and composed of brittle formations of shale marl and marl limestone additionally the protective cover of vegetation in this area is marked by a noticeable regression el motaki et al 2019 the combination of these factors affects the stability of the watershed which is characterized by active erosion bensiali 2020 el motaki et al 2019 salhi and benabdelouahab 2017 likewise a qualitative assessment of erosion in the ghiss basin led by bensiali 2020 has revealed that 28 43 238 37 km2 16 51 138 37 km2 25 64 214 84 km2 23 23 194 38 km2 and 6 19 51 89 km2 of the area show respectively very high high moderate low and very low erodibility the ghiss basin belongs to the flysch nappes zone and these nappes appear in the form of klippes at the tops of the highest peaks michard et al 2006 the flysch nappes are bounded to the east by the nekor fault and are separated from the internal domain named alboran domain to the west by the jebha fault fig 2 gimeno vives et al 2020 the climate of the province of al hoceima is mediterranean semi arid with dry hot summers and rainy cold winters the relative dryness of the area is aggravated by the interannual irregularity of rainfall the average annual rainfall in the meteorological station of targuist is 454 mm while the average of snowfall is 5 days the mountains of targuist are the main source of water feeding of the ghiss river low flow rate of 800 l s and most of the inflows are recorded in the form of floods due to torrential hydrological regimes in the area the annual mean temperature is 17 c the warmest temperature in the study area varies between 13 8 c and 34 6 c while the coldest temperature ranges between 3 8 c and 19 1 c table 3 the aquifer dominating the area is the unconfined aquifer of ghiss nekor fig 4 covering an area of about 100 square km it circulates in plio quaternary alluvium whose average thickness is about 240 m it is characterized by its easy exploitation and vulnerability to pollution chafouq et al 2017 according to the latest official census in rural communes hcp 2011 which has been done by the high commission of planning in morocco the rural communes belonging to the ghiss basin contain a distribution of at least 172 wells fig 3 in the lower part of the ghiss nekor plain the water table is less than 5 m deep and the total groundwater reserve in the basin is estimated at approximately 328 mcm million cubic meters onee 2017 the ghiss river is currently undergoing the installation of a new dam located about 23 km upstream from its mouth to cope with the effects of climate change and the increasing water needs in the al hoceima region 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources in the current study we used satellite imagery and conventional maps to prepare the 11 thematic maps considered of great importance in defining gwpzs in the ghiss basin the rs data landsat 8 oli was used to create the lineament map in geomatica banff software which was integrated later in a gis environment arcgis 10 8 to generate the lineament density map the same satellite image was used to create the lulc map by employing a supervised classification tool in gis geomatica and arcgis software are powerful tools and are widely used in studies dealing with groundwater delineation such as ahirwar et al 2020 arunbose et al 2021 aykut 2021 ghosh et al 2020 and murasingh et al 2018 these tools help to ensure rapid and accurate analysis of spatial information the aster gdem global digital elevation model 30 m resolution was utilized to retrieve data regarding the ghiss basin boundary drainage density elevation roughness slope topographic position index tpi topographic wetness index twi and the curvature maps the drainage density elevation roughness and slope maps were calculated using the gis spatial analyst tool the curvature map was made using arcgis 3d analyst the tpi map was prepared using jenness algorithm as a gis topographic tool jenness 2006 while we used the gis map algebra tool to generate the twi map shukla 2017 the two previous satellite images were downloaded from the usgs earthexplorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov the 2019 dataset from climatic research unit cru https sites uea ac uk cru was used to create the rainfall map we utilized the kriging geostatistical method for the pretreatment and the interpolation of the rainfall datasets this method guarantees high accuracy of the estimated surfaces of the interpolated data el hamidi et al 2018 ferchichi et al 2018 karami et al 2018 the lithological map was obtained from digitizing the geologic map of the rif chain at 1 500 000 scale published in 1980 by the moroccan ministry of energy and mines the hydrogeological map of the ghiss basin was digitized using the map of unconfined aquifers and streams in the province of al hoceima provided by the ministry of land use planning water and the environment in 2007 while the depth to water level data were obtained during a field survey conducted in june and july of 2021 the produced thematic layers were all resampled to a cell resolution of 28 m prior to using the weighted overlay analysis 3 2 gis mcd analysis the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a multi criteria decision analysis method developed by saaty 1980 this approach has been widely applied by scientists in the studies of qualitative measures aykut 2021 shao et al 2020 arulbalaji et al 2019 singh et al 2018 the ahp method was employed in the delineation of gwpzs in the ghiss basin by integrating the criteria most affecting the distribution of groundwater firstly we assigned appropriate weights to the eleven factors according to the opinions of experts and recent literature such as alikhanov et al 2021 achu et al 2020 arefin 2020 bourjila et al 2020 and arulbalaji et al 2019 secondly we compared the factors using a pairwise comparison matrix table 4 in which the saaty relative importance scale was applied table 5 the third step consisted of applying weights to the subclasses in each parameter by using a scale of 1 9 with 9 being the most suitable the results of the weighting is shown in table 6 finally the consistency ratio cr was estimated using equation 1 1 c r c i r i ci represents the consistency index whereas ri represents the random index values for ri rely on a number of factors that have been used in this study and was determined by applying saaty s standard table saaty 1990 the ri for the current study is 1 51 ci was calculated using equation 2 2 c i λ m a x n n 1 λmax the principal eigenvalue was calculated using the eigenvector technique table 7 khashei siuki et al 2020 and n is the number of parameters which is 11 in the present study to be acceptable the cr should be less or equal to 0 10 thus if the cr is higher than 0 10 therefore the pairwise comparison should be revised in the present study λmax 12 50 ci 0 15 and cr 0 099 consequently the inconsistency is acceptable and the weights assigned logically to the parameters 3 3 the weighted overlay analysis to generate the gwpzs map we employed a weighted overlay analysis in gis equation 3 was used to overlay eleven thematic maps to generate a final suitability model 3 g w p z i n x a y b a designates the factor and x is the weight of the factor while b designates the factor classes and y is the rank of the factors subclasses the suitability model divides the ghiss basin into four gwpzs poor moderate good and very good zones the framework for the methodology adopted in the current work is shown in fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 thematic maps lithology fig 6 the lithology of the basin was used to demarcate the groundwater potential because it is a highly determining factor for aquifer recharge aykut 2021 ahirwar et al 2021 four major formations can be distinguished sericiteous shale in the southern and southeastern portions of the study area the marly shale in the central and modern alluvium in the northeast of the basin to determine accurately the gwpzs in the ghiss basin the lithological characteristics that control groundwater occurrence have been investigated and we assigned appropriate weights to each rock type according to their potential for groundwater storage table 6 lineament density fig 7 joints fissures and fractures highly control the groundwater percolation and occurrence mandal et al 2016 furthermore regions with high lineament density are characterized by high groundwater recharge zhu et al 2019 thus the low scores were assigned to low lineament density and high scores were allocated to high lineament density values appropriately the values of lineament density in the study area were categorized into five classes very high 1 08 1 94 km km2 high 0 75 1 07 km km2 moderate 0 47 0 74 km km2 low 0 21 0 46 km km2 and very low 0 0 2 km km2 drainage density fig 8 this factor is highly related to permeability and infiltration rate into the soil jena et al 2020 the low values of drainage density indicate high permeability thus high groundwater potential and vice versa patra et al 2018 thus low scores were allocated to high drainage density values and vice versa accordingly the values of drainage density in the study area were divided into five classes very poor 2 09 2 59 km km2 poor 1 57 2 08 km km2 moderate 1 06 1 56 km km2 good 0 55 1 05 km km2 and very good 0 03 0 54 km km2 lulc fig 9 the study area is occupied by 63 523 17 km2 of barren lands 23 193 67 km2 of sparse matorral 8 64 03 km2 of dense matorral 4 31 32 km2 of row crop olive and almond trees 2 17 48 km2 of irrigated crop and only 1 7 33 km2 of built up land the infiltration rate is not equal in the lulc categories and this factor highly affects the recharge conditions jinno et al 2009 the high vegetation density decelerates surface runoff which amplifies the infiltration rate mandal et al 2016 therefore a high score was assigned to cultivated lands low scores were assigned to barren lands which exhibit a weak recharge rate and to built up terrains for their low infiltration from impervious surfaces such as pavement jinno et al 2009 elevation fig 10 generally elevation categories reflect the geomorphological units in the study area which highly control groundwater availability therefore low lying areas such as flood plains have greater groundwater potential siddi raju et al 2019 thapa et al 2017 consequently low scores were allocated for high elevation units and vice versa curvature fig 11 a digital elevation model dem was used to calculate the curvature in the study area the positive values reflect convex and wastage areas zero values reflect flat and transitional areas while negative curvature values reflect concave and accumulation zones arunbose et al 2021 the curvature values in the study area were categorized into five classes 11 42 1 6 1 59 0 47 0 46 0 57 0 58 1 81 and 1 82 14 93 low scores were assigned to low values and high scores were assigned to high curvature values slope fig 12 slope highly affects groundwater potential and designates the steepness of the terrain surface slope values in the study area were categorized into five classes flat 0 7 66 gentle 7 67 14 22 moderate 14 23 20 56 steep 20 57 28 44 and very steep 28 45 55 78 generally the groundwater potential is lower when the terrain is steeper that is contains abrupt slopes sutradhar et al 2021b murmu et al 2019 therefore high scores are allocated for gentle slopes and vice versa twi fig 13 twi is employed to quantify water percolation processes through the soil and consequently its influence on the spatial distribution of groundwater arunbose et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 sørensen et al 2006 twi for the study area was calculated by employing equation 4 4 t w i ln α tan β α designates the upslope contributing area whereas β designates the local slope local twi values were divided into five classes 2 97 5 54 5 55 7 28 7 29 9 85 9 86 13 91 and 13 92 24 11 high scores were given to the high values and vice versa tpi fig 14 tpi is a prominent algorithm which is used in estimating topographic slope positions and automatically classifying landforms mieza et al 2016 in order to estimate the tpi the altitude of each pixel in the dem was compared to a specific neighborhood surrounding that pixel and then the mean elevation was subtracted from the elevation value at the central position arabameri et al 2019 this comparison was processed using equation 5 5 t p i m 0 n 1 m n n m0 designates the elevation of the evaluation point and mn designates the mean elevation of the local grid while n designates the number of points around the evaluated pixel the calculated tpi values were grouped into five bins 30 90 6 35 6 34 2 05 2 04 1 49 1 50 6 04 and 6 05 33 62 high scores were allocated for higher tpi and vice versa roughness fig 15 the roughness index indicates the topographic variation of the study area this index is calculated by summing the elevation difference between a grid cell and its neighbor grid cells in a dem arunbose et al 2021 the values of this factor were categorized into five classes 0 01 0 31 0 32 0 42 0 43 0 50 0 51 0 58 and 0 59 0 87 high scores were assigned to lower roughness values and vice versa rainfall fig 16 rainfall highly affects the groundwater potential accordingly heavy precipitation may result in high groundwater recharge while low precipitation leads to low groundwater recharge hence low scores were assigned to low precipitation and vice versa according to the rainfall values in the study area five classes were defined very poor 365 383 mm poor 384 402 mm moderate 403 420 mm good 421 438 mm and very good 439 456 mm 4 2 determination of gwpzs 4 2 1 gwpzs map using 11 factors the groundwater potential zones in the ghiss basin were obtained by utilizing a gis based weighted overlay technique in which eleven thematic layers judged to affect the groundwater potential most significantly were integrated according to the final model we characterize four classes of gwpzs poor moderate good and very good the poor gwpzs cover an area of 58 59 km2 which represents 7 of the study area the moderate gwpzs cover an area of 460 35 km2 55 whereas the good gwpzs cover an area of 292 95 km2 35 finally the very good gwpzs cover an area of 25 11 km2 which accounts for only 3 of the study area fig 17 the gwpzs map reveals that the highest groundwater potential coincides with areas characterized by low and middle elevation and marked by modern alluvium conglomerate sandstone and silt it also matches the southwest part of the basin where lineament density is high the infiltration rate is greater and areas of low slope and roughness values predominate moderate gwpzs occur in areas marked by high elevations intermediate slope intermediate lineament density values barren lands and correlates with a sericiteous shale lithology poor gwpzs occur in regions characterized by very steep slopes high elevation and in some areas coincide with low lineament density and high roughness values as seen from the resultant map fig 17 the geographical distribution of groundwater is shown as follows good gwpzs are localized in the north part of the basin moderate and poor gwpzs are dominant in the middle and the south of the basin while the very good groundwater potentiality can be seen in the east and the southwest of the basin where there occurs the ghiss nekor aquifer and the targuist aquifer respectively it is important to mention that the ghiss nekor aquifer is the most important aquifer in the province of al hoceima and according to the official hydrogeological map fig 4 shows the highest groundwater yields 5 20 l s 4 2 2 gwpzs maps using fewer factors maps from a i in fig 18 were calculated from fewer parameters but using the same relative importance scale applied earlier table 5 table 8 shows the factors used for each map and their relative weights by reducing the number of factors and this by eliminating each time the least important factor table 8 we observe a change in the percentages of the different gwpzs classes for example when we use 11 factors the model shows that the moderate class dominates the basin 55 while when we use only two factors the poor class dominates the model 44 4 2 3 validation due to the absence of groundwater yield data the gwpzs models were validated against depth to water level dwl data in mbgl of 44 wells which reflect the recharge condition and groundwater potential in the observed sites this same validation process has been used by patra et al 2018 and showed 75 conformity those authors employed data from 32 dug wells in the ganga alluvial plain of hooghly district of india in another study ghosh et al 2020 data from 89 dug wells were used to validate the calculated gwpzs in the upper kangsabati river basin west bengal india and the analysis revealed 79 77 of agreement these two studies used 12 and 7 factors respectively and support the validation methodology used in our study the dwl data were measured during the field investigation table 9 fig 19 and showed a variation between 2 m and 110 m these data have been categorized into five classes using the jenks natural breaks algorithm and are as follows very shallow 2 12 m shallow 13 30 m medium 31 50 m deep 51 70 m and very deep 71 110 m this grouping algorithm has been used in other studies for example ghosh et al 2020 hereafter we compared dwl with each gwpzs model to assess their relative agreement table 9 the main gwpzs model which was calculated using 11 factors fig 17 showed an agreement with 70 of the wells gauged for instance wells w10 w13 and w14 of very shallow shallow and medium groundwater level respectively are located on the main map in very good good and moderate gwpzs despite the complex characteristics of our study area the validation results show the proficiency of this methodology and the effectiveness of the factors used therefore an accurate gwpzs map has been generated that shows 38 of the basin 318 06 km2 with a good and very good groundwater potentiality this map can be used as a reference by decision makers to help select optimal areas for the construction of productive wells and boreholes furthermore the map can be incorporated into digital databases used for effective sustainable groundwater management to cope with surface water shortage in the ghiss basin which is a major challenge faced by the region this methodology in which gis rs and ahp were integrated has been adopted by many researchers achu et al 2020 alikhanov et al 2021 arefin 2020 arunbose et al 2021 aykut 2021 das 2019 who inferred the importance of the factors considered in the current study especially lithology and lineament density these two factors most affect recharge in our study area table 4 to discover the influence of reducing the number of factors on the accuracy of groundwater potential zones delineation we further assessed the agreement between the dwl data and the gwpzs on the nine maps generated using 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 and 2 factors the results presented in table 9 show that the degree of agreement varies between 63 and 68 the best degree of agreement 68 was obtained when we used 8 7 and 2 parameters conformity with the main model map was also assessed by comparing cell by cell differences using the raster calculator tool in arcgis the results showed a variation between models at 28 50 table 8 based on these results the closest models to the main model obtained using eleven factors are those calculated using 8 7 and 2 factors with an acceptable agreement of 68 furthermore these three models showed a conformity with the main model that reached 43 41 and 42 respectively thereby we infer from these results that reducing the number of factors in such studies may be as effective in regions with a similar geologic framework and where data are scarce or not available some limitations are worth noting in this work first a lack of soil data that forced us to eliminate soil factors secondly due to the lack of available measurement wells we used a limited number and type of well data for our model validation however this study provides a framework that can be used in similar regions that also lack data finally during the process of calculating gwpzs maps from fewer parameters the high number of possible factor combinations compelled us to only consider a sample of combinations we determined which factor combinations to consider by eliminating at each time the factor with the lowest weight until keeping only two factors 5 conclusion the current study is the first attempt to investigate gwpzs in the ghiss basin by means of an integrated gis based approach employing gis rs and ahp techniques eleven parameters affecting groundwater availability lineament density lithology drainage density lulc elevation curvature slope twi tpi roughness and rainfall were all used in the analysis appropriate weights were assigned to each parameter based on the pairwise comparison matrix ahp method the resultant thematic layers were overlayed and a single suitability surface was calculated the results indicate that 62 of the basin is of poor and moderate groundwater potentiality and therefore requires an adequate aquifer management plan to meet the population needs for water in this semi arid area validation results assess the accuracy of the final map to have an acceptable agreement of 70 and confirm the reliability of the final gwpzs map the same approach was used to produce and then validate gwpzs maps generated from fewer factors to discover the influence on the accuracy of the gwpzs delineation the results showed a small decrease in the degree of agreement from 70 to 68 when we used 8 7 and 2 parameters therefore reducing the number of factors in gwpzs studies dealing with data scarcity is still highly effective thus based on these original findings it is reasonable to conclude that using fewer factors can mitigate a lack of data despite these findings further studies are needed to update the gwpzs map for the region and also to validate the model more thoroughly which is more likely as additional hydrogeological data i e groundwater yield data for the basin are collected this gis based approach to investigate gwpzs can also be applied in areas of a similar climatic regime and geologic framework furthermore the results of this study should be taken into consideration in future studies dealing with groundwater management and agriculture in the ghiss basin

consequently the hydrogeology of the study area is not well investigated and it is limited to a restricted area of the basin chafouq et al 2016 2017 himi et al 2017 kouz et al 2018 the province of al hoceima is a semi arid region and lacks conventional surface water sources according to estimates from onee 2017 water needs should rise from 11 8 mcm year in 2017 to 15 2 mcm year by the year of 2040 consequently the estimated deficit is forecasted to rise from 2 8 mcm year 2017 to 12 2 mcm year by 2040 table 1 therefore a thorough understanding of groundwater distribution in the study area is necessary for more effective water resources management anantha et al 2021 singh et al 2018 towards this end integration of spatial analysis tools such as geographic information systems gis and remote sensing rs as a preliminary step could help decision makers understand the spatial distribution of groundwater techniques utilizing such tools are rapid low cost and can analyze an extensive region arulbalaji et al 2019 patra et al 2018 siddi raju et al 2019 tweed et al 2007 yeh et al 2009 ziani et al 2021 moreover such techniques can consider a vast amount of spatial data when assessing potential groundwater sources arulbalaji et al 2019 singh et al 2018 many authors have noted the high reliability of results obtained from geospatial techniques arefin 2020 arulbalaji et al 2019 rao and jugran 2003 sahoo et al 2015 the combination of these techniques with the multi criteria decision analysis mcda has also been shown to be effective in the delineation of groundwater potential zones alikhanov et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 arunbose et al 2021 bourjila et al 2020 jesiya and gopinath 2020 pathak et al 2021 singh et al 2021 thus one of the objectives of the current study is to map the groundwater potential zones in the ghiss basin by integrating gis remote sensing and analytical hierarchy process ahp techniques we intend by the creation of this map to identify the location of potential productive wells in the study area and also provide a digital database that can be utilized by decision makers in developing effective sustainable groundwater management plans to cope with the lack of surface water in the region the delineation of groundwater potential zones requires a careful selection of the type and number of factors the factors controlling groundwater occurrence have already been identified by specialists and include lineament density geology lithology elevation geomorphology soil drainage density slope land use land cover lulc rainfall topographic wetness index twi roughness curvature etc the number of factors that have been used to delineate gwpzs differs from one study to another for example the authors arunbose et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 sutradhar et al 2021a singh et al 2021 aykut 2021 jesiya and gopinath 2020 devi and nair 2021 and murasingh et al 2018 have used 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 and 6 parameters in their analyses respectively furthermore some studies have assessed the sensitivity of the influencing factors e g verma and patel 2021 and revealed that lithology lineament density and geomorphology are the most influential factors in the delineation of groundwater potential zones in lower the rihand river basin india and pathak et al 2021 have showed that lineament density and hydrogeomorphology are the most influential in the mountainous region of nepal himalaya however no studies have been carried out to assess the influence of reducing the number of parameters on the reliability of the calculated gwpzs models accordingly the second objective of this study is to understand how a reduced number of factors affects the validity of the delineated gwpzs for this purpose we will develop ten gwpzs models each calculated with a different set of factors the main gwpzs model will be calculated using eleven factors while the rest will be calculated using fewer factors reducing at each time the factor with the lowest weight until keeping only two factors a comparison will be made to determine whether the use of fewer factors is sufficient to demarcate groundwater potential zones if so then studies related to the delineation of gwpzs can rely on fewer factors relying on fewer factors in modeling gwpzs would facilitate better management practice in areas where there is a lack of data like most of the mountainous regions of morocco table 2 provides a list of abbreviations that we use in this paper 2 description of the study area the ghiss basin is located southwest of al hoceima city in northern morocco between 34 48 n and 35 11 n latitude 03 49 w and 04 26 w longitude fig 1 the basin covers a geographical area of approximately 837 square kilometers characterized by a rugged and complex terrain with an altitude range from 6 to 2032 m msl the ghiss river which is around 80 km in length is a sixth order stream and it drains from southwest to northeast flowing into the mediterranean sea the river basin is bordered from the north by the boufrah snada bouskour basin and the nekor basin from the south its slopes are steep at more than 35 and composed of brittle formations of shale marl and marl limestone additionally the protective cover of vegetation in this area is marked by a noticeable regression el motaki et al 2019 the combination of these factors affects the stability of the watershed which is characterized by active erosion bensiali 2020 el motaki et al 2019 salhi and benabdelouahab 2017 likewise a qualitative assessment of erosion in the ghiss basin led by bensiali 2020 has revealed that 28 43 238 37 km2 16 51 138 37 km2 25 64 214 84 km2 23 23 194 38 km2 and 6 19 51 89 km2 of the area show respectively very high high moderate low and very low erodibility the ghiss basin belongs to the flysch nappes zone and these nappes appear in the form of klippes at the tops of the highest peaks michard et al 2006 the flysch nappes are bounded to the east by the nekor fault and are separated from the internal domain named alboran domain to the west by the jebha fault fig 2 gimeno vives et al 2020 the climate of the province of al hoceima is mediterranean semi arid with dry hot summers and rainy cold winters the relative dryness of the area is aggravated by the interannual irregularity of rainfall the average annual rainfall in the meteorological station of targuist is 454 mm while the average of snowfall is 5 days the mountains of targuist are the main source of water feeding of the ghiss river low flow rate of 800 l s and most of the inflows are recorded in the form of floods due to torrential hydrological regimes in the area the annual mean temperature is 17 c the warmest temperature in the study area varies between 13 8 c and 34 6 c while the coldest temperature ranges between 3 8 c and 19 1 c table 3 the aquifer dominating the area is the unconfined aquifer of ghiss nekor fig 4 covering an area of about 100 square km it circulates in plio quaternary alluvium whose average thickness is about 240 m it is characterized by its easy exploitation and vulnerability to pollution chafouq et al 2017 according to the latest official census in rural communes hcp 2011 which has been done by the high commission of planning in morocco the rural communes belonging to the ghiss basin contain a distribution of at least 172 wells fig 3 in the lower part of the ghiss nekor plain the water table is less than 5 m deep and the total groundwater reserve in the basin is estimated at approximately 328 mcm million cubic meters onee 2017 the ghiss river is currently undergoing the installation of a new dam located about 23 km upstream from its mouth to cope with the effects of climate change and the increasing water needs in the al hoceima region 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources in the current study we used satellite imagery and conventional maps to prepare the 11 thematic maps considered of great importance in defining gwpzs in the ghiss basin the rs data landsat 8 oli was used to create the lineament map in geomatica banff software which was integrated later in a gis environment arcgis 10 8 to generate the lineament density map the same satellite image was used to create the lulc map by employing a supervised classification tool in gis geomatica and arcgis software are powerful tools and are widely used in studies dealing with groundwater delineation such as ahirwar et al 2020 arunbose et al 2021 aykut 2021 ghosh et al 2020 and murasingh et al 2018 these tools help to ensure rapid and accurate analysis of spatial information the aster gdem global digital elevation model 30 m resolution was utilized to retrieve data regarding the ghiss basin boundary drainage density elevation roughness slope topographic position index tpi topographic wetness index twi and the curvature maps the drainage density elevation roughness and slope maps were calculated using the gis spatial analyst tool the curvature map was made using arcgis 3d analyst the tpi map was prepared using jenness algorithm as a gis topographic tool jenness 2006 while we used the gis map algebra tool to generate the twi map shukla 2017 the two previous satellite images were downloaded from the usgs earthexplorer website https earthexplorer usgs gov the 2019 dataset from climatic research unit cru https sites uea ac uk cru was used to create the rainfall map we utilized the kriging geostatistical method for the pretreatment and the interpolation of the rainfall datasets this method guarantees high accuracy of the estimated surfaces of the interpolated data el hamidi et al 2018 ferchichi et al 2018 karami et al 2018 the lithological map was obtained from digitizing the geologic map of the rif chain at 1 500 000 scale published in 1980 by the moroccan ministry of energy and mines the hydrogeological map of the ghiss basin was digitized using the map of unconfined aquifers and streams in the province of al hoceima provided by the ministry of land use planning water and the environment in 2007 while the depth to water level data were obtained during a field survey conducted in june and july of 2021 the produced thematic layers were all resampled to a cell resolution of 28 m prior to using the weighted overlay analysis 3 2 gis mcd analysis the analytical hierarchy process ahp is a multi criteria decision analysis method developed by saaty 1980 this approach has been widely applied by scientists in the studies of qualitative measures aykut 2021 shao et al 2020 arulbalaji et al 2019 singh et al 2018 the ahp method was employed in the delineation of gwpzs in the ghiss basin by integrating the criteria most affecting the distribution of groundwater firstly we assigned appropriate weights to the eleven factors according to the opinions of experts and recent literature such as alikhanov et al 2021 achu et al 2020 arefin 2020 bourjila et al 2020 and arulbalaji et al 2019 secondly we compared the factors using a pairwise comparison matrix table 4 in which the saaty relative importance scale was applied table 5 the third step consisted of applying weights to the subclasses in each parameter by using a scale of 1 9 with 9 being the most suitable the results of the weighting is shown in table 6 finally the consistency ratio cr was estimated using equation 1 1 c r c i r i ci represents the consistency index whereas ri represents the random index values for ri rely on a number of factors that have been used in this study and was determined by applying saaty s standard table saaty 1990 the ri for the current study is 1 51 ci was calculated using equation 2 2 c i λ m a x n n 1 λmax the principal eigenvalue was calculated using the eigenvector technique table 7 khashei siuki et al 2020 and n is the number of parameters which is 11 in the present study to be acceptable the cr should be less or equal to 0 10 thus if the cr is higher than 0 10 therefore the pairwise comparison should be revised in the present study λmax 12 50 ci 0 15 and cr 0 099 consequently the inconsistency is acceptable and the weights assigned logically to the parameters 3 3 the weighted overlay analysis to generate the gwpzs map we employed a weighted overlay analysis in gis equation 3 was used to overlay eleven thematic maps to generate a final suitability model 3 g w p z i n x a y b a designates the factor and x is the weight of the factor while b designates the factor classes and y is the rank of the factors subclasses the suitability model divides the ghiss basin into four gwpzs poor moderate good and very good zones the framework for the methodology adopted in the current work is shown in fig 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 thematic maps lithology fig 6 the lithology of the basin was used to demarcate the groundwater potential because it is a highly determining factor for aquifer recharge aykut 2021 ahirwar et al 2021 four major formations can be distinguished sericiteous shale in the southern and southeastern portions of the study area the marly shale in the central and modern alluvium in the northeast of the basin to determine accurately the gwpzs in the ghiss basin the lithological characteristics that control groundwater occurrence have been investigated and we assigned appropriate weights to each rock type according to their potential for groundwater storage table 6 lineament density fig 7 joints fissures and fractures highly control the groundwater percolation and occurrence mandal et al 2016 furthermore regions with high lineament density are characterized by high groundwater recharge zhu et al 2019 thus the low scores were assigned to low lineament density and high scores were allocated to high lineament density values appropriately the values of lineament density in the study area were categorized into five classes very high 1 08 1 94 km km2 high 0 75 1 07 km km2 moderate 0 47 0 74 km km2 low 0 21 0 46 km km2 and very low 0 0 2 km km2 drainage density fig 8 this factor is highly related to permeability and infiltration rate into the soil jena et al 2020 the low values of drainage density indicate high permeability thus high groundwater potential and vice versa patra et al 2018 thus low scores were allocated to high drainage density values and vice versa accordingly the values of drainage density in the study area were divided into five classes very poor 2 09 2 59 km km2 poor 1 57 2 08 km km2 moderate 1 06 1 56 km km2 good 0 55 1 05 km km2 and very good 0 03 0 54 km km2 lulc fig 9 the study area is occupied by 63 523 17 km2 of barren lands 23 193 67 km2 of sparse matorral 8 64 03 km2 of dense matorral 4 31 32 km2 of row crop olive and almond trees 2 17 48 km2 of irrigated crop and only 1 7 33 km2 of built up land the infiltration rate is not equal in the lulc categories and this factor highly affects the recharge conditions jinno et al 2009 the high vegetation density decelerates surface runoff which amplifies the infiltration rate mandal et al 2016 therefore a high score was assigned to cultivated lands low scores were assigned to barren lands which exhibit a weak recharge rate and to built up terrains for their low infiltration from impervious surfaces such as pavement jinno et al 2009 elevation fig 10 generally elevation categories reflect the geomorphological units in the study area which highly control groundwater availability therefore low lying areas such as flood plains have greater groundwater potential siddi raju et al 2019 thapa et al 2017 consequently low scores were allocated for high elevation units and vice versa curvature fig 11 a digital elevation model dem was used to calculate the curvature in the study area the positive values reflect convex and wastage areas zero values reflect flat and transitional areas while negative curvature values reflect concave and accumulation zones arunbose et al 2021 the curvature values in the study area were categorized into five classes 11 42 1 6 1 59 0 47 0 46 0 57 0 58 1 81 and 1 82 14 93 low scores were assigned to low values and high scores were assigned to high curvature values slope fig 12 slope highly affects groundwater potential and designates the steepness of the terrain surface slope values in the study area were categorized into five classes flat 0 7 66 gentle 7 67 14 22 moderate 14 23 20 56 steep 20 57 28 44 and very steep 28 45 55 78 generally the groundwater potential is lower when the terrain is steeper that is contains abrupt slopes sutradhar et al 2021b murmu et al 2019 therefore high scores are allocated for gentle slopes and vice versa twi fig 13 twi is employed to quantify water percolation processes through the soil and consequently its influence on the spatial distribution of groundwater arunbose et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 sørensen et al 2006 twi for the study area was calculated by employing equation 4 4 t w i ln α tan β α designates the upslope contributing area whereas β designates the local slope local twi values were divided into five classes 2 97 5 54 5 55 7 28 7 29 9 85 9 86 13 91 and 13 92 24 11 high scores were given to the high values and vice versa tpi fig 14 tpi is a prominent algorithm which is used in estimating topographic slope positions and automatically classifying landforms mieza et al 2016 in order to estimate the tpi the altitude of each pixel in the dem was compared to a specific neighborhood surrounding that pixel and then the mean elevation was subtracted from the elevation value at the central position arabameri et al 2019 this comparison was processed using equation 5 5 t p i m 0 n 1 m n n m0 designates the elevation of the evaluation point and mn designates the mean elevation of the local grid while n designates the number of points around the evaluated pixel the calculated tpi values were grouped into five bins 30 90 6 35 6 34 2 05 2 04 1 49 1 50 6 04 and 6 05 33 62 high scores were allocated for higher tpi and vice versa roughness fig 15 the roughness index indicates the topographic variation of the study area this index is calculated by summing the elevation difference between a grid cell and its neighbor grid cells in a dem arunbose et al 2021 the values of this factor were categorized into five classes 0 01 0 31 0 32 0 42 0 43 0 50 0 51 0 58 and 0 59 0 87 high scores were assigned to lower roughness values and vice versa rainfall fig 16 rainfall highly affects the groundwater potential accordingly heavy precipitation may result in high groundwater recharge while low precipitation leads to low groundwater recharge hence low scores were assigned to low precipitation and vice versa according to the rainfall values in the study area five classes were defined very poor 365 383 mm poor 384 402 mm moderate 403 420 mm good 421 438 mm and very good 439 456 mm 4 2 determination of gwpzs 4 2 1 gwpzs map using 11 factors the groundwater potential zones in the ghiss basin were obtained by utilizing a gis based weighted overlay technique in which eleven thematic layers judged to affect the groundwater potential most significantly were integrated according to the final model we characterize four classes of gwpzs poor moderate good and very good the poor gwpzs cover an area of 58 59 km2 which represents 7 of the study area the moderate gwpzs cover an area of 460 35 km2 55 whereas the good gwpzs cover an area of 292 95 km2 35 finally the very good gwpzs cover an area of 25 11 km2 which accounts for only 3 of the study area fig 17 the gwpzs map reveals that the highest groundwater potential coincides with areas characterized by low and middle elevation and marked by modern alluvium conglomerate sandstone and silt it also matches the southwest part of the basin where lineament density is high the infiltration rate is greater and areas of low slope and roughness values predominate moderate gwpzs occur in areas marked by high elevations intermediate slope intermediate lineament density values barren lands and correlates with a sericiteous shale lithology poor gwpzs occur in regions characterized by very steep slopes high elevation and in some areas coincide with low lineament density and high roughness values as seen from the resultant map fig 17 the geographical distribution of groundwater is shown as follows good gwpzs are localized in the north part of the basin moderate and poor gwpzs are dominant in the middle and the south of the basin while the very good groundwater potentiality can be seen in the east and the southwest of the basin where there occurs the ghiss nekor aquifer and the targuist aquifer respectively it is important to mention that the ghiss nekor aquifer is the most important aquifer in the province of al hoceima and according to the official hydrogeological map fig 4 shows the highest groundwater yields 5 20 l s 4 2 2 gwpzs maps using fewer factors maps from a i in fig 18 were calculated from fewer parameters but using the same relative importance scale applied earlier table 5 table 8 shows the factors used for each map and their relative weights by reducing the number of factors and this by eliminating each time the least important factor table 8 we observe a change in the percentages of the different gwpzs classes for example when we use 11 factors the model shows that the moderate class dominates the basin 55 while when we use only two factors the poor class dominates the model 44 4 2 3 validation due to the absence of groundwater yield data the gwpzs models were validated against depth to water level dwl data in mbgl of 44 wells which reflect the recharge condition and groundwater potential in the observed sites this same validation process has been used by patra et al 2018 and showed 75 conformity those authors employed data from 32 dug wells in the ganga alluvial plain of hooghly district of india in another study ghosh et al 2020 data from 89 dug wells were used to validate the calculated gwpzs in the upper kangsabati river basin west bengal india and the analysis revealed 79 77 of agreement these two studies used 12 and 7 factors respectively and support the validation methodology used in our study the dwl data were measured during the field investigation table 9 fig 19 and showed a variation between 2 m and 110 m these data have been categorized into five classes using the jenks natural breaks algorithm and are as follows very shallow 2 12 m shallow 13 30 m medium 31 50 m deep 51 70 m and very deep 71 110 m this grouping algorithm has been used in other studies for example ghosh et al 2020 hereafter we compared dwl with each gwpzs model to assess their relative agreement table 9 the main gwpzs model which was calculated using 11 factors fig 17 showed an agreement with 70 of the wells gauged for instance wells w10 w13 and w14 of very shallow shallow and medium groundwater level respectively are located on the main map in very good good and moderate gwpzs despite the complex characteristics of our study area the validation results show the proficiency of this methodology and the effectiveness of the factors used therefore an accurate gwpzs map has been generated that shows 38 of the basin 318 06 km2 with a good and very good groundwater potentiality this map can be used as a reference by decision makers to help select optimal areas for the construction of productive wells and boreholes furthermore the map can be incorporated into digital databases used for effective sustainable groundwater management to cope with surface water shortage in the ghiss basin which is a major challenge faced by the region this methodology in which gis rs and ahp were integrated has been adopted by many researchers achu et al 2020 alikhanov et al 2021 arefin 2020 arunbose et al 2021 aykut 2021 das 2019 who inferred the importance of the factors considered in the current study especially lithology and lineament density these two factors most affect recharge in our study area table 4 to discover the influence of reducing the number of factors on the accuracy of groundwater potential zones delineation we further assessed the agreement between the dwl data and the gwpzs on the nine maps generated using 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 and 2 factors the results presented in table 9 show that the degree of agreement varies between 63 and 68 the best degree of agreement 68 was obtained when we used 8 7 and 2 parameters conformity with the main model map was also assessed by comparing cell by cell differences using the raster calculator tool in arcgis the results showed a variation between models at 28 50 table 8 based on these results the closest models to the main model obtained using eleven factors are those calculated using 8 7 and 2 factors with an acceptable agreement of 68 furthermore these three models showed a conformity with the main model that reached 43 41 and 42 respectively thereby we infer from these results that reducing the number of factors in such studies may be as effective in regions with a similar geologic framework and where data are scarce or not available some limitations are worth noting in this work first a lack of soil data that forced us to eliminate soil factors secondly due to the lack of available measurement wells we used a limited number and type of well data for our model validation however this study provides a framework that can be used in similar regions that also lack data finally during the process of calculating gwpzs maps from fewer parameters the high number of possible factor combinations compelled us to only consider a sample of combinations we determined which factor combinations to consider by eliminating at each time the factor with the lowest weight until keeping only two factors 5 conclusion the current study is the first attempt to investigate gwpzs in the ghiss basin by means of an integrated gis based approach employing gis rs and ahp techniques eleven parameters affecting groundwater availability lineament density lithology drainage density lulc elevation curvature slope twi tpi roughness and rainfall were all used in the analysis appropriate weights were assigned to each parameter based on the pairwise comparison matrix ahp method the resultant thematic layers were overlayed and a single suitability surface was calculated the results indicate that 62 of the basin is of poor and moderate groundwater potentiality and therefore requires an adequate aquifer management plan to meet the population needs for water in this semi arid area validation results assess the accuracy of the final map to have an acceptable agreement of 70 and confirm the reliability of the final gwpzs map the same approach was used to produce and then validate gwpzs maps generated from fewer factors to discover the influence on the accuracy of the gwpzs delineation the results showed a small decrease in the degree of agreement from 70 to 68 when we used 8 7 and 2 parameters therefore reducing the number of factors in gwpzs studies dealing with data scarcity is still highly effective thus based on these original findings it is reasonable to conclude that using fewer factors can mitigate a lack of data despite these findings further studies are needed to update the gwpzs map for the region and also to validate the model more thoroughly which is more likely as additional hydrogeological data i e groundwater yield data for the basin are collected this gis based approach to investigate gwpzs can also be applied in areas of a similar climatic regime and geologic framework furthermore the results of this study should be taken into consideration in future studies dealing with groundwater management and agriculture in the ghiss basin

11886,the rate and duration of precipitation in many outermost small islands within the indonesian region have been projected to decrease during the dry season due to prolonged droughts thus drought mitigation plans for these islands must be adaptive and continually improved as a result of recent advances drought periods can be monitored and relevant information communicated using water requirement assessment embedded within a geographical information system gis based model although improved tools and models have been used to analyse data concerning water conditions only a few studies have focused on drought in the outermost small islands in indonesia the main purpose of this study was to inform regulatory agencies on the drought status of these small islands thus the viable drought vulnerability index dvi was developed to contribute to the construction of a support system to make relevant decisions about the drought status of the islands specific parameters were selected to develop and analyse dvi involving three considerations meteorological physical and socio economic aspects this study focused on the analysis of data from water resources availability rainfall surface water and groundwater population and interpretations from gis to establish the rainfall index ri water use index wui water supplying vegetation index wsvi and critical land rate index cri to develop a viable dvi the results provide a clear understanding for all stakeholders concerning the drought problem and use a viable index and vulnerable map as valuable tools for water management in the study area the results also confirm that a gis approach is effective in identifying and measuring the vulnerability index in the outermost small island area aiding in the implementation of better adaptive drought management practices for sustainable development keywords drought index gis approach outermost small islands water vulnerability status 1 introduction indonesia is an archipelago consisting of approximately 17 000 islands out of which about 13 000 are small islands previous studies have shown that the outermost small islands are experiencing water resource vulnerability with lack of water resources and poor water conditions being common phenomena kirono et al 2016 suroso et al 2009 suryawan et al 2019 as a result of climate change which affects both surface water and groundwater nistor et al 2020 rahardjo et al 2014 water resource availability in indonesia has been projected to decrease during the dry season this could lead to prolonged droughts resulting in water scarcity rahardjo et al 2007 tallar and suen 2015 temam et al 2019 y zhang et al 2019 on the island of java the water resource availability is predicted to drop to 476 m3 per person yr by 2040 far below the current annual level of 1169 m3 per person yr with the ideal level being 1600 m3 per person yr geothermal power generation project climate change assessment 2020 the ministry of public works and housing of indonesia reported that almost 10 of indonesia is expected to experience a water crisis by 2045 lowy institute 2019 recent advances have enabled the monitoring and communication of drought information using a water requirement assessment or an index embedded within a gis based model kawo and karuppannan 2018 nistor et al 2019 2020 rahardjo et al 2019 singh 2019 taloor et al 2020 valencia gómez et al 2020 yang et al 2017 h zhang et al 2019 such an index has been considered an effective and simple indicator for describing or analysing water related problems nayak et al 2020 tallar and suen 2016 several previous studies have adapted the water resources vulnerability index to assess the present condition tallar and suen 2015 wang et al 2020 williams et al 2019 in addition several studies of drought situations in large islands of indonesia with well documented data for interpretation and analysis have been presented amalo et al 2019 mursidi and sari 2017 however few studies have focused on drought status in the outermost small islands in indonesia a viable instrument is required to assess drought vulnerability in these outermost small islands such vulnerability strongly depends on the sectoral focus as well as on the geographical context of the assessment previous drought assessment methods such as iseca dvi de azevedo reis et al 2020 the standardised dvi karavitis et al 2014 the standardised precipitation index mckee 1993 and the palmer drought index pdi yang et al 2017 require considerable existing data such as abundant dense distribution of rain gauges dabanlı et al 2017 karavitis et al 2014 mckee et al 1993 yang et al 2017 or hydrographic regions de azevedo reis et al 2020 these methods have a complex methodology based on numerous parameters it is difficult for stakeholders from the outermost small islands to measure and assess the drought status with very limited available rain gauge stations and data we have developed a simplified drought vulnerability index dvi to inform regulatory agencies about the drought status of these outermost small islands and support adaptive management for drought mitigation to enable the easy comprehension of the drought status at different times and places the dvi reduces the vast quantity of selected parameter information into its simplest form and some information may be lost during the simplification process as a trade off the connotation of the drought level can be imparted to the untrained stakeholders as well as the water resource managers and decision makers of the outermost small islands the proposed viable dvi can be implemented without extensive fieldwork or substantial financial costs while including the specific parameters that involve the three major issues meteorological physical and socio economic aspects of drought 2 study area and methods 2 1 description of study area the study area is located in the savu rai jua regency east nusa tenggara province ntt indonesia which includes two of the outermost small islands in indonesia fig 1 geographically the regency is located between 10 25 7 10 49 46 s and 121 16 11 122 0 30 e and has an area of approximately 459 km2 the maximum altitude is 350 m above sea level asl on savu island and 177 m asl on rai jua island major soil types in the savu rai jua regency include grumosols lithosols alluvial and mediterranean soils which overlie carbonate bedrock marl and limestone calcareous sandstones and melange facies harris et al 1998 roosmawati and harris 2009 susilawati 2012 intan 2016 the dominant land cover is agricultural and typical trees include palmyra pine gewang corypha utan lamk and mangrove the study area is classified as semi arid marked by a long dry season approximately 8 months from april to november and maximum annual rainfall of 100 400 mm year based on data from 2000 to 2015 there is a single rain gauge on savu island at 10 29 38 s and 121 50 43 e fig 1 the monthly rainfall data for the study area are listed in table 1 for 2016 and shown in fig 2 for 2005 2016 january exhibited the highest rainfall intensity with june and august exhibiting the lowest fig 2 the average monthly temperature ranged between 25 and 34 c based on data from the central bureau of statistics bps in 2016 there were 88 826 people in 58 villages in savu rai jua regency with an average population density of approximately 193 people km2 the highest population in 2016 was in the sabu barat sub district which accounted for 36 of the total population of savu rai jua regency while the highest population density 298 inhabitants km2 was in the hawu mehara sub district the demographic data on population and density according to sub districts in savu rai jua regency are shown in table 2 2 2 methodology this study used a gis and interpretations from digital images fig 3 specific parameters were selected to develop the system and to analyse the dvi involving three major issues meteorological physical and socio economic aspects population data table 2 and water resource availability were used to calculate the water use index wui the common approach is to calculate drought vulnerability levels based on the length of the dry month al adaileh et al 2019 oke 2018 according to previous studies a particular area is expected to be excessively dry if the number of dry months is up to 8 months yr amalo et al 2019 oke 2018 temam et al 2019 therefore rainfall index ri analysis was conducted within the development of dvi considering the length of the dry season within the study area the schmidt ferguson methodology was modified to indicate that rainfall lower than 60 mm month indicated a dry month based on previous studies istyarini et al 2018 this was considered as a well known and appropriate method to analyse the rainfall distribution in indonesia considering the lack of non continuous data which becomes a problem when conducting analysis and collecting information about climate classification the water supplying vegetation index wsvi was analysed by interpreting landsat 8 imagery sourced from the united states geological survey bands 4 and 5 were used to analyse the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi while band 10 was used to analyse land surface temperature lst lower values of ndvi and lst indicate a higher value of wsvi syarif et al 2013 the results of the transformation of wsvi on the image produced a variety of values therefore the results were simplified by clustering the designed data to determine the best arrangement of values into different classes the water requirement assessment also involved the calculation of the critical land rate index cri based on data from the bps to measure land capacity as an important variable in developing dvi these four parameters wui ri wsvi and cri were scaled and weighted according to the order of their abilities and conditions of the study area so that the analyses produced a viable result for dvi in this study the weighting method of the dvi variables used a ranking system tallar and suen 2016 the analytical hierarchy process ahp method was also used to validate the weight values of variables by interviewing and filling questionnaires to collect opinions from an expert panel of academicians practitioners and government agencies the ahp method was processed using expert choice 11 0 the result of the ahp verified the assignment of weight values to the variables the dvi weight values are shown in table 3 3 results and discussion dry season rainfall in 2016 averaged 27 mm month which led to an overall classification of the study area as high vulnerable based on ri table 4 based on the lack of rainfall recorded in june and august those months are classified as very high vulnerable while april and july were classified as high vulnerable may september and november are classified as vulnerable while october is low vulnerable for calculating wui data on various types of water resources and population in the study area were obtained table 5 based on the results of wui analysis sabu tengah and sabu timur districts are classified as vulnerable while the rest are very vulnerable table 6 the results of wsvi analysis classify sabu tengah sabu liae and rai jua districts as very vulnerable while sabu barat sabu timur and hawu mehara districts are classified as vulnerable table 7 finally the results of the cri analysis indicate that sabu timur sabu liae and hawu mehara districts are classified as very vulnerable sabu barat and sabu tengah districts are classified as vulnerable and rai jua district is classified as fairly vulnerable to drought table 8 consequently the dvi classifies most of the districts in the study area as vulnerable with only one sabu liae being highly vulnerable table 9 and fig 4 these findings necessitate the development of an adaptive management strategy for drought mitigation in the outermost small islands fig 5 further improvements for drought mitigation action plans in the study area should provide data networks early warning systems and preparedness drought forecasting drought monitoring tools drought impact assessment methodology and reactive proactive response systems to date drought mitigation and preparedness programs have been largely reactive and not proactive moreover both local and central governments have devoted little effort towards mitigation and preparedness for drought problems particularly on the outermost small islands mitigation approaches to predict drought problems have several important issues such as the lack of appropriate early warning systems to predict climate change insufficient databases for assessing minimum water requirements lack of political will and coordination at various levels of government concerning drought problems and appropriate mitigation programs aimed at reducing vulnerability to drought problems in the outermost small islands within the context of drought it is essential to provide basic water requirements to all people prior to allocations for other water use generally a basic water requirement assessment is the first step to describe the overall water use and can often be provided through adaptive management for drought mitigation 4 conclusions indonesia is experiencing increased vulnerability to extended periods of reduced rainfall during the dry season the resultant increase in drought induced disasters has led to considerable interest in drought mitigation and preparedness food insecurity and the absence of drought warning systems are the main issues affecting drought vulnerability in the outermost small islands therefore it is increasingly recognised that stakeholders at various levels of government require the development of adaptive management for drought mitigation in these islands this study has shown that all four selected parameters wui wsvi cri and ri are important for developing a viable dvi for the outermost small islands many previous studies have used rainfall intensity and or water use parameters to develop and standardise the dvi amalo et al 2019 dabanlı et al 2017 de azevedo reis et al 2020 however few studies have assessed water supplying vegetation combined with critical land rate parameters the study results classified all districts in the study area as vulnerable or in one instance high vulnerable vulnerability to drought is dynamic and influenced by many variables including meteorological physical and socio economic aspects to determine drought vulnerability the most important consideration is to select and weigh the variables that are commonly subjective and may vary between areas our findings confirmed that using a gis approach in conjunction with remote sensing to identify and measure the dvi is instrumental in developing better adaptive drought management practices several methods of water requirement assessment can be added such as principal component analysis and fuzzy evaluation method future research using this assessment could not only produce a visualisation of drought but potentially pave the way for

11886,the rate and duration of precipitation in many outermost small islands within the indonesian region have been projected to decrease during the dry season due to prolonged droughts thus drought mitigation plans for these islands must be adaptive and continually improved as a result of recent advances drought periods can be monitored and relevant information communicated using water requirement assessment embedded within a geographical information system gis based model although improved tools and models have been used to analyse data concerning water conditions only a few studies have focused on drought in the outermost small islands in indonesia the main purpose of this study was to inform regulatory agencies on the drought status of these small islands thus the viable drought vulnerability index dvi was developed to contribute to the construction of a support system to make relevant decisions about the drought status of the islands specific parameters were selected to develop and analyse dvi involving three considerations meteorological physical and socio economic aspects this study focused on the analysis of data from water resources availability rainfall surface water and groundwater population and interpretations from gis to establish the rainfall index ri water use index wui water supplying vegetation index wsvi and critical land rate index cri to develop a viable dvi the results provide a clear understanding for all stakeholders concerning the drought problem and use a viable index and vulnerable map as valuable tools for water management in the study area the results also confirm that a gis approach is effective in identifying and measuring the vulnerability index in the outermost small island area aiding in the implementation of better adaptive drought management practices for sustainable development keywords drought index gis approach outermost small islands water vulnerability status 1 introduction indonesia is an archipelago consisting of approximately 17 000 islands out of which about 13 000 are small islands previous studies have shown that the outermost small islands are experiencing water resource vulnerability with lack of water resources and poor water conditions being common phenomena kirono et al 2016 suroso et al 2009 suryawan et al 2019 as a result of climate change which affects both surface water and groundwater nistor et al 2020 rahardjo et al 2014 water resource availability in indonesia has been projected to decrease during the dry season this could lead to prolonged droughts resulting in water scarcity rahardjo et al 2007 tallar and suen 2015 temam et al 2019 y zhang et al 2019 on the island of java the water resource availability is predicted to drop to 476 m3 per person yr by 2040 far below the current annual level of 1169 m3 per person yr with the ideal level being 1600 m3 per person yr geothermal power generation project climate change assessment 2020 the ministry of public works and housing of indonesia reported that almost 10 of indonesia is expected to experience a water crisis by 2045 lowy institute 2019 recent advances have enabled the monitoring and communication of drought information using a water requirement assessment or an index embedded within a gis based model kawo and karuppannan 2018 nistor et al 2019 2020 rahardjo et al 2019 singh 2019 taloor et al 2020 valencia gómez et al 2020 yang et al 2017 h zhang et al 2019 such an index has been considered an effective and simple indicator for describing or analysing water related problems nayak et al 2020 tallar and suen 2016 several previous studies have adapted the water resources vulnerability index to assess the present condition tallar and suen 2015 wang et al 2020 williams et al 2019 in addition several studies of drought situations in large islands of indonesia with well documented data for interpretation and analysis have been presented amalo et al 2019 mursidi and sari 2017 however few studies have focused on drought status in the outermost small islands in indonesia a viable instrument is required to assess drought vulnerability in these outermost small islands such vulnerability strongly depends on the sectoral focus as well as on the geographical context of the assessment previous drought assessment methods such as iseca dvi de azevedo reis et al 2020 the standardised dvi karavitis et al 2014 the standardised precipitation index mckee 1993 and the palmer drought index pdi yang et al 2017 require considerable existing data such as abundant dense distribution of rain gauges dabanlı et al 2017 karavitis et al 2014 mckee et al 1993 yang et al 2017 or hydrographic regions de azevedo reis et al 2020 these methods have a complex methodology based on numerous parameters it is difficult for stakeholders from the outermost small islands to measure and assess the drought status with very limited available rain gauge stations and data we have developed a simplified drought vulnerability index dvi to inform regulatory agencies about the drought status of these outermost small islands and support adaptive management for drought mitigation to enable the easy comprehension of the drought status at different times and places the dvi reduces the vast quantity of selected parameter information into its simplest form and some information may be lost during the simplification process as a trade off the connotation of the drought level can be imparted to the untrained stakeholders as well as the water resource managers and decision makers of the outermost small islands the proposed viable dvi can be implemented without extensive fieldwork or substantial financial costs while including the specific parameters that involve the three major issues meteorological physical and socio economic aspects of drought 2 study area and methods 2 1 description of study area the study area is located in the savu rai jua

11887,the sensitivity of the derivative analysis to the variation of flow rates allows it to solve ambiguities provide diagnostics of the flow dimension and identify the boundary conditions of the tested aquifer based on the results of a derivative analysis it was hypothesized that the set of assumptions for the fitted solution to the drawdown curve are valid for the tested aquifer thus combining the derivative analysis results and the detailed geological characterization a new approach was developed to build preliminary conceptual hydrogeological models in cases where field data are scarce applying this approach it was concluded that basaltic aquifers in the serra geral aquifer system sgas are comprised of leaky confined aquifers which the alternation of basalt floods that have permeable horizons at the top and with low permeability of interior flow the simulated drawdown curve in a transient flow model perfectly matched with the drawdown curve recorded in the field thus supporting the suitability of the built conceptual model this statement challenges the prevailing theory that conceptualizes sgas as a fractured aquifer conclusively the current approach is capable of producing suitable conceptual models in cases of field data scarcity future investigations in other complex geological contexts may validate the present approach graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer test diagnostic plot groundwater flow model serra geral aquifer 1 introduction a pumping test is a field test in which groundwater is withdrawn at a controlled rate and the water level response drawdown is measured in one or more nearby observation wells and the pumping well itself walton 2019 typically the single purpose of a pumping test is to estimate the hydraulic properties of an aquifer system such as transmissivity hydraulic conductivity horizontal and vertical and storage coefficient as well as to assess well productivity walton 2019 the data obtained from the pumping tests are useful for the groundwater management e g machiwal et al 2017 masoud 2020 shekhar et al 2020 and serve as a source of parameterization of mathematical flow models e g baalousha 2016 sahoo and jha 2017 xiao et al 2019 the first solution to describe the groundwater flow to a pumping well was developed by theis 1935 which considered a homogeneous confined aquifer horizontally isotropic and laterally infinite with a constant flow due to the assumptions in theis s model 1935 this solution cannot be applied in all cases for this reason different analytical solutions have been successively proposed to obtain the hydraulic parameters for different types of aquifers e g dewandel et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 as revealed by renard et al 2009 each of these solutions was deduced from a specific set of premises a fact that makes them valid only for specific conditions vertical or horizontal fracture flow double porosity leaky confined etc an additional evaluation process of drawdown data by derivative analysis can provide relevant information such as the distance from the well to the boundary conditions no flow or constant head substratum inclination anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and flow dimension e g renard et al 2009 ferroud et al 2019 several studies have demonstrated the ability of derivative analysis to improve the understanding of the mechanistic process controlling the groundwater flow in complex aquifers e g giese et al 2017 ferroud et al 2019 rane and jayaraj 2021 the results produced by derivative analysis can guide the formulation of hydrogeological conceptual models conceptual models are fundamental elements in hydrogeological studies and they bring together a set of hypotheses contemplating the hydraulic properties conditioning and processes in hydrogeological problems e g enemark et al 2019 mustafa et al 2020 the elaboration of conceptual hydrogeological models is conditioned by the interpretation of existing data and as such several different conceptual models can be ambiguously proposed using the same data which generates uncertainties regarding the validity of such models e g sullivan et al 2020 enemark et al 2019 different methodological approaches varying in their premises integration of data and fields and methods for validation have been proposed for the development of conceptual hydrogeological models e g marques et al 2019 de filippis et al 2020 enemark et al 2019 as per consensus all these studies point to the need to obtain a large amount of data to restrict the number of potentially viable conceptual models and thereby reduce uncertainties bearing in mind that a derivative analysis of the drawdown curves can determine the hydraulic parameters of the aquifers they offer the diagnosis of the flow regime and the existence of boundary conditions these can be useful for the elaboration or improvement of hydrogeological models this finding is supported by several studies which demonstrate that pumping tests can be essential elements in the development of conceptual hydrogeological models e g giese et al 2017 kambuku et al 2018 sproule et al 2021 despite the pivotal importance of hydrogeological conceptual models the available field data are insufficient to build a comprehensive conceptual model in several cases consequently to overcome the problems related to field data scarcity the present work was aimed at developing a simplistic approach that uses a derivative analysis of the drawdown curves associated with a parsimonious analysis of an aquifer s geological context to build a preliminary conceptual hydrogeological model to assess the suitability of proposed approach it was tested in a basaltic aquifer in southeastern brazil 2 pumping tests and derivative analysis a pumping test defines the field tests designed to obtain the hydraulic properties transmissivity and storage of the aquifer under study typically a production well is pumped at full capacity and or at a constant rate while the water levels are measured at frequent intervals in the production well and neighboring observation wells importantly the water level data measured in the pumping well is less accurate and reliable due to the turbulence created by the pumping and because of well losses consequently the resulting water level drawdowns recorded in pumping wells are not representative of the drawdown in the aquifer and at least one observation well should be used when available the time series of the drawdown of hydraulic head was plotted as time drawdown and or distance drawdown graph and analyzed with model equations and type curve matching straight line matching or inflection point selection techniques the drawdown s l the difference between hydraulic head h l at time t t and the initial hydraulic head h0 l represents the recorded parameters in the pumping test the parameter s in a confined non leaky homogeneous and isotropic aquifer with hydraulic conductivity k l t at distance r l from the pumping well may be described by the governing equation for a two dimensional form of radial flow toward the pumping well as given below theis 1935 1 2 s r 2 1 r s r s t s t here t and s represent the transmissivity l2 t and storage coefficient of the aquifer dimensionless respectively bourdet et al 1989 developed a derivative analysis in which the pressure data p were also plotted along with the values of the pressure derivative dp d logt in formation tests allowing for more accurate diagnoses of the flow regimes in oil reservoirs renard et al 2009 demonstrated that this approach is also functional in diagnosing the type of groundwater flow to the wells in pumping tests based on the derivative of ds dlog t considering that the drawdown derivative is particularly sensitive to small variations in the drawdown rate defining the logarithmic derivative of drawdown as a relation expressed by eq 2 the derivative of the time series composed by n drawdown si and time ti values may be approximated as a slope between two successive data points and to multiply it by the time correspondent to the center of the interval calculated as the arithmetic mean t m t i t i 1 2 as expressed by eq 3 2 s ln t t s t 3 s l n t t m t i t i 1 2 s i s i 1 t i t i 1 the graphical representation of the diagnostic curve which is a combined graphical representation of s and ds dlog t vs time is used to improve the interpretation of the pumping tests the derivative curve of the pumping tests is calculated using the methodology of bourdet et al 1989 which approximates the derivative of the drawdown curve using equation 3 the geometry of the diagnostic curve that allows us to discern the flow offers the diagnosis of flow regimes capable of explaining the drawdown as a function of time as demonstrated by renard et al 2009 aquifers with a distinct flow regime will present a discernible and typical geometry of derivative curves as exemplified in fig 1 if the aquifer is bound by an impermeable contour the drawdown curve is represented by an upward linear curve the most suitable solution for the tested aquifer is that which allows the simultaneous adjustment to the lowering curve of the pumped and observed wells as well as their respective derivative curves 3 material and methods 3 1 proposed approach to generate hydrogeological conceptual model the current approach was designed assuming a case in which aquifer tests are available but other field data are scarce or even absent the aquifer test provides some important aspects of flow dimension such as the type of boundary conditions geometry of flow and estimation of aquifer properties it was also hypothesized that that the main assumptions of fitted solution are valid to tested aquifer consequently the assumptions of adjusted solution and geological characteristics obtained from the literature provided the basis for the conceptual model the general framework of the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 1 field data in the first step of this approach fig 2 data for the aquifer test and geological contextualization are obtained the aquifer tests serve as the main tool to obtain the characteristics of the tested aquifer using the derivative analysis in the second step geological contextualization is performed to identify the main geological features controlling the storage and flow of groundwater in the studied aquifer for instance in cases of hard rock terrain the regional geological discontinuities can play an important role in the groundwater flow on the other hand the interactions and water exchange processes between individual aquifers within multilayered sedimentary aquifers are complex and governed by the characteristics of confining or semi confining units a careful and detailed evaluation of the literature forms the basis of this conceptual geological model 3 1 2 conceptual model development the present approach explicitly assumes that the set of assumptions used to deduce the analytical solution fitted to drawdown curve is valid for the tested aquifer and may be incorporated in the hydrogeological conceptual model in the third step of the process fig 2 the hydrogeological conceptual model is built by integrating the geological characterization produced in step 1 and the results of the derivative analysis of the aquifer tests the derivative analysis of available aquifer tests identifies crucial information concerning flow geometry and boundary conditions besides the model parametrization they are compatible within the local geological context for the elaboration of the conceptual hydrogeological model 3 1 3 numerical flow simulation in the last step of our approach a synthetic aquifer with characteristics reproducing the hydrogeological conceptual model is built in the numerical model the aquifer test is simulated within the flow model simulation under a transient flow regime in the numerical model and the computed finally the produced hydrogeological conceptual model is validated by comparing the derivative curves of the simulated drawdown with those derived from aquifer tests based on the similarity in the derivative curve geometry the conceptual model is considered reliable 3 2 application of the proposed approach to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach it was applied in the basaltic aquifer of serra geral aquifer system sgas in the municipality of campina verde located in the triângulo mineiro region south of the state of minas gerais fig 3 in addition to the availability of aquifer test data we adopted as a criterion the absence of other pumping wells within a 1 5 km radius to ensure that the recorded drawdown would not interfere with other wells 3 2 1 study area characterization and field data the geographical coordinates of campina verde are centered on the 19 32 12 south latitude and 49 29 12 west longitude the municipality has a territorial area of 3650 km2 and according to the 2014 population census a total population of 20 022 inhabitants with approximately 70 14 015 inhabitants concentrated in the urban area ibge 2014 the wells used in the present study are located were installed in sgas an outcrop unit in the study area fig 3 regionally the municipality of campina verde lies in the geological context of the paraná basin and includes the vale do rio do peixe and marília formations which belong to the late cretaceous bauru group fig 3 and cover the basalts of the serra geral formation the serra geral formation belongs to the magmatic province of paraná pmp and is composed of a sequence of basalt floods from the jurassic cretaceous age cordani and vandoros 1967 together with the intertrap sandstones the serra geral formation can reach up to a thickness of 1700 m and belongs to the continental scale paraná etendeka magmatic province almeida 1986 according to frank et al 2009 the basalts of the serra geral formation cover nearly 917 000 km2 constituting one of the largest continental flood basalt occurrences these basalts are formed of heterogeneous lava packages with distinct architecture morphology and chemistry rossetti et al 2018 in general the rocks that make up this unit are tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites with subordinate amounts of rhyolites and rhyodacites peate et al 1992 the age of basalt magmatism ranges from 137 ma to 127 ma turner et al 1994 the stratigraphy of the serra geral formation is unsolved due to the absence of stratigraphic markers however it can be chemically divided into low tio2 and high tio2 rossetti et al 2018 the serra geral formation covers nearly 20 of the study site s location fig 3 3 2 2 aquifer test derivative analysis and conceptual model formulation in sgas fig 4 illustrates the simplified geological and constructive profile of the pumping well p1 and the observation well p2 with the latter located 52 m southeast of p1 the aquifer test carried out in the campina verde municipality comprised 24 h of continuous pumping with flow measurement and drawdown over time after the 24 h test period the pumping was stopped and the recovery of the level in the wells was monitored until the water level stabilized to improve the test described here the dynamic level of the observation well p2 located 52 m from the pumping well was also monitored to record any possible interferences during the entire test run before performing the pumping test the tested wells remained off for a period of 6 h to recover and reach the static level during the test the drawdown was measured using a graduated electric water level meter and the variations in well flow rates were periodically assessed by evaluating the time required to fill a 200 l barrel fig 5 a illustrates the flow variations throughout the test notably a drop at the beginning of the test and the subsequent stabilization of the flow can be seen although an attempt was made to keep the maximum flow constant small fluctuations in the pumping flow were registered fig 5b presents the drawdown and recovery data recorded in the two monitored wells showing that the observation well responds instantly to the pumping following a downward trend in water level parallel to that observed in the well that was effectively pumped using aqtesolv software several solutions were successively tested to fit the recorded drawdown the best fit of each selected drawdown and derivative curve of both the pumping and observation wells were evaluated the adjustments of the selected solution to the data of the drawdown curve allowed for the identification of the hydrodynamic parameters to measure the goodness of fit the recorded and calculated drawdown data were compared by computing the root mean square error rmse according to eq 4 4 r m s e i 1 n s i ˆ s i 2 n here s i ˆ s i and n represent the computed drawdown recorded drawdown and number of measurements respectively to build the hydrogeological conceptual model previous works characterizing basaltic aquifers worldwide and focusing on sgas were reviewed in detail the characteristics of the basalts were compatibilized with the assumptions of the fitted solution to elaborate a conceptual model the suitability of the hydrogeological conceptual model was tested by numerical flow simulations using the centered block finite difference code modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and the graphical interface software modelmuse 4 0 winston 2019 the adjusted moench 1985 solution was fitted with an infinite aquifer based on this a large model domain of with 2500 2500 70 m width length height was imposed which was discretized in a finite difference grid of 500 columns 500 rows and three layers a homogeneous aquifer with planar geometry of the layers was assumed the p1 and p2 wells fig 4 were inserted within the model simulating the groundwater pumping of well p1 with variable flow rate fig 5a while the drawdown of observation well p2 was recorded the model parameterization k and ss was optimized by trial and error to produce a simulated drawdown that agrees with that recorded in p2 fig 5b 4 results 4 1 adjustment of drawdown and recovery curves the adjustment of drawdown and derivative curves comprise the key step in our approach as it permits to determine the hydraulic parameters flow regime and types of boundary conditions we tested 5 distinct solutions theoretically compatible with basaltic aquifers gringarten witherspoon solution 1972 neuman solution 1974 moench solution 1984 gringarten ramey solution 1974 and moench solution 1985 below are summarized the main features of tested solutions the gringarten witherspoon solution 1972 was deduced to reproduce the drawdown in fractured aquifers with a single vertical plane fracture intersecting the pumped well neuman solution 1974 describes a solution to porous unconfined aquifers moench solution 1984 calculate the drawdown in a porosity fractured aquifer with double assuming slab shaped or spherical matrix blocks and fracture skin gringarten ramey solution 1974 computes the drawdown in an anisotropic confined aquifer with a horizontal fracture moench solution 1985 calculates the drawdown in a leaky confined aquifer assuming fully penetrating wells fig 7 presents the best fit to the drawdown curve of p1 and p2 using the the comparison of the derivative curve of the fitted solutions and the drawdown curves is presented in fig 8 the rmse of each fitted solution is presented in table 1 as seen in fig 7 all the tested solutions except for neuman 1975 demonstrate similar fitting to the drawdown curve of p1 with the rmse ranging from 0 43 to 0 61 table 1 in the case of p2 the best fit was found using moench 1985 fig 6 b and moench 1985 solutions fig 6e despite the closeness of rmse seen in the case of the gringarten and witherspoon 1972 with respect to the moench 1985 and moench 1985 solutions the curve fitting solution significantly diverges from the first half of the drawdown data moreover the best fit using the gringarten ramey solution 1972 was reached when a 100 m long vertical fracture connected to constant head boundary condition was assumed which is a natural feature absent in the studied site the poorest fit was observed with neuman 1975 solution which is applicable to unconfined aquifers and the gringarten ramey solution 1974 which was developed for single horizontal fractures based on the set of fitting trials performed here the goodness of fit was ambiguously reached using solutions for leaky confined aquifers moench 1985 and double porosity with slab blocks moench 1985 the solution of moench 1985 assumes a fractured formation with flow contribution from both the matrix and fractures while the solution of moench 1985 assumes an aquifer limited at the top and bottom by leaky aquitards the derivative curve of wells p1 and p2 fig 8 are typical of the confined leaky type as seen in fig 1 for this reason we assume that this is the most suitable solution for the evaluated tests moreover evaluating the geological characteristics of basalts and the geometry of derivative curve fig 8 we concluded that the assumptions of moench 1985 solution better match the tested aquifer the transmissivity and storage values obtained from moench s solution 1985 were 5 90 m2 day and 2 70 10 5 respectively 4 2 assumptions of moench 1985 solution owing to the best fit offered by moench 1985 solution the assumptions adopted to deduce this solution were examined for compatibility with the geological contextualization of the tested aquifer moench s solution 1985 conceptualized a leaky aquifer system assuming that the pumped aquifer is bordered on the top and at the base by leaky confining aquifers fig 9 both the aquifer and leaky layers are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic having constant thickness and of infinite radial extent three cases are assumed to occur in a leaky aquifer system depending upon whether the upper boundary of the leaky unit that overlies the aquifer and the lower boundary of the leaky layer that underlies the aquifer the first case is described by constant head boundaries case 1 the second case has no flow boundaries or a combination consisting of a constant head boundary above case 2 and the third comprises a no flow boundary below case 3 for the present study the best fit was obtained by an adjustment of case 3 implicating in a leaking from the overlying semi confined aquifer 4 3 geological conceptual model the internal structure of a single continental basalt flood is complex resulting from the formation of some features produced by lava cooling the vertical differentiation of the cooling rate controls the resulting porosity and permeability in distinct intervals of the basalt flood e g mcgrail et al 2011 zakharova et al 2012 navarro et al 2020 generally a single basalt flood may be divided into three zones consisting of the top flow internal flow or core and bottom flow e g uhl jr and joshi 1986 aubele et al 1988 whitehead 1992 brown et al 2011 navarro et al 2020 the bottom flow was neglected in the current analysis because its thickness comprises only a few decimeters 4 3 1 top flow lava cooling occurs more rapidly across the boundary with the atmosphere involving convection and radiation than with the rock substrate which is only controlled by conduction resulting in isotherms that retreat more rapidly from the top and lateral tips of the flow kattenhorn and schaefer 2008 the experiments carried out by browning et al 2016 demonstrated that the heating and resultant thermal expansion in volcanic rocks spread to pre existing microcracks by small increments or nucleate a relatively small number of new microcracks due to its rapid cooling the top of the basalt flow is typically composed of vesicular basalt characterized by a large proportion of voids produced by gas exsolution during the lava cooling e g saar and manga 1999 melnik 2000 mueller et al 2005 since the basaltic lava flow operates under a low energy regime the magma maintains an equilibrium condition of lava and gas bubbles as it wells up out of the aperture and the rate of bubble growth is proportional to the square root of time mangan and cashman 1996 according to sahagian et al 1989 the coalescence of gas bubbles occurs in the post eruptive stage as bubbles rise and coalesce within a fluid interior inserted between fronts of solidification that develop inside with time from both the top and bottom being overtaken by the solidification fronts that cease to migrate according to mcgrail et al 2006 vesicular layers comprise 15 30 of the basalt flow with evidence of lateral continuity of this layer on a regional scale the pore network connectivity of the top flow is related to the shape of the gas bubble nucleation kinetics and bubble growth e g saar and manga 1999 melnik 2000 mueller et al 2005 due to the factors controlling the volumes of vesicles in the basalts the porosity and permeability broadly vary but they present the highest values in the top flow from a detailed review of the literature we identified the typical variations in porosity and permeability expected at the top of a basalt flow the laboratory measurements of porosity ranges and permeability values of the top flow given in the literature are summarized respectively in tables 2 and 3 from geophysical logging navarro et al 2020 determined the porosity and permeability values in sgas these authors found porosity ranging from 5 to 39 and permeability varying between 10 15 and 10 12 m2 4 3 2 interior flow the internal structure of basalts that s generated by their slow cooling has been exhaustively investigated by several authors long and wood 1986 kattenhorn and schaefer 2008 browning et al 2016 puffer et al 2018 the slow cooling permits the large thickness of the crystallized basalts during the cooling process the contraction stress breaks the rock generating the typical structures of colonnade and entablature as described by long and wood 1986 colonnade refers to columnar structures oriented perpendicularly to the flow boundaries and typically occurring in the basal portion of the flow but which may also constitute its entire thickness or form at several levels alternating with entablatures contrary to well oriented structures of colonnade entablatures are characterized by a greater abundance of randomly oriented cooling joints long and wood 1986 in general the porosity of interior flow is significantly low christensen and wilkens 1982 vinciguerra et al 2005 zakharova et al 2012 while vinciguerra et al 2005 reported a porosity of 1 in columnar basalt christensen and wilkens 1982 reported a range of values between 0 1 and 1 9 zakharova et al 2012 verified that higher porosity values 5 10 correspond in intervals with higher planar fracture density permeability and porosity measurements of the interior portion of the basalt flood massive colonnade and entablature are less common in the literature than the top of the flood mcgrail et al 2011 determined that the permeability of the massive basalt ranges from 10 13 to 10 12 m2 while nara et al 2011 and schaefer et al 2015 reported permeability levels of 10 19 m2 and 10 13 m2 respectively notably according to mcgrail et al 2006 and zakharova et al 2012 the presence of fractures or joints do not contribute significantly to the increase of hydraulic conductivity in the case of sgas navarro et al 2020 found porosity varying between 0 1 and 12 with average of 5 and permeability ranging from 10 18 to 10 13 m2 4 4 conceptual model development besides the assumption in moench 1985 solution the overlap of several basalt floods allows the conceptualization of sgas in the study area as a multi layered aquifer system under this condition the aquifers represented by permeable vesicular layers situated at the top of lava flow are limited at the bottom and top by semi confining units represented by the interior flow it was assumed that the microcracks of interior basalts generated during the cooling period permit a low rate groundwater exchange by leaking this description perfectly matches the assumptions in moench 1985 model allowing us to describe the basaltic aquifer as a leaky confined aquifer based on geological models the tops of the flood where the structures associated with the escape of gases occur with a vesicular can be classified as confined aquifers that are recharged by vertical leaks in the interior portion of the lava flow the discontinuity system is predominantly vertical represented by diaclases with a pseudo columnar feature to columnar or entablature as leaky aquitard layers whose fissures serve as conduits for vertical drainage to the underlying and overlying vesicular layers fig 10 in such a scenario the layers with high permeability are expected to be confined by layers with little permeability at the top although the presence of diaclases generated by the cooling processes allows water to drain from the shallower units to the confined aquifer unit 4 5 numerical simulation of aquifer test to evaluate the reliability of the proposed big picture conceptual model fig 10 a simulation of the aquifer test was performed in a model reproducing it due to the scarcity of field data our model represents a very limited version of reality reproducing the major features of our conceptual model e g alternating of vesicular and massive basalts if the assumptions of our conceptual model are true the derivative curve of the simulated aquifer test would present a similar geometry to the derivative curve of the true test through a trial and error optimization of the model parameterization the best fit was found using the values of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient respectively equal to 4 8 10 6 m s and 1 5 10 6 m 1 in the case of top flow layers 1 and 3 in the case of the interior flow the best fit was observed employing the values of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient respectively equal to 1 5 10 7 m s and 8 10 7 m 1 the overlap of the observed and simulated variations of hydraulic head in p2 indicates a good agreement between them fig 11 a with rmse of 1 21 m this suggests that the numerical and hydrogeological conceptual models are capable of reproducing the studied aquifer with a high degree of representativeness this statement is more evident when evaluating the derivative curve of the simulated drawdown fig 11b which reveals a geometry similar to that expected of a leaky aquifer and also seen in the derivative curves of the aquifer test fig 6 5 discussion the management of subsurface water resources requires full knowledge of the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer measurement of the amount of water stored in subsurface and information on the flow regime that governs the movement of groundwater in the porous systems enemark et al 2019 however in several cases especially in developing countries the required data is scarce leading to great uncertainties in the produced estimations to overcome problems related to data scarcity different approaches using multiple field data walker et al 2019 groundwater age and noble gases manning and caine 2007 tracers burghof et al 2018 and validation by numerical simulations kambuku et al 2018 have been proposed however these approaches were applied to solve specific uncertainties for the studied sites thus to assist in the development of conceptual hydrogeological models in several distinct hydrogeological scenarios a simple approach was developed in the present study to gain a more realistic insights using the aquifer test data the use of a derivative analysis of pumping tests is emphasized in the proposed model because this single tool is capable of offering crucial information to build conceptual models such as the presence of boundary conditions and flow dimension renard et al 2009 consequently the use of derivative analysis is especially suitable to characterize the flow conditions in complex geological settings as previously demonstrated in several works e g giese et al 2017 koïta et al 2017 nassimi and mohammadi 2018 moreover the use of the derivative analysis possibilities to avoid ambiguities in the solutions as seen in single curve match approaches e g ramos et al 2017 ferroud et al 2019 help constrain the generated hydrogeological models since the derivative analysis can provide important responses concerning flow conditions in complex aquifers this methodology is emphasized in developing conceptual geological models presuming that each solution brings together a set of valid premises for specific cases a simple adjustment allows for identifying the flow dimension anisotropy and distance and type of boundary conditions in the tested aquifer the present results reinforce that the evaluation of the drawdown from a pumping well is subject to ambiguity and several distinct solutions can be perfectly fitted fig 6 however the simultaneous fitting of an observation well strongly restricts the curve fitting solutions that can be adjusted finally the use of derivative curves imposes additional restrictions to the curve fitting solutions that can be adjusted of the tested solutions to fit distinct solutions of the drawdown curve fig 6 the double porosity with slab blocks moench 1985 and leaky confined case 3 moench 1985 presented the better match with drawdown and derivative curves from the pumping test however the moench 1985 solution was interpreted as the most appropriate since it is compatible with basaltic aquifers some previous works e g gingerich 1999 hamm et al 2005 rane and jayaraj 2021 also demonstrated by means of derivative analysis that basalts are best represented by leaky confined aquifers abundant works found in the literature conceptualize the basalts from sgas as fractured aquifers with discontinuities generated by tectonic fractures or by lava cooling e g hausman 1974 athayde et al 2012 reginato and ahlert 2013 silva et al 2013 fernandes et al 2016 however the presence of a radial flow instead of linear in the intermediate stage of diagnostic curve supports the absence of large fractures controlling the groundwater flow moreover the use of the solution for single horizontal fig 6b fractures does not produce a good match to the drawdown and derivative curves on the other hand the solution developed for single vertical fractures fig 6a produces a good match only when the fracture is connected to a constant head boundary condition further it is highly improbable that the pumping and observation wells intercept the same fracture importantly the use of derivative analysis does not solve all the ambiguities of the curve fitting solutions therefore the compatibility of the geological contextualization and the assumption of the matched analytical solution is a crucial step in the conceptual model development in the cases in which the assumption of the fitted solution is incompatible with the geological context of the studied site the produced conceptual model will not be reliable under this condition the need to build an alternative conceptual model based on detailed geological contextualization and combined with assumptions of moench 1985 solution was recognized thus the characterization of hydraulic characteristics of basaltic aquifers in several previous works were gathered e g kattenhorn and schaefer 2008 zakharova et al 2012 browning et al 2016 puffer et al 2018 navarro et al 2020 based on the common characteristics described in these works basaltic aquifers were conceptualized as multilayered aquifers in which the permeable vesicular horizons of top flow horizons are overlapped by massive columnar and entablature basalts of the interior portion of subsequent flow lava fig 10 because of the low permeability of interior flow it works as a leaky confining layer transferring groundwater at limited rates this statement aligns with the findings of some previous works e g cruz and silva 2001 hamm et al 2005 ayenew et al 2008 rane and jayaraj 2021 that classify basalts as leaky confined further some previous works already conceptualized sgas as multilayered aquifers with permeable horizons comprised by top flow e g rebouças and fraga 1988 lastoria 2002 as evidenced here the use of a numerical model represents a useful and easy way to diagnose the suitability of a developed hydrogeological conceptual model in cases where the proposed conceptual model is unsuitable to explain the evaluated aquifer the derivative analysis of drawdown computed in the model will be distinct from that observed in the field in the studied case the simulated drawdown satisfactorily fit to the field data drawdown indicating the suitability of the produced conceptual model in the present case the identification of a diagnose curve compatible with leaky confined aquifers also supports the consistency of the proposed conceptual model the simulations revealed that leaky behavior in the derivative curve is only expressed with k values above 5 0 10 8 m s and values below this threshold will behave as a simple confined aquifer with an infinite radial flow considering the insights provided here applying the current approach may guide water prospecting mathematical flow models management of water resources and vulnerability analysis in sgas in view of the conceptual model presented in the present work it is suggested that the permeable zones of the sgas are recharged at extremely slow rates therefore they may have a strong depleting behavior in the case described the strategy for prospecting water consists of identifying the lateral continuity of the permeable horizons from geophysical investigations and integration of data from existing tubular wells 6 conclusions conceptual models are crucial elements to address several problems in hydrogeology especially those involving water management and predictions from numerical simulations the current approach was designed for cases where the field information is scarce or suggests ambiguous interpretations this approach is based on a remarkably simplistic premise that the aquifer conceptual model inherits all the assumptions of the solution that fits the drawdown curve the coupling of the diagnostic plot fitting with the geological contextualization can offer enough information for the elaboration of preliminary conceptual models the primary conceptualization provided by our approach can guide additional investigations aiming to detail the conceptual model by applying this approach it was verified that sgas is represented by a confined aquifer with vertical leak in which the aquifers are formed by vesicular or weathered horizons while the leaky aquitards are represented by the top of flow horizons this statement challenges the common notion in brazil that basalts represent fractured aquifers consequently our approach can prevent the misdirection of investigations guided by inappropriate assumptions for the studied aquifer conclusively the present work demonstrated the ability of pumping tests to provide crucial information to build hydrogeological conceptual models the feasibility of this approach could be proved through future applications in other complex geological frameworks such as karstic aquifers or

11887,the sensitivity of the derivative analysis to the variation of flow rates allows it to solve ambiguities provide diagnostics of the flow dimension and identify the boundary conditions of the tested aquifer based on the results of a derivative analysis it was hypothesized that the set of assumptions for the fitted solution to the drawdown curve are valid for the tested aquifer thus combining the derivative analysis results and the detailed geological characterization a new approach was developed to build preliminary conceptual hydrogeological models in cases where field data are scarce applying this approach it was concluded that basaltic aquifers in the serra geral aquifer system sgas are comprised of leaky confined aquifers which the alternation of basalt floods that have permeable horizons at the top and with low permeability of interior flow the simulated drawdown curve in a transient flow model perfectly matched with the drawdown curve recorded in the field thus supporting the suitability of the built conceptual model this statement challenges the prevailing theory that conceptualizes sgas as a fractured aquifer conclusively the current approach is capable of producing suitable conceptual models in cases of field data scarcity future investigations in other complex geological contexts may validate the present approach graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer test diagnostic plot groundwater flow model serra geral aquifer 1 introduction a pumping test is a field test in which groundwater is withdrawn at a controlled rate and the water level response drawdown is measured in one or more nearby observation wells and the pumping well itself walton 2019 typically the single purpose of a pumping test is to estimate the hydraulic properties of an aquifer system such as transmissivity hydraulic conductivity horizontal and vertical and storage coefficient as well as to assess well productivity walton 2019 the data obtained from the pumping tests are useful for the groundwater management e g machiwal et al 2017 masoud 2020 shekhar et al 2020 and serve as a source of parameterization of mathematical flow models e g baalousha 2016 sahoo and jha 2017 xiao et al 2019 the first solution to describe the groundwater flow to a pumping well was developed by theis 1935 which considered a homogeneous confined aquifer horizontally isotropic and laterally infinite with a constant flow due to the assumptions in theis s model 1935 this solution cannot be applied in all cases for this reason different analytical solutions have been successively proposed to obtain the hydraulic parameters for different types of aquifers e g dewandel et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 as revealed by renard et al 2009 each of these solutions was deduced from a specific set of premises a fact that makes them valid only for specific conditions vertical or horizontal fracture flow double porosity leaky confined etc an additional evaluation process of drawdown data by derivative analysis can provide relevant information such as the distance from the well to the boundary conditions no flow or constant head substratum inclination anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and flow dimension e g renard et al 2009 ferroud et al 2019 several studies have demonstrated the ability of derivative analysis to improve the understanding of the mechanistic process controlling the groundwater flow in complex aquifers e g giese et al 2017 ferroud et al 2019 rane and jayaraj 2021 the results produced by derivative analysis can guide the formulation of hydrogeological conceptual models conceptual models are fundamental elements in hydrogeological studies and they bring together a set of hypotheses contemplating the hydraulic properties conditioning and processes in hydrogeological problems e g enemark et al 2019 mustafa et al 2020 the elaboration of conceptual hydrogeological models is conditioned by the interpretation of existing data and as such several different conceptual models can be ambiguously proposed using the same data which generates uncertainties regarding the validity of such models e g sullivan et al 2020 enemark et al 2019 different methodological approaches varying in their premises integration of data and fields and methods for validation have been proposed for the development of conceptual hydrogeological models e g marques et al 2019 de filippis et al 2020 enemark et al 2019 as per consensus all these studies point to the need to obtain a large amount of data to restrict the number of potentially viable conceptual models and thereby reduce uncertainties bearing in mind that a derivative analysis of the drawdown curves can determine the hydraulic parameters of the aquifers they offer the diagnosis of the flow regime and the existence of boundary conditions these can be useful for the elaboration or improvement of hydrogeological models this finding is supported by several studies which demonstrate that pumping tests can be essential elements in the development of conceptual hydrogeological models e g giese et al 2017 kambuku et al 2018 sproule et al 2021 despite the pivotal importance of hydrogeological conceptual models the available field data are insufficient to build a comprehensive conceptual model in several cases consequently to overcome the problems related to field data scarcity the present work was aimed at developing a simplistic approach that uses a derivative analysis of the drawdown curves associated with a parsimonious analysis of an aquifer s geological context to build a preliminary conceptual hydrogeological model to assess the suitability of proposed approach it was tested in a basaltic aquifer in southeastern brazil 2 pumping tests and derivative analysis a pumping test defines the field tests designed to obtain the hydraulic properties transmissivity and storage of the aquifer under study typically a production well is pumped at full capacity and or at a constant rate while the water levels are measured at frequent intervals in the production well and neighboring observation wells importantly the water level data measured in the pumping well is less accurate and reliable due to the turbulence created by the pumping and because of well losses consequently the resulting water level drawdowns recorded in pumping wells are not representative of the drawdown in the aquifer and at least one observation well should be used when available the time series of the drawdown of hydraulic head was plotted as time drawdown and or distance drawdown graph and analyzed with model equations and type curve matching straight line matching or inflection point selection techniques the drawdown s l the difference between hydraulic head h l at time t t and the initial hydraulic head h0 l represents the recorded parameters in the pumping test the parameter s in a confined non leaky homogeneous and isotropic aquifer with hydraulic conductivity k l t at distance r l from the pumping well may be described by the governing equation for a two dimensional form of radial flow toward the pumping well as given below theis 1935 1 2 s r 2 1 r s r s t s t here t and s represent the transmissivity l2 t and storage coefficient of the aquifer dimensionless respectively bourdet et al 1989 developed a derivative analysis in which the pressure data p were also plotted along with the values of the pressure derivative dp d logt in formation tests allowing for more accurate diagnoses of the flow regimes in oil reservoirs renard et al 2009 demonstrated that this approach is also functional in diagnosing the type of groundwater flow to the wells in pumping tests based on the derivative of ds dlog t considering that the drawdown derivative is particularly sensitive to small variations in the drawdown rate defining the logarithmic derivative of drawdown as a relation expressed by eq 2 the derivative of the time series composed by n drawdown si and time ti values may be approximated as a slope between two successive data points and to multiply it by the time correspondent to the center of the interval calculated as the arithmetic mean t m t i t i 1 2 as expressed by eq 3 2 s ln t t s t 3 s l n t t m t i t i 1 2 s i s i 1 t i t i 1 the graphical representation of the diagnostic curve which is a combined graphical representation of s and ds dlog t vs time is used to improve the interpretation of the pumping tests the derivative curve of the pumping tests is calculated using the methodology of bourdet et al 1989 which approximates the derivative of the drawdown curve using equation 3 the geometry of the diagnostic curve that allows us to discern the flow offers the diagnosis of flow regimes capable of explaining the drawdown as a function of time as demonstrated by renard et al 2009 aquifers with a distinct flow regime will present a discernible and typical geometry of derivative curves as exemplified in fig 1 if the aquifer is bound by an impermeable contour the drawdown curve is represented by an upward linear curve the most suitable solution for the tested aquifer is that which allows the simultaneous adjustment to the lowering curve of the pumped and observed wells as well as their respective derivative curves 3 material and methods 3 1 proposed approach to generate hydrogeological conceptual model the current approach was designed assuming a case in which aquifer tests are available but other field data are scarce or even absent the aquifer test provides some important aspects of flow dimension such as the type of boundary conditions geometry of flow and estimation of aquifer properties it was also hypothesized that that the main assumptions of fitted solution are valid to tested aquifer consequently the assumptions of adjusted solution and geological characteristics obtained from the literature provided the basis for the conceptual model the general framework of the proposed approach is illustrated in fig 2 3 1 1 field data in the first step of this approach fig 2 data for the aquifer test and geological contextualization are obtained the aquifer tests serve as the main tool to obtain the characteristics of the tested aquifer using the derivative analysis in the second step geological contextualization is performed to identify the main geological features controlling the storage and flow of groundwater in the studied aquifer for instance in cases of hard rock terrain the regional geological discontinuities can play an important role in the groundwater flow on the other hand the interactions and water exchange processes between individual aquifers within multilayered sedimentary aquifers are complex and governed by the characteristics of confining or semi confining units a careful and detailed evaluation of the literature forms the basis of this conceptual geological model 3 1 2 conceptual model development the present approach explicitly assumes that the set of assumptions used to deduce the analytical solution fitted to drawdown curve is valid for the tested aquifer and may be incorporated in the hydrogeological conceptual model in the third step of the process fig 2 the hydrogeological conceptual model is built by integrating the geological characterization produced in step 1 and the results of the derivative analysis of the aquifer tests the derivative analysis of available aquifer tests identifies crucial information concerning flow geometry and boundary conditions besides the model parametrization they are compatible within the local geological context for the elaboration of the conceptual hydrogeological model 3 1 3 numerical flow simulation in the last step of our approach a synthetic aquifer with characteristics reproducing the hydrogeological conceptual model is built in the numerical model the aquifer test is simulated within the flow model simulation under a transient flow regime in the numerical model and the computed finally the produced hydrogeological conceptual model is validated by comparing the derivative curves of the simulated drawdown with those derived from aquifer tests based on the similarity in the derivative curve geometry the conceptual model is considered reliable 3 2 application of the proposed approach to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach it was applied in the basaltic aquifer of serra geral aquifer system sgas in the municipality of campina verde located in the triângulo mineiro region south of the state of minas gerais fig 3 in addition to the availability of aquifer test data we adopted as a criterion the absence of other pumping wells within a 1 5 km radius to ensure that the recorded drawdown would not interfere with other wells 3 2 1 study area characterization and field data the geographical coordinates of campina verde are centered on the 19 32 12 south latitude and 49 29 12 west longitude the municipality has a territorial area of 3650 km2 and according to the 2014 population census a total population of 20 022 inhabitants with approximately 70 14 015 inhabitants concentrated in the urban area ibge 2014 the wells used in the present study are located were installed in sgas an outcrop unit in the study area fig 3 regionally the municipality of campina verde lies in the geological context of the paraná basin and includes the vale do rio do peixe and marília formations which belong to the late cretaceous bauru group fig 3 and cover the basalts of the serra geral formation the serra geral formation belongs to the magmatic province of paraná pmp and is composed of a sequence of basalt floods from the jurassic cretaceous age cordani and vandoros 1967 together with the intertrap sandstones the serra geral formation can reach up to a thickness of 1700 m and belongs to the continental scale paraná etendeka magmatic province almeida 1986 according to frank et al 2009 the basalts of the serra geral formation cover nearly 917 000 km2 constituting one of the largest continental flood basalt occurrences these basalts are formed of heterogeneous lava packages with distinct architecture morphology and chemistry rossetti et al 2018 in general the rocks that make up this unit are tholeiitic basalts and basaltic andesites with subordinate amounts of rhyolites and rhyodacites peate et al 1992 the age of basalt magmatism ranges from 137 ma to 127 ma turner et al 1994 the stratigraphy of the serra geral formation is unsolved due to the absence of stratigraphic markers however it can be chemically divided into low tio2 and high tio2 rossetti et al 2018 the serra geral formation covers nearly 20 of the study site s location fig 3 3 2 2 aquifer test derivative analysis and conceptual model formulation in sgas fig 4 illustrates the simplified geological and constructive profile of the pumping well p1 and the observation well p2 with the latter located 52 m southeast of p1 the aquifer test carried out in the campina verde municipality comprised 24 h of continuous pumping with flow measurement and drawdown over time after the 24 h test period the pumping was stopped and the recovery of the level in the wells was monitored until the water level stabilized to improve the test described here the dynamic level of the observation well p2 located 52 m from the pumping well was also monitored to record any possible interferences during the entire test run before performing the pumping test the tested wells remained off for a period of 6 h to recover and reach the static level during the test the drawdown was measured using a graduated electric water level meter and the variations in well flow rates were periodically assessed by evaluating the time required to fill a 200 l barrel fig 5 a illustrates the flow variations throughout the test notably a drop at the beginning of the test and the subsequent stabilization of the flow can be seen although an attempt was made to keep the maximum flow constant small fluctuations in the pumping flow were registered fig 5b presents the drawdown and recovery data recorded in the two monitored wells showing that the observation well responds instantly to the pumping following a downward trend in water level parallel to that observed in the well that was effectively pumped using aqtesolv software several solutions were successively tested to fit the recorded drawdown the best fit of each selected drawdown and derivative curve of both the pumping and observation wells were evaluated the adjustments of the selected solution to the data of the drawdown curve allowed for the identification of the hydrodynamic parameters to measure the goodness of fit the recorded and calculated drawdown data were compared by computing the root mean square error rmse according to eq 4 4 r m s e i 1 n s i ˆ s i 2 n here s i ˆ s i and n represent the computed drawdown recorded drawdown and number of measurements respectively to build the hydrogeological conceptual model previous works characterizing basaltic aquifers worldwide and focusing on sgas were reviewed in detail the characteristics of the basalts were compatibilized with the assumptions of the fitted solution to elaborate a conceptual model the suitability of the hydrogeological conceptual model was tested by numerical flow simulations using the centered block finite difference code modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and the graphical interface software modelmuse 4 0 winston 2019 the adjusted moench 1985 solution was fitted with an infinite aquifer based on this a large model domain of with 2500 2500 70 m width length height was imposed which was discretized in a finite difference grid of 500 columns 500 rows and three layers a homogeneous aquifer with planar geometry of the layers was assumed the p1 and p2 wells fig 4 were inserted within the model simulating the groundwater pumping of well p1 with variable flow rate fig 5a while the drawdown of observation well p2 was recorded the model parameterization k and ss was optimized by trial and error to produce a simulated drawdown that agrees with that recorded in p2 fig 5b 4 results 4 1 adjustment of drawdown and recovery curves the adjustment of drawdown and derivative curves comprise the key step in our approach as it permits to determine the hydraulic parameters flow regime and types of boundary conditions we tested 5 distinct solutions theoretically compatible with basaltic aquifers gringarten witherspoon solution 1972 neuman solution 1974 moench solution 1984 gringarten ramey solution 1974 and moench solution 1985 below are summarized the main features of tested solutions the gringarten witherspoon solution 1972 was deduced to reproduce the drawdown in fractured aquifers with a single vertical plane fracture intersecting the pumped well neuman solution 1974 describes a solution to porous unconfined aquifers moench solution 1984 calculate the drawdown in a porosity fractured aquifer with double assuming slab shaped or spherical matrix blocks and fracture skin gringarten ramey solution 1974 computes the drawdown in an anisotropic confined aquifer with a horizontal fracture moench solution 1985 calculates the drawdown in a leaky confined aquifer assuming fully penetrating wells fig 7 presents the best fit to the drawdown curve of p1 and p2 using the the comparison of the derivative curve of the fitted solutions and the drawdown curves is presented in fig 8 the rmse of each fitted solution is presented in table 1 as seen in fig 7 all the tested solutions except for neuman 1975 demonstrate similar fitting to the drawdown curve of p1 with the rmse ranging from 0 43 to 0 61 table 1 in the case of p2 the best fit was found using moench 1985 fig 6 b and moench 1985 solutions fig 6e despite the closeness of rmse seen in the case of the gringarten and witherspoon 1972 with respect to the moench 1985 and moench 1985 solutions the curve fitting solution significantly diverges from the first half of the drawdown data moreover the best fit using the gringarten ramey solution 1972 was reached when a 100 m long vertical fracture connected to constant head boundary condition was assumed which is a natural feature absent in the studied site the poorest fit was observed with neuman 1975 solution which is applicable to unconfined aquifers and the gringarten ramey solution 1974 which was developed for single horizontal fractures based on the set of fitting trials performed here the goodness of fit was ambiguously reached using solutions for leaky confined aquifers moench 1985 and double porosity with slab blocks moench 1985 the solution of moench 1985 assumes a fractured formation with flow contribution from both the matrix and fractures while the solution of moench 1985 assumes an aquifer limited at the top and bottom by leaky aquitards the derivative curve of wells p1 and p2 fig 8 are typical of the confined leaky type as seen in fig 1 for this reason we assume that this is the most suitable solution for the evaluated tests moreover evaluating the geological characteristics of basalts and the geometry of derivative curve fig 8 we concluded that the assumptions of moench 1985 solution better match the tested aquifer the transmissivity and storage values obtained from moench s solution 1985 were 5 90 m2 day and 2 70 10 5 respectively 4 2 assumptions of moench 1985 solution owing to the best fit offered by moench 1985 solution the assumptions adopted to deduce this solution were examined for compatibility with the geological contextualization of the tested aquifer moench s solution 1985 conceptualized a leaky aquifer system assuming that the pumped aquifer is bordered on the top and at the base by leaky confining aquifers fig 9 both the aquifer and leaky layers are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic having constant thickness and of infinite radial extent three cases are assumed to occur in a leaky aquifer system depending upon whether the upper boundary of the leaky unit that overlies the aquifer and the lower boundary of the leaky layer that underlies the aquifer the first case is described by constant head boundaries case 1 the second case has no flow boundaries or a combination consisting of a constant head boundary above case 2 and the third comprises a no flow boundary below case 3 for the present study the best fit was obtained by an adjustment of case 3 implicating in a leaking from the overlying semi confined aquifer 4 3 geological conceptual model the internal structure of a single continental basalt flood is complex resulting from the formation of some features produced by lava cooling the vertical differentiation of the cooling rate controls the resulting porosity and permeability in distinct intervals of the basalt flood e g mcgrail et al 2011 zakharova et al 2012 navarro et al 2020 generally a single basalt flood may be divided into three zones consisting of the top flow internal flow or core and bottom flow e g uhl jr and joshi 1986 aubele et al 1988 whitehead 1992 brown et al 2011 navarro et al 2020 the bottom flow was neglected in the current analysis because its thickness comprises only a few decimeters 4 3 1 top flow lava cooling occurs more rapidly across the boundary with the atmosphere involving convection and radiation than with the rock substrate which is only controlled by conduction resulting in isotherms that retreat more rapidly from the top and lateral tips of the flow kattenhorn and schaefer 2008 the experiments carried out by browning et al 2016 demonstrated that the heating and resultant thermal expansion in volcanic rocks spread to pre existing microcracks by small increments or nucleate a relatively small number of new microcracks due to its rapid cooling the top of the basalt flow is typically composed of vesicular basalt characterized by a large proportion of voids produced by gas exsolution during the lava cooling e g saar and manga 1999 melnik 2000 mueller et al 2005 since the basaltic lava flow operates under a low energy regime the magma maintains an equilibrium condition of lava and gas bubbles as it wells up out of the aperture and the rate of bubble growth is proportional to the square root of time mangan and cashman 1996 according to sahagian et al 1989 the coalescence of gas bubbles occurs in the post eruptive stage as bubbles rise and coalesce within a fluid interior inserted between fronts of solidification that develop inside with time from both the top and bottom being overtaken by the solidification fronts that cease to migrate according to mcgrail et al 2006 vesicular layers comprise 15 30 of the basalt flow with evidence of lateral continuity of this layer on a regional scale the pore network connectivity of the top flow is related to the shape of the gas bubble nucleation kinetics and bubble growth e g saar and manga 1999 melnik 2000 mueller et al 2005 due to the factors controlling the volumes of vesicles in the basalts the porosity and permeability broadly vary but they present the highest values in the top flow from a detailed review of the literature we identified the typical variations in porosity and permeability expected at the top of a basalt flow the laboratory measurements of porosity ranges and permeability values of the top flow given in the literature are summarized respectively in tables 2 and 3 from geophysical logging navarro et al 2020 determined the porosity and permeability values in sgas these authors found porosity ranging from 5 to 39 and permeability varying between 10 15 and 10 12 m2 4 3 2 interior flow the internal structure of basalts that s generated by their slow cooling has been exhaustively investigated by several authors long and wood 1986 kattenhorn and schaefer 2008 browning et al 2016 puffer et al 2018 the slow cooling permits the large thickness of the crystallized basalts during the cooling process the contraction stress breaks the rock generating the typical structures of colonnade and entablature as described by long and wood 1986 colonnade refers to columnar structures oriented perpendicularly to the flow boundaries and typically occurring in the basal portion of the flow but which may also constitute its entire thickness or form at several levels alternating with entablatures contrary to well oriented structures of colonnade entablatures are characterized by a greater abundance of randomly oriented cooling joints long and wood 1986 in general the porosity of interior flow is significantly low christensen and wilkens 1982 vinciguerra et al 2005 zakharova et al 2012 while vinciguerra et al 2005 reported a porosity of 1 in columnar basalt christensen and wilkens 1982 reported a range of values between 0 1 and 1 9 zakharova et al 2012 verified that higher porosity values 5 10 correspond in intervals with higher planar fracture density permeability and porosity measurements of the interior portion of the basalt flood massive colonnade and entablature are less common in the literature than the top of the flood mcgrail et al 2011 determined that the permeability of the massive basalt ranges from 10 13 to 10 12 m2 while nara et al 2011 and schaefer et al 2015 reported permeability levels of 10 19 m2 and 10 13 m2 respectively notably according to mcgrail et al 2006 and zakharova et al 2012 the presence of fractures or joints do not contribute significantly to the increase of hydraulic conductivity in the case of sgas navarro et al 2020 found porosity varying between 0 1 and 12 with average of 5 and permeability ranging from 10 18 to 10 13 m2 4 4 conceptual model development besides the assumption in moench 1985 solution the overlap of several basalt floods allows the conceptualization of sgas in the study area as a multi layered aquifer system under this condition the aquifers represented by permeable vesicular layers situated at the top of lava flow are limited at the bottom and top by semi confining units represented by the interior flow it was assumed that the microcracks of interior basalts generated during the cooling period permit a low rate groundwater exchange by leaking this description perfectly matches the assumptions in moench 1985 model allowing us to describe the basaltic aquifer as a leaky confined aquifer based on geological models the tops of the flood where the structures associated with the escape of gases occur with a vesicular can be classified as confined aquifers that are recharged by vertical leaks in the interior portion of the lava flow the discontinuity system is predominantly vertical represented by diaclases with a pseudo columnar feature to columnar or entablature as leaky aquitard layers whose fissures serve as conduits for vertical drainage to the underlying and overlying vesicular layers fig 10 in such a scenario the layers with high permeability are expected to be confined by layers with little permeability at the top although the presence of diaclases generated by the cooling processes allows water to drain from the shallower units to the confined aquifer unit 4 5 numerical simulation of aquifer test to evaluate the reliability of the proposed big picture conceptual model fig 10 a simulation of the aquifer test was performed in a model reproducing it due to the scarcity of field data our model represents a very limited version of reality reproducing the major features of our conceptual model e g alternating of vesicular and massive basalts if the assumptions of our conceptual model are true the derivative curve of the simulated aquifer test would present a similar geometry to the derivative curve of the true test through a trial and error optimization of the model parameterization the best fit was found using the values of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient respectively equal to 4 8 10 6 m s and 1 5 10 6 m 1 in the case of top flow layers 1 and 3 in the case of the interior flow the best fit was observed employing the values of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient respectively equal to 1 5 10 7 m s and 8 10 7 m 1 the overlap of the observed and simulated variations of hydraulic head in p2 indicates a good agreement between them fig 11 a with rmse of 1 21 m this suggests that the numerical and hydrogeological conceptual models are capable of reproducing the studied aquifer with a high degree of representativeness this statement is more evident when evaluating the derivative curve of the simulated drawdown fig 11b which reveals a geometry similar to that expected of a leaky aquifer and also seen in the derivative curves of the aquifer test fig 6 5 discussion the management of subsurface water resources requires full knowledge of the hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer measurement of the amount of water stored in subsurface and information on the flow regime that governs the movement of groundwater in the porous systems enemark et al 2019 however in several cases especially in developing countries the required data is scarce leading to great uncertainties in the produced estimations to overcome problems related to data scarcity different approaches using multiple field data walker et al 2019 groundwater age and noble gases manning and caine 2007 tracers burghof et al 2018 and validation by numerical simulations kambuku et al 2018 have been proposed however these approaches were applied to solve specific uncertainties for the studied sites thus to assist in the development of conceptual hydrogeological models in several distinct hydrogeological scenarios a simple approach was developed in the present study to gain a more realistic insights using the aquifer test data the use of a derivative analysis of pumping tests is emphasized in the proposed model because this single tool is capable of offering crucial information to build conceptual models such as the presence of boundary conditions and flow dimension renard et al 2009 consequently the use of derivative analysis is especially suitable to characterize the flow conditions in complex geological settings as previously demonstrated in several works e g giese et al 2017 koïta et al 2017 nassimi and mohammadi 2018 moreover the use of the derivative analysis possibilities to avoid ambiguities in the solutions as seen in single curve match approaches e g ramos et al 2017 ferroud et al 2019 help constrain the generated hydrogeological models since the derivative analysis can provide important responses concerning flow conditions in complex aquifers this methodology is emphasized in developing conceptual geological models presuming that each solution brings together a set of valid premises for specific cases a simple adjustment allows for identifying the flow dimension anisotropy and distance and type of boundary conditions in the tested aquifer the present results reinforce that the evaluation of the drawdown from a pumping well is subject to ambiguity and several distinct solutions can be perfectly fitted fig 6 however the simultaneous fitting of an observation well strongly restricts the curve fitting solutions that can be adjusted finally the use of derivative curves imposes additional restrictions to the curve fitting solutions that can be adjusted of the tested solutions to fit distinct solutions of the drawdown curve fig 6 the double porosity with slab blocks moench 1985 and leaky confined case 3 moench 1985 presented the better match with drawdown and derivative curves from the pumping test however the moench 1985 solution was interpreted as the most appropriate since it is compatible with basaltic aquifers some previous works e g gingerich 1999 hamm et al 2005 rane and jayaraj 2021 also demonstrated by means of derivative analysis that basalts are best represented by leaky confined aquifers abundant works found in the literature conceptualize the basalts from sgas as fractured aquifers with discontinuities generated by tectonic fractures or by lava cooling e g hausman 1974 athayde et al 2012 reginato and ahlert 2013 silva et al 2013 fernandes et al 2016 however the presence of a radial flow instead of linear in the intermediate stage of diagnostic curve supports the absence of large fractures controlling the groundwater flow moreover the use of the solution for single horizontal fig 6b fractures does not produce a good match to the drawdown and derivative curves on the other hand the solution developed for single vertical fractures fig 6a produces a good match only when the fracture is connected to a constant head boundary condition further it is highly improbable that the pumping and observation wells intercept the same fracture importantly the use of derivative analysis does not solve all the ambiguities of the curve fitting solutions therefore the compatibility of the geological contextualization and the assumption of the matched analytical solution is a crucial step in the conceptual model development in the cases in which the assumption of the fitted solution is incompatible with the geological context of the studied site the produced conceptual model will not be reliable under this condition the need to build an alternative conceptual model based on detailed geological contextualization and combined with assumptions of moench 1985 solution was recognized thus the characterization of hydraulic characteristics of basaltic aquifers in several previous works were gathered e g kattenhorn and schaefer 2008 zakharova et al 2012 browning et al 2016 puffer et al 2018 navarro et al 2020 based on the common characteristics described in these works basaltic aquifers were conceptualized as multilayered aquifers in which the permeable vesicular horizons of top flow horizons are overlapped by massive columnar and entablature basalts of the interior portion of subsequent flow lava fig 10 because of the low permeability of interior flow it works as a leaky confining layer transferring groundwater at limited rates this statement aligns with the findings of some previous works e g cruz and silva 2001 hamm et al 2005 ayenew et al 2008 rane and jayaraj 2021 that classify basalts as leaky confined further some previous works already conceptualized sgas as multilayered aquifers with permeable horizons comprised by top flow e g rebouças and fraga 1988 lastoria 2002 as evidenced here the use of a numerical model represents a useful and easy way to diagnose the suitability of a developed hydrogeological conceptual model in cases where the proposed conceptual model is unsuitable to explain the evaluated aquifer the derivative analysis of drawdown computed in the model will be distinct from that observed in the field in the studied case the simulated drawdown satisfactorily fit to the field data drawdown indicating the suitability of the produced conceptual model in the present case the identification of a diagnose curve compatible with leaky confined aquifers also supports the consistency of the proposed conceptual model the simulations revealed that leaky behavior in the derivative curve is only expressed with k values above 5 0 10 8 m s and values below this threshold will behave as a simple confined aquifer with an infinite radial flow considering the insights provided here applying the current approach may guide water prospecting mathematical flow models management of water resources and vulnerability analysis in sgas in view of the conceptual model presented in the present work it is suggested that the permeable zones of the sgas are recharged at extremely slow rates therefore they may have a strong depleting behavior in the case described the strategy for prospecting water consists of identifying the lateral continuity of the permeable horizons from geophysical investigations and integration of data from existing tubular wells 6 conclusions conceptual models are crucial elements to address several problems in hydrogeology especially those involving water management and predictions from numerical simulations the current approach was designed for cases where the field information is scarce or suggests ambiguous interpretations this approach is based on a remarkably simplistic premise that the aquifer conceptual model inherits all the assumptions of the solution that fits the drawdown curve the coupling of the diagnostic plot fitting with the geological contextualization can offer enough information for the elaboration of preliminary conceptual models the primary conceptualization provided by our approach can guide additional investigations aiming to detail the conceptual model by applying this approach it was verified that sgas is represented by a confined aquifer with vertical leak in which the aquifers are formed by vesicular or weathered horizons while the leaky aquitards are represented by the top of flow horizons this statement challenges the common notion in brazil that basalts represent fractured aquifers consequently our approach can prevent the misdirection of investigations guided by inappropriate assumptions for the studied aquifer conclusively the present work demonstrated the ability of pumping tests to provide crucial information to build hydrogeological conceptual models the feasibility of this approach could be proved through future applications in other complex geological frameworks such as karstic aquifers or

11888,presence of fluoride f in drinking water both at low and high levels causes serious human health hazard in this investigation 106 number of groundwater samples of angul district odisha india were collected and analyzed using statistical hydrogeochemical spatial distribution and health risk assessment methods about 28 of the collected groundwater samples the concentration of f exceeded the permissible limit set by who as well as buero of indian standards bis apart from this 13 of the collected samples the concentration of f varied from 2 to 3 4 mgl 1 and thus highly harmful for human consumption the human health risk assessment was carried out as recommended by the usepa in the study area the calculated hazard quotient hq caused by f contamination varied from 0 0 to 2 12 and 0 0 to 3 92 for adults and children respectively almost 28 30 and 58 49 groundwater samples are exhibited non carcinogenic health risk due to f contamination for adult and children respectively the non carcinogenic health risk posed by f to children is higher than adult further f exhibited a positive correlation with bicarbonate hco3 alkalinity the concentration of f increases with ph which indicating that higher ph augments the dissolutions of f ions from metamorphic and sedimentary f containing minerals of the study area in addition intensive uses of phosphate fertilizer pesticides and industrial activities may be contributing as the other sources of f in the groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords angul groundwater fluoride bicarbonate hydrogeochemical spatial distribution correlation health risk assessment 1 introduction groundwater is a potential source of drinking water for consumption of human beings all over the globe however extensive pollution of groundwater causes major damage to its quality contamination of fluoride f in groundwater and aquifers is a serious concern throughout the world including india ali et al 2018 2019 yadav et al 2020 kimambo et al 2019 aullon alcaine et al 2020 patel et al 2017 mariño et al 2020 in general f occurs naturally in wide varieties of minerals such as topaz cryolite amphiboles apatite villiamite fluorospar mica rock phosphate and sellaite ali et al 2019 ijumulana et al 2020 mohanta et al 2020 the increase in concentration of f in groundwater may be due to the leaching of these minerals further various anthropogenic activities also play a vital role in elevation of f in groundwater system guissouma et al 2017 kimambo et al 2019 the concentration of f in groundwater increases due to the industrial application of these minerals for instance cryolite is used to produce pesticides and extraction of aluminium similarly rock phosphate is uses for the manufacture of fertilizer particularly triple super phosphate and pesticides qasemi et al 2019 industrial production of glass steel and copper also liberates f to the receiving environment and consequently percolates deep into the groundwater panaskar et al 2017 very often industrial accident and leakage increases the environmental loading rate of f for instance recently industrial leakage of hydrofluoric gas in the republic of south korea drastically increased the f concentration in the receiving environment vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in addition f is also forms in the municipal water due to application of sodium hexafluorosilicate fluorosilicic acid and sodium fluoride in the fluoridation schemes in general f is known to be an essential oligo element which facilitates the proper growth and development of bone and teeth boulétreau et al 2006 fluoride displaces the hydroxide ions from hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh of bones and teeth as a result produces more harder and tougher fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f consequently strengthening the enamel of teeth when administered at its low concentration kimambo et al 2019 as shown in eq 1 ca 5 po 4 3 oh f ca 5 po 4 3 f oh 1 however elevated concentrations of f 1

the elevated levels of f in groundwater of different countries across the world like india china parts of africa argentina have been reported in literature vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 alcaine et al 2020 sun et al 2013 fluorosis is an endemic disease in 14 states and 150 000 villages in india together with 6 million children are reported to be suffering from fluorosis susheela 1999 jacks et al 2005 further the concentration of f in the rural parts of the india is 1 85 times greater than urban areas ali et al 2019 it has been reported that the pooled f concentration in indian is about 2 37 mgl 1 which is far greater than the who world health organization recommended value of 1 5 mgl 1 ali et al 2019 who 2011 among the most f affected states of eastern india west bengal assam and odisha

the other hand rest part of the district is belonging to rural area and most of the population are working as subsistence farmer and economically poor the mainstream of this population depends on dug open wells or boreholes water for domestic application it is very essential to understand how different types of trace elements are distributed in the groundwater their spatial patterns and the trends

groundwater resource management application of geographic information system gis along with arcgis software is one of the most promising techniques for investigation of spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater quality parameters abokifa et al 2016 gholizadeh et al 2017 hajizadeh et al 2017 in recent years health risk assessment of groundwater quality has gained more attention and carried out by many researchers across the globe mohanta et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019a bhattacharya et al 2020 bodrud doza 2020 it assists to find out the potential health risks caused by

angul district is 6232 sq kms angul is situated at an average height of 139 m above mean sea level msl as per 2011 census reports the population density of angul district is 199 persons per sq km the average annual rainfall of the district is 1421 mm the angul district comprises diverse groups of geological sequence contain super group of iron rocks of eastern ghats gondwana super group laterites to alluvial deposits the gondwana rocks are present in kaniha talcher chendipada kishorenagar blocks of central angul the gondwana group of rocks extends northwards from this fault up to rivers tikra and brahmani where it is separated again from the archean group of rocks by another fault the major rocks present in the gondwana group are belonging to conglomerates colored laminated shales and sand stone of highly ferruginous nature this group of rocks is comprises sand stone and shales the main rock types found in archean group are quartzite which is occasionally micacious horneblendebiotite micaschist granite and gneisses on the other hand the remaining part from west of murhi and north of angul up to the western end of angul contain sedimentary rocks of gondawana group with huge deposits of coal mostly in talcher zone the widespread mahanadi coal field and talcher coal fields limited are situated in this area commonly the slope of the zone is from west to east and from north to south the talcher region of angul district is a well known industrial zone of orissa the presence of talcher coalfields and the river brahmani are the major reasons for the growth of several industries in this area for instance thermal power ntpc heavy water plant aluminum plant nalco fertilizer plant fci jindal steel plant and bhusana steel plant etc the presence of these industries causes serious environmental pollution in this area therefore the central pollution control board delhi identified this industrial belt as one of the 24 problem areas in the country in the study area shallow and deep wells groundwater are the primary source of portable water however uncontrolled groundwater uses together with leaching of agricultural and industrial waste are the major concern in the study area thus regular monitoring of water quality and its assessment is highly essential which is not yet explored in this region so far 2 2 groundwater sampling the grid map of the study area was prepared at 6 6 km sampling interval as shown in fig 1 a total 106 number of groundwater samples from different locations including urban rural and industrial area were collected systematically as per the grid map during the month between march to june the sample were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles previously soaked in 15 v v hno3 for one day followed by rinsed with double distilled water and kept in a fridge at 4 c for subsequent uses prior to sampling the tube wells were pumped for several minutes to eliminate any stagnant water 2 3 analysis of groundwater samples the ph of the collected groundwater samples were measured on site using a using a hq440d laboratory dual input multi parameter electrode system hach co usa the geographic position of each sampling was recorded using a hand held global positioning system etrex 20 gramin concentration of f was analyzed by fluoride ion selective electrode coupled to ion analyzer 9609bnwp thermofsischer scientific usa alkalinity of the collected samples was estimated by titration method as described in apha 2005 2 4 human health risk assessment the contamination of groundwater poses severs negative effect on human health thus it is very crucial to evaluate the human health risk posed by different groundwater contaminants health risk assessment deals with the rate of pollutant loads to human beings and evaluates its probable health hazards mohanta et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019 bhattacharya et al 2020 bodrud doza 2020 in the present study the health risk associated with f contamination in the collected groundwater samples has been evaluated since the health risks associated with dermal exposure is significantly low thus oral route pathway was considered in this study wu et al 2019a mohanta et al 2021 anim gyampoa et al 2019 in most of the literature f is the key groundwater contaminant and international agency for research on cancer iarc categorized this chemical as a non carcinogenic pollutant in this study the probable health risk of f through oral route has been evaluated as described by usepa usepa 1989 mohanta et al 2019 the chronic daily intake of f per unit weight mg kg day 1 through oral exposure pathway can be computed by eq 1 wu et al 2019a mohanta et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 1 i n t a k e o r a l c i r e f e d b w a t where c denotes the concentration of f in groundwater mgl 1 ir represents the drinking water intake rate 0 7 lday 1 for children and 1 5 lday 1 for adult ef signifies exposure frequency and has taken as 365 days per year zhang et al 2018 typical values of average body weight bw are 15 kg for a child 60 kg for adults ed is the exposure duration 6 years for children and 30 years for adults at signifies the average exposure time and it is 2190 and 10 950 for children and adults respectively the non carcinogenic hazard quotient hq through oral exposure can be estimated by eq 2 2 h q j i n t a k e o r a l r f d o r a l where j is the groundwater quality indicator rfd oral represents the non carcinogenic reference dose through oral exposure as per usepa 2019 the rfd oral reference dose for f is 0 04 mg kg day 1 the health risk can be permissible when the hq value is less than 1 while the risk is unacceptable when the hq value greater than 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical analysis and spatial distribution of f in the study area the f concentration of angul district was varied from mdl to 3 4 mgl 1 minimum detectable limit the distribution of f in angul district is shown in fig 2 a b almost 47 samples 51 numbers are categorized under the quality group a 1 mgl 1 f whereas 12 of the total collected samples the concentration of f remains less than 0 5 mgl 1 i e deficient as per the who guide line and thus required fluoridation overall 28 of samples 31 numbers are contaminated with f concentration more than 1 5 mgl 1 i e beyond the permissible limit recommended by who 2011 as well as buero of indian standards bis 2012 and thus are falling under unacceptably categories similarly 39 62 samples 43 number are categorized under group b 2 mgl 1 from fig 2 b it is clearly observed that in 3 number of samples the concentration of f exceeding 3 mgl 1 the calculated median f value of angul district is 1 19 mgl 1 as shown in fig 3 which indicating that the overall level of risk is not very high 56 of the groundwater samples are meets the requirements of the who drinking water standards 0 5 1 5 mgl 1 in general the concentration of gcs changes with the spatial variation in the ph and redox conditions which primarily govern the degrees of solubilisation as well as mobilization of different gcs in the groundwater bundschuh et al 2004 2017 bhattacharya et al 2006 farooqi et al 2007 in this study the concentration of alkalinity varied from 40 to 640 mgl 1 in literature almost similar mean alkalinity profiles have been reported by other researchers mariño et al 2020 quino lima et al 2020b generally the ph of the alluvial groundwater governs by the h2co3 and hco3 buffer system where h2co3 represents the summation of co2 and carbonic acid the minimum and maximum ph value of the study area varied from 4 6 to 7 9 respectively this clearly revealed that the some of the zones of the study area are falling under the alkaline range with moderate concentrations of co3 2 fig 4 demonstrates the spatial distribution of alkalinity of angul district in the study area concentration of bicarbonate found to be the most predominant alkali species in general f bearing well waters are mild alkaline in nature and contain about 95 of co2 in the form of bicarbonate alkalinity with a low level of calcium hardness along with large amount of silica hem 1998 raza et al 2016 generally groundwater with high ph dislocates f ions from the surface of the mineral in the present study similar phenomenon has been observed that out of the 14 highest f contaminated samples 2 1 3 4 mgl 1 the ph of the 11 number of samples are greater than 7 in the study area the concentration f is positively correlated with concentration of hco3 bicarbonate with a correlation coefficient of 0 149 as shown in fig 5 similar positive correlations between hco3 with f and ph with co2 have been reported in literature singaraja et al 2018 su et al 2013 investigated the correlation between various ions and concentration of f in groundwater of northern china they reported a positive correlation of f with hco3 and other ions similar existence of positive correlation between f and other ions in groundwater of northern argentina has been reported in literature warren et al 2005 the with f and hco3 profile of the study area have been analyzed using gis software the spatial distribution profile of bicarbonate is well correlated with that of the spatial distribution of f as shown in fig 6 from the figure it is observed that the south west region of kishorenagar and athamallik block of angul district are highly polluted with f in the range of 2 3 4 mgl 1 and thus very harmful for human consumption therefore defluoridation is highly recommended in this region of the study area further more than 13 of the collected samples are contaminated with f in the range of 2 3 4 mgl 1 similar concentration of f has been reported literature in the range of 0 8 5 9 mgl 1 jacks et al 2005 shah et al 2021 meenakshi et al 2004 investigated the distribution of f in groundwater of jind district haryana they reported the f concentration varied in the range of 0 3 6 9 mgl 1 and more than 80 of water samples are under the unacceptable categories similarly das et al 2003 reported f concentration in groundwater of guwahati assam which varied from 0 35 to 6 88 mgl 1 in addition the higher f concentration in the study area is well supported with many reports in literature that the drinking water of 27 districts of odisha are contaminated with f consequently causes several acute health disorders nanda et al 2011 cgwb 2010 the higher f concentration in angul district may be attributed to the widespread application of synthetic phosphate fertilizer coupled with pesticides further rapid industrialization such as iron and steel plant aluminum smelter fertilizer plant thermal power plant and coal mining might have increased the f concentration in the study area however this aspect requires further investigation this phenomenon is well supported by many reports in literature that aluminium smelter metal extraction and coal mining fly ash pesticide herbicides and fertilizer industries are responsible for the contamination of f in groundwater qasemi et al 2019 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in another study luo et al 2018 reported that the concentration f in solid waste and wastewater discharges from aluminium and steel industries can rise up to 7 52 and 4 47 mgl 1 respectively it has been also reported that due to the industrial pollution along with increase in concentration of f in groundwater of angul district enhances the rates of cancer tuberculosis and other different diseases in this region moharana et al 2013 thus the groundwater needed pre treatment before being supplied for drinking purpose similar high levels of f in groundwater have been reported in many literature in different part of the world such as africa bhattacharya et al 2016 argentina bhattacharya et al 2006 alcaine et al 2020 india bhattacharya and chakrabarti 2011 chakrabarti and bhattacharya 2013 in angul district the maximum f concentration exposed to different population are analogous to other fluorosis affected regions of the world for instance pambar basin of tamil nadu kalpana and elango 2013 nalgonda of andhra pradesh india brindha et al 2011 vaniyar basin of tamil nadu jagadeshan et al 2015 bushehr province of southern iran battaleb looie et al 2013 the f concentration in some samples are deficient than the who guide line which may be due to presence of clay and calcium hardness which usually precipitates f ions as calcium fluoride however this aspects requires further investigation 3 2 geochemical mechanism of f mobilization angul district largely occupied by sedimentary and metamorphic rocks containing f bearing mineral as demonstrated in fig 7 similar observations have been reported in many literatures the occurrence of excessive concentration of f has been reported in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks such as fluorite caf2 biotite k3alsi3o10 f oh 2 chiolite na5al3f14 sellaite mgf2 cryolite na3alf6 fluoroapatite ca5 po4 3f mica ab2 3 x si 4o10 o f oh 2 clays and phosphorite which are commonly leaches out by different geochemical process chae et al 2007 adimalla and quina et al 2020 jia et al 2019 berger et al 2016 in another study luo et al 2018 reported the occurrence of micas and amphibole with a f content of 220 1300 mgkg 1 in quaternary sediments while biotite in metamorphic rock as the major f bearing mineral they also observed clay and silt sediments possess high f contents of 1118 and 1106 mgkg 1 respectively the mobilization of f and associated geochemical process in groundwater is still not clearly understood adimalla and qiana 2020 the ph is one of the most important factors controlling the mobility of f in groundwater in the present study a slight positive correlation between f and hco3 r 0 149 is observed as depicted in fig 5 which signify that the groundwater samples contaminated with f may be due to the exchange f adsorbed on clay biotite and muscovite minerals in the study area as shown in eqs 3 8 marghade et al 2020 the mechanisms of f mobility caused by change in ph can be explained as follows 1 higher ph oh can influences the ionic charge of f and thus f ions easily releases from ores and this process is further magnifies due to the similar radii and charges of oh and f ions consequently accelerate the dissolution of f bearing minerals jia et al 2019 mohanta et al 2020 2 the presence of oh ions in water promotes precipitation of ca2 al3 and fe3 as a result prevent formation of complex of f with these cations which lead to enhance the concentration of f in groundwater as shown in eqs 3 6 the higher bicarbonate hco3 and oh concentrations in water sample facilitate the dissolution of metamorphic and sedimentary f containing minerals of angul district beside dissolution it also increases the weathering of minerals ion exchange reactions and control the overall concentration of f in groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 ali et al 2018 adimalla et al 2018 jia et al 2019 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 adeyeye et al 2021 wu et al 2018 therefore the interaction between ph and f playing a major rule in governing the f concentration in sediment containing biotite muscovite and fluorite in groundwater luo et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 the various chemical reactions associated with desorption of f from f bearing minerals are shown below chatterjee et al 2017 adimallaa and qiana 2020 adeyeye et al 2021 3 m u s o v i t e k a l 2 a l s i 3 o 10 f 2 2 o h k a l 2 a l s i o 10 3 o h 2 2 f weathering 4 f l u o r a p a t i t e c a 5 p o 4 3

reveals that some of the zones of the study area are falling under the alkaline range with moderate concentrations of co3 2 thus in this study most of the highest f containing samples are composed of higher hco3 concentration in the range of 140 566 mgl 1 the precipitation of calcite is shown in eq 8 which reduces the activity of calcium ions forming insoluble caco3 and thus increases concentration of f in groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 adimallaa and qiana 2020 evaporation process in semi arid regions like angul may be responsible for f enhancement in groundwater luo et al 2018 thus rock water interaction weathering process and evaporation are usually the key parameters that extremely increase the concentration of f in groundwater of the study area 3 3 health risk assessment the non carcinogenic hq values of f for adults varied from 0 00 to 2 12 with a mean of 0 755 while it varied from 0 00 to 3 96 with a mean of 1 41 for children overall the results reveals that almost 28 3 samples for adult and 58 49 samples for children exceeded the usepa recommended acceptable limit of non carcinogenic health risks hq 1 this study indicates that children s encounter greater potential non carcinogenic health risk than adult similar finding has been reported by several researchers chen et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2020 bodrud doza et al 2020 li et al 2019c fig 6 demonstrates the spatial distribution of f associated to human health risks in the study area higher non carcinogenic health risk is observed in the south west region of kishorenagar and athamallik block of angul district and thus very harmful for human consumption on the other hand the northern chendipada kaniha pallahada and eastern parts banarpal of the study area witness moderately lower health risks fig 6 based on the statistical analysis of water quality parameters some groundwater samples classified under acceptable quality for drinking purpose are also falling under non carcinogenic health risk category for both adults and children similar health risk assessment of groundwater quality has been reported by many researchers for example toolabi et al 2021 studied the health risk assessment of f nitrate and arsenic in bam groundwater resource iran they reported the hq values of f for children are above one whereas in case of adult it remains below one further the health risk due to dermal route is smaller than oral route some of these literature reported values are less than the corresponding values achieved in the present study indicating the pollution level of the groundwater is very high adimalla and qiana 2020 investigated the health risks assessment of f contaminated groundwater of telangana india the researchers reported almost similar non carcinogenic health risk caused by f with a hq values ranges from 0 77 to 2 63 and 1 04 to 3 55 for adult and children respectively in warangal region while in nalgonda region the condition is very critical likewise zhang et al 2007 evaluated the health risk of f in the songnen plain northeast china and reported a high morbidity rate of 39 47 together with skeletal and dental fluorosis similar finding has been reported by bhattacharya et al 2020 that the health risks caused by f polluted water through oral exposure are acceptable to adults whereas not tolerable and harmful to children ahada and suthar 2017 studied health risk assessment of f in groundwater of southern districts of punjab india and reported a 2 34 times greater hq value for children than adult in spite of the ambiguity in the health risk assessment the results obtained in this study are highly significant and valuable in taking scientific decision on groundwater quality thus it is very essential to minimize the non carcinogenic health risks associated with the safety of children a comparative study on distribution of f and associated water quality parameters together with its level of toxicity is shown in table 1 from the table it can be seen that the concentration of f varied from 0 to 18 mgl 1 in most of the studies the f concentration in groundwater samples primarily governed by weathering water rock interaction ion exchange mechanisms and few cases due to anthropogenic activities most of the studies indicate the existence of significant positive correlation between f and ph as well as f and hco 3 the elevated ph and hco3 profile play a major role in controlling the groundwater f level high ph and hco3 profiles driver the weathering and dissolution of f bearing rocks and minerals consequently enhance its groundwater level gomez et al 2020 kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 marino et al 2020 laxman et al 2019 however in this study the concentration of f mean value 1 2 mgl 1 is less than many reports in literature as shown in table 1 this might be due to the lower ph with a mean value of 6 9 and hco3 with a mean value of 233 mgl 1 profiles in the study area compared to other reported literature similar low concentration of f mean value 0 81 mgl 1 has been reported in literature at a lower mean ph and hco 3 values of 6 98 and 292 mgl 1 respectively as shown in table 1 wu et al 2019b from table 1 it is also observed that some of the literature reported non carcinogenic health risk is higher than the present study this is attributed to the presence of high concentration of f and or other associated groundwater contaminants such as no3 for example mohanta et al 2020 reported the hi hazard index value due to f is 13 and 14 3 times greater than the critical limit while in this study it is 2 12 and 3 96 times for adults and children respectively reddy and sunitha 2020 reported higher thi total hazardous index quotients of 98 and 88 for adults and children respectively similarly the values of non carcinogenic health risk hq reported in many literatures is found superior to that of the present study zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 this phenomenon is ascribed to the elevated ph and hco 3 alkalinity profiles in these reported study area with compared to the present study and thus enhances the dissolution of f bearing rock and minerals 4 conclusion about 12 of the total collected groundwater samples contained less than 0 5 mgl 1 of f and deficient than the who guide line thus fluoridation is highly essential in 28 of the total samples the concentration of f exceeded the permissible limit recommended by who as well as bis however the calculated median concentration of f is 1 19 mgl 1 indicating that the overall level of risk is not very high the spatial distribution of f reveals that the south west region of kishorenagar and athamallik block of angul district have the highest concentration of f in the range of 2 3 4 mgl 1 thus highly harmful for human consumption and defluoridation is highly recommended the ph and hco3 alkalinity are primarily controlling the f level in the study area most of the f belts may be due to dissolutions of metamorphic and sedimentary f containing minerals in addition intensive uses of phosphate fertilizer pesticides and industrial activities may be contributing as the other sources of f in the groundwater almost 28 30 and 58 49 of groundwater samples are exhibited non carcinogenic health risk due to f contamination for adult and children respectively the non carcinogenic health risk of f to children is higher than adult thus it is highly essential take actions for the reduction of f level in drinking water besides industrial wastes required to be treated before being discharged into the receiving environment in addition frequent monitoring of groundwater quality should be carried out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11888,presence of fluoride f in drinking water both at low and high levels causes serious human health hazard in this investigation 106 number of groundwater samples of angul district odisha india were collected and analyzed using statistical hydrogeochemical spatial distribution and health risk assessment methods about 28 of the collected groundwater samples the concentration of f exceeded the permissible limit set by who as well as buero of indian standards bis apart from this 13 of the collected samples the concentration of f varied from 2 to 3 4 mgl 1 and thus highly harmful for human consumption the human health risk assessment was carried out as recommended by the usepa in the study area the calculated hazard quotient hq caused by f contamination varied from 0 0 to 2 12 and 0 0 to 3 92 for adults and children respectively almost 28 30 and 58 49 groundwater samples are exhibited non carcinogenic health risk due to f contamination for adult and children respectively the non carcinogenic health risk posed by f to children is higher than adult further f exhibited a positive correlation with bicarbonate hco3 alkalinity the concentration of f increases with ph which indicating that higher ph augments the dissolutions of f ions from metamorphic and sedimentary f containing minerals of the study area in addition intensive uses of phosphate fertilizer pesticides and industrial activities may be contributing as the other sources of f in the groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords angul groundwater fluoride bicarbonate hydrogeochemical spatial distribution correlation health risk assessment 1 introduction groundwater is a potential source of drinking water for consumption of human beings all over the globe however extensive pollution of groundwater causes major damage to its quality contamination of fluoride f in groundwater and aquifers is a serious concern throughout the world including india ali et al 2018 2019 yadav et al 2020 kimambo et al 2019 aullon alcaine et al 2020 patel et al 2017 mariño et al 2020 in general f occurs naturally in wide varieties of minerals such as topaz cryolite amphiboles apatite villiamite fluorospar mica rock phosphate and sellaite ali et al 2019 ijumulana et al 2020 mohanta et al 2020 the increase in concentration of f in groundwater may be due to the leaching of these minerals further various anthropogenic activities also play a vital role in elevation of f in groundwater system guissouma et al 2017 kimambo et al 2019 the concentration of f in groundwater increases due to the industrial application of these minerals for instance cryolite is used to produce pesticides and extraction of aluminium similarly rock phosphate is uses for the manufacture of fertilizer particularly triple super phosphate and pesticides qasemi et al 2019 industrial production of glass steel and copper also liberates f to the receiving environment and consequently percolates deep into the groundwater panaskar et al 2017 very often industrial accident and leakage increases the environmental loading rate of f for instance recently industrial leakage of hydrofluoric gas in the republic of south korea drastically increased the f concentration in the receiving environment vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in addition f is also forms in the municipal water due to application of sodium hexafluorosilicate fluorosilicic acid and sodium fluoride in the fluoridation schemes in general f is known to be an essential oligo element which facilitates the proper growth and development of bone and teeth boulétreau et al 2006 fluoride displaces the hydroxide ions from hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh of bones and teeth as a result produces more harder and tougher fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f consequently strengthening the enamel of teeth when administered at its low concentration kimambo et al 2019 as shown in eq 1 ca 5 po 4 3 oh f ca 5 po 4 3 f oh 1 however elevated concentrations of f 1 5 mgl 1 displace calcium from bone and teeth thus at high concentration of f causes dental and skeletal fluorosis kimambo et al 2019 as depicted in eq 2 ca 5 po 4 3 f 9f ca 5 f 10 3po 4 3 2 on the other hand when the concentration of f in drinking water is less than 0 5 mgl 1 it causes dental carries chronic exposure of f causes several serious abnormalities such as bending of the bones crippling bone deformities gastrointestinal manifestations minimizes intelligence quotient lower cognitive ability and developmental issues in children vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 jacks 2005 kimambo et al 2019 in addition elevated concentration of f in drinking water influences human thyroid hormones adversely affect the liver kidneys along with nervous and reproductive systems raza et al 2016 alcaine et al 2020 almost 200 millions of people from more than 25 nations in the world are suffering from serious dental and skeletal fluorosis faraji et al 2014 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 the elevated levels of f in groundwater of different countries across the world like india china parts of africa argentina have been reported in literature vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 alcaine et al 2020 sun et al 2013 fluorosis is an endemic disease in 14 states and 150 000 villages in india together with 6 million children are reported to be suffering from fluorosis susheela 1999 jacks et al 2005 further the concentration of f in the rural parts of the india is 1 85 times greater than urban areas ali et al 2019 it has been reported that the pooled f concentration in indian is about 2 37 mgl 1 which is far greater than the who world health organization recommended value of 1 5 mgl 1 ali et al 2019 who 2011 among the most f affected states of eastern india west bengal assam and odisha are highly vulnerable therefore the who sets a minimum concentration limit of f in drinking water is 0 5 mgl 1 guissouma et al 2017 based on the warmer and cooler climatic conditions who recommended two different maximum concentration of f as 1 and 1 5 mgl 1 respectively who 2011 kimambo et al 2019 similarly the bureau of indian standards bis recommended 1 mgl 1 of f as the maximum permissible limit in drinking water bis report 2009 the angul is a semi arid region primarily a well known industrialized and mining area of the country particularly the district head quarter and talcher zone on the other hand rest part of the district is belonging to rural area and most of the population are working as subsistence farmer and economically poor the mainstream of this population depends on dug open wells or boreholes water for domestic application it is very essential to understand how different types of trace elements are distributed in the groundwater their spatial patterns and the trends of dispersing or clustering effect in the aqueous system lee and li 2017 quino lima et al 2020a among the major 17 sustainable development goals sdgs set by the united nations in september 2015 supply of geogenic contaminants gcs free safe food water are within the framework of the sdgs in addition protection lives both in aquatic systems and on land are also very vital to achieve sustainable development bundschuh et al 2017 therefore characterization of groundwater quality and its continuous monitoring is very much crucial to prevent its contamination which favors to achieve sustainable groundwater resource management application of geographic information system gis along with arcgis software is one of the most promising techniques for investigation of spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater quality parameters abokifa et al 2016 gholizadeh et al 2017 hajizadeh et al 2017 in recent years health risk assessment of groundwater quality has gained more attention and carried out by many researchers across the globe mohanta et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019a bhattacharya et al 2020 bodrud doza 2020 it assists to find out the potential health risks caused by various pollutants present in groundwater and provide suitable guidance to reduce the health risks for instance su et al 2018 investigated health risk posed by no3 no2 nh4 nevertheless the researchers ignored the occurrence of other pollutants in the groundwater in this study the groundwater profile of angul district has been presented the hydrochemical data s the spatial distribution of f and alkalinity have been analyzed and interpreted outlined the drinking water quality ranks and delineate f source and mobilization mechanism furthermore the potential of non carcinogenic health risk caused by f exposure through oral pathway has been evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area angul lies between 20 31 n 21 40 n latitude 84 15 e 85 23 e longitude the total geographical area of angul district is 6232 sq kms angul is situated at an average height of 139 m above mean sea level msl as per 2011 census reports the population density of angul district is 199 persons per sq km the average annual rainfall of the district is 1421 mm the angul district comprises diverse groups of geological sequence contain super group of iron rocks of eastern ghats gondwana super group laterites to alluvial deposits the gondwana rocks are present in kaniha talcher chendipada kishorenagar blocks of central angul the gondwana group of rocks extends northwards from this fault up to rivers tikra and brahmani where it is separated again from the archean group of rocks by another fault the major rocks present in the gondwana group are belonging to conglomerates colored laminated shales and sand stone of highly ferruginous nature this group of rocks is comprises sand stone and shales the main rock types found in archean group are quartzite which is occasionally micacious horneblendebiotite micaschist granite and gneisses on the other hand the remaining part from west of murhi and north of angul up to the western end of angul contain sedimentary rocks of gondawana group with huge deposits of coal mostly in talcher zone the widespread mahanadi coal field and talcher coal fields limited are situated in this area commonly the slope of the zone is from west to east and from north to south the talcher region of angul district is a well known industrial zone of orissa the presence of talcher coalfields and the river brahmani are the major reasons for the growth of several industries in this area for instance thermal power ntpc heavy water plant aluminum plant nalco fertilizer plant fci jindal steel plant and bhusana steel plant etc the presence of these industries causes serious environmental pollution in this area therefore the central pollution control board delhi identified this industrial belt as one of the 24 problem areas in the country in the study area shallow and deep wells groundwater are the primary source of portable water however uncontrolled groundwater uses together with leaching of agricultural and industrial waste are the major concern in the study area thus regular monitoring of water quality and its assessment is highly essential which is not yet explored in this region so far 2 2 groundwater sampling the grid map of the study area was prepared at 6 6 km sampling interval as shown in fig 1 a total 106 number of groundwater samples from different locations including urban rural and industrial area were collected systematically as per the grid map during the month between march to june the sample were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles previously soaked in 15 v v hno3 for one day followed by rinsed with double distilled water and kept in a fridge at 4 c for subsequent uses prior to sampling the tube wells were pumped for several minutes to eliminate any stagnant water 2 3 analysis of groundwater samples the ph of the collected groundwater samples were measured on site using a using a hq440d laboratory dual input multi parameter electrode system hach co usa the geographic position of each sampling was recorded using a hand held global positioning system etrex 20 gramin concentration of f was analyzed by fluoride ion selective electrode coupled to ion analyzer 9609bnwp thermofsischer scientific usa alkalinity of the collected samples was estimated by titration method as described in apha 2005 2 4 human health risk assessment the contamination of groundwater poses severs negative effect on human health thus it is very crucial to evaluate the human health risk posed by different groundwater contaminants health risk assessment deals with the rate of pollutant loads to human beings and evaluates its probable health hazards mohanta et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019 bhattacharya et al 2020 bodrud doza 2020 in the present study the health risk associated with f contamination in the collected groundwater samples has been evaluated since the health risks associated with dermal exposure is significantly low thus oral route pathway was considered in this study wu et al 2019a mohanta et al 2021 anim gyampoa et al 2019 in most of the literature f is the key groundwater contaminant and international agency for research on cancer iarc categorized this chemical as a non carcinogenic pollutant in this study the probable health risk of f through oral route has been evaluated as described by usepa usepa 1989 mohanta et al 2019 the chronic daily intake of f per unit weight mg kg day 1 through oral exposure pathway can be computed by eq 1 wu et al 2019a mohanta et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 1 i n t a k e o r a l c i r e f e d b w a t where c denotes the concentration of f in groundwater mgl 1 ir represents the drinking water intake rate 0 7 lday 1 for children and 1 5 lday 1 for adult ef signifies exposure frequency and has taken as 365 days per year zhang et al 2018 typical values of average body weight bw are 15 kg for a child 60 kg for adults ed is the exposure duration 6 years for children and 30 years for adults at signifies the average exposure time and it is 2190 and 10 950 for children and adults respectively the non carcinogenic hazard quotient hq through oral exposure can be estimated by eq 2 2 h q j i n t a k e o r a l r f d o r a l where j is the groundwater quality indicator rfd oral represents the non carcinogenic reference dose through oral exposure as per usepa 2019 the rfd oral reference dose for f is 0 04 mg kg day 1 the health risk can be permissible when the hq value is less than 1 while the risk is unacceptable when the hq value greater than 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical analysis and spatial distribution of f in the study area the f concentration of angul district was varied from mdl to 3 4 mgl 1 minimum detectable limit the distribution of f in angul district is shown in fig 2 a b almost 47 samples 51 numbers are categorized under the quality group a 1 mgl 1 f whereas 12 of the total collected samples the concentration of f remains less than 0 5 mgl 1 i e deficient as per the who guide line and thus required fluoridation overall 28 of samples 31 numbers are contaminated with f concentration more than 1 5 mgl 1 i e beyond the permissible limit recommended by who 2011 as well as buero of indian standards bis 2012 and thus are falling under unacceptably categories similarly 39 62 samples 43 number are categorized under group b 2 mgl 1 from fig 2 b it is clearly observed that in 3 number of samples the concentration of f exceeding 3 mgl 1 the calculated median f value of angul district is 1 19 mgl 1 as shown in fig 3 which indicating that the overall level of risk is not very high 56 of the groundwater samples are meets the requirements of the who drinking water standards 0 5 1 5 mgl 1 in general the concentration of gcs changes with the spatial variation in the ph and redox conditions which primarily govern the degrees of solubilisation as well as mobilization of different gcs in the groundwater bundschuh et al 2004 2017 bhattacharya et al 2006 farooqi et al 2007 in this study the concentration of alkalinity varied from 40 to 640 mgl 1 in literature almost similar mean alkalinity profiles have been reported by other researchers mariño et al 2020 quino lima et al 2020b generally the ph of the alluvial groundwater governs by the h2co3 and hco3 buffer system where h2co3 represents the summation of co2 and carbonic acid the minimum and maximum ph value of the study area varied from 4 6 to 7 9 respectively this clearly revealed that the some of the zones of the study area are falling under the alkaline range with moderate concentrations of co3 2 fig 4 demonstrates the spatial distribution of alkalinity of angul district in the study area concentration of bicarbonate found to be the most predominant alkali species in general f bearing well waters are mild alkaline in nature and contain about 95 of co2 in the form of bicarbonate alkalinity with a low level of calcium hardness along with large amount of silica hem 1998 raza et al 2016 generally groundwater with high ph dislocates f ions from the surface of the mineral in the present study similar phenomenon has been observed that out of the 14 highest f contaminated samples 2 1 3 4 mgl 1 the ph of the 11 number of samples are greater than 7 in the study area the concentration f is positively correlated with concentration of hco3 bicarbonate with a correlation coefficient of 0 149 as shown in fig 5 similar positive correlations between hco3 with f and ph with co2 have been reported in literature singaraja et al 2018 su et al 2013 investigated the correlation between various ions and concentration of f in groundwater of northern china they reported a positive correlation of f with hco3 and other ions similar existence of positive correlation between f and other ions in groundwater of northern argentina has been reported in literature warren et al 2005 the with f and hco3 profile of the study area have been analyzed using gis software the spatial distribution profile of bicarbonate is well correlated with that of the spatial distribution of f as shown in fig 6 from the figure it is observed that the south west region of kishorenagar and athamallik block of angul district are highly polluted with f in the range of 2 3 4 mgl 1 and thus very harmful for human consumption therefore defluoridation is highly recommended in this region of the study area further more than 13 of the collected samples are contaminated with f in the range of 2 3 4 mgl 1 similar concentration of f has been reported literature in the range of 0 8 5 9 mgl 1 jacks et al 2005 shah et al 2021 meenakshi et al 2004 investigated the distribution of f in groundwater of jind district haryana they reported the f concentration varied in the range of 0 3 6 9 mgl 1 and more than 80 of water samples are under the unacceptable categories similarly das et al 2003 reported f concentration in groundwater of guwahati assam which varied from 0 35 to 6 88 mgl 1 in addition the higher f concentration in the study area is well supported with many reports in literature that the drinking water of 27 districts of odisha are contaminated with f consequently causes several acute health disorders nanda et al 2011 cgwb 2010 the higher f concentration in angul district may be attributed to the widespread application of synthetic phosphate fertilizer coupled with pesticides further rapid industrialization such as iron and steel plant aluminum smelter fertilizer plant thermal power plant and coal mining might have increased the f concentration in the study area however this aspect requires further investigation this phenomenon is well supported by many reports in literature that aluminium smelter metal extraction and coal mining fly ash pesticide herbicides and fertilizer industries are responsible for the contamination of f in groundwater qasemi et al 2019 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in another study luo et al 2018 reported that the concentration f in solid waste and wastewater discharges from aluminium and steel industries can rise up to 7 52 and 4 47 mgl 1 respectively it has been also reported that due to the industrial pollution along with increase in concentration of f in groundwater of angul district enhances the rates of cancer tuberculosis and other different diseases in this region moharana et al 2013 thus the groundwater needed pre treatment before being supplied for drinking purpose similar high levels of f in groundwater have been reported in many literature in different part of the world such as africa bhattacharya et al 2016 argentina bhattacharya et al 2006 alcaine et al 2020 india bhattacharya and chakrabarti 2011 chakrabarti and bhattacharya 2013 in angul district the maximum f concentration exposed to different population are analogous to other fluorosis affected regions of the world for instance pambar basin of tamil nadu kalpana and elango 2013 nalgonda of andhra pradesh india brindha et al 2011 vaniyar basin of tamil nadu jagadeshan et al 2015 bushehr province of southern iran battaleb looie et al 2013 the f concentration in some samples are deficient than the who guide line which may be due to presence of clay and calcium hardness which usually precipitates f ions as calcium fluoride however this aspects requires further investigation 3 2 geochemical mechanism of f mobilization angul district largely occupied by sedimentary and metamorphic rocks containing f bearing mineral as demonstrated in fig 7 similar observations have been reported in many literatures the occurrence of excessive concentration of f has been reported in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks such as fluorite caf2 biotite k3alsi3o10 f oh 2 chiolite na5al3f14 sellaite mgf2 cryolite na3alf6 fluoroapatite ca5 po4 3f mica ab2 3 x si 4o10 o f oh 2 clays and phosphorite which are commonly leaches out by different geochemical process chae et al 2007 adimalla and quina et al 2020 jia et al 2019 berger et al 2016 in another study luo et al 2018 reported the occurrence of micas and amphibole with a f content of 220 1300 mgkg 1 in quaternary sediments while biotite in metamorphic rock as the major f bearing mineral they also observed clay and silt sediments possess high f contents of 1118 and 1106 mgkg 1 respectively the mobilization of f and associated geochemical process in groundwater is still not clearly understood adimalla and qiana 2020 the ph is one of the most important factors controlling the mobility of f in groundwater in the present study a slight positive correlation between f and hco3 r 0 149 is observed as depicted in fig 5 which signify that the groundwater samples contaminated with f may be due to the exchange f adsorbed on clay biotite and muscovite minerals in the study area as shown in eqs 3 8 marghade et al 2020 the mechanisms of f mobility caused by change in ph can be explained as follows 1 higher ph oh can influences the ionic charge of f and thus f ions easily releases from ores and this process is further magnifies due to the similar radii and charges of oh and f ions consequently accelerate the dissolution of f bearing minerals jia et al 2019 mohanta et al 2020 2 the presence of oh ions in water promotes precipitation of ca2 al3 and fe3 as a result prevent formation of complex of f with these cations which lead to enhance the concentration of f in groundwater as shown in eqs 3 6 the higher bicarbonate hco3 and oh concentrations in water sample facilitate the dissolution of metamorphic and sedimentary f containing minerals of angul district beside dissolution it also increases the weathering of minerals ion exchange reactions and control the overall concentration of f in groundwater vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 ali et al 2018 adimalla et al 2018 jia et al 2019 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 adeyeye et al 2021 wu et al 2018 therefore the interaction between ph and f playing a major rule in governing the f concentration in sediment containing biotite muscovite and fluorite in groundwater luo et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 the various chemical reactions associated with desorption of f from f bearing minerals are shown below chatterjee et al 2017 adimallaa and qiana 2020 adeyeye et al 2021 3 m u s o v i t e k a l 2 a l s i 3 o 10 f 2 2 o h k a l 2 a l s i o 10 3 o h 2 2 f weathering 4 f l u o r a p a t i t e c a 5 p o 4 3

reveals that some of the zones of the study area are falling under the alkaline range with moderate concentrations of co3 2 thus in this study most of the highest f containing samples are composed of higher hco3 concentration in the range of 140 566 mgl 1 the precipitation of calcite is shown in eq 8 which reduces the activity of calcium ions forming insoluble caco3 and thus increases concentration of f in groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 adimallaa and qiana 2020 evaporation process in semi arid regions like angul may be responsible for f enhancement in groundwater luo et al 2018 thus rock water interaction weathering process and evaporation are usually the key parameters that extremely increase the concentration of f in groundwater of the study area 3 3 health risk assessment the non carcinogenic hq values of f for adults varied from 0 00 to 2 12 with a mean of 0 755 while it varied from 0 00 to 3 96 with a mean of 1 41 for children overall the results reveals that almost 28 3 samples for adult and 58 49 samples for children exceeded the usepa recommended acceptable limit of non carcinogenic health risks hq 1 this study indicates that children s encounter greater potential non carcinogenic health risk than adult similar finding has been reported by several researchers chen et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2020 bodrud doza et al 2020 li et al 2019c fig 6 demonstrates the spatial distribution of f associated to human health risks in the study area higher non carcinogenic health risk is observed in the south west region of kishorenagar and athamallik block of angul district and thus very harmful for human consumption on the other hand the northern chendipada kaniha pallahada and eastern parts banarpal of the study area witness moderately lower health risks fig 6 based on the statistical analysis of water quality parameters some groundwater samples classified under acceptable quality for drinking purpose are also falling under non carcinogenic health risk category for both adults and children similar health risk assessment of groundwater quality has been reported by many researchers for example toolabi et al 2021 studied the health risk assessment of f nitrate and arsenic in bam groundwater resource iran they reported the hq values of f for children are above one whereas in case of adult it remains below one further the health risk due to dermal route is smaller than oral route some of these literature reported values are less than the corresponding values achieved in the present study indicating the pollution level of the groundwater is very high adimalla and qiana 2020 investigated the health risks assessment of f contaminated groundwater of telangana india the researchers reported almost similar non carcinogenic health risk caused by f with a hq values ranges from 0 77 to 2 63 and 1 04 to 3 55 for adult and children respectively in warangal region while in nalgonda region the condition is very critical likewise zhang et al 2007 evaluated the health risk of f in the songnen plain northeast china and reported a high morbidity rate of 39 47 together with skeletal and dental fluorosis similar finding has been reported by bhattacharya et al 2020 that the health risks caused by f polluted water through oral exposure are acceptable to adults whereas not tolerable and harmful to children ahada and suthar 2017 studied health risk assessment of f in groundwater of southern districts of punjab india and reported a 2 34 times greater hq value for children than adult in spite of the ambiguity in the health risk assessment the results obtained in this study are highly significant and valuable in taking scientific decision on groundwater quality thus it is very essential to minimize the non carcinogenic health risks associated with the safety of children a comparative study on distribution of f and associated water quality parameters together with its level of toxicity is shown in table 1 from the table it can be seen that the concentration of f varied from 0 to 18 mgl 1 in most of the studies the f concentration in groundwater samples primarily governed by weathering water rock interaction ion exchange mechanisms and few cases due to anthropogenic activities most of the studies indicate the existence of significant positive correlation between f and ph as well as f and hco 3 the elevated ph and hco3 profile play a major role in controlling the groundwater f level high ph and hco3 profiles driver the weathering and dissolution of f bearing rocks and minerals consequently enhance its groundwater level gomez et al 2020 kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 marino et al 2020 laxman et al 2019 however in this study the concentration of f mean value 1 2 mgl 1 is less than many reports in literature as shown in table 1 this might be due to the lower ph with a mean value of 6 9 and hco3 with a mean value of 233 mgl 1 profiles in the study area compared to other reported literature similar low concentration of f mean value 0 81 mgl 1 has been reported in literature at a lower mean ph and hco 3 values of 6 98 and 292 mgl 1 respectively as shown in table 1 wu et al 2019b from table 1 it is also observed that some of the literature reported non carcinogenic health risk is higher than the present study this is attributed to the presence of high concentration of f and or other associated groundwater contaminants such as no3 for example mohanta et al 2020 reported the hi hazard index value due to f is 13 and 14 3 times greater than the critical limit while in this study it is 2 12 and 3 96 times for adults and children respectively reddy and sunitha 2020 reported higher thi total hazardous index quotients of 98 and 88 for adults and children respectively similarly the values of non carcinogenic health risk hq reported in many literatures is found superior to that of the present study zhang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 this phenomenon is ascribed to the elevated ph and hco 3 alkalinity profiles in these reported study area with compared to the present study and thus enhances the dissolution of f bearing rock and minerals 4 conclusion about 12 of the total collected groundwater samples contained less than 0 5 mgl 1 of f and deficient than the who guide line thus fluoridation is highly essential in 28 of the total samples the concentration of f exceeded the permissible limit recommended by who as well as bis however the calculated median concentration of f is 1 19 mgl 1 indicating that the overall level of risk is not very high the spatial distribution of f reveals that the south west region of kishorenagar and athamallik block of angul district have the highest concentration of f in the range of 2 3 4 mgl 1 thus highly harmful for human consumption and defluoridation is highly recommended the ph and hco3 alkalinity are primarily controlling the f level in the study area most of the f belts may be due to dissolutions of metamorphic and sedimentary f containing minerals in addition intensive uses of phosphate fertilizer pesticides and industrial activities may be contributing as the other sources of f in the groundwater almost 28 30 and 58 49 of groundwater samples are exhibited non carcinogenic health risk due to f contamination for adult and children respectively the non carcinogenic health risk of f to children is higher than adult thus it is highly essential take actions for the reduction of f level in drinking water besides industrial wastes required to be treated before being discharged into the receiving environment in addition frequent monitoring of groundwater quality should be carried out declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

11889,spatial uncertainty caused by large scale variation in fluoride f occurrence remains a setback for water supply authorities in the f belts of the world it is estimated that approximately 80 million people in the east african rift valley earv regions and volcanic areas exhibit a wide variety of fluorosis symptoms due to drinking water with f concentrations higher than 1 5 mg l who guideline limit in this study we combined geostatistical techniques spatial statistical methods and geographical information systems gis to i map the probable places with f 0 5 mg l and f 1 5 4 0 and 10 0 mg l using probability kriging pk method ii estimate the probable total population at high or low f risk levels using univariate local moran s i statistic and iii map the spatial distribution of population at high and low f risk levels in manyara arusha and kilimanjaro regions using gis it was predicted that places along the major and minor earv mountain ranges and around the flanks of major stratovolcanoes were dominated by groundwater sources with extremely low f 0 5 mg l in contrast places within earv graben were dominated by groundwater sources with f 1 5 mg l about 1 million people 20 of the total population living around mt kilimanjaro in rombo moshi and mwanga districts are at high dental caries risk furthermore it was estimated that about 2 million people 41 of the total population in siha hai arusha city hanang arusha simanjiro and meru districts are at high risk of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis fluorosis especially dental and crippling fluorosis is an increasing disease burden at the community level due to prolonged consumption of f contaminated water within earv graben the major findings of the present study are very crucial for authority to

with the severity varying significantly between groups the children being prominently at relatively high risk fluoride contaminated groundwater has been reported in many countries it is estimated that approximately 200 million people distributed in around 28 countries across continents depend on groundwater sources with f exceeding 1 5 mg l fawell et al 2006 kimambo et al 2019 shen and schäfer 2015 the specific countries where the population depends on f contaminated groundwater sources have been summarized in kimambo et al 2019 although there is no confirmed data on the number of people depending on groundwater with a high concentration of f it is estimated that approximately 272 million people 40 of the total population in sub sahara africa depend on groundwater sources of poor quality ali et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 kut et al 2016 one of the well known causes of poor quality in groundwater sources is geogenic f which is prevalent within east african rift valley earv regions and volcanic areas it is estimated that approximately 80 million people there exhibit a wide variety of fluorosis symptoms due to prolonged exposure to f exceeding the recommended maximum permissible value of 1 5 mg l who 2011 for drinking water shen and schäfer 2015 smedley et al 2002 it is further estimated that the population under the greatest levels of disease burden due to skeletal fluorosis live in eritrea tanzania ethiopia kenya and south africa fewtrell et al 2006 in tanzania the disease burden due to dental caries and fluorosis has been reported sporadically in parts of the northern development zone ndz where about 90 of the population are reported to be affected by dental fluorosis at varying severity or stages mabelya 1995 vuhahula et al 2009 yoder et al 1998 due to high spatial variability in f occurrence within these regions ijumulana et al 2020 the actual health risk to the population is uncertain and highly speculative assuming the effects of elevated f concentrations across all age groups in the earv system the objective of this study was to estimate the probable total population under dental caries and fluorosis risk levels in three regions arusha kilimanjaro and manyara due to high spatial variability in f concentrations a combination of geospatial methods was adopted the methods included probability kriging pk which was used to delineate places with f 0 5 mg l f 1 5 4 0 and 10 0 mg l using f concentrations in the national fluoride database nfd the univariate local moran s i statistic and gis were used to decipher communities and total population under high risks in terms of dental caries and fluorosis in the ndz of tanzania 1 1 the study area 1 1 1 climate population distribution and drinking water sources the study was conducted in three regions of ndz fig 1 a namely arusha manyara kilimanjaro and tanga fig 1b according to the national population census of 2012 and projections of 2017 unies 2017 urt 2013 approximately 12 of the population lives in ndz with unequal geographical distribution at the regional level due to several environmental geological and climatic factors it was projected that approximately 30 25 23 and 22 of the population live in tanga arusha kilimanjaro and manyara region respectively as indicated in the quintiles map fig 1c the population density in each region is highly variable with the highest population concentrated around major stratovolcanoes i e mt kilimanjaro mt meru and mt hanang in kilimanjaro arusha and manyara regions respectively the lowest population density is geographically distributed within earv graben which defines the northern tanzania dry belt extending between 3 20 and 6 s and between 36 and 38 e solomon et al 2000 the study area is characterized by considerable spatial and temporal variability climatic conditions which are controlled by topography landforms and the geological setting the windward side of the stratovolcanoes and earv mountain ranges in the western and eastern parts of the studied regions are more humid compared to the places on the leeward side on average terms many places in earv graben are hot and semi arid with annual rainfall ranging between 600 and 800 mm mainly during october december and march may kijazi and reason 2009 like many places in sub saharan africa ssa particularly regions in earv average monthly temperatures range between 20 and 26 c in the studied regions with a dry season of around 4 6 months macdonald et al 2009 new et al 1999 the prolonged droughts and scarcity of surface water in the studied regions promote groundwater as the primary source of water especially for drinking garcía pérez et al 2013 ijumulana et al 2020 macdonald and calow 2009 malago et al 2017 thole 2013 it is estimated that approximately 45 million people in these regions depend on groundwater hosted in young volcanic rocks which account for 4 of the potential hydrogeological environments of ssa adelana and macdonald 2008 ghiglieri et al 2010 macdonald and davies 2000 the geogenic occurrence of elevated f concentrations in groundwater systems has rendered many sources unfit for drinking it is estimated that over one third of the groundwater resources are unfit for drinking purposes causing severe adverse health effects viz fluorosis in ndz chowdhury et al 2019 thole 2013 vuhahula et al 2009 furthermore it has been recently reported that geogenic f contamination is space dependent having significant patterns that are important to decipher for ensuring safe water supply in regions with naturally contaminated groundwater systems ijumulana et al 2020 in the studied regions potential adverse health effects vary in space with possible severe health problems among communities that depend solely on groundwater sources with f levels above 1 5 mg l especially in the earv graben and around the flanks of stratovolcanoes 1 1 2 geomorphological setting and population density distribution the relief of the study area is highly variable with elevation ranging between 400 and 5900 m above mean sea level a m s l as shown in fig 2 a lowlands lie between 450 and 1200 m a m s l where major water bodies are situated the location of the water bodies indicates primary discharge areas within the internal drainage basin idb and pangani drainage basin pdb while the highest elevations lie between 2300 and 5900 m a m s l the highest points 2900 5900 m a m s l in this range constitute the peaks of the major stratovolcanoes including 1 mt kilimanjaro 2 mt meru 3 mt hanang 4 mt oldoinyo lengai an active volcano 5 ngorongoro crater maar 6 mt gelai 7 mt kitumbeine 8 mt monduli and 9 mt kwaraha in terms of groundwater occurrence in these regions the major stratovolcanoes play an important role as they constitute primary recharge areas depending on the nature of the local geological setting the relief with an elevation between 1200 and 2900 m a m s l is dominated by gentle slopes controlling sporadic and clustered settlements as indicated in fig 2b this range includes places along the slopes of the major rift valley mountain ranges in the eastern and western of the study areas and around the flanks of the major stratovolcanoes particularly mt kilimanjaro 1 mt meru 2 mt monduli 8 and mt hanang 3 at this slope between 1200 and 2900 m a m s l the population density ranges between 150 and 16 000 persons per square kilometer on the other hand the population is sparsely distributed in lowlands especially in earv graben with population density ranging between 1 and 150 persons per square kilometer fig 2b 2 materials and methods 2 1 spatial data compilation and preparation spatial data used in this study was compiled from different sources

report water samples from each source were collected following standard operating procedures sop for water sampling who 2017 a 1 liter clean plastic polyethylene bottle was used for water sampling the sampling bottles were rinsed three times with distilled water and the water to be sampled before water sampling determination of f concentrations was carried out immediately at the sampling point following standard analytical methods apha 1989 who 2017 hach 2021 using an f ion selective electrode with hq440d ion meter calibrated using standard f solutions supplied by hach in a typical procedure 25 ml of water sample was mixed with total ionic strength adjustor buffer tisab powder in a beaker and shaken thoroughly to ensure tisab powder was completely dissolved and uniformly mixed with the water sample to be analyzed a detailed description of the data collection methods and analysis techniques can be found in the water quality mapping report of the ministry of water water quality service division 2016 the other spatial data used was f concentrations measured in situ using the same procedure and instrument during fieldwork campaigns of 2016 and 2018 this data was used to validate predicted f concentrations using f data of the ministry of water water quality service division 2016 the last two spatial datasets were collected from the national agencies while major drainage boundaries were obtained from pangani basin water office pbwo the administrative boundaries and population data were acquired from the national bureau of statistics nbs of tanzania the specific spatial dataset description is presented in table 1 spatial data preparation involved the integration of the data using various gis software as spatial data were on different datum the integration process included defining the data on a common spatial reference system srs which was the world geodetic system of 1984 wgs84 through on the fly datum transformation models present in many gis software viz arcgis globalmapper qgis etc the other process was the preparation of a spatial database for the population and integrate it with the f database ijumulana et al 2020 from which summary statistics of f concentrations were estimated at the regional and district level 2 2 statistical analysis of f concentrations high f concentrations and related health problems are sporadically well studied at the regional level in three regions by various researchers malago et al 2017 shorter 2011 vuhahula et al 2009 for this study the statistical distribution analysis of f concentrations was systematically done at regional district and ward levels since groundwater systems are ubiquitous the water supply process is independent of the political administrative boundaries indicated in fig 1a for example the population in some administrative wards depends on groundwater sources located outside the administrative boundary to provide an understanding of f contamination burden predicted concentrations were used to estimate the population at f risk levels 2 3 geostatistical analysis since groundwater sources in the study regions followed the population distribution which is influenced by environmental geological and climatic factors kriging was used to systemize the sampling locations kriging is widely used in the field of structural optimization while dealing with stochastic processes basudhar and missoum 2008 chiles and delfiner 2009 cressie 1990 meng et al 2018 hengl 2009 stein 2012 zhang et al 2020 specifically probability kriging pk was used in this study to predict places with f less than 0 5 mg l and greater than 1 5 mg l which are well known to cause dental caries and fluorosis respectively dissanayake 1991 the basic theory of the kriging model and the concept of pk are introduced briefly in the annex when using pk the values 0 5 and 1 5 mg l were used as cut off points c in equation 12 section 2 3 2 of the annex the predictions were done at a 1 5 by 1 5 km grid the selection of the prediction grid was automatically determined based on the minimum maximum separation distance of the groundwater sources from which samples were collected 2 4 fluoride risk levels estimation at f 0 5 1 5 mg l the presence of different concentrations of f in drinking water affects the population depending on the contaminated source brindha and elango 2011 dissanayake 1991 mohanta and mohanty 2018 bhattacharya et al 2020 mridha et al 2021 for this study we defined f risk level frl as follows based on the risk mapping concepts recently developed by quino lima et al 2020 1 f r l p k n k where p k and n k are the probability of exceedance and total population in the local administrative unit k respectively the former was estimated based on 0 5 and 1 5 mg l thresholds and equation 12 section 2 3 2 of the annex carr and mao 1993 okx et al 1993 sullivan 1984 while the latter was obtained from the census population database urt 2013 by local administrative unit in this study we refer to ward level which is the second and third administrative level in urban and rural settings in tanzania respectively to estimate p k at ward level k z x 0 raster data were converted to vector format thereafter the respective ward boundary was used as a conditioning boundary in the gis environment to estimate the average value using equation 2 2 p k a v 1 n i 1 n p k i where p k a v stands for average probability of exceedance at individual ward k while n stands for total number of prediction grids within the administrative ward boundary since f contamination in the study area is space dependent ijumulana et al 2020 the median values at each ward level were used instead of the mean value for wards with small coverage less than 2 25 km2 the prediction grid in this study the logical assignment of the nearest values was assigned although there were few such cases 2 5 spatial cluster and spatial outlier analysis in frl the global and local moran s i statistics were used to analyze spatial patterns using estimated frl in equation 1 the global moran s i statistics is widely used in environmental sciences to test the hypothesis of completely spatial randomness csr in the observed events on the variable of interest which are continuous and stochastic moran 1950 in principle the results of the test static indicate whether the phenomenon under investigation is clustering randomly distributed or dispersed in space and or in time space indicated by i 0 i 0 or i 0 respectively the method has recently been used to study the nature of f contamination in northern tanzania ijumulana et al 2020 the local moran s i statistics determines significant spatial patterns spatial patterns referred to here are as defined by ijumulana et al 2020 and conceptualized by zhang et al 2008 in their soil pollution study a detailed description of the working principles of the local moran s i statistics is provided by anselin 1995 and zhang et al 2008 in this study high high and low low spatial patterns refer to the population under high and low f risk levels respectively the low high and high low spatial patterns refer to populations under high or low f risk levels surrounded by low or high f risk levels respectively under this assumption the concept of water mixing as part of the remediation process of f burden can be implemented the mapping of significant patterns was done at three significance levels i e α 0 001 0 01 and 0 05 2 6 software used in this study different software both open source and proprietary were used in this study they include spatial statistical and gis software open source spatial statistical software included geoda version 1 14 0 and r studio version february 1 5042 gis software included arcgis 9 6 1 and qgis version 2 18 23 geoda and r studio were used to map spatial patterns at local scales while arcgis and qgis were used in spatial data preparation and generation of final maps presented in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 geographical distribution of fluoride in groundwater in the northern zone of tanzania 3 1 1 geographical distribution of fluoride in groundwater at the regional level the geographical distribution of f concentrations in terms of potential health effects in the kilimanjaro manyara and arusha regions are presented in fig 3 despite kilimanjaro region n 297 having substantial groundwater sources with f levels below who 2011 guideline limit for drinking water 1 5 mg l over 55 of sources had f 0 5 mg l representing potential health risks in terms of dental caries the safe range for drinking water 0 5 f 1 5 mg l was represented by only 22 of the total water sources in the nfd contrary to the 70 presently known at the national level in the fluorotic regions of tanzania mjengera and mkongo 2003 furthermore the probability of developing dental fluorosis 1 5 f 4 0 mg l skeletal fluorosis 4 0 f 10 0 mg l and crippling fluorosis f 10 0 mg l in this region based on the existing drinking water sources was estimated to be 0 05 0 08 and 0 10 respectively for manyara n 499 and arusha n 405 regions the safe range for drinking purposes was presented by 31 and 30 of the existing groundwater sources respectively this is contrary to what is currently known about contaminated groundwater sources in these regions thole 2013 the probability of health problems in terms of fluorosis was higher in arusha region with 55 of the sources having f above 1 5 mg l thus causing potential dental fluorosis prob 1 5 f 4 0 mg l 0 25 skeletal fluorosis prob 4 0 f 4 0 mg l 0 17 and crippling fluorosis prob f 10 0 mg l 0 13 for manyara region the probability was relatively moderate with 43 of groundwater sources having f above 1 5 mg l with the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis of 0 26 0 14 and 0 03 respectively 3 1 2 geographical distribution of fluoride in groundwater and potential health risks at the district level the groundwater samples were grouped according to the district administrative boundary and the probability of dental caries and fluorosis estimated at the district level in each region fig 4 presents the geographical distribution of f in terms of health risk implication due to drinking f contaminated water the probability of health burden varied between districts with siha and hai districts being the most vulnerable with 88 and 80 of groundwater sources having f above 1 5 mg l respectively the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis prevalence was 0 19 0 25 and 0 43 respectively in siha district in hai district the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis prevalence was 0 04 0 35 and 0 41 respectively despite some districts viz rombo moshi mwanga same and moshi municipality had substantial safe groundwater sources for drinking purposes some of the sources there presented the likelihood of dental caries prevalence as 88 85 69 55 and 33 of the groundwater sources had f 0 5 mg l respectively furthermore the probability of safe sources for drinking water provision 0 5 f 1 5 mg l varied between districts the probability was lowest p 0 06 in rombo hai and siha districts while in ascending order it was 0 11 0 30 0 35 and 0 50 in moshi district mwanga and same districts and moshi municipality respectively fig 4a although 30 of the groundwater samples in the arusha region represented safe sources of water for drinking purposes the probability of accessing a safe source varied from one district to another in ascending order the probability was 0 16 0 20 0 22 0 26 0 34 0 51 and 0 52 in arusha city arusha karatu meru ngorongoro monduli and longido districts respectively fig 4b in terms of potential health risk levels emanating from drinking f contaminated water the overall probability of fluorosis prevalence in arusha region was 0 55 but varied between districts in ascending order the probability of dental fluorosis prevalence varied from 0 09 through 0 10 0 14 0 22 0 29 0 30 to 0 42 in karatu longido monduli ngorongoro meru arusha and arusha city respectively for skeletal fluorosis it varied from 0 00 through 0 02 0 09 0 10 0 19 0 32 to 0 34 in karatu ngorongoro monduli longido meru arusha city and arusha respectively in terms of crippling fluorosis the probability was 0 03 for monduli and longido districts and varied from 0 00 through 0 02 0 05 0 12 to 0 25 in karatu ngorongoro arusha city arusha and meru districts respectively in manyara region fig 4c 31 of the groundwater samples presented safe sources of drinking water however the probability varied among the districts in ascending order the probability varied from 0 17 through 0 23 0 30 0 32 0 38 to 0 51 in hanang simanjiro mbulu kiteto and babati districts and babati urban respectively in terms of fluorosis prevalence the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis varied from one district to another for dental fluorosis it varied from 0 10 through 0 17 0 18 0 31 0 38 and 0 39 in babati and kiteto districts babati urban mbulu simanjiro and hanang districts respectively on the other hand no potential health risks in terms of skeletal fluorosis were found in babati urban and mbulu district while it varied from 0 02 through 0 16 0 27 to 0 29 in kiteto babati hanang and simanjiro districts respectively it was further envisioned that crippling fluorosis is a probable health problem in some parts of the manyara region no potential health risks exist in babati urban mbulu and kiteto districts although relatively small the probability of crippling fluorosis prevalence was 0 06 for babati and simanjiro districts as well as 0 02 in hanang district in a strict sense the overall risk level of fluorosis in manyara region was 0 43 and varied between districts from 0 18 through 0 20 0 31 and 0 68 to 0 72 in babati urban mbulu and babati districts kiteto and simanjiro districts respectively 3 2 spatial distribution of fluoride concentrations unsafe for human consumption in groundwater from kilimanjaro manyara and arusha regions using the probability kriging method equations 12 13 and 14 in the annex the maps fig 5 were generated fig 5a shows the spatial distribution of places with f 0 5 mg l whereas fig 5b d represents places with f 1 5 4 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively places with extremely low f 0 5 mg l levels probability between 0 80 and 1 00 were geographically distributed along the major and minor rift mountain ranges in the western and eastern part of the study regions respectively around major stratovolcanoes especially mt kilimanjaro 1 mt meru 2 and mt hanang 4 in kilimanjaro arusha and manyara regions respectively the presence of groundwater sources with extremely low f concentrations around elevated terrain may be due to less contact time between recharge water and f bearing volcanic rocks ghiglieri et al 2010 in contrast the probability of f 0 5 mg l was extremely low p 0 30 in places within earv graben along the administrative boundary between arusha and manyara regions this is a typical indication of the sources and mobility of f in the aqueous environment which is contact time between volcanic rocks and recharge water from precipitation ghiglieri et al 2010 similarly places with f 0 5 mg l were distributed along the regional administrative boundary between singida simiyu and arusha regions in the western part of the study area the administrative boundaries in these regions are elevated braking slopes constituting rift faults with steep slopes where the hydraulic gradients are largely resulting in high groundwater flows the presence of large hydraulic gradients results in less contact time between recharge water from precipitation and f bearing rocks leading to reduced dissolution processes of f bearing minerals mainly titanite amphibole hornblende and biotite ijumulana et al 2020 the probability of encountering groundwater sources with f above the maximum recommended value for drinking water who 2011 2017 varied from one place to another and the potential health problems in terms of fluorosis were a regional problem in the studied areas fig 5b the locations with extreme f concentrations probability of exceedance between 0 60 and 1 00 were along the southern and eastern boundary of the arusha region and around the flanks of major stratovolcanoes especially mt meru and mt hanang in the north eastern and south western parts of the study area respectively specific places with extreme f are summarized in table 1 the risk of f is a regional problem affecting specific locations on a local scale in the arusha region it is estimated that approximately 62 administrative wards 57 are affected by extreme concentrations of f however the probability of having this problem varied from one district to another in descending order the most affected wards were within arusha district arusha city meru monduli ngorongoro and longido districts in which 95 89 71 40 19 and 19 of the ward population depend on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations respectively fig 5c and d show locations with a probability of f exceeding 4 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively the probability of f 4 0 mg l was high ranging between 0 60 and 1 00 around mt meru 2 especially in the graben between mt kilimanjaro 1 and mt meru 2 other locations were distributed around mt hanang 4 and south east of lake manyara which lies within earv graben lake manyara being one of the groundwater discharge areas in the internal drainage basin contains water with high levels of f mobilized through dissolution processes of f bearing minerals and the presence of phosphate minerals at the minjingu area in the south east of the lake furthermore places with f exceeding 10 0 mg l were distributed around mt meru especially in the graben between mt meru and mt kilimanjaro in kilimanjaro region 20 out of 107 wards 19 depend on groundwater sources with extreme concentrations of f at the district level this percentage varies from one ward to another in siha district groundwater sources in all administrative wards were affected by extreme f concentrations followed by hai district in which 5 out of 14 wards 36 depend on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations the rest of the districts demonstrated few wards whose population depends on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations as indicated in table 2 for manyara region the population in 62 out of 122 wards 51 were estimated to depend on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations however the risk levels varied between districts the population in hanang district demonstrated the highest risk levels 84 followed by simanjiro babati mbulu babati urban and kiteto districts with 76 43 38 38 and 21 risk levels respectively 3 3 fluoride risk level mapping in arusha kilimanjaro and manyara region as described in sections 2 5 and 2 6 fig 6 shows spatial autocorrelation analysis results using population depending on groundwater sources with f concentrations below 0 5 mg l and above 1 5 mg l fig 6a and b using queen s first order spatial weight matrix and estimated f risk levels risk 1 f 0 5 mg l and risk 2 f 1 5 mg l a significant positive moran s i statistic was obtained indicating clustering of f risk levels in space however the moran s i statistics was highly significant i 0 615 z value 19 680 pseudo p value 0 001 for f risk level above 1 5 mg l compared to f risk level below 0 5 mg l i 0 515 z value 18 190 pseudo p value 0 001 3 4 spatial cluster and outlier mapping in fluoride risk levels fluoride risk levels were mapped using univariate moran s i statistical analysis since the univariate moran s i statistic is calculated under the assumption of normality at the local scale the f risk levels were transformed using the box cox transform box and cox 1964 zhang et al 2008 table 3 gives a summary of the properties of the contiguity queen s case anselin 2013 spatial weights that were used to calculate the local moran s i statistic at four orders q q1 q2 q3 and q4 the first and second order q1and q2 respectively queen s contiguity spatial weights demonstrated high levels of symmetric as indicated by small differences between mean and median neighbors compared to the third q3 and fourth q4 orders likewise the first two orders indicated a smaller number of non zero compared to the last two orders furthermore the experiment to map significant spatial clusters and spatial outliers was done at three four orders of the queen s contiguity spatial weights table 4 gives summary statistics of spatial clusters and spatial outliers estimates in f risk levels at f 0 5 mg l as a rule of thumb when using local moran s i statistics the best classification results are attained at convenient large and converging z value as well as the smaller pseudo p value anselin 1995 in this study significant spatial clusters and spatial outliers in f risk levels were mapped at q2 with lower order neighbors excluded i e i 0 4126 z value 20 5374 and pseudo p value 0 001 for f 0 5 mg l and i 0 512 z value 24 5668 and pseudo p value 0 001 for f 1 5 mg l the spatial distribution of probable f health effects in the study regions is presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively in both cases the significant spatial patterns were classified and mapped at three significant levels i e α 0 001 0 01 and 0 05 the probability of disease burden in terms of dental caries was highest in 79 wards around the flanks of mt kilimanjaro fig 7 it was estimated that around 20 of the population depends on groundwater sources for drinking with the median probability for f 0 5 mg l of around 0 84 table 5 in contrast 91 wards with approximately 22 of the population were at low risk in terms of dental caries as indicated by the lowest median probability of 0 13 mostly the population in this category are maasai communities which are sparsely distributed within earv graben around 10 of the population were estimated to live in the low or high risk levels where approximately 20 671 in three wards and 406 005 in 11 wards were at low risk level but in the neighborhood of high risk levels and vice versa respectively the median probability of low risk levels in the neighborhood of high risk levels and vice versa was 0 67 and 0 25 respectively the results of frl analysis at f 1 5 mg l are presented in fig 8 communities in rural and urban settings around mt meru and mt hanang were at high frl with a median probability of exceedance of approximately 0 64 table 6 in these settings it is estimated that approximately 41 of the population distributed in 131 wards is at high fluorosis risk emanating from consumption of groundwater with f 1 5 mg l in contrast 52 wards with 10 of the population distributed along with the usambara mountain ranges which is part of a minor escarpment of earv were at a low fluorosis risk level however some of the wards were at a very high risk level in terms of dental caries as described above 3 5 validation of fluoride risk level maps the validation of f risk maps was done through field water sampling and observation on prevailing fluorosis disease burden in the high high zone of fig 8 between 2016 and 2018 fig 9 presents a summary of field measured f concentrations and other physio chemical parameters in drinking water sources as well as adverse health effects as an outcome measured in september 2016 children and adolescents aged between 4 and 12 years old in embaseni village of maji ya chai ward in meru district in the south east flanks of mt meru were visually observed to have developed mild to severe dental fluorosis due to consumption of f contaminated f 11 4 mg l spring water fig 9a similarly the woman in fig 9b was 29 years in lemanda village of oldonyosambu ward in arusha district arusha region she developed crippling fluorosis due to consumption of f contaminated spring water f 18 7 mg l since her birth based on in situ measured physio chemical parameters the two springs differed significantly in terms of ph temperature t electric conductivity ec and elevation above mean sea level the high ph 8 17 temperature 28 7 c elevation 1808 m a m s l and relatively low ec 494 μs cm at lemanda spring is an indication that the spring could be originating from the rift system the relatively low ph 7 15 temperature 24 6 c elevation 1261 m a m s l and high ec 947 μs cm can be an indication that high levels of f originate from prolonged contact time between recharge water and volcanic rocks ashes which enhance processes viz dissolution of fluorine bearing minerals and ion exchange in water solution brindha and elango 2011 jacks et al 2005 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 4 conclusion despite over 80 of safe water demand for various purposes in ndz of tanzania is sufficed by groundwater resources the occurrence of f in elevated or extremely low concentrations has rendered many sources unfit for drinking purposes the occurrence of f in groundwater systems in northern tanzania is due to stochastic processes resulting in a large scale of variability in space in this study integrated geostatistical techniques spatial statistical methods and gis mapping tools were used to delineate places at high f risk levels in three regions namely kilimanjaro arusha and manyara the f risk levels were estimated at f 0 5 mg l and f 1 5 mg l which correspond to threshold values likely to cause dental caries and fluorosis disease burden in human health respectively around 1 million people were estimated to be under significant high dental caries risk in districts around mt kilimanjaro in kilimanjaro region likewise around 2 million people were estimated to be under significant high fluorosis risk in districts within earv graben and around the flanks of mt meru and mt hanang in arusha and manyara regions respectively the probability for dental caries disease burden in kilimanjaro region was 0 77 0 20 whereas that of fluorosis was 0 62 0 24 in the three regions specific districts with a population under high dental caries risk include rombo moshi and mwanga in these districts the probability of accessing a safe source for drinking purposes is 0 06 0 11 and 0 30 in rombo moshi and mwanga respectively in terms of fluorosis disease burden the specific districts with a population under significant risk include siha and hai in kilimanjaro region arusha city arusha and meru in arusha region and simanjiro and hanang in the manyara region the probability of accessing safe water in these districts is 0 06 siha and hai 0 16 arusha city 0 17 hanang 0 20 arusha 0 23 simanjiro and 0 26 meru in these districts almost all members of the household have developed mild to severe fluorosis which is an increasing disease burden as observed visually during field campaigns in embaseni and lemanda villages in meru and arusha districts respectively the findings of this study are very important for the local water supply authorities in the studied regions not only for managing the existing groundwater sources in the naturally contaminated hydrogeological environments but also in the planning for new sources of safe water for drinking purposes to meet the national 2025 vision on the safe water supply to all citizens the findings are also crucial for the researchers to estimate the severity of dental caries and fluorosis using appropriate hazard indices among different age groups with emphasis on children

11889,spatial uncertainty caused by large scale variation in fluoride f occurrence remains a setback for water supply authorities in the f belts of the world it is estimated that approximately 80 million people in the east african rift valley earv regions and volcanic areas exhibit a wide variety of fluorosis symptoms due to drinking water with f concentrations higher than 1 5 mg l who guideline limit in this study we combined geostatistical techniques spatial statistical methods and geographical information systems gis to i map the probable places with f 0 5 mg l and f 1 5 4 0 and 10 0 mg l using probability kriging pk method ii estimate the probable total population at high or low f risk levels using univariate local moran s i statistic and iii map the spatial distribution of population at high and low f risk levels in manyara arusha and kilimanjaro regions using gis it was predicted that places along the major and minor earv mountain ranges and around the flanks of major stratovolcanoes were dominated by groundwater sources with extremely low f 0 5 mg l in contrast places within earv graben were dominated by groundwater sources with f 1 5 mg l about 1 million people 20 of the total population living around mt kilimanjaro in rombo moshi and mwanga districts are at high dental caries risk furthermore it was estimated that about 2 million people 41 of the total population in siha hai arusha city hanang arusha simanjiro and meru districts are at high risk of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis fluorosis especially dental and crippling fluorosis is an increasing disease burden at the community level due to prolonged consumption of f contaminated water within earv graben the major findings of the present study are very crucial for authority to

rashid et al 2018 fluoride concentrations above 1 5 mg l in drinking water have adverse health effects for humans if ingested for a prolonged period who 2011 2017 dissanayake 1991 and bretzler and johnson 2015 reported prevalence of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis among the population exposed to different levels of f concentrations namely 1 5 f 4 0 mg l 4 0 f 10 0 mg l and f 10 0 mg l through drinking water furthermore dissanayake 1991 reported significant human health problems in terms of dental caries when drinking water even with f 0 5 mg l is used for a prolonged period there are also non fluorosis health effects that may occur due to long term consumption of drinking water with f levels exceeding the maximum permissible limit of 1 5 mg l who 2011 e g growth retardation

with the severity varying significantly between groups the children being prominently at relatively high risk fluoride contaminated groundwater has been reported in many countries it is estimated that approximately 200 million people distributed in around 28 countries across continents depend on groundwater sources with f exceeding 1 5 mg l fawell et al 2006 kimambo et al 2019 shen and schäfer 2015 the specific countries where the population depends on f contaminated groundwater sources have been summarized in kimambo et al 2019 although there is no confirmed data on the number of people depending on groundwater with a high concentration of f it is estimated that approximately 272 million people 40 of the total population in sub sahara africa depend on groundwater sources of poor quality ali et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 kut et al 2016 one of the well known causes of poor quality in groundwater sources is geogenic f which is prevalent within east african rift valley earv regions and volcanic areas it is estimated that approximately 80 million people there exhibit a wide variety of fluorosis symptoms due to prolonged exposure to f exceeding the recommended maximum permissible value of 1 5 mg l who 2011 for drinking water shen and schäfer 2015 smedley et al 2002 it is further estimated that the population under the greatest levels of disease burden due to skeletal fluorosis live in eritrea tanzania ethiopia kenya and south africa fewtrell et al 2006 in tanzania the disease burden due to dental caries and fluorosis has been reported sporadically in parts of the northern development zone ndz where about 90 of the population are reported to be affected by dental fluorosis at varying severity or stages mabelya 1995 vuhahula et al 2009 yoder et al 1998 due to high spatial variability in f occurrence within these regions ijumulana et al 2020 the actual health risk to the population is uncertain and highly speculative assuming the effects of elevated f concentrations across all age groups in the earv system the objective of this study was to estimate the probable total population under dental caries and fluorosis risk levels in three regions arusha kilimanjaro and manyara due to high spatial variability in f concentrations a combination of geospatial methods was adopted the methods included probability kriging pk which was used to delineate places with f 0 5 mg l f 1 5 4 0 and 10 0 mg l using f concentrations in the national fluoride database nfd the univariate local moran s i statistic and gis were used to decipher communities and total population under high risks in terms of dental caries and fluorosis in the ndz of tanzania 1 1 the study area 1 1 1 climate population distribution and drinking water sources the study was conducted in three regions of ndz fig 1 a namely arusha manyara kilimanjaro and tanga fig 1b according to the national population census of 2012 and projections of 2017 unies 2017 urt 2013 approximately 12 of the population lives in ndz with unequal geographical distribution at the regional level due to several environmental geological and climatic factors it was projected that approximately 30 25 23 and 22 of the population live in tanga arusha kilimanjaro and manyara region respectively as indicated in the quintiles map fig 1c the population density in each region is highly variable with the highest population concentrated around major stratovolcanoes i e mt kilimanjaro mt meru and mt hanang in kilimanjaro arusha and manyara regions respectively the lowest population density is geographically distributed within earv graben which defines the northern tanzania dry belt extending between 3 20 and 6 s and between 36 and 38 e solomon et al 2000 the study area is characterized by considerable spatial and temporal variability climatic conditions which are controlled by topography landforms and the geological setting the windward side of the stratovolcanoes and earv mountain ranges in the western and eastern parts of the studied regions are more humid compared to the places on the leeward side on average terms many places in earv graben are hot and semi arid with annual rainfall ranging between 600 and 800 mm mainly during october december and march may kijazi and reason 2009 like many places in sub saharan africa ssa particularly regions in earv average monthly temperatures range between 20 and 26 c in the studied regions with a dry season of around 4 6 months macdonald et al 2009 new et al 1999 the prolonged droughts and scarcity of surface water in the studied regions promote groundwater as the primary source of water especially for drinking garcía pérez et al 2013 ijumulana et al 2020 macdonald and calow 2009 malago et al 2017 thole 2013 it is estimated that approximately 45 million people in these regions depend on groundwater hosted in young volcanic rocks which account for 4 of the potential hydrogeological environments of ssa adelana and macdonald 2008 ghiglieri et al 2010 macdonald and davies 2000 the geogenic occurrence of elevated f concentrations in groundwater systems has rendered many sources unfit for drinking it is estimated that over one third of the groundwater resources are unfit for drinking purposes causing severe adverse health effects viz fluorosis in ndz chowdhury et al 2019 thole 2013 vuhahula et al 2009 furthermore it has been recently reported that geogenic f contamination is space dependent having significant patterns that are important to decipher for ensuring safe water supply in regions with naturally contaminated groundwater systems ijumulana et al 2020 in the studied regions potential adverse health effects vary in space with possible severe health problems among communities that depend solely on groundwater sources with f levels above 1 5 mg l especially in the earv graben and around the flanks of stratovolcanoes 1 1 2 geomorphological setting and population density distribution the relief of the study area is highly variable with elevation ranging between 400 and 5900 m above mean sea level a m s l as shown in fig 2 a lowlands lie between 450 and 1200 m a m s l where major water bodies are situated the location of the water bodies indicates primary discharge areas within the internal drainage basin idb and pangani drainage basin pdb while the highest elevations lie between 2300 and 5900 m a m s l the highest points 2900 5900 m a m s l in this range constitute the peaks of the major stratovolcanoes including 1 mt kilimanjaro 2 mt meru 3 mt hanang 4 mt oldoinyo lengai an active volcano 5 ngorongoro crater maar 6 mt gelai 7 mt kitumbeine 8 mt monduli and 9 mt kwaraha in terms of groundwater occurrence in these regions the major stratovolcanoes play an important role as they constitute primary recharge areas depending on the nature of the local geological setting the relief with an elevation between 1200 and 2900 m a m s l is dominated by gentle slopes controlling sporadic and clustered settlements as indicated in fig 2b this range includes places along the slopes of the major rift valley mountain ranges in the eastern and western of the study areas and around the flanks of the major stratovolcanoes particularly mt kilimanjaro 1 mt meru 2 mt monduli 8 and mt hanang 3 at this slope between 1200 and 2900 m a m s l the population density ranges between 150 and 16 000 persons per square kilometer on the other hand the population is sparsely distributed in lowlands especially in earv graben with population density ranging between 1 and 150 persons per square kilometer fig 2b 2 materials and methods 2 1 spatial data compilation and preparation spatial data used in this study was compiled from different sources table 1 fluoride concentrations in groundwater were obtained from the nfd at the ngurdoto defluoridation research station ndrs of the ministry of water according to water quality service division 2016 report water samples from each source were collected following standard operating procedures sop for water sampling who 2017 a 1 liter clean plastic polyethylene bottle was used for water sampling the sampling bottles were rinsed three times with distilled water and the water to be sampled before water sampling determination of f concentrations was carried out immediately at the sampling point following standard analytical methods apha 1989 who 2017 hach 2021 using an f ion selective electrode with hq440d ion meter calibrated using standard f solutions supplied by hach in a typical procedure 25 ml of water sample was mixed with total ionic strength adjustor buffer tisab powder in a beaker and shaken thoroughly to ensure tisab powder was completely dissolved and uniformly mixed with the water sample to be analyzed a detailed description of the data collection methods and analysis techniques can be found in the water quality mapping report of the ministry of water water quality service division 2016 the other spatial data used was f concentrations measured in situ using the same procedure and instrument during fieldwork campaigns of 2016 and 2018 this data was used to validate predicted f concentrations using f data of the ministry of water water quality service division 2016 the last two spatial datasets were collected from the national agencies while major drainage boundaries were obtained from pangani basin water office pbwo the administrative boundaries and population data were acquired from the national bureau of statistics nbs of tanzania the specific spatial dataset description is presented in table 1 spatial data preparation involved the integration of the data using various gis software as spatial data were on different datum the integration process included defining the data on a common spatial reference system srs which was the world geodetic system of 1984 wgs84 through on the fly datum transformation models present in many gis software viz arcgis globalmapper qgis etc the other process was the preparation of a spatial database for the population and integrate it with the f database ijumulana et al 2020 from which summary statistics of f concentrations were estimated at the regional and district level 2 2 statistical analysis of f concentrations high f concentrations and related health problems are sporadically well studied at the regional level in three regions by various researchers malago et al 2017 shorter 2011 vuhahula et al 2009 for this study the statistical distribution analysis of f concentrations was systematically done at regional district and ward levels since groundwater systems are ubiquitous the water supply process is independent of the political administrative boundaries indicated in fig 1a for example the population in some administrative wards depends on groundwater sources located outside the administrative boundary to provide an understanding of f contamination burden predicted concentrations were used to estimate the population at f risk levels 2 3 geostatistical analysis since groundwater sources in the study regions followed the population distribution which is influenced by environmental geological and climatic factors kriging was used to systemize the sampling locations kriging is widely used in the field of structural optimization while dealing with stochastic processes basudhar and missoum 2008 chiles and delfiner 2009 cressie 1990 meng et al 2018 hengl 2009 stein 2012 zhang et al 2020 specifically probability kriging pk was used in this study to predict places with f less than 0 5 mg l and greater than 1 5 mg l which are well known to cause dental caries and fluorosis respectively dissanayake 1991 the basic theory of the kriging model and the concept of pk are introduced briefly in the annex when using pk the values 0 5 and 1 5 mg l were used as cut off points c in equation 12 section 2 3 2 of the annex the predictions were done at a 1 5 by 1 5 km grid the selection of the prediction grid was automatically determined based on the minimum maximum separation distance of the groundwater sources from which samples were collected 2 4 fluoride risk levels estimation at f 0 5 1 5 mg l the presence of different concentrations of f in drinking water affects the population depending on the contaminated source brindha and elango 2011 dissanayake 1991 mohanta and mohanty 2018 bhattacharya et al 2020 mridha et al 2021 for this study we defined f risk level frl as follows based on the risk mapping concepts recently developed by quino lima et al 2020 1 f r l p k n k where p k and n k are the probability of exceedance and total population in the local administrative unit k respectively the former was estimated based on 0 5 and 1 5 mg l thresholds and equation 12 section 2 3 2 of the annex carr and mao 1993 okx et al 1993 sullivan 1984 while the latter was obtained from the census population database urt 2013 by local administrative unit in this study we refer to ward level which is the second and third administrative level in urban and rural settings in tanzania respectively to estimate p k at ward level k z x 0 raster data were converted to vector format thereafter the respective ward boundary was used as a conditioning boundary in the gis environment to estimate the average value using equation 2 2 p k a v 1 n i 1 n p k i where p k a v stands for average probability of exceedance at individual ward k while n stands for total number of prediction grids within the administrative ward boundary since f contamination in the study area is space dependent ijumulana et al 2020 the median values at each ward level were used instead of the mean value for wards with small coverage less than 2 25 km2 the prediction grid in this study the logical assignment of the nearest values was assigned although there were few such cases 2 5 spatial cluster and spatial outlier analysis in frl the global and local moran s i statistics were used to analyze spatial patterns using estimated frl in equation 1 the global moran s i statistics is widely used in environmental sciences to test the hypothesis of completely spatial randomness csr in the observed events on the variable of interest which are continuous and stochastic moran 1950 in principle the results of the test static indicate whether the phenomenon under investigation is clustering randomly distributed or dispersed in space and or in time space indicated by i 0 i 0 or i 0 respectively the method has recently been used to study the nature of f contamination in northern tanzania ijumulana et al 2020 the local moran s i statistics determines significant spatial patterns spatial patterns referred to here are as defined by ijumulana et al 2020 and conceptualized by zhang et al 2008 in their soil pollution study a detailed description of the working principles of the local moran s i statistics is provided by anselin 1995 and zhang et al 2008 in this study high high and low low spatial patterns refer to the population under high and low f risk levels respectively the low high and high low spatial patterns refer to populations under high or low f risk levels surrounded by low or high f risk levels respectively under this assumption the concept of water mixing as part of the remediation process of f burden can be implemented the mapping of significant patterns was done at three significance levels i e α 0 001 0 01 and 0 05 2 6 software used in this study different software both open source and proprietary were used in this study they include spatial statistical and gis software open source spatial statistical software included geoda version 1 14 0 and r studio version february 1 5042 gis software included arcgis 9 6 1 and qgis version 2 18 23 geoda and r studio were used to map spatial patterns at local scales while arcgis and qgis were used in spatial data preparation and generation of final maps presented in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 geographical distribution of fluoride in groundwater in the northern zone of tanzania 3 1 1 geographical distribution of fluoride in groundwater at the regional level the geographical distribution of f concentrations in terms of potential health effects in the kilimanjaro manyara and arusha regions are presented in fig 3 despite kilimanjaro region n 297 having substantial groundwater sources with f levels below who 2011 guideline limit for drinking water 1 5 mg l over 55 of sources had f 0 5 mg l representing potential health risks in terms of dental caries the safe range for drinking water 0 5 f 1 5 mg l was represented by only 22 of the total water sources in the nfd contrary to the 70 presently known at the national level in the fluorotic regions of tanzania mjengera and mkongo 2003 furthermore the probability of developing dental fluorosis 1 5 f 4 0 mg l skeletal fluorosis 4 0 f 10 0 mg l and crippling fluorosis f 10 0 mg l in this region based on the existing drinking water sources was estimated to be 0 05 0 08 and 0 10 respectively for manyara n 499 and arusha n 405 regions the safe range for drinking purposes was presented by 31 and 30 of the existing groundwater sources respectively this is contrary to what is currently known about contaminated groundwater sources in these regions thole 2013 the probability of health problems in terms of fluorosis was higher in arusha region with 55 of the sources having f above 1 5 mg l thus causing potential dental fluorosis prob 1 5 f 4 0 mg l 0 25 skeletal fluorosis prob 4 0 f 4 0 mg l 0 17 and crippling fluorosis prob f 10 0 mg l 0 13 for manyara region the probability was relatively moderate with 43 of groundwater sources having f above 1 5 mg l with the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis of 0 26 0 14 and 0 03 respectively 3 1 2 geographical distribution of fluoride in groundwater and potential health risks at the district level the groundwater samples were grouped according to the district administrative boundary and the probability of dental caries and fluorosis estimated at the district level in each region fig 4 presents the geographical distribution of f in terms of health risk implication due to drinking f contaminated water the probability of health burden varied between districts with siha and hai districts being the most vulnerable with 88 and 80 of groundwater sources having f above 1 5 mg l respectively the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis prevalence was 0 19 0 25 and 0 43 respectively in siha district in hai district the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis prevalence was 0 04 0 35 and 0 41 respectively despite some districts viz rombo moshi mwanga same and moshi municipality had substantial safe groundwater sources for drinking purposes some of the sources there presented the likelihood of dental caries prevalence as 88 85 69 55 and 33 of the groundwater sources had f 0 5 mg l respectively furthermore the probability of safe sources for drinking water provision 0 5 f 1 5 mg l varied between districts the probability was lowest p 0 06 in rombo hai and siha districts while in ascending order it was 0 11 0 30 0 35 and 0 50 in moshi district mwanga and same districts and moshi municipality respectively fig 4a although 30 of the groundwater samples in the arusha region represented safe sources of water for drinking purposes the probability of accessing a safe source varied from one district to another in ascending order the probability was 0 16 0 20 0 22 0 26 0 34 0 51 and 0 52 in arusha city arusha karatu meru ngorongoro monduli and longido districts respectively fig 4b in terms of potential health risk levels emanating from drinking f contaminated water the overall probability of fluorosis prevalence in arusha region was 0 55 but varied between districts in ascending order the probability of dental fluorosis prevalence varied from 0 09 through 0 10 0 14 0 22 0 29 0 30 to 0 42 in karatu longido monduli ngorongoro meru arusha and arusha city respectively for skeletal fluorosis it varied from 0 00 through 0 02 0 09 0 10 0 19 0 32 to 0 34 in karatu ngorongoro monduli longido meru arusha city and arusha respectively in terms of crippling fluorosis the probability was 0 03 for monduli and longido districts and varied from 0 00 through 0 02 0 05 0 12 to 0 25 in karatu ngorongoro arusha city arusha and meru districts respectively in manyara region fig 4c 31 of the groundwater samples presented safe sources of drinking water however the probability varied among the districts in ascending order the probability varied from 0 17 through 0 23 0 30 0 32 0 38 to 0 51 in hanang simanjiro mbulu kiteto and babati districts and babati urban respectively in terms of fluorosis prevalence the probability of dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis varied from one district to another for dental fluorosis it varied from 0 10 through 0 17 0 18 0 31 0 38 and 0 39 in babati and kiteto districts babati urban mbulu simanjiro and hanang districts respectively on the other hand no potential health risks in terms of skeletal fluorosis were found in babati urban and mbulu district while it varied from 0 02 through 0 16 0 27 to 0 29 in kiteto babati hanang and simanjiro districts respectively it was further envisioned that crippling fluorosis is a probable health problem in some parts of the manyara region no potential health risks exist in babati urban mbulu and kiteto districts although relatively small the probability of crippling fluorosis prevalence was 0 06 for babati and simanjiro districts as well as 0 02 in hanang district in a strict sense the overall risk level of fluorosis in manyara region was 0 43 and varied between districts from 0 18 through 0 20 0 31 and 0 68 to 0 72 in babati urban mbulu and babati districts kiteto and simanjiro districts respectively 3 2 spatial distribution of fluoride concentrations unsafe for human consumption in groundwater from kilimanjaro manyara and arusha regions using the probability kriging method equations 12 13 and 14 in the annex the maps fig 5 were generated fig 5a shows the spatial distribution of places with f 0 5 mg l whereas fig 5b d represents places with f 1 5 4 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively places with extremely low f 0 5 mg l levels probability between 0 80 and 1 00 were geographically distributed along the major and minor rift mountain ranges in the western and eastern part of the study regions respectively around major stratovolcanoes especially mt kilimanjaro 1 mt meru 2 and mt hanang 4 in kilimanjaro arusha and manyara regions respectively the presence of groundwater sources with extremely low f concentrations around elevated terrain may be due to less contact time between recharge water and f bearing volcanic rocks ghiglieri et al 2010 in contrast the probability of f 0 5 mg l was extremely low p 0 30 in places within earv graben along the administrative boundary between arusha and manyara regions this is a typical indication of the sources and mobility of f in the aqueous environment which is contact time between volcanic rocks and recharge water from precipitation ghiglieri et al 2010 similarly places with f 0 5 mg l were distributed along the regional administrative boundary between singida simiyu and arusha regions in the western part of the study area the administrative boundaries in these regions are elevated braking slopes constituting rift faults with steep slopes where the hydraulic gradients are largely resulting in high groundwater flows the presence of large hydraulic gradients results in less contact time between recharge water from precipitation and f bearing rocks leading to reduced dissolution processes of f bearing minerals mainly titanite amphibole hornblende and biotite ijumulana et al 2020 the probability of encountering groundwater sources with f above the maximum recommended value for drinking water who 2011 2017 varied from one place to another and the potential health problems in terms of fluorosis were a regional problem in the studied areas fig 5b the locations with extreme f concentrations probability of exceedance between 0 60 and 1 00 were along the southern and eastern boundary of the arusha region and around the flanks of major stratovolcanoes especially mt meru and mt hanang in the north eastern and south western parts of the study area respectively specific places with extreme f are summarized in table 1 the risk of f is a regional problem affecting specific locations on a local scale in the arusha region it is estimated that approximately 62 administrative wards 57 are affected by extreme concentrations of f however the probability of having this problem varied from one district to another in descending order the most affected wards were within arusha district arusha city meru monduli ngorongoro and longido districts in which 95 89 71 40 19 and 19 of the ward population depend on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations respectively fig 5c and d show locations with a probability of f exceeding 4 0 and 10 0 mg l respectively the probability of f 4 0 mg l was high ranging between 0 60 and 1 00 around mt meru 2 especially in the graben between mt kilimanjaro 1 and mt meru 2 other locations were distributed around mt hanang 4 and south east of lake manyara which lies within earv graben lake manyara being one of the groundwater discharge areas in the internal drainage basin contains water with high levels of f mobilized through dissolution processes of f bearing minerals and the presence of phosphate minerals at the minjingu area in the south east of the lake furthermore places with f exceeding 10 0 mg l were distributed around mt meru especially in the graben between mt meru and mt kilimanjaro in kilimanjaro region 20 out of 107 wards 19 depend on groundwater sources with extreme concentrations of f at the district level this percentage varies from one ward to another in siha district groundwater sources in all administrative wards were affected by extreme f concentrations followed by hai district in which 5 out of 14 wards 36 depend on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations the rest of the districts demonstrated few wards whose population depends on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations as indicated in table 2 for manyara region the population in 62 out of 122 wards 51 were estimated to depend on groundwater sources with extreme f concentrations however the risk levels varied between districts the population in hanang district demonstrated the highest risk levels 84 followed by simanjiro babati mbulu babati urban and kiteto districts with 76 43 38 38 and 21 risk levels respectively 3 3 fluoride risk level mapping in arusha kilimanjaro and manyara region as described in sections 2 5 and 2 6 fig 6 shows spatial autocorrelation analysis results using population depending on groundwater sources with f concentrations below 0 5 mg l and above 1 5 mg l fig 6a and b using queen s first order spatial weight matrix and estimated f risk levels risk 1 f 0 5 mg l and risk 2 f 1 5 mg l a significant positive moran s i statistic was obtained indicating clustering of f risk levels in space however the moran s i statistics was highly significant i 0 615 z value 19 680 pseudo p value 0 001 for f risk level above 1 5 mg l compared to f risk level below 0 5 mg l i 0 515 z value 18 190 pseudo p value 0 001 3 4 spatial cluster and outlier mapping in fluoride risk levels fluoride risk levels were mapped using univariate moran s i statistical analysis since the univariate moran s i statistic is calculated under the assumption of normality at the local scale the f risk levels were transformed using the box cox transform box and cox 1964 zhang et al 2008 table 3 gives a summary of the properties of the contiguity queen s case anselin 2013 spatial weights that were used to calculate the local moran s i statistic at four orders q q1 q2 q3 and q4 the first and second order q1and q2 respectively queen s contiguity spatial weights demonstrated high levels of symmetric as indicated by small differences between mean and median neighbors compared to the third q3 and fourth q4 orders likewise the first two orders indicated a smaller number of non zero compared to the last two orders furthermore the experiment to map significant spatial clusters and spatial outliers was done at three four orders of the queen s contiguity spatial weights table 4 gives summary statistics of spatial clusters and spatial outliers estimates in f risk levels at f 0 5 mg l as a rule of thumb when using local moran s i statistics the best classification results are attained at convenient large and converging z value as well as the smaller pseudo p value anselin 1995 in this study significant spatial clusters and spatial outliers in f risk levels were mapped at q2 with lower order neighbors excluded i e i 0 4126 z value 20 5374 and pseudo p value 0 001 for f 0 5 mg l and i 0 512 z value 24 5668 and pseudo p value 0 001 for f 1 5 mg l the spatial distribution of probable f health effects in the study regions is presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively in both cases the significant spatial patterns were classified and mapped at three significant levels i e α 0 001 0 01 and 0 05 the probability of disease burden in terms of dental caries was highest in 79 wards around the flanks of mt kilimanjaro fig 7 it was estimated that around 20 of the population depends on groundwater sources for drinking with the median probability for f 0 5 mg l of around 0 84 table 5 in contrast 91 wards with approximately 22 of the population were at low risk in terms of dental caries as indicated by the lowest median probability of 0 13 mostly the population in this category are maasai communities which are sparsely distributed within earv graben around 10 of the population were estimated to live in the low or high risk levels where approximately 20 671 in three wards and 406 005 in 11 wards were at low risk level but in the neighborhood of high risk levels and vice versa respectively the median probability of low risk levels in the neighborhood of high risk levels and vice versa was 0 67 and 0 25 respectively the results of frl analysis at f 1 5 mg l are presented in fig 8 communities in rural and urban settings around mt meru and mt hanang were at high frl with a median probability of exceedance of approximately 0 64 table 6 in these settings it is estimated that approximately 41 of the population distributed in 131 wards is at high fluorosis risk emanating from consumption of groundwater with f 1 5 mg l in contrast 52 wards with 10 of the population distributed along with the usambara mountain ranges which is part of a minor escarpment of earv were at a low fluorosis risk level however some of the wards were at a very high risk level in terms of dental caries as described above 3 5 validation of fluoride risk level maps the validation of f risk maps was done through field water sampling and observation on prevailing fluorosis disease burden in the high high zone of fig 8 between 2016 and 2018 fig 9 presents a summary of field measured f concentrations and other physio chemical parameters in drinking water sources as well as adverse health effects as an outcome measured in september 2016 children and adolescents aged between 4 and 12 years old in embaseni village of maji ya chai ward in meru district in the south east flanks of mt meru were visually observed to have developed mild to severe dental fluorosis due to consumption of f contaminated f 11 4 mg l spring water fig 9a similarly the woman in fig 9b was 29 years in lemanda village of oldonyosambu ward in arusha district arusha region she developed crippling fluorosis due to consumption of f contaminated spring water f 18 7 mg l since her birth based on in situ measured physio chemical parameters the two springs differed significantly in terms of ph temperature t electric conductivity ec and elevation above mean sea level the high ph 8 17 temperature 28 7 c elevation 1808 m a m s l and relatively low ec 494 μs cm at lemanda spring is an indication that the spring could be originating from the rift system the relatively low ph 7 15 temperature 24 6 c elevation 1261 m a m s l and high ec 947 μs cm can be an indication that high levels of f originate from prolonged contact time between recharge water and volcanic rocks ashes which enhance processes viz dissolution of fluorine bearing minerals and ion exchange in water solution brindha and elango 2011 jacks et al 2005 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a 4 conclusion despite over 80 of safe water demand for various purposes in ndz of tanzania is sufficed by groundwater resources the occurrence of f in elevated or extremely low concentrations has rendered many sources unfit for drinking purposes the occurrence of f in groundwater systems in northern tanzania is due to stochastic processes resulting in a large scale of variability in space in this study integrated geostatistical techniques spatial statistical methods and gis mapping tools were used to delineate places at high f risk levels in three regions namely kilimanjaro arusha and manyara the f risk levels were estimated at f 0 5 mg l and f 1 5 mg l which correspond to threshold values likely to cause dental caries and fluorosis disease burden in human health respectively around 1 million people were estimated to be under significant high dental caries risk in districts around mt kilimanjaro in kilimanjaro region likewise around 2 million people were estimated to be under significant high fluorosis risk in districts within earv graben and around the flanks of mt meru and mt hanang in arusha and manyara regions respectively the probability for dental caries disease burden in kilimanjaro region was 0 77 0 20 whereas that of fluorosis was 0 62 0 24 in the three regions specific districts with a population under high dental caries risk include rombo moshi and mwanga in these districts the probability of accessing a safe source for drinking purposes is 0 06 0 11 and 0 30 in rombo moshi and mwanga respectively in terms of fluorosis disease burden the specific districts with a population under significant risk include siha and hai in kilimanjaro region arusha city arusha and meru in arusha region and simanjiro and hanang in the manyara region the probability of accessing safe water in these districts is 0 06 siha and hai 0 16 arusha city 0 17 hanang 0 20 arusha 0 23 simanjiro and 0 26 meru in these districts almost all members of the household have developed mild to severe fluorosis which is an increasing disease burden as observed visually during field campaigns in embaseni and lemanda villages in meru and arusha districts respectively the findings of this study are very important for the local water supply authorities in the studied regions not only for managing the existing groundwater sources in the naturally contaminated hydrogeological environments but also in the planning for new sources of safe water for drinking purposes to meet the national 2025 vision on the safe water supply to all citizens the findings are also crucial for the researchers to estimate the severity of dental caries and fluorosis using appropriate hazard indices among different age groups with emphasis on children
