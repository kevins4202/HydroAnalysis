5595,evapotranspiration et is the component of the hydrological cycle that accounts for most water consumption across the agricultural region of the heihe river basin in northwest china it is of great practical importance in the basin to allocate water resources for ensuring the security of food production and to formulate effective science based agro ecological management policies to address climate change impacts due to the probable effects of future changing environment on regional et in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat model were first driven by the downscaled climate data from three ipcc representative concentration pathways rcps that have been projected by five general circulation models gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and the water saving irrigation scenario to project et per unit area we then added to the model the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale that considered the ecological health to simulate the behaviour of total et for the period 2021 2050 finally 12 case study scenarios were used to separate the effects of climate change and human activity on total et the results showed that total et can be significantly decreased by 1 22 108 m3 when the rcp water saving irrigation scenarios were combined with the appropriate agricultural scale the results suggest that the best set of strategies to reduce agricultural water consumption is to reduce the area of arable land through consideration of ecosystem health and aggressively utilize water saving agricultural technology to counter the increased et brought about by future climate change in the heihe agricultural region keywords evapotranspiration swat model rcp scenarios appropriate agricultural scale water saving irrigation heihe agricultural region 1 introduction as an important driving force of ecosystem behaviour the hydrological cycle is vital to the sustainability of the earth system hurtt et al 1998 in the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration et links surface water to atmospheric water by transporting water vapor up into the atmosphere which is subsequently returned to the surface as precipitation cooling caused by surface water evapotranspiration balances ground warming through the absorption of solar radiation thereby maintaining the temperature of the earth ecosystem within a reasonable range rosen 1999 in terms of water quantity et is the second largest mechanism of water flow in the hydrological cycle second only to precipitation about 65 of land surface precipitation is eventually returned to the atmosphere through et and this proportion can be 90 in arid regions bonan 2002 given the importance of et in water and energy balance it is necessary to understand the hydrological cycle to accurately estimate et in order to have a measure of the availability of freshwater resources for sustainable water use lack of available water restricts agricultural production rational allocation and effective use of limited water resources are of paramount importance in maintaining the stability of agriculture and ensuring its future development water resource allocation is ultimately reflected in water consumption et consumes 90 of agricultural water rana and katerji 2000 so knowledge of et activity can provide theoretical and practical support for the efficient use of water in agriculture enable the rational allocation of water resources and guide the development of irrigation systems research into et is key to solving the current water crisis and ensuring sustainable agricultural production and food security as present and future circumstances change du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 continuing greenhouse gas emissions will affect all parts of the climate system leading to further global climate warming ipcc 2013 and significant changes in observed climate variables such as temperature and precipitation amorim borges et al 2014 okkan 2015 terink et al 2013 wang and chen 2014 the increase in average global surface temperature by the end of the twenty first century is expected to be 1 5 c under most climate change scenarios ipcc 2013 and change in precipitation due to global warming will vary from region to region ipcc 2014 agriculture is one of the water using sectors most sensitive to climate change and is experiencing significant effects due to current warming piao et al 2010 tao and zhang 2013 et has the greatest influence on agricultural water use of all factors and it has received a lot of attention in recent years as it varies in response to climate change cong et al 2011 used the single crop coefficient method in the a1b future climate scenario to estimate the crop et for the next 50 years in chinese agricultural regions they found that for corn and wheat et would increase by 5 30 and 2 60 in the period 2046 2065 over the period 1961 1990 zhou et al 2017 estimated the et of six major crops in the hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia china using the single crop coefficient method under future scenarios a2 and b2 and projected that et for six crops would increase by 3 4 7 3 in the period 2041 2070 in the b2 scenario and by 10 5 15 2 for the period 2071 2099 in the a2 scenario xu et al 2019a used the agro ecological zone aez model to model et for maize in the northeast farming region of china nfr under four rcp climate scenarios they projected that et would increase significantly across nfr by the 2050s compared to the baseline period 1981 2010 with the largest increase in the middle part of liaoning province and parts of western jilin province water management policies in agricultural regions are usually based on et data and projections kang et al 2017 and therefore it is vital to accurately project et in arid regions knowledge and understanding of the processes how et responds to climate change are still lacking in the arid agricultural region of northwest china due to the lack of long term observed data for regional et and therefore it is necessary to combine hydrological and climate models to project et over the long term et is greatly affected by land use or land cover as well as by climate change land use affects et on a regional scale mainly through vegetation change e g deforestation afforestation or grassland reclamation agricultural activity e g farmland reclamation crop planting and agricultural management and urbanization olchev et al 2008 used a regional process based soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat regio model to quantify the effects of deforestation and land use changes on et in a mountainous tropical rain forest area in the northern part of the lore lindu national park llnp in central sulawesi indonesia the model projected 15 deforestation an increase in agricultural use coffee plantations corn and rice fields increased grassland and expanded urban areas resulting in a relatively small decrease in monthly et of about 2 decreases in transpiration of about 6 and in interception evaporation of about 5 and an increase in soil evaporation of about 21 dias et al 2015 used an integrated model of land surface processes inland and a dynamic model of agro ecosystems agroibis to model the effects of land cover changes on et for small catchments in the upper xingu river basin mato grosso state brazil they found that projected mean annual et was 39 lower in agricultural ecosystems pasture and soybean cropland than in natural ecosystems tropical rainforest and cerrado li et al 2009b modelled the effects of land use change on et in an agricultural catchment on the loess plateau in china using a swat model and found that land use change increased et by 8 0 li et al 2017 used modis data to study how land use change affected et in china during the period 2001 2013 they concluded that the response of et to forest reduction was much greater than that to other land cover types a review of the literature cited shows that previous studies of the response of et to land use change focus on historical land use change and simulation of the effects of land use change by setting different hypothetical land use change scenarios few studies have considered the impact of ecological and agricultural scale from the perspective of water resource usage on the sustainable development of oases in arid areas in the process of land use regulation population growth and associated social and economic development have led to agricultural production consuming more and more water resulting in insufficient water being available for the natural oasis ecosystem and thus making it impossible for the ecosystem to support the sustainable development of the oasis cheng et al 2014 thus ecological health must be considered from the perspective of water resource management that takes into account the balance between ecology and agriculture in order to determine appropriate areas for ecological vegetation and agricultural acreage during oasis land use planning accurately projecting the response of et to changes in the scale of agriculture will provide better support for ensuring a healthy ecology and thus sustainable development of the oasis oasis agriculture is the mainstay of local social and economic development in the arid inland areas of northwest china agriculture accounts for 85 of total water use however water in this area is extremely scarce accounting for only 5 of china s total water resources development of water saving agricultural practices and improved water use efficiency are the only ways to resolve water use conflicts kang et al 2017 in recent years agricultural water use efficiency in northwest china has improved dramatically through the implementation of large scale water saving irrigation projects the reform of canal and field drainage projects and improvements in irrigation methods zou et al 2018 but these changes will also significantly affect the local hydrological cycle and thus water allocation and consumption for different land uses previous studies of the effects of water saving irrigation on et have mainly been at the field level bai et al 2015 li et al 2018 qin et al 2016 and research at a regional scale is scarce although studies have shown that water saving irrigation has a significant impact on et in northwest china there has been no quantitative characterization zou et al 2017 so it is necessary to comprehensively quantify the effects of water saving irrigation on regional et the heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china it spans 390 km from east to west and 510 km from north to south and covers a total area of 142 900 km2 the upper reach of the heihe river is in the south of the qilian mountains to the yingluoxia gorge which is the area where runoff is generated the middle reaches are the alluvial plains between the yingluoxia gorge and zhengyixia gorge and they are the major irrigated agricultural districts the downstream section of the basin is below the zhengyixia gorge and is mainly a natural desert oasis landscape water consumption in this basin is continually increasing and severe water shortages have become more frequent since the 1960s cheng et al 2014 the middle reaches of the heihe river contain 95 of the land cultivated in the whole basin cultivated land consumes 80 of the water resources of the main channel and produces nearly 90 of the total agricultural output of the heihe river basin by value xu et al 2019b the region is also important as a source of grain and vegetables and for seed production it produces 30 of the commodity grain and 60 of the commercial oil in gansu province each year nian et al 2014 and strongly influences the hydrological cycle of the entire basin et in the agricultural region is responsible for most of the water consumption in the basin as the climate warms and human activity increases quantifying the response of agricultural et to a changing environment is of great practical importance so that the region can effectively allocate water resources in the basin control agricultural irrigation sustain water resources for food production ensure food security develop effective agro ecological management strategies and address climate change with science thus the main objectives of this study are 1 to use the five gcms from the cmip5 to project future temperature and precipitation trends in the heihe agricultural region under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 to couple the swat model with the downscaled rcp climate data and water saving irrigation quota scenarios to project et per unit area and then include the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale scenarios that considered the ecological health to project total et for the period 2021 2050 using 12 case study scenarios to identify the separate effects of climate change and human activity on total et and 3 to propose effective agricultural water management strategies based on the et projections from the various model scenarios to manage water shortages in the heihe river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the agricultural region of the heihe river basin is mainly between 38 32 39 55 n and 99 01 100 46 e and includes ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county fig 1 the total area of the agricultural region is 9501 85 km2 and cultivated agricultural land occupied 2348 km2 in 2014 the average annual temperature of the agricultural region is 2 8 7 6 c and annual sunshine is 3000 4000 h the annual average precipitation is 129 6 mm 75 of which falls in june september and annual average potential evaporation is 1400 mm the main crops are corn and spring wheat agricultural production depends mainly on irrigation water from the heihe river and local groundwater the main channel of the heihe river is 820 km long with the annual runoff of 1 58 billion m3 groundwater is very deep 30 200 m in the upper southwest parts of the piedmont alluvial fan plain and comes closer to the surface in the lower fine soil plain area expansion of the arable area and increased groundwater exploitation have led to a significant decrease in groundwater levels since the 1990s with range of 4 92 to 11 49 m decline in the past 30 years mi et al 2016 in recent years groundwater depth often ranges from 3 m to 30 m in irrigated areas and the allowable amount of groundwater exploitation is about 0 643 billion m3 xu et al 2019b 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 hydro meteorological and geographical data the data used for swat model establishment and forecast are listed in table 1 meteorological data for eight national meteorological stations fig 1 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn data included daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation the river flow is greatly affected by human water use and river water consumption is mainly by et through crops grown in the basin so the et data were selected as the objectives for parameter estimation due to the lack of long term regional et time series data monthly remote sensing et values with a resolution of 1 km for the period 2000 2013 that were calculated by wu et al 2016 using the etwatch model were used for swat model calibration and validation the data were obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program http westdc westgis ac cn and were verified with the daily measured et of two ground eddy covariance ec observation stations in the heihe river basin fig 1 for the yingke oasis plain area underlying surface was corn the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9249 rmse was 0 5288 mm d and the difference between rmse and the mean absolute error mae was 40 of mae the index of agreement d was 0 978 which suggested there was a good match between the observed and projected values of etwatch wu et al 2016 and that the remote sensing et data were suitable for swat model parameter calibration and validation the geographic data used in this study were also obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program and include digital elevation model dem data that were extracted from the aster global dem soil data and land use data dem resolution was 30 m and the soil map and the land use map were both at a scale of 1 1 000 000 2 2 2 agricultural management data the swat model incorporated the following agricultural management practices for crops irrigation fertilization planting and harvesting according to previous swat model methods for setting agricultural management practices niu et al 2018 sun and ren 2013 zou et al 2017 we first determined the irrigation zone to which the sub basin belonged using the location of the center of the sub basin and then set the irrigation and fertilization scheduling for each sub basin to match those of the irrigation zone the required data were obtained from the china economic and social development statistics database http tongji cnki net kns55 index aspx the zhangye water conservancy yearbook the gansu development yearbook and the gansu rural yearbook the auto fertilization option was used to apply phosphorus fertilizer with no phosphorus stress 2 2 3 gcms and era 40 reanalysis data gcms are the primary tool for projecting future climate scenarios fowler et al 2007 monthly and daily meteorological data of 23 gcms were selected from cmip5 at the u k centre for environmental data analysis http www ceda ac uk the monthly data were used for the assessment of the adaptability of the gcm model over the period 1961 2000 and uniformly interpolated to a 2 2 spatial resolution the daily data were used for statistical downscaling to generate climate change scenarios for the baseline period 1976 2005 and the projection period 2021 2050 under three rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp2 6 is defined that the peak in radiative forcing increased to 3 w m2 before 2100 and then declines to 2 6 w m2 around 490 ppm co2 equiv by 2100 the definitions of the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are described as stabilization without an overshoot pathway to 4 5 w m2 around 650 ppm co2 equiv after 2100 and as a rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8 5 w m2 around 1370 ppm co2 equiv by 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 after the

physical processes in a basin based on the water balance equation and incorporates actual land management practices a detailed description of the swat model is given by arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2002 2005 2011 and gassman et al 2007 fig 2 shows the principal procedures of data processing model setup parameter estimation and model application when using swat we divided the heihe agricultural region into 31 sub basins and further subdivided the sub basins into 327 hydrological response units hrus combining 27 soil types and 23 land use types taking the hru as the basic unit hydrological components nutrients and sediment yield are modeled and aggregated for each sub basin and then routed to the basin outlet throughout the channel network in the swat model the calculation of et requires three components vegetation canopy interception soil evaporation and crop et each component is calculated from potential et and observed environmental factors the order of calculation is potential et canopy interception evaporation potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration values are then distributed to each soil layer actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration are calculated from the soil moisture content of each layer potential et was estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 meteorological data required for this model include temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed air resistance and canopy resistance are estimated according to the crop height and leaf area index potential soil evaporation is determined by potential et and soil coverage when the soil moisture content is less than field capacity soil evaporation is limited by soil moisture content and is exponentially related to soil thickness the calculation of actual crop transpiration is similar to that of soil evaporation and is exponentially related to crop root depth zou et al 2017 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis model calibration and validation the sub basin was used as the basic unit for parameter sensitivity analysis model calibration and model validation the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat sampling method was used for sensitivity analysis van griensven et al 2006 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 which forms part of swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 was used for optimizing the 10 most sensitive parameters as determined by the sensitivity analysis table 2 in sufi 2 all uncertainties parameter conceptual model input observed data are mapped onto the parameter ranges as the procedure tries to capture most of the measured data within a 95 projection uncertainty the overall uncertainty in the output is quantified by the 95 projection uncertainty 95ppu calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable obtained through latin hypercube sampling two indices are used to quantify the strength of the calibration uncertainty performance p factor which is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95ppu band and r factor which is the average width of the band divided by the standard deviation of the corresponding measured variable ideally we want to bracket most of the measured data plus their uncertainties within the 95ppu band p factor 1 while having the narrowest possible band r factor 0 abbaspour et al 2007 to compare the monthly remote sensing et with monthly et simulated by swat model a slightly modified version of the efficiency criterion ϕ was used krause et al 2005 1

coefficient of determination r2 relative bias rb root mean square error rmse and three other indices representing different indicator measures based on the sums of errors e el dr were also used to evaluate the performance of the swat model willmott et al 2015 2 ns 1 i 1 n e t o i e t s i 2 i 1 n e t o i e t o 2 3 r 2 i 1 n e t o i e t o e t s i e t s 2 i 1 n e t o i e t o 2 i 1 n e t s i e t s

value and n is the time series length detailed descriptions of the parameters selected sensitivity analysis the initial parameter values and the optimal parameter values are listed in table 2 we selected 14 of the 31 sub basins which collectively contained all land use and soil types in the region and combined them with the remote sensing et data then used them for parameter calibration the remaining 17 sub basins were selected for validation the calibration period was 2000 2009 and the validation period was 2010 2013 according to the previous calibration of the swat model on the same spatial scale the p factor was 0 5 for 50 of the calibrated sub basins and 41 2 of the validated sub basins the r factor was relatively small for both calibration and validation and its value was 1 0 the ns coefficient was 0 6 for 78 6 of the calibrated sub basins and 58 8 of the validated sub basins the value of ϕ was 0 7 for 71 4 of the calibrated sub basins and 52 9 of the validated sub basins the overall performance of the swat model was also good at the same spatial scale the ns and ϕ values were mostly 0 7 rmse was in the range 1 72 4 95 mm rb was in the range 0 08 to 0 02 and the indicators e el and dr were simultaneously close to 1 zou et al 2017 overall the indices show that the calibrated swat model reasonably well projected et in the region and therefore it is a reliable tool for modeling et in an agricultural area with a changing environment 2 3 3 climate change scenarios 1 gcm evaluation and selection the rank scoring method was used to assess the performance of the 23 gcms in projecting precipitation and temperature this method calculates the eigenvalues of the projected and measured values of the climate variables for each gcm model eleven eigenvalues are used mean coefficient of variation cv normalized root mean square error nrmse monthly distribution correlation coefficient rt spatial distribution correlation coefficient rs mann kendall test z statistic z trend magnitude β hamed 2008 the first two leading modes of each empirical orthogonal function eof1 and eof2 harvey and wigley 2003 mu et al 2004 the brier score bs and the significance score sscore in probability density functions brier 1950 taylor et al 2011 a rank score rs of 0 10 is assigned to each of the climate variables depending on its eigenvalues the formula is 9 r s i x max x i x max x min 10 where i is the model number xi is the relative error of the eigenvalue of the projected and measured values and xmin and xmax are the minimum and maximum values of the relative error as xi decreases rs increases it should be noted that the selection of climate variables and statistical criteria in the rank scoring method is of great importance for the final rs values compared with the impact of statistical criteria the effect of climate variables on rs is direct and much more significant thus sensitivity analyses of rs values for different climate variables were conducted to improve the assessment of gcm performance the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that precipitation had the most significant effect on rs guo 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 as shown in table s2 the rs values of five gcms were above 5 0 in terms of precipitation simulation implying good simulation effects therefore these top five gcms were used to project the future precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature in the heihe river basin 2 statistical downscaling model gcms do not provide reliable climate information for hydrological models at the basin scale due to their coarse spatial resolution allen and ingram 2002 busuioc et al 1999 as a result many methods have been used to obtain catchment scale meteorological variables from the output of gcms to create climate scenarios for watershed scale hydrological models ruelland et al 2012 the statistical downscaling model sdsm is a commonly used method ruelland et al 2012 it combines the weather generator with multiple linear regressions it is easy to implement and is widely used for downscaling in regional climate change research huang et al 2012 khan et al 2006 su et al 2016 wilby et al 2002 it offers the advantages of including no boundary conditions in the projection requiring little computation and being an easy to construct model fowler et al 2007 therefore sdsm was used to downscale future precipitation and temperature for the region details of the application were given in guo 2017 liu et al 2019 and wang et al 2019 the predictors atmospheric circulation factors or large scale forecast parameters were first screened using the daily observed meteorological data and era 40 reanalysis data sdsm then computed a statistical relationship between the predictands the climatic elements of the stations and selected predictors to determine the parameters of the multiple regression equation using the effective dual simplex method i e the model was calibrated the calibration period was 1961 1990 and the validation period was 1991 2000 the optimal statistical relationships between predictands and selected predictors were determined for each station by adjusting parameters according to the results of statistical downscaling at eight national meteorological stations table 3 the daily r2 and ns values for maximum temperature and minimum temperature at each station during the calibration and validation periods were mostly 0 9 rmse for the maximum temperature for most stations was 2 c and for minimum temperature was within 3 c daily r2 for the precipitation of all stations was 0 5 and daily ns for each station during calibration and validation periods were in the ranges 0 555 0 824 and 0 521 0 825 rmse for precipitation for each station was within 20 of the measured precipitation in summary the overall temperature and precipitation modeling by sdsm were acceptable after the model was parameterized future maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation data 2021 2050 for the scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 could be downscaled using the gcm scenario generator in order to effectively use future scenario data as a meteorological input for the swat model we used the historical measured data to correct future climate scenario data as follows hempel et al 2013 10 x x obs x rcp x base x base x obs where x is the corrected temperature and precipitation data for the future period xobs is the measured temperature and precipitation data for the reference period xrcp is the future temperature and precipitation data simulated by the gcm model and xbase is the temperature and precipitation data generated by the gcm model for the reference period 2 3 4 human activity scenarios 1 agricultural scale scenario fig 2 shows the indicators

calculated the appropriate agricultural scale by combining the water heat balance model with ecological health index ehi and effective vegetation coverage evc indicator evc was determined using the wasson and nanninga 1986 model which is a generalization of bagnold s transport equation to model relations among projected vegetation cover wind speed outside the area of vegetation and transport

calculated by eq 13 here it is 1 615 when evc is at the upper limit of 18 al is the lower limit of the appropriate agricultural scale and when evc is at the lower limit of 14 al is the upper limit of the appropriate agricultural scale we determined that the lower limit for an appropriate agricultural scale based on ecological health is 1894 km2 with the ecological scale being 567 km2 and the upper limit of the appropriate agricultural scale is 2020 km2 with the ecological scale being 441 km2 the area of cultivated land decreased by 454 km2 and 328 km2 from the lower and upper limits when compared with 2014 2 water saving irrigation scenario the irrigation systems in the study region are very complex in recent years various irrigation districts have initiated extensive canal lining and water conservancy projects and have developed water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation and water deficit irrigation wu et al 2015 agricultural water use efficiency has been significantly improved as a result to determine future irrigation quotas we first collected data for the yields and the irrigation quotas of grain crops in all irrigation districts from 1985 to 2014 and then we calculated the irrigation water productivity of each irrigation area and fitted an exponential curve with time as the independent variable water productivity in the whole study area is shown in fig s1 we projected irrigation water productivity for each irrigation area in the period 2021 2050 using the fitted model we developed and then projected the future irrigation quota for each irrigation district assuming that the current production level is maintained for the next 30 years detailed results are shown in fig s2 where the irrigation quota for the next 30 years is substantially reduced when compared to the historical period thus saving a significant quantity of water 2 3 5 simulation scenario settings to further distinguish the impacts of climate change and

the five gcms for the period 2021 2050 monthly maximum and minimum temperatures changed consistently in the various models for the three rcp scenarios and in most months the increase was 1 0 2 0 c specifically the maximum temperatures given by the five gcm models increased by 0 69 1 81 c rcp2 6 0 77 1 89 c rcp4 5 and 1 32 2 23 c rcp8 5 and the minimum temperatures increased by 0 98 1 67 c rcp2 6 0 89 1 93 c rcp4 5 and 1 23 2 21 c rcp8 5 the monthly increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures were ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 the greatest increases in maximum and minimum temperatures were in summer june august under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 and in autumn fall september november under rcp8 5 fig 3 also shows that most of the gcm models projected increasing monthly precipitation under the various climate scenarios the average difference for the three scenarios was 0 61 to 5 32 rcp2 6 1 03 6 68 rcp4 5 and 1 04 to 6 78 rcp8 5 the monthly precipitation values were also ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 increased precipitation was greatest in spring march may under all three scenarios 4 51 rcp2 6 5 41 rcp4 5 and 6 28 rcp8 5 table 4 shows that projected changes in the mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures in all three rcp scenarios increased over the 30 year period the increases in maximum temperature projected by the five gcms were 1 30 c rcp2 6 1 46 c rcp4 5 and 1 86 c rcp8 5 the projected increases in minimum temperature were 1 27 c rcp2 6 1 42 c rcp4 5 and 1 68 c rcp8 5 the increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures were ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 precipitation projected by the best performing model cnrm cm5 decreased for the different scenarios while the other models showed increasing precipitation however whether precipitation decreased or increased the range of change in precipitation was 10 and the projected precipitation ranges of the five gcms were 2 48 rcp2 6 2 82 rcp4 5 and 3 92 rcp8 5 similar to the trends in maximum and minimum temperatures the downscaling climate scenario indicated that the study area would show warm wet trends over the next 30 years 3 2 effects of climate change on total et under the assumptions of unchanged agricultural area and the same irrigation quota all the gcm models showed a consistent increase in total et except cnrm cm5 which showed decreased et for the three rcp scenarios during the period 2021 2050 fig 4 overall total et in the region will increase by 0 37 108 m3 rcp2 6 0 44 108 m3 rcp4 5 0 49 108 m3 rcp8 5 over the next 30 years the annual increases were ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 fig 5 table 5 which is consistent with the increases in temperature and precipitation for the area and shows that future climate change will increase total et over the region 3 3 total et response to human activity the amount of water consumed by the heihe agricultural ecosystem affects the ecological security of the entire basin it is necessary to control the amount of water used in agriculture to ensure the healthy and harmonious development of the basin but the expansion of the agricultural area has significantly increased the demand for water in the oasis in this study the main focus was on the need to balance water utilization between cultivated land and the natural ecology we developed an approach to finding the upper and lower limits of an appropriate agricultural scale that draws on water heat balance theory and wind sand dynamics theory with ecological health assessment and then explored the effects of changes in the agricultural area on total et fig 5 and table 5 show that total et projected using the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale decreased by 1 55 108 m3 2 14 108 m3 compared to the historical baseline period this is primarily because the determination of the appropriate area of cultivated land in the study area is affected by the development of a natural landscape and the area of agricultural land has been decreasing relative to the baseline period which has led to a reduction in agricultural water consumption the swat model irrigation quota input scenario using the water saving irrigation quota data fig s2 was developed to investigate the relationship between water saving irrigation and total et the results show that total et in the area decreased by 0 19 108 m3 in the water saving scenario and the water saving effect is significant total et decreased by 1 71 108 m3 and 2 29 108 m3 for the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale in the water saving irrigation scenarios fig 5 table 5 water saving irrigation leads to a more significant reduction of total et in the appropriate agricultural scale scenario and thus has a negative effect on et 3 4 combined effects of climate change and human activity on total et fig 5 and table 5 show that projected total et decreased during 2021 2050 at the upper limit of the appropriate agricultural scale for the various climate change scenarios total et decreased by 1 23 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 16 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 13 108 m3 compared to the baseline period projected total et at the lower limit of the agricultural scale decreased in the period 2021 2050 by 1 84 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 78 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 75 108 m3 rcp8 5 the magnitude of the reduction was ordered rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 this ordering is mainly due to the fact that each single climate change scenario increased total et i e increased et is ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 and the increase in total et caused by climate change offsets the reduction in total et caused by the reduction in the area of cultivated land resulting in an overall reduction in et two other coupled scenarios were used to investigate the combined effects of change in the agricultural area water saving irrigation and climate change on total et projected total et when the agricultural area was at the upper limit decreased over 2021 2050 in all climate change scenarios by 1 32 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 25 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 22 108 m3 rcp8 5 with water saving irrigation projected total et decreased in all climate change scenarios by1 92 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 86 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 83 108 m3 rcp8 5 at the lower limit of the appropriate agricultural area with water saving irrigation fig 5 table 5 this result reflects an increasing reduction of total et compared to the climate change agricultural scale scenario and the role of water saving irrigation in reducing water consumption is further confirmed this also indicates that it is a feasible plan for heihe agricultural area to reduce water consumption ease the conflict between agricultural water use and et and ensure the sustainable development of arid oasis agriculture and the eco environment by reducing the area of agricultural arable land with considering the ecological health and aggressively utilizing water saving agricultural technology to counter the expected increase in water consumption due to future climate change in this area 4 discussion 4 1 future climate change trends the downscaled climate change model scenarios suggest that the warm wet trend of climate will continue in the region during 2021 2050 which is similar to the findings of other studies e g sun et al 2015 wang and chen 2014 zhang et al 2016 the projected trends of temperature and precipitation are consistent with historical climate change observations in the heihe river basin and regional findings in northwest china during the past half century wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 climate change in northwest china may be caused by increased atmospheric water vapor and an enhanced hydrological cycle altered by global warming shi et al 2007 4 2 climate change and human activity effects the mechanisms by which climate change influences et are complex and nonlinear one such mechanism is that climate warming leads to an increased water vapor pressure deficit which results in an intensified atmospheric evaporation demand and increased rate of et walter et al 2004 in this study we found that increased temperature in the future will increase et compared to the baseline period the five gcms used to project temperatures in northwest china under three rcp scenarios showed that a higher temperature increase leads to a more significant increase in et which is consistent with the conclusion of zhang et al 2016 however et is also affected by soil moisture and precipitation increases soil moisture projected precipitation decreased in the cnrm cm5 model under different scenarios which shows that change in et is determined more by the change in precipitation than temperature the et response to temperature change is relatively weak so et projected by the cnrm cm5 model decreases in comparison with the other four gcms the agricultural area et is usually calculated using water balance and water heat balance guo et al 2016 lei et al 2014 ling et al 2013 without consideration of the eco environmental health of an arid oasis many previous studies of oases have determined a suitable oasis area after assuming that either the natural oasis area or the artificial oasis area does not change few literatures focused on the balance between cultivated land and ecological land from the perspective of water resources utilization this study defines the ecological health from water resource perspective by introducing an ecological health concept and ecological health index which is a more comprehensive approach to identify the appropriate oasis and agricultural scale and which can guide the sustainable management of regional water resources li 2008 found that for northwest china the expected value of the artificial oasis area as a percentage of the whole oasis area should be 85 01 i e the area of natural oasis should be 15 of the total oasis area the proportion of natural land calculated by two scenarios in this study was 23 04 and 17 92 which is consistent with li 2008 however the current area of natural oasis in the study region did not meet the requirements for local ecological protection given by our ecological health assessment so the future area of cultivated land is significantly reduced relative to the baseline when cultivated land area is determined taking ecological health into account and thus total et will be significantly reduced many current studies that assess the impact of irrigation regimes on hydrological characteristics such as et using the swat model are based on a variety of irrigation programs that have been optimized by various means or have had irrigation quotas arbitrarily changed panagopoulos et al 2014 sun and ren 2014 few studies have used water saving irrigation programs based on projections of irrigation water productivity a future irrigation water productivity model was created to project the water saving irrigation quota founded on the assumption that future grain production remains at the current level which has a strong basis in reality the model also provides a reference for future agricultural water resource management and utilization the projected water saving irrigation quota in this area was reduced from the present level by 177 mm fig s2 which greatly reduced soil evaporation resulting in a decrease in et per unit area and thus reducing total et wei et al 2018 4 3 uncertainties and limitations sources of uncertainty in model projections in the study include the ipcc emission scenarios the climate models used downscaling methods hydrological model composition and model parameters wilby and harris 2006 it is a challenge to identify which uncertainties dominate the hydrologic projections there is great uncertainty concerning future climate change the ipcc fifth assessment report identifies significant differences in possible future trends of atmospheric co2 concentrations solar radiation temperature and precipitation the imperfection of climate models is also a major cause of uncertainty in climate projection current climate models are consistent in projecting the future trends of some but not all climate variables and there are differences between the projections of various climate models fu et al 2013 in this study five optimal performance gcms were selected from 23 gcms using the rank scoring method and the time interval used for future climate change was 30 years although these choices reduced some uncertainties there were still errors through several decades of development statistical downscaling has become a relatively perfect field in climatology and is increasingly being used to predict future climate scenarios such as precipitation and temperature but there are still many areas that need further improvement first the applicable conditions and scope of sdsm need to be further studied in view of the fact that the simulation results of different sdsm for the same area often differ greatly chiew et al 2010 it is necessary to further compare the different sdsm results to find out the applicable conditions or scope second the temporal and spatial scale of the statistical relationship between atmospheric circulation factors and surface climate elements need to be given more attention sdsm is based on the assumption that the statistical relationship between the atmospheric circulation factors and surface climate elements is constant in the case of future changes in climatic conditions and how to re establish the statistical relationship between them is very important as time and space change finally statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling have their own advantages and disadvantages and the combination of these two methods will be one of the main development directions the inaccuracy of the hydrological model is also a major cause of uncertainty in this research but uncertainty from modeling land surface processes is much less than the uncertainty inherent in the climate model the hydrological model is influenced by its structure its parameters the accuracy of its simulation and the downscaling of the input data therefore errors in simulations are inevitable which increases the uncertainty of model projections in this study we evaluated only the effects of temperature and precipitation on et although it is influenced by other factors for example an expected increase in atmospheric co2 concentration will inevitably affect stomatal conductance and the leaf area index of plants which will have further effects on et and thus the hydrological cycle niu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 the next step in this program is to improve climate change scenarios by modifying the stomatal conductance equation to incorporate the effects of increased atmospheric co2 concentration and to include in the swat model the responses of leaf area index and plant height to increased atmospheric co2 in order to quantify the effect of co2 concentrations on et some indicators such as the spatial distribution of water resources are not included in the determination of appropriate agricultural area the method can be improved by incorporating ecological impact factors e g groundwater level distance from a river and developing a distributed oasis model we considered only the agricultural area and water saving irrigation in human activity scenarios but other influential human activities such as changing a crop variety changing the cultivation system plastic film mulching groundwater exploitation or similar agricultural practices are not considered how to take account of factors such as these requires a more comprehensive discussion there are some uncertainties in the results but it is particularly urgent and necessary to identify changing trends in total et for agricultural areas that are caused by global warming and increased human activity the results of this study provide for the development of strategies to cope with climate change and to develop effective water management practices the results also help us to better understand both the processes that constitute the hydrological cycle and water consumption in the heihe agricultural region to develop a healthier ecological environment and to provide scientific guidance for alleviating the increasingly conflicting demands of agricultural and environmentally sustainable water use 4 4 implications for policy makers agriculture in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin is typical oasis agriculture in the near future water consumption in the region will be significantly affected by both climate change and increasing human activity and agricultural water resource management must make several policy adjustments this study quantified the impact of future climate change agricultural land scale by considering ecological health and water saving irrigation scenarios on total et using 12 simulation cases we found that future climate change will increase total et thereby adversely affecting irrigated agriculture in the region and contributing to the degradation of the desert oasis transition zone thus policymakers need to take positive steps to address climate change we also conclude that total et will be significantly reduced if the area of agricultural land with considering the oasis ecological health is reduced and irrigation practices that reduce water use are adopted to counter increased water consumption due to climate change this conclusion implies that policymakers cannot simply increase the land area used for agriculture to serve economic interests it is necessary to consider the health of the environment when determining the extent of agricultural land area and to slightly reduce the area of existing agricultural land to reduce agricultural water consumption it is also necessary to further upgrade drainage canal linings in each irrigation district and to implement modern high efficiency water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation and water deficit irrigation to improve agricultural water use efficiency 5 conclusions this study was designed to increase understanding of how climate change and human activity will affect et by creating mathematical models that respond to climate change and human activity we constructed a distributed swat model for the heihe agricultural region combined it with remotely sensed et data products and coupled it to the downscaled climate data with three ipcc rcp scenarios which were projected by five gcms models in cmip5 and the optimal agricultural land area that took account of ecological health and water saving irrigation scenarios was also considered 12 model case studies were conducted to project et over the next 30 years in order to identify the major factors that influenced the changes in total et this research shows that the swat model after calibration can well simulate et processes for an agricultural area and can accurately project future et it shows that total et can be significantly reduced by 1 22 108 m3 if the health of the environment is taken into account to reduce the area of agricultural land and water saving irrigation is aggressively adopted under the unfavourable background of an increasing demand for water consumption due to warm wet trends over the next 30 years caused by climate change an effective management strategy is offered which

5595,evapotranspiration et is the component of the hydrological cycle that accounts for most water consumption across the agricultural region of the heihe river basin in northwest china it is of great practical importance in the basin to allocate water resources for ensuring the security of food production and to formulate effective science based agro ecological management policies to address climate change impacts due to the probable effects of future changing environment on regional et in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat model were first driven by the downscaled climate data from three ipcc representative concentration pathways rcps that have been projected by five general circulation models gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and the water saving irrigation scenario to project et per unit area we then added to the model the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale that considered the ecological health to simulate the behaviour of total et for the period 2021 2050 finally 12 case study scenarios were used to separate the effects of climate change and human activity on total et the results showed that total et can be significantly decreased by 1 22 108 m3 when the rcp water saving irrigation scenarios were combined with the appropriate agricultural scale the results suggest that the best set of strategies to reduce agricultural water consumption is to reduce the area of arable land through consideration of ecosystem health and aggressively utilize water saving agricultural technology to counter the increased et brought about by future climate change in the heihe agricultural region keywords evapotranspiration swat model rcp scenarios appropriate agricultural scale water saving irrigation heihe agricultural region 1 introduction as an important driving force of ecosystem behaviour the hydrological cycle is vital to the sustainability of the earth system hurtt et al 1998 in the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration et links surface water to atmospheric water by transporting water vapor up into the atmosphere which is subsequently returned to the surface as precipitation cooling caused by surface water evapotranspiration balances ground warming through the absorption of solar radiation thereby maintaining the temperature of the earth ecosystem within a reasonable range rosen 1999 in terms of water quantity et is the second largest mechanism of water flow in the hydrological cycle second only to precipitation about 65 of land surface precipitation is eventually returned to the atmosphere through et and this proportion can be 90 in arid regions bonan 2002 given the importance of et in water and energy balance it is necessary to understand the hydrological cycle to accurately estimate et in order to have a measure of the availability of freshwater resources for sustainable water use lack of available water restricts agricultural production rational allocation and effective use of limited water resources are of paramount importance in maintaining the stability of agriculture and ensuring its future development water resource allocation is ultimately reflected in water consumption et consumes 90 of agricultural water rana and katerji 2000 so knowledge of et activity can provide theoretical and practical support for the efficient use of water in agriculture enable the rational allocation of water resources and guide the development of irrigation systems research into et is key to solving the current water crisis and ensuring sustainable agricultural production and food security as present and future circumstances change du et al 2015 kang et al 2017 continuing greenhouse gas emissions will affect all parts of the climate system leading to further global climate warming ipcc 2013 and significant changes in observed climate variables such as temperature and precipitation amorim borges et al 2014 okkan 2015 terink et al 2013 wang and chen 2014 the increase in average global surface temperature by the end of the twenty first century is expected to be 1 5 c under most climate change scenarios ipcc 2013 and change in precipitation due to global warming will vary from region to region ipcc 2014 agriculture is one of the water using sectors most sensitive to climate change and is experiencing significant effects due to current warming piao et al 2010 tao and zhang 2013 et has the greatest influence on agricultural water use of all factors and it has received a lot of attention in recent years as it varies in response to climate change cong et al 2011 used the single crop coefficient method in the a1b future climate scenario to estimate the crop et for the next 50 years in chinese agricultural regions they found that for corn and wheat et would increase by 5 30 and 2 60 in the period 2046 2065 over the period 1961 1990 zhou et al 2017 estimated the et of six major crops in the hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia china using the single crop coefficient method under future scenarios a2 and b2 and projected that et for six crops would increase by 3 4 7 3 in the period 2041 2070 in the b2 scenario and by 10 5 15 2 for the period 2071 2099 in the a2 scenario xu et al 2019a used the agro ecological zone aez model to model et for maize in the northeast farming region of china nfr under four rcp climate scenarios they projected that et would increase significantly across nfr by the 2050s compared to the baseline period 1981 2010 with the largest increase in the middle part of liaoning province and parts of western jilin province water management policies in agricultural regions are usually based on et data and projections kang et al 2017 and therefore it is vital to accurately project et in arid regions knowledge and understanding of the processes how et responds to climate change are still lacking in the arid agricultural region of northwest china due to the lack of long term observed data for regional et and therefore it is necessary to combine hydrological and climate models to project et over the long term et is greatly affected by land use or land cover as well as by climate change land use affects et on a regional scale mainly through vegetation change e g deforestation afforestation or grassland reclamation agricultural activity e g farmland reclamation crop planting and agricultural management and urbanization olchev et al 2008 used a regional process based soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat regio model to quantify the effects of deforestation and land use changes on et in a mountainous tropical rain forest area in the northern part of the lore lindu national park llnp in central sulawesi indonesia the model projected 15 deforestation an increase in agricultural use coffee plantations corn and rice fields increased grassland and expanded urban areas resulting in a relatively small decrease in monthly et of about 2 decreases in transpiration of about 6 and in interception evaporation of about 5 and an increase in soil evaporation of about 21 dias et al 2015 used an integrated model of land surface processes inland and a dynamic model of agro ecosystems agroibis to model the effects of land cover changes on et for small catchments in the upper xingu river basin mato grosso state brazil they found that projected mean annual et was 39 lower in agricultural ecosystems pasture and soybean cropland than in natural ecosystems tropical rainforest and cerrado li et al 2009b modelled the effects of land use change on et in an agricultural catchment on the loess plateau in china using a swat model and found that land use change increased et by 8 0 li et al 2017 used modis data to study how land use change affected et in china during the period 2001 2013 they concluded that the response of et to forest reduction was much greater than that to other land cover types a review of the literature cited shows that previous studies of the response of et to land use change focus on historical land use change and simulation of the effects of land use change by setting different hypothetical land use change scenarios few studies have considered the impact of ecological and agricultural scale from the perspective of water resource usage on the sustainable development of oases in arid areas in the process of land use regulation population growth and associated social and economic development have led to agricultural production consuming more and more water resulting in insufficient water being available for the natural oasis ecosystem and thus making it impossible for the ecosystem to support the sustainable development of the oasis cheng et al 2014 thus ecological health must be considered from the perspective of water resource management that takes into account the balance between ecology and agriculture in order to determine appropriate areas for ecological vegetation and agricultural acreage during oasis land use planning accurately projecting the response of et to changes in the scale of agriculture will provide better support for ensuring a healthy ecology and thus sustainable development of the oasis oasis agriculture is the mainstay of local social and economic development in the arid inland areas of northwest china agriculture accounts for 85 of total water use however water in this area is extremely scarce accounting for only 5 of china s total water resources development of water saving agricultural practices and improved water use efficiency are the only ways to resolve water use conflicts kang et al 2017 in recent years agricultural water use efficiency in northwest china has improved dramatically through the implementation of large scale water saving irrigation projects the reform of canal and field drainage projects and improvements in irrigation methods zou et al 2018 but these changes will also significantly affect the local hydrological cycle and thus water allocation and consumption for different land uses previous studies of the effects of water saving irrigation on et have mainly been at the field level bai et al 2015 li et al 2018 qin et al 2016 and research at a regional scale is scarce although studies have shown that water saving irrigation has a significant impact on et in northwest china there has been no quantitative characterization zou et al 2017 so it is necessary to comprehensively quantify the effects of water saving irrigation on regional et the heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china it spans 390 km from east to west and 510 km from north to south and covers a total area of 142 900 km2 the upper reach of the heihe river is in the south of the qilian mountains to the yingluoxia gorge which is the area where runoff is generated the middle reaches are the alluvial plains between the yingluoxia gorge and zhengyixia gorge and they are the major irrigated agricultural districts the downstream section of the basin is below the zhengyixia gorge and is mainly a natural desert oasis landscape water consumption in this basin is continually increasing and severe water shortages have become more frequent since the 1960s cheng et al 2014 the middle reaches of the heihe river contain 95 of the land cultivated in the whole basin cultivated land consumes 80 of the water resources of the main channel and produces nearly 90 of the total agricultural output of the heihe river basin by value xu et al 2019b the region is also important as a source of grain and vegetables and for seed production it produces 30 of the commodity grain and 60 of the commercial oil in gansu province each year nian et al 2014 and strongly influences the hydrological cycle of the entire basin et in the agricultural region is responsible for most of the water consumption in the basin as the climate warms and human activity increases quantifying the response of agricultural et to a changing environment is of great practical importance so that the region can effectively allocate water resources in the basin control agricultural irrigation sustain water resources for food production ensure food security develop effective agro ecological management strategies and address climate change with science thus the main objectives of this study are 1 to use the five gcms from the cmip5 to project future temperature and precipitation trends in the heihe agricultural region under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 to couple the swat model with the downscaled rcp climate data and water saving irrigation quota scenarios to project et per unit area and then include the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale scenarios that considered the ecological health to project total et for the period 2021 2050 using 12 case study scenarios to identify the separate effects of climate change and human activity on total et and 3 to propose effective agricultural water management strategies based on the et projections from the various model scenarios to manage water shortages in the heihe river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the agricultural region of the heihe river basin is mainly between 38 32 39 55 n and 99 01 100 46 e and includes ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county fig 1 the total area of the agricultural region is 9501 85 km2 and cultivated agricultural land occupied 2348 km2 in 2014 the average annual temperature of the agricultural region is 2 8 7 6 c and annual sunshine is 3000 4000 h the annual average precipitation is 129 6 mm 75 of which falls in june september and annual average potential evaporation is 1400 mm the main crops are corn and spring wheat agricultural production depends mainly on irrigation water from the heihe river and local groundwater the main channel of the heihe river is 820 km long with the annual runoff of 1 58 billion m3 groundwater is very deep 30 200 m in the upper southwest parts of the piedmont alluvial fan plain and comes closer to the surface in the lower fine soil plain area expansion of the arable area and increased groundwater exploitation have led to a significant decrease in groundwater levels since the 1990s with range of 4 92 to 11 49 m decline in the past 30 years mi et al 2016 in recent years groundwater depth often ranges from 3 m to 30 m in irrigated areas and the allowable amount of groundwater exploitation is about 0 643 billion m3 xu et al 2019b 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 hydro meteorological and geographical data the data used for swat model establishment and forecast are listed in table 1 meteorological data for eight national meteorological stations fig 1 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn data included daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation the river flow is greatly affected by human water use and river water consumption is mainly by et through crops grown in the basin so the et data were selected as the objectives for parameter estimation due to the lack of long term regional et time series data monthly remote sensing et values with a resolution of 1 km for the period 2000 2013 that were calculated by wu et al 2016 using the etwatch model were used for swat model calibration and validation the data were obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program http westdc westgis ac cn and were verified with the daily measured et of two ground eddy covariance ec observation

and the mean absolute error mae was 40 of mae the index of agreement d was 0 978 which suggested there was a good match between the observed and projected values of etwatch wu et al 2016 and that the remote sensing et data were suitable for swat model parameter calibration and validation the geographic data used in this study were also obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program and include digital elevation model dem data that were extracted from the aster global dem soil data and land use data dem resolution was 30 m and the soil map and the land use map were both at a scale of 1 1 000 000 2 2 2 agricultural management data the swat model incorporated the following agricultural management practices for crops irrigation fertilization planting and harvesting according to previous swat model methods for setting agricultural management practices niu et al 2018 sun and ren 2013 zou et al 2017 we first determined the irrigation zone to which the sub basin belonged using the location of the center of the sub basin and then set the irrigation and fertilization scheduling for each sub basin to match those of the irrigation zone the required data were obtained from the china economic and social development statistics database http tongji cnki net kns55 index aspx the zhangye water conservancy yearbook the gansu development yearbook and the gansu rural yearbook the auto fertilization option was used to apply phosphorus fertilizer with no phosphorus stress 2 2 3 gcms and era 40 reanalysis data gcms are the primary tool for projecting future climate scenarios fowler et al 2007 monthly and daily meteorological data of 23 gcms were selected from cmip5 at the u k centre for environmental data analysis http www ceda ac uk the monthly data were used for the assessment of the adaptability of the gcm model over the period 1961 2000 and uniformly interpolated to a 2 2 spatial resolution the daily data were used for statistical downscaling to generate climate change scenarios for the baseline period 1976 2005 and the projection period 2021 2050 under three rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp2 6 is defined that the peak in radiative forcing increased to 3 w m2 before 2100 and then declines to 2 6 w m2 around 490 ppm co2 equiv by 2100 the definitions of the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are described as stabilization without an overshoot pathway to 4 5 w m2 around 650 ppm co2 equiv after 2100 and as a rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8 5 w m2 around 1370 ppm co2 equiv by 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 after the

physical processes in a basin based on the water balance equation and incorporates actual land management practices a detailed description of the swat model is given by arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2002 2005 2011 and gassman et al 2007 fig 2 shows the principal procedures of data processing model setup parameter estimation and model application when using swat we divided the heihe agricultural region into 31 sub basins and further subdivided the sub basins into 327 hydrological response units hrus combining 27 soil types and 23 land use types taking the hru as the basic unit hydrological components nutrients and sediment yield are modeled and aggregated for each sub basin and then routed to the basin outlet throughout the channel network in the swat model the calculation of et requires three components vegetation canopy interception soil evaporation and crop et each component is calculated from potential et and observed environmental factors the order of calculation is potential et canopy interception evaporation potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration values are then distributed to each soil layer actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration are calculated from the soil moisture content of each layer potential et was estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 meteorological data required for this model include temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed air resistance and canopy resistance are estimated according to the crop height and leaf area index potential soil evaporation is determined by potential et and soil coverage when the soil moisture content is less than field capacity soil evaporation is limited by soil moisture content and is exponentially related to soil thickness the calculation of actual crop transpiration is similar to that of soil evaporation and is exponentially related to crop root depth zou et al 2017 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis model calibration and validation the sub basin was used as the basic unit for parameter sensitivity analysis model calibration and model validation the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat sampling method was used for sensitivity analysis van griensven et al 2006 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 which forms part of swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 was used for optimizing the 10 most sensitive parameters as determined by the sensitivity analysis table 2 in sufi 2 all uncertainties parameter conceptual model input observed data are mapped onto the parameter ranges as the procedure tries to capture most of the measured data within a 95 projection uncertainty the overall uncertainty in the output is quantified by the 95 projection uncertainty 95ppu calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable obtained through latin hypercube sampling two indices are used to quantify the strength of the calibration uncertainty performance p factor which is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95ppu band and r factor which is the average width of the band divided by the standard deviation of the corresponding measured variable ideally we want to bracket most of the measured data plus their uncertainties within the 95ppu band p factor 1 while having the narrowest possible band r factor 0 abbaspour et al 2007 to compare the monthly remote sensing et with monthly et simulated by swat model a slightly modified version of the efficiency criterion ϕ was used krause et al 2005 1

coefficient of determination r2 relative bias rb root mean square error rmse and three other indices representing different indicator measures based on the sums of errors e el dr were also used to

value and n is the time series length detailed descriptions of the parameters selected sensitivity analysis the initial parameter values and the optimal parameter values are listed in table 2 we selected 14 of the 31 sub basins which collectively contained all land use and soil types in the region and combined them with the remote sensing et data then used them for parameter calibration the remaining 17 sub basins were selected for validation the calibration period was 2000 2009 and the validation period was 2010 2013 according to the previous calibration of the swat model on the same spatial scale the p factor was 0 5 for 50 of the calibrated sub basins and 41 2 of the validated sub basins the r factor was relatively small for both calibration and validation and its value was 1 0 the ns coefficient was 0 6 for 78 6 of the calibrated sub basins and 58 8 of the validated sub basins the value of ϕ was 0 7 for 71 4 of the calibrated sub basins and 52 9 of the validated sub basins the overall performance of the swat model was also good at the same spatial scale the ns and ϕ values were mostly 0 7 rmse was in the range 1 72 4 95 mm rb was in the range 0 08 to 0 02 and the indicators e el and dr were simultaneously close to 1 zou et al 2017 overall the indices show that the calibrated swat model reasonably well projected et in the region and therefore it is a reliable tool for modeling et in an agricultural area with a changing environment 2 3 3 climate change scenarios 1 gcm evaluation and selection the rank scoring method was used to assess the performance of the 23 gcms in projecting precipitation and temperature this method calculates the eigenvalues of the projected and measured values of the climate variables for each gcm model eleven eigenvalues are used mean coefficient of variation cv normalized root mean square error nrmse monthly distribution correlation coefficient rt spatial distribution correlation coefficient rs mann kendall test z statistic z trend magnitude β hamed 2008 the first two leading modes of each empirical orthogonal function eof1 and eof2 harvey and wigley 2003 mu et al 2004 the brier score bs and the significance score sscore in probability density functions brier 1950 taylor et al 2011 a rank score rs of 0 10 is assigned to each of the climate variables depending on its eigenvalues the formula is 9 r s i x max x i x max x min 10 where i is the model number xi is the relative error of the eigenvalue of the projected and measured values and xmin and xmax are the minimum and maximum values of the relative error as xi decreases rs increases it should be noted that the selection of climate variables and statistical criteria in the rank scoring method is of great importance for the final rs values compared with the impact of statistical criteria the effect of climate variables on rs is direct and much more significant thus sensitivity analyses of rs values for different climate variables were conducted to improve the assessment of gcm performance the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that precipitation had the most significant effect on rs guo 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 as shown in table s2 the rs values of five gcms were above 5 0 in terms of precipitation simulation implying good simulation effects therefore these top five gcms were used to project the future precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature in the heihe river basin 2 statistical downscaling model gcms do not provide reliable climate information for hydrological models at the basin scale due to their coarse spatial resolution allen and ingram 2002 busuioc et al 1999 as a result many methods have been used to obtain catchment scale meteorological variables from the output of gcms to create climate scenarios for watershed scale hydrological models ruelland et al 2012 the statistical downscaling model sdsm is a commonly used method ruelland et al 2012 it combines the weather generator with multiple linear regressions it is easy to implement and is widely used for downscaling in regional climate change research huang et al 2012 khan et al 2006 su et al 2016 wilby et al 2002 it offers the advantages of including no boundary conditions in the projection requiring little computation and being an easy to construct model fowler et al 2007 therefore sdsm was used to downscale future precipitation and temperature for the region details of the application were given in guo 2017 liu et al 2019 and wang et al 2019 the predictors atmospheric circulation factors or large scale forecast parameters were first screened using the daily observed meteorological data and era 40 reanalysis data sdsm then computed a statistical relationship between the predictands the climatic elements of the stations and selected predictors to determine the parameters of the multiple regression equation using the effective dual simplex method i e the model was calibrated the calibration period was 1961 1990 and the validation period was 1991 2000 the optimal statistical relationships between predictands and selected predictors were determined for each station by adjusting parameters according to the results of statistical downscaling at eight national meteorological stations table 3 the daily r2 and ns values for maximum temperature and minimum temperature at each station during the calibration and validation periods were mostly 0 9 rmse for the maximum temperature for most stations was 2 c and for minimum temperature was within 3 c daily r2 for the precipitation of all stations was 0 5 and daily ns for each station during calibration and validation periods were in the ranges 0 555 0 824 and 0 521 0 825 rmse for precipitation for each station was within 20 of the measured precipitation in summary the overall temperature and precipitation modeling by sdsm were acceptable after the model was parameterized future maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation data 2021 2050 for the scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 could be downscaled using the gcm scenario generator in order to effectively use future scenario data as a meteorological input for the swat model we used the historical measured data to correct future climate scenario data as follows hempel et al 2013 10 x x obs x rcp x base x base x obs where x is the corrected temperature and precipitation data for the future period xobs is the measured temperature and precipitation data for the reference period xrcp is the future temperature and precipitation data simulated by the gcm

the appropriate agricultural scale we determined that the lower limit for an appropriate agricultural scale based on ecological health is 1894 km2 with the ecological scale being 567 km2 and the upper limit of the appropriate agricultural scale is 2020 km2 with the ecological scale being 441 km2 the area of cultivated land decreased by 454 km2 and 328 km2 from the lower and upper limits when compared with 2014 2 water saving irrigation scenario the irrigation systems in the study region are very complex in recent years various irrigation districts have initiated extensive canal lining and water conservancy projects and have developed water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation and water deficit irrigation wu et al 2015 agricultural water use efficiency has been significantly improved as a result to determine future irrigation quotas we first collected data for the yields and the irrigation quotas of grain crops in all irrigation districts from 1985 to 2014 and then we calculated the irrigation water productivity of each irrigation area and fitted an exponential curve with time as the independent variable water productivity in the whole study area is shown in fig s1 we projected irrigation water productivity for each irrigation area in the period 2021 2050 using the fitted model we developed and then projected the future irrigation quota for each irrigation district assuming that the current production level is maintained for the next 30 years detailed results are shown in fig s2 where the irrigation quota for the next 30 years is substantially reduced when compared to the historical period thus saving a significant quantity of water 2 3 5 simulation scenario settings to further distinguish the impacts of climate change and

the five gcms for the period 2021 2050 monthly maximum and minimum temperatures changed consistently in the various models for the three rcp scenarios and in most months the increase was 1 0 2 0 c specifically the maximum temperatures given by the five gcm models increased by 0 69 1 81 c rcp2 6 0 77 1 89 c rcp4 5 and 1 32 2 23 c rcp8 5 and the minimum temperatures increased by 0 98 1 67 c rcp2 6 0 89 1 93 c rcp4 5 and 1 23 2 21 c rcp8 5 the monthly increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures were ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 the greatest increases in maximum and minimum temperatures were in summer june august under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 and in autumn fall september november under rcp8 5 fig 3 also shows that most of the gcm models projected increasing monthly precipitation under the various climate scenarios the average difference for the three scenarios was 0 61 to 5 32 rcp2 6 1 03 6 68 rcp4 5 and 1 04 to 6 78 rcp8 5 the monthly precipitation values were also ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 increased precipitation was greatest in spring march may under all three scenarios 4 51 rcp2 6 5 41 rcp4 5 and 6 28 rcp8 5 table 4 shows that projected changes in the mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures in all three rcp scenarios increased over the 30 year period the increases in maximum temperature projected by the five gcms were 1 30 c rcp2 6 1 46 c rcp4 5 and 1 86 c rcp8 5 the projected increases in minimum temperature were 1 27 c rcp2 6 1 42 c rcp4 5 and 1 68 c rcp8 5 the increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures were ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 precipitation projected by the best performing model cnrm cm5 decreased for the different scenarios while the other models showed increasing precipitation however whether precipitation decreased or increased the range of change in precipitation was 10 and the projected precipitation ranges of the five gcms were 2 48 rcp2 6 2 82 rcp4 5 and 3 92 rcp8 5 similar to the trends in maximum and minimum temperatures the downscaling climate scenario indicated that the study area would show warm wet trends over the next 30 years 3 2 effects of climate change on total et under the assumptions of unchanged agricultural area and the same irrigation quota all the gcm models showed a consistent increase in total et except cnrm cm5 which showed decreased et for the three rcp scenarios during the period 2021 2050 fig 4 overall total et in the region will increase by 0 37 108 m3 rcp2 6 0 44 108 m3 rcp4 5 0 49 108 m3 rcp8 5 over the next 30 years the annual increases were ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 fig 5 table 5 which is consistent with the increases in temperature and precipitation for the area and shows that future climate change will increase total et over the region 3 3 total et response to human activity the amount of water consumed by the heihe agricultural ecosystem affects the ecological security of the entire basin it is necessary to control the amount of water used in agriculture to ensure the healthy and harmonious development of the basin but the expansion of the agricultural area has significantly increased the demand for water in the oasis in this study the main focus was on the need to balance water utilization between cultivated land and the natural ecology we developed an approach to finding the upper and lower limits of an appropriate agricultural scale that draws on water heat balance theory and wind sand dynamics theory with ecological health assessment and then explored the effects of changes in the agricultural area on total et fig 5 and table 5 show that total et projected using the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale decreased by 1 55 108 m3 2 14 108 m3 compared to the historical baseline period this is primarily because the determination of the appropriate area of cultivated land in the study area is affected by the development of a natural landscape and the area of agricultural land has been decreasing relative to the baseline period which has led to a reduction in agricultural water consumption the swat model irrigation quota input scenario using the water saving irrigation quota data fig s2 was developed to investigate the relationship between water saving irrigation and total et the results show that total et in the area decreased by 0 19 108 m3 in the water saving scenario and the water saving effect is significant total et decreased by 1 71 108 m3 and 2 29 108 m3 for the upper and lower limits of the appropriate agricultural scale in the water saving irrigation scenarios fig 5 table 5 water saving irrigation leads to a more significant reduction of total et in the appropriate agricultural scale scenario and thus has a negative effect on et 3 4 combined effects of climate change and human activity on total et fig 5 and table 5 show that projected total et decreased during 2021 2050 at the upper limit of the appropriate agricultural scale for the various climate change scenarios total et decreased by 1 23 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 16 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 13 108 m3 compared to the baseline period projected total et at the lower limit of the agricultural scale decreased in the period 2021 2050 by 1 84 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 78 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 75 108 m3 rcp8 5 the magnitude of the reduction was ordered rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 this ordering is mainly due to the fact that each single climate change scenario increased total et i e increased et is ordered rcp8 5 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 and the increase in total et caused by climate change offsets the reduction in total et caused by the reduction in the area of cultivated land resulting in an overall reduction in et two other coupled scenarios were used to investigate the combined effects of change in the agricultural area water saving irrigation and climate change on total et projected total et when the agricultural area was at the upper limit decreased over 2021 2050 in all climate change scenarios by 1 32 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 25 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 22 108 m3 rcp8 5 with water saving irrigation projected total et decreased in all climate change scenarios by1 92 108 m3 rcp2 6 1 86 108 m3 rcp4 5 and 1 83 108 m3 rcp8 5 at the lower limit of the appropriate agricultural area with water saving irrigation fig 5 table 5 this result reflects an increasing reduction of total et compared to the climate change agricultural scale scenario and the role of water saving irrigation in reducing water consumption is further confirmed this also indicates that it is a feasible plan for heihe agricultural area to reduce water consumption ease the conflict between agricultural water use and et and ensure the sustainable development of arid oasis agriculture and the eco environment by reducing the area of agricultural arable land with considering the ecological health and aggressively utilizing water saving agricultural technology to counter the expected increase in water consumption due to future climate change in this area 4 discussion 4 1 future climate change trends the downscaled climate change model scenarios suggest that the warm wet trend of climate will continue in the region during 2021 2050 which is similar to the findings of other studies e g sun et al 2015 wang and chen 2014 zhang et al 2016 the projected trends of temperature and precipitation are consistent with historical climate change observations in the heihe river basin and regional findings in northwest china during the past half century wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 climate change in northwest china may be caused by increased atmospheric water vapor and an enhanced hydrological cycle altered by global warming shi et al 2007 4 2 climate change and human activity effects the mechanisms by which climate change influences et are complex and nonlinear one such mechanism is that climate warming leads to an increased water vapor pressure deficit which results in an intensified atmospheric evaporation demand and increased rate of et walter et al 2004 in this study we found that increased temperature in the future will increase et compared to the baseline period the five gcms used to project temperatures in northwest china under three rcp scenarios showed that a higher temperature increase leads to a more significant increase in et which is consistent with the conclusion of zhang et al 2016 however et is also affected by soil moisture and precipitation increases soil moisture projected precipitation decreased in the cnrm cm5 model under different scenarios which shows that change in et is determined more by the change in precipitation than temperature the et response to temperature change is relatively weak so et projected by the cnrm cm5 model decreases in comparison with the other four gcms the agricultural area et is usually calculated using water balance and water heat balance guo et al 2016 lei et al 2014 ling et al 2013 without consideration of the eco environmental health of an arid oasis many previous studies of oases have determined a suitable oasis area after assuming that either the natural oasis area or the artificial oasis area does not change few literatures focused on the balance between cultivated land and ecological land from the perspective of water resources utilization this study defines the ecological health from water resource perspective by introducing an ecological health concept and ecological health index which is a more comprehensive approach to identify the appropriate oasis and agricultural scale and which can guide the sustainable management of regional water resources li 2008 found that for northwest china the expected value of the artificial oasis area as a percentage of the whole oasis area should be 85 01 i e the area of natural oasis should be 15 of the total oasis area the proportion of natural land calculated by two scenarios in this study was 23 04 and 17 92 which is consistent with li 2008 however the current area of natural oasis in the study region did not meet the requirements for local ecological protection given by our ecological health assessment so the future area of cultivated land is significantly reduced relative to the baseline when cultivated land area is determined taking ecological health into account and thus total et will be significantly reduced many current studies that assess the impact of irrigation regimes on hydrological characteristics such as et using the swat model are based on a variety of irrigation programs that have been optimized by various means or have had irrigation quotas arbitrarily changed panagopoulos et al 2014 sun and ren 2014 few studies have used water saving irrigation programs based on projections of irrigation water productivity a future irrigation water productivity model was created to project the water saving irrigation quota founded on the assumption that future grain production remains at the current level which has a strong basis in reality the model also provides a reference for future agricultural water resource management and utilization the projected water saving irrigation quota in this area was reduced from the present level by 177 mm fig s2 which greatly reduced soil evaporation resulting in a decrease in et per unit area and thus reducing total et wei et al 2018 4 3 uncertainties and limitations sources of uncertainty in model projections in the study include the ipcc emission scenarios the climate models used downscaling methods hydrological model composition and model parameters wilby and harris 2006 it is a challenge to identify which uncertainties dominate the hydrologic projections there is great uncertainty concerning future climate change the ipcc fifth assessment report identifies significant differences in possible future trends of atmospheric co2 concentrations solar radiation temperature and precipitation the imperfection of climate models is also a major cause of uncertainty in climate projection current climate models are consistent in projecting the future trends of some but not all climate variables and there are differences between the projections of various climate models fu et al 2013 in this study five optimal performance gcms were selected from 23 gcms using the rank scoring method and the time interval used for future climate change was 30 years although these choices reduced some uncertainties there were still errors through several decades of development statistical downscaling has become a relatively perfect field in climatology and is increasingly being used to predict future climate scenarios such as precipitation and temperature but there are still many areas that need further improvement first the applicable conditions and scope of sdsm need to be further studied in view of the fact that the simulation results of different sdsm for the same area often differ greatly chiew et al 2010 it is necessary to further compare the different sdsm results to find out the applicable conditions or scope second the temporal and spatial scale of the statistical relationship between atmospheric circulation factors and surface climate elements need to be given more attention sdsm is based on the assumption that the statistical relationship between the atmospheric circulation factors and surface climate elements is constant in the case of future changes in climatic conditions and how to re establish the statistical relationship between them is very important as time and space change finally statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling have their own advantages and disadvantages and the combination of these two methods will be one of the main development directions the inaccuracy of the hydrological model is also a major cause of uncertainty in this research but uncertainty from modeling land surface processes is much less than the uncertainty inherent in the climate model the hydrological model is influenced by its structure its parameters the accuracy of its simulation and the downscaling of the input data therefore errors in simulations are inevitable which increases the uncertainty of model projections in this study we evaluated only the effects of temperature and precipitation on et although it is influenced by other factors for example an expected increase in atmospheric co2 concentration will inevitably affect stomatal conductance and the leaf area index of plants which will have further effects on et and thus the hydrological cycle niu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2012 the next step in this program is to improve climate change scenarios by modifying the stomatal conductance equation to incorporate the effects of increased atmospheric co2 concentration and to include in the swat model the responses of leaf area index and plant height to increased atmospheric co2 in order to quantify the effect of co2 concentrations on et some indicators such as the spatial distribution of water resources are not included in the determination of appropriate agricultural area the method can be improved by incorporating ecological impact factors e g groundwater level distance from a river and developing a distributed oasis model we considered only the agricultural area and water saving irrigation in human activity scenarios but other influential human activities such as changing a crop variety changing the cultivation system plastic film mulching groundwater exploitation or similar agricultural practices are not considered how to take account of factors such as these requires a more comprehensive discussion there are some uncertainties in the results but it is particularly urgent and necessary to identify changing trends in total et for agricultural areas that are caused by global warming and increased human activity the results of this study provide for the development of strategies to cope with climate change and to develop effective water management practices the results also help us to better understand both the processes that constitute the hydrological cycle and water consumption in the heihe agricultural region to develop a healthier ecological environment and to provide scientific guidance for alleviating the increasingly conflicting demands of agricultural and environmentally sustainable water use 4 4 implications for policy makers agriculture in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin is typical oasis agriculture in the near future water consumption in the region will be significantly affected by both climate change and increasing human activity and agricultural water resource management must make several policy adjustments this study quantified the impact of future climate change agricultural land scale by considering ecological health and water saving irrigation scenarios on total et using 12 simulation cases we found that future climate change will increase total et thereby adversely affecting irrigated agriculture in the region and contributing to the degradation of the desert oasis transition zone thus policymakers need to take positive steps to address climate change we also conclude that total et will be significantly reduced if the area of agricultural land with considering the oasis ecological health is reduced and irrigation practices that reduce water use are adopted to counter increased water consumption due to climate change this conclusion implies that policymakers cannot simply increase the land area used for agriculture to serve economic interests it is necessary to consider the health of the environment when determining the extent of agricultural land area and to slightly reduce the area of existing agricultural land to reduce agricultural water consumption it is also necessary to further upgrade drainage canal linings in each irrigation district and to implement modern high efficiency water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation and water deficit irrigation to improve agricultural water use efficiency 5 conclusions this study was designed to increase understanding of how climate change and human activity will affect et by creating mathematical models that respond to climate change and human activity we constructed a distributed swat model for the heihe agricultural region combined it with remotely sensed et data products and coupled it to the downscaled climate data with three ipcc rcp scenarios which were projected by five gcms models in cmip5 and the optimal agricultural land area that took account of ecological health and water saving irrigation scenarios was also considered 12 model case studies were conducted to project et over the next 30 years in order to identify the major factors that influenced the changes in total et this research shows that the swat model after calibration can well simulate et processes for an agricultural area and can accurately project future et it shows that total et can be significantly reduced by 1 22 108 m3 if the health of the environment is taken into account to reduce the area of agricultural land and water saving irrigation is aggressively adopted under the unfavourable background of an increasing demand for water consumption due to warm wet trends over the next 30 years caused by climate change an effective management strategy is offered which policymakers can adopt to ease the demand for agricultural water and ensure the sustainable development of oasis agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

5596,this study considers the flow of water in ice covered compound channels with straight trapezoidal cross sections for describing the lateral distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity in aforementioned channels a modified analytical model which incorporates the influences of channel bed friction ice cover resistance lateral shear turbulence and secondary currents is derived by the shiono and knight method and a two layer hypothesis then the analytical model is applied to straight compound channels with full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice the modeled results of the two cases which employ appropriate boundary conditions indicate good predictions for the transverse distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity when compared with captured experimental results subsequently the intensities and rotational directions of secondary flows and the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity effect are exhaustively discussed finding that the intensities of secondary flows in the main channel domain for the two cases present opposite changing laws as flow depth increases and the signs of secondary flow coefficients are verified to be consistent with experimental

giving rise to the formation of ice cover over a river compared with open rivers ice covered rivers during the freeze up possess a differentiated set of geomorphological conditions morse and hicks 2005 and the hydraulic characteristics are greatly altered lau and krishnappan 1981 zare et al 2016 most notably the roughness difference between ice cover underside and river bed results in an asymmetric channel flow under the ice cover chen et al 2016 tsai and ettema 1994 where two vertically superimposed helical secondary current cells rather than one exist lotsari et al 2019 thus the velocity distribution is changed by the ice cover and even sediment transportation and river bed evolution are influenced in engineering practice the presence of ice cover can induce a series of problems for river management in winter for instance the adjustment of upstream discharge water quality monitoring in downstream rivers and control of water supply ettema 2002 therefore studying flow characteristics of ice covered rivers such as flow velocities discharges and secondary flows is of great necessity prediction of depth averaged streamwise velocity for natural rivers is the foundation of researching sediment movement and river channel evolution bonakdari 2012 and the total discharge for a given water level can be obtained by the lateral integration of depth averaged streamwise velocity over the cross section area for ice covered channel flows previous researchers mainly concentrated on turbulence coherent structures demers et al 2013 robert and tran 2012 prediction of stage discharge chen et al 2018 composite roughness smith and ettema 1997 li 2012 and impacts of ice cover on sediment transport muste et al 2000 turcotte et al 2011 even if several studies based on a two layer hypothesis have been performed on the lateral distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity their research objectives were ice covered rectangular channel flows rather than ice covered compound channel flows zhong et al 2019 significantly for ice covered compound channel flows the prominent hydraulic features are the asymmetric flow under the ice cover the lateral exchange of momentum taking place in the shear layer and secondary flow structure the asymmetric flow presenting in the ice covered channel differs from that of open channel covered with suspended vegetation the distribution of ice cover is continuous whereas the distribution of floating vegetation with developed or under developed roots is discontinuous downing kunz and stacey 2012 liu et al 2017 zhang and nepf 2011 causing the differences of momentum exchange and secondary flow structure in modeling a fully developed asymmetric flow a two layer approach where flow above and under the plane of maximum streamwise velocity is separately described is usually adopted larsen 1973 teal et al 1994 asymmetric flows in the so called two layers can be deemed as two pseudo free surface flows sukhodolov et al 1999 uzuner 1975 thus for a fully developed steady uniform turbulent flow in an ice covered compound channel the streamwise velocity and shear stress in each layer follow the logarithmic and linear distributions respectively although a slight deviation exists between the locations of the zero shear stress and maximum streamwise velocity prior researches indicated that the two locations can be regarded as consistent knack and shen 2015 sayre and song 1979 in addition note that the two vertically superimposed helical secondary current cells under the ice cover can exacerbate the momentum exchange and hence affect flow velocity shear stress and even bank stability lotsari et al 2019 hence in modeling of ice covered compound channel flows introducing the two layer hypothesis and secondary flow effect into the prediction of transverse variation of depth averaged streamwise velocity are pivotal and significant problems of complex flows such as ice covered compound channel flows can be addressed by sophisticated numerical modeling methods namely direct numerical simulation lee and moser 2015 sahu and govindarajan 2016 reynolds averaged navier stokes equations including the standard k ε model the k ω turbulent model and reynolds stress model tan et al 1999 vallet 2007 wang et al 2009 yoon et al 1996 and large eddy simulation skyllingstad and denbo 2001 however considering that the planform vorticity is a key feature for overbank flow in an ice covered compound channel these turbulence numerical models even the advanced reynolds stress model cannot reproduce the planform vorticity because it is determined by the nature of reynolds averaged navier stokes equations knight et al 2007 furthermore these sophisticated numerical models need a mass of empirical parameters and lots of computational efforts that make them not very applicable to engineering design purposes thus an alternative methodology based on analytical model methods needs to be proposed for predicting the transverse distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity in ice covered compound channels motivated by the above discussions a predictive analytical model is proposed for the lateral distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity in straight trapezoidal compound channels with ice cover by means of the shiono and knight method skm shiono and knight 1991 and secondary flow theory put forward by ervine et al 2000 first utilizing the two layer hypothesis the channel cross section is divided into the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer the additional resistance created by the ice cover is included in the reynolds stress and directly reflected in the darcy weisbach comprehensive friction factor thus the analytical solution of depth averaged streamwise velocity is acquired second the modeled results are verified against experimental results under two flow conditions namely the full ice cover and the symmetrical shore ice finally on the basis of experimental and analytical results the intensity and rotation direction of secondary currents are exhaustively discussed 2 theoretical background fig 1 shows the hydraulic parameters of an ice covered compound channel with straight trapezoidal cross section for predicting the lateral variation of depth averaged streamwise velocity in the channel with steady uniform flow field the depth averaged streamwise momentum equation containing the additional ice cover resistance needs to be derived first combining the continuity equation with the navier stokes momentum equation in longitudinal streamwise direction the governing equation is given as shiono and knight 1991 1 ρ u v y u w z ρ g s 0 τ yx y τ zx z where x y and z denote streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively ρ is the fluid density u v and w are respectively temporal average velocity components in the x y and z directions s 0 denotes the channel bed slope g is the gravitational acceleration τ yx and τ zx are respectively the reynolds shear stresses with respect to the vertical and horizontal planes and τ yx ρ u v τ zx ρ u w u v and w respectively denote fluctuating velocities in the x y and z directions for ice covered compound channels the presence of ice cover can increase the wetted perimeter enlarge water flow resistance and decrease discharge capacity peters et al 2017 hence under the common action of bed friction and ice cover resistance the flow structure is altered as presented in fig 2 a tsai and ettema 1994 the longitudinal profile based on einstein s resistance separation theory einstein 1942 can be divided into two layers namely the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer fig 2 a illustrates that although the vertical variation of streamwise velocity u is differentiated from that of open channels it follows the logarithmic distribution within each layer which is supported by the measured results of the full ice cover case presented in fig 2 b specifically streamwise velocity u has a minimum value i e zero value at ice cover underside and channel bed and reaches its maximum value u max at the interface between two layers it is not difficult to find that the vertical distribution of u in ice covered compound channels is similar to that of the pipe turbulent flow due to the roughness difference between ice cover underside and river bed there exist two regions where shear stresses have opposite signs as presented in fig 2 a shear stress τ zx linearly varies in the vertical direction for the two layers and reaches the maximum values namely χ i τ i and χ b τ b at ice cover underside and channel bed therefore reynolds shear stress τ zx can be expressed as tsai and ettema 1994 2 τ zx χ b τ b χ b τ b χ i τ i z h f o r 0 z h where χ b and χ i are respectively the dimensionless wetted perimeters of river bed per unit width and ice cover per unit width τ b and τ i are respectively the boundary shear stresses at river bed and ice cover underside and h is the total flow depth of cross section to obtain the depth averaged form of eq 1 eq 1 is integrated over flow depth h here the immersed depth of ice cover in water is ignored and provided w 0 w h 0 thus the depth averaged form of eq 1 can be obtained as 3 ρ h uv d y ρ g h s 0 h τ yx y χ d τ d where uv d 1 h 0 h uv d z τ yx is the depth averaged transverse reynolds shear stress and τ yx 1 h 0 h ρ u v d z χ d is the dimensionless comprehensive wetted perimeter per unit width and χ d χ b χ i τ d is the comprehensive boundary shear stress and τ d χ b τ b χ i τ i χ d in view of the pervasive application of the eddy viscosity approach to the numerical modeling the approach can be utilized to express τ yx as shiono and knight 1991 4 τ yx ρ ε yx u d y where u d is the depth averaged streamwise velocity and u d 1 h 0 h u d z ε yx is the depth averaged eddy viscosity and ε yx λ d h u λ d is the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity u is the local shear velocity and u τ d ρ f d 8 u d f d is the darcy weisbach comprehensive friction factor thus the comprehensive boundary shear stress τ d can be expressed as 5 τ d ρ f d 8 u d 2 with regard to the secondary flow term ρ h uv d y related researches are few and far between and only few experimental data are available in the experiment we simply catch the rotation directions of secondary current cells which will be specifically introduced in the latter section in view of this the related theories of ervine et al 2000 are adopted here ervine et al 2000 assumed u k 1 u d and v k 2 u d thus uv d k 1 k 2 u d 2 k u d 2 hence the secondary flow term can be expressed as 6 ρ h uv d y ρ h k u d 2 y where k is the secondary flow coefficient varying with the roughness and geometry of the channel boundary thus substituting eqs 4 6 into eq 3 the depth averaged form of eq 1 can be rewritten as 7 ρ g h s 0 ρ f d 8 χ d u d 2 y ρ λ d h 2 f d 8 u d u d y ρ h k u d 2 y for the trapezoidal ice covered compound channels whose geometric characteristics are illustrated in fig 1 the analytical solution to eq 7 can be derived as follows 1 for regions with a constant flow depth namely region 1 and region 3 in fig 1 u d can be expressed as 8 u d c 1 e r 1 y c 2 e r 2 y ω 1 2 where r 1 1 λ d h 8 f d 1 2 k k 2 2 λ d χ d f d 8 3 2 r 2 2 k λ d h 8 f d 1 2 r 1 ω 8 g h s 0 f d χ d c 1 and c 2 are unknown constants 2 for regions with a linear side slope 1 s namely region 2 and region 4 in fig 1 u d can be expressed as 9 u d c 3 ξ α 1 c 4 ξ α 2 a ξ 1 2 where α 1 l m m l 2 4 n l 2 l α 2 l m m l 2 4 n l 2 l a g s 0 λ

in region 2 and ξ h h y b s 4 in region 4 3 boundary conditions for analytical solutions this study focuses on the flow structures of two working conditions namely the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice that are distributed above floodplain areas based on the flow depth i e the constant flow depth or laterally linear varying flow depth and the distribution of ice cover the cross section of the compound channels with full ice cover or with symmetrical shore ice can be divided into four regions as presented in fig 1 to acquire the corresponding analytical solutions to u d unknown constants c 1 c 4 that appear in eqs 8 and 9 need to be solved by utilizing appropriate boundary conditions knight et al 2004 indicated that the continuity of u d y is inapplicable when λ d and f d are different at two adjacent regions thus the suitable boundary condition which is the continuity of unit force h τ yx is proposed to replace the continuity of u d y for the continuous flow depth domain the continuity of h τ yx is equivalent to that of μ u d y where μ is an intermediate parameter and μ λ d f d hence for trapezoidal ice covered compound channels with continuous flow depth the continuity of μ u d y is employed here the boundary conditions employed in this study are listed as follows 1 the no slip condition namely u d 0 at the remote boundary of the channel 2 considering the symmetry of u d its velocity gradient located at the centerline of main channel ought to be zero namely u d y 0 for y 0 3 the continuity of u d at the interface of adjacent domains namely u d i u d i 1 4 the continuity of μ u d y at the interface of adjacent domains namely μ u d y i μ u d y i 1 with μ λ d f d 4 application principle and calibration coefficients the principle of utilizing eqs 8 and 9 to model the transverse distribution of u d is based on the subdivision of the channel cross section into various subdomains and employment of appropriate secondary flow coefficients for the respective subdomains for symmetrical ice covered compound channels only half of the cross section needs to be investigated and the cross section is often split into four subdomains with different flow depths here three physical parameters of each subdomain namely darcy weisbach comprehensive friction factor f d dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λ d and secondary flow coefficient k need to be ascertained and presented as follows 4 1 comprehensive friction factor fd to derive the computational formulation of comprehensive friction factor f d the relationship among river bed boundary shear stress τ b ice covered boundary shear stress τ i and comprehensive boundary shear stress τ d is mainly utilized that is τ d χ b τ b χ i τ i χ d considering that τ b ρ f b 8 u b 2 τ i ρ f i 8 u i 2 and τ d ρ f d 8 u d 2 one has 10 χ d f d u d 2 χ b f b u b 2 χ i f i u i 2 where f b is the darcy weisbach friction factor of river bed u b is the depth averaged streamwise velocity of the lower bed layer f i is the darcy weisbach friction factor of ice cover and u i is the depth averaged streamwise velocity of the upper ice layer according to einstein s hypothesis the depth averaged streamwise velocities of the lower bed and upper ice layers are approximately equal to that of the cross section namely u b u i u d in this study measured results of ub ui and ud confirmed the effectiveness of einstein s hypothesis as shown in fig 3 thus eq 10 can be transformed into 11 f d χ b f b χ i f i χ d χ b f b χ i f i χ b χ i by combining the well known chezy formula with the manning equation the expression of the friction factor can be obtained thereupon the friction factors of the river bed and ice cover can be respectively presented as 12 f b 8 g n b 2 r b 1 3 13 f i 8 g n i 2 r i 1 3 where n b and n i are the manning s roughness coefficients of the river bed and ice cover respectively r b and r i are respectively the hydraulic radiuses of the lower bed and upper ice layers similarly the depth averaged streamwise velocities of the two layers utilizing the chezy formula and the manning equation are respectively acquired as 14 u b r b 2 3 j b 1 2 n b 15 u i r i 2 3 j i 1 2 n i where j b and j i are respectively the hydraulic slopes of the lower bed and upper ice layers given that the flow condition in this study is steady and uniform there is j b j i accordingly combining u b u i with eqs 14 and 15 the relationship between r b and r i can be presented as 16 r b r i n b 3 2 n i 3 2 thus the comprehensive hydraulic radius of the channel cross section is expressed as 17 r d a d χ d a b a i χ b χ i a b χ b a i χ i χ i χ b 1 χ i χ b n b 3 2 n i 3 2 β 1 β r i where a b and a i are respectively the areas of the lower bed and upper ice layers a d is the area of the whole cross section β is the ratio of χ i to χ b namely β χ i χ b based on eq 17 we get 18 r i 1 β n b 3 2 n i 3 2 β r d therefore by substituting eqs 12 and 13 and eqs 16 18 into eq 11 the computational formulation of comprehensive friction factor f d can be obtained as 19 f d 8 g χ b χ i n b 3 2 β n i 3 2 1 β r d 1 3 χ b n b 3 2 χ i n i 3 2 4 2 dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λd although several models concerning λ have been proposed in the literature for open channels abril and knight 2004 shiono and knight 1991 van prooijen et al 2005 hardly any research has been conducted on λ for ice covered channels fortunately prior studies have pointed out that flows in the so called two layers of ice covered channels can be regarded as two pseudo free surface flows uzuner 1975 thus for ice covered compound channels flows in the upper ice layer and lower bed layer can be respectively deemed as rectangular open channel flow and compound open channel flow for the upper ice layer here we consider the standard value 0 067 for λ i i e λ i κ 6 where κ is the karman constant and κ 0 4 as regards the lower bed layer the value of λ bmc in the main channel is set as the standard value 0 067 and the value of λ bfp on floodplain can be expressed as abril and knight 2004 20 λ bfp λ bmc 0 2 1 2 d r b 1 44 where d r b is the relative flow depth of the lower bed layer and d r b h bfc h bmc h bfc is the flow depth on floodplain of the lower bed layer h bmc is the flow depth in the main channel of the lower bed layer based on the respective flow depth of the two layers the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity is proposed as 21 λ d λ i h i λ b h b h where h b and h i denote flow depths of the lower bed layer and the upper ice layer respectively tsai and ettema 1994 gave the normalized position for the interface of the two layers as 22 h b h m i m b m i where m b and m i are respectively parameters related to boundary roughnesses at channel bed and ice cover and they can be expressed as 23 m b κ 8 f b 1 2 24 m i κ 8 f i 1 2 therefore by substituting eqs 22 24 into eq 21 the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity can be obtained as 25 λ d λ i f i 1 2 λ b f b 1 2 f i 1 2 f b 1 2 4 3 secondary flow coefficient k for ice covered compound channels the schematic vertical variations of streamwise velocity u and transverse velocity v are shown in fig 4 a which displays two secondary current cells with different rotational directions comprehending the vertical distribution of u is straightforward whereas the vertical distribution of v is slightly complex the main reason is that the additional ice cover leads to the presence of two vertically superimposed secondary current cells lotsari et al 2019 considering that flows in each layer are separately similar to the free surface flows the vertical distribution of v in ice covered compound channels should satisfy three conditions wormleaton 1996 knight et al 2007 1 zero velocity at channel bed and ice cover underside i e v 0 for z 0 and z h 2 zero shear at the interface of two layers i e v z 0 for z h b 3 continuity for the steady uniform flow i e 0 h vdz 0 thereupon the schematic vertical distribution of v is presented as fig 4 a with two different secondary current cells which is verified by the experimental results of v in fig 4 b in practice streamwise velocity u is usually positive and has larger values near the interface of two layers than near the bed and ice cover as shown in fig 4 by contrast transverse velocity v contains positive and negative values and is merely a small proportion of u thus product term uv has small values near the bed as well as ice cover and large values near the interface of two layers and the sign of uv depends on the sign of v as presented in fig 5 similarly u v d which denotes the depth averaged value of uv can be positive or negative relying on the superimposed rotational sense of two secondary current cells according to eq 6 the sign of secondary flow coefficient k is in keeping with the sign of u v d that is the value of k becomes positive if the superimposed cells rotate clockwise and negative if rotating anticlockwise for the full ice cover case in this study the sign of k may be considered positive in the main channel domain and floodplains and negative in the main channel side slope domain however for the symmetrical shore ice case the sign of k may be considered negative in the main channel as well as main channel side slope domains and positive on floodplains for further details see the discussion 5 application of analytical model 5 1 experimental setup two work conditions full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases are considered in laboratory experiments as illustrated in fig 6 and the two cases are carried out under the same channel cross section dimensions as shown in fig 7 specifically the experiments are performed in a 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 5 m deep symmetrical compound channel the channel surfaces are made up of organic glass and its longitudinal slope is s 0 0 01 the side slope of the main channel is s 2 1 the widths of the half main channel and floodplain are both 0 2 m and the bankfull height is h 0 1 m the plastic foams with widths of 1 m and 0 4 m are respectively used to model the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice whose lengths are both 12 m the symmetrical shore ice is exactly distributed above the floodplain regions the two cases are operated under the steady uniform flow condition flow depths are regulated using the tailgate installed downstream of the flume while flow discharges are controlled by an electromagnetic flowmeter mounted on upstream of the flume and point velocities are captured with a sontek 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv considering the symmetry of the ice covered compound channel the flow characteristics of half of the channel are investigated now we take the full ice cover case as an example because the experimental setup and channel features of the symmetrical shore ice case are the same as those of the full ice cover case the schematic top view and cross section features of the full ice cover case are shown in fig 7 from fig 7 a the measured cross section is located at 8 m downstream from the ice covered compound channel starting point where a fully developed flow filed can be acquired twenty two vertical lines across the measured cross section are arranged as presented in fig 7 b where there are eight vertical lines in the main channel domain six vertical lines in the side slope domain and eight vertical lines in the floodplain domain to accurately capture the velocity distribution at least 20points are measured for each vertical line in the main channel domain and 15points are taken in the floodplain domain with a measurement interval of 1 cm the instantaneous velocity components are measured using the adv with a sampling rate of 50 hz and a sampling time of 160 s then bad measured data are removed when the correlation coefficients and signal to noise ratio snr are respectively less than 70 and 15 db for the two cases two experiments with flow depths of 0 25 m and 0 30 m are respectively performed details of the experiments are listed in table 1 where fic and ssc respectively denote the abbreviations of the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases 5 2 comparison with experimental data to verify the validity and reliability of the proposed analytical model the theoretical results simulated from the analytical model together with the experimental results measured in the laboratory are compared here the parameters utilized in modeling the two cases are shown in table 2 the modeled results of u d for the two cases with different flow depths are presented in figs 8 and 9 for the full ice cover case fig 8 illustrates that the analytical results of the proposed model match well with the experimental results whether the flow depth is low or high comparing fig 8 a with b we observe that the velocity gradient u d y for the low flow depth is larger than that for the high flow depth it indicates that u d for the high flow depth can quickly increase to the maximum velocity which is in line with engineering practice furthermore as flow depth increases the absolute values of secondary flow coefficient k for the main channel domain decrease from 2 to 1 whereas such values increase from 2 to 3 5 for the floodplain domain as presented in table 2 for the symmetrical shore ice case the proposed model can also make good predictions for different flow depths as illustrated in fig 9 nevertheless along the edge of the floodplain some deviations exist between the analytical and experimental results no matter what the flow depth is which may result from transverse momentum exchange in the interface similar to that of the full ice cover case u d has a rapid growth trend toward its maximum value for the high flow depth however as flow depth increases the absolute values of secondary flow coefficient k display an opposite changing law in the main channel domain compared with that of the full ice cover case this phenomenon may result from the different flow patterns between the symmetrical shore ice and full ice cover cases to clearly and intuitively illustrate the comparison of the analytical results and the experimental data error statistics for the two cases are performed as shown in table 3 the absolute error which is defined as the difference between the calculated and measured values of u d is given as 26 ε a u d calculated u d measured on the basis of eq 26 the average absolute error can be presented as 27 ε a 1 n i 1 n ε ai where n is the number of measured vertical lines in the cross section for each case and ε ai denotes the absolute error of u d located at ith measured vertical line the average relative error is defined as 28 ε r 1 n i 1 n ε ai u di measured 100 where u di is the depth averaged streamwise velocity of ith measured vertical line table 3 presents that the predicted results of u d are credible within an accuracy of 0 005 m s as far as the average absolute error ε a is concerned except for the ssc2 case whose ε a value peaks at 0 0052 m s the variation range of average relative error ε r is 1 51 2 93 among all the cases the fic2 case which possesses the minimum ε a and ε r has the highest accuracy from the results of error statistics the proposed analytical model can thus provide good predictions for the depth averaged streamwise velocity 5 3 discussion considering that secondary flow coefficient k is concerned with the number rotational direction and strength of secondary current cells secondary flows are specifically illustrated in this section the secondary flow vectors for the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases both with high flow depth h 0 3 m which are measured by the adv system are shown in fig 10 there exists an apparent clockwise secondary current cell along the edge of the floodplain and the strength of secondary flow cell for the symmetrical shore ice case is distinctly strong an anticlockwise secondary current cell appears at the corner of the main channel side slope domain in the main channel domain the secondary flow cell tends to rotate clockwise for the full ice cover case while rotate anticlockwise for the symmetrical shore ice case hence the signs of k are respectively negative and positive in the main channel side slope and floodplain domains no matter what the case is for the main channel domain however the signs of k are respectively positive and negative for the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases for the sake of verifying the impact of secondary currents on u d distribution and confirming the signs of k from the perspective of numerical simulation three circumstances for each case are considered as presented in fig 11 the secondary flow coefficients for the two cases are both set as k 1 k 2 k 3 0 k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 and k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 other parameters used in the analytical model remain unchanged as listed in table 2 from fig 11 the analytical results for the two cases without considering the secondary flow effect are obviously inconsistent with the experimental data indicating that the secondary flow effect cannot be neglected when the secondary flow coefficients for the full ice cover case and symmetric shore ice case are respectively considered k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 and k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 the corresponding analytical results are even worse than that of ignoring the influence of secondary flows once the signs of k 1 for the two cases are both changed i e k 1 of the full ice cover case becomes 2 and k 1 of the symmetrical shore ice case becomes 2 the analytical results seem to be satisfactory thus the signs of secondary flow coefficients adopted in this study are appropriate sensitive analyses of dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λd for the two cases with flow depth h 0 25 m are also conducted as shown in fig 12 the value of λd in the main channel domain varies from 0 067 standard value in this study to 0 201 triple increment whereas other parameters remain constant as presented in table 2 from fig 12 the augment of λd has a less impact on the simulated results of the full ice cover case than that of the symmetrical shore ice case which may arise from the different flow structures between the two cases also the depth averaged streamwise velocities for both cases present different changing laws as λd increases specifically u d in the full ice cover case has a declining trend with the increase of λd whereas an increasing tendency exists in the symmetrical shore ice situation overall the changing of λd only has a minor influence on the modeled results of the two cases note that the proposed analytical model can be applied not only to two stage ice covered compound channels but also to complicated ice covered channels such as multi stage ice covered compound channels once the appropriate boundary conditions and reasonable values of fd λd and k are determined the analytical results of ud distribution for complicated ice covered channels can be obtained however there are some limitations on employing the proposed analytical model i e eqs 8 and 9 first when the flow state does not satisfy the steady uniform flow condition the analytical model will become inapplicable and infeasible second for ice covered channels the location of maximum streamwise velocity and the plane of zero shear stress have a subtle deviation in practice which depends on the roughness difference between the ice cover underside and channel bed to capture more realistic flow characteristics of ice covered channels further studies based on the actual flow conditions are required to carry out finally due to momentum exchange along the edge of floodplain in the symmetrical shore ice case secondary flows therein need to be further investigated 6 conclusions given that the flow characteristics of ice covered compound channels are different from those of open channels this study gets insight into the depth averaged streamwise velocity of straight trapezoidal compound channels with ice cover on the basis of the skm and the two layer hypothesis ice cover friction is considered into the reynolds stress and then the depth averaged governing equation for the ice covered compound channel is obtained thus the analytical solutions including lateral momentum transfer secondary flow effect ice cover resistance and bed friction are derived and applied to the compound channels with full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice by imposing appropriate boundary conditions detailed conclusions can be drawn from this study as follows 1 the analytical modeled results for the two cases compared with the measured results indicate good predictions in terms of depth averaged streamwise velocity ud for the symmetrical shore ice case however the simulated results of ud along the edge of floodplain present subtle differences with the measured results which may arise from lateral momentum exchange 2 the change laws of the secondary flow intensity for the two cases are discovered for the full ice cover case the intensity of secondary flow in the main channel domain decreases as flow depth increases whereas a positive correlation is found on the floodplain for the symmetrical shore ice case the intensity of secondary flow in the main channel domain displays an opposite change law when compared with that of the full ice cover case 3 the signs of secondary flow coefficients adopted herein are proved to be suitable by the measured secondary flow vectors specifically the rotational directions of the secondary current cells for the main channel side slope and floodplain domains are respectively anticlockwise and clockwise as far as the main channel domain is concerned secondary current cells have a clockwise rotation trend in the full ice cover case while they tend to rotate anticlockwise in the symmetrical shore ice case 4 the sensitive analysis of dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λd has been performed although the computational results of the two cases show diverse change laws as λd increases the variation of λd has a minor influence on the computational results even though this study utilizing the proposed analytical model obtains some theoretical results for ice covered compound channels the universal applicability of these theoretical results needs to be further investigated first we will cooperate with hydrological stations in cold regions to collect relevant data for ice covered natural rivers then the proposed analytical model will be applied to actual fields for verifying its universality second because the additional ice cover alters number and patterns of secondary current cells further work is needed to study the difference between secondary flows of ice covered and open compound channels finally given the presence of transverse momentum exchange along the edge of the floodplain for the symmetrical shore ice case we will focus on the momentum exchange and propose a proper exchange model in our future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

giving rise to the formation of ice cover over a river compared with open rivers ice covered rivers during the freeze up possess a differentiated set of geomorphological conditions morse and hicks 2005 and the hydraulic characteristics are greatly altered lau and krishnappan 1981 zare et al 2016 most notably the roughness difference between ice cover underside and river bed results in an asymmetric channel flow under the ice cover chen et al 2016 tsai and ettema 1994 where two vertically superimposed helical secondary current cells rather than one exist lotsari et al 2019 thus the velocity distribution is changed by the ice cover and even sediment transportation and river bed evolution are influenced in engineering practice the presence of ice cover can induce a series of problems for river management in winter for instance the adjustment of upstream discharge water quality monitoring in downstream rivers and control of water supply ettema 2002 therefore studying flow characteristics of ice covered rivers such as flow velocities discharges and secondary flows is of great necessity prediction of depth averaged streamwise velocity for natural rivers is the foundation of researching sediment movement and river channel evolution bonakdari 2012 and the total discharge for a given water level can be obtained by the lateral integration of depth averaged streamwise velocity over the cross section area for ice covered channel flows previous researchers mainly concentrated on turbulence coherent structures demers et al 2013 robert and tran 2012 prediction of stage discharge chen et al 2018 composite roughness smith and ettema 1997 li 2012 and impacts of ice cover on sediment transport muste et al 2000 turcotte et al 2011 even if several studies based on a two layer hypothesis have been performed on the lateral distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity their research objectives were ice covered rectangular channel flows rather than ice covered compound channel flows zhong et al 2019 significantly for ice covered compound channel flows the prominent hydraulic features are the asymmetric flow under the ice cover the lateral exchange of momentum taking place in the shear layer and secondary flow structure the asymmetric flow presenting in the ice covered channel differs from that of open channel covered with suspended vegetation the distribution of ice cover is continuous whereas the distribution of floating vegetation with developed or under developed roots is discontinuous downing kunz and stacey 2012 liu et al 2017 zhang and nepf 2011 causing the differences of momentum exchange and secondary flow structure in modeling a fully developed asymmetric flow a two layer approach where flow above and under the plane of maximum streamwise velocity is separately described is usually adopted larsen 1973 teal et al 1994 asymmetric flows in the so called two layers can be deemed as two pseudo free surface flows sukhodolov et al 1999 uzuner 1975 thus for a fully developed steady uniform turbulent flow in an ice covered compound channel the streamwise velocity and shear stress in each layer follow the logarithmic and linear distributions respectively although a slight deviation exists between the locations of the zero shear stress and maximum streamwise velocity prior researches indicated that the two locations can be regarded as consistent knack and shen 2015 sayre and song 1979 in addition note that the two vertically superimposed helical secondary current cells under the ice cover can exacerbate the momentum exchange and hence affect flow velocity shear stress and even bank stability lotsari et al 2019 hence in modeling of ice covered compound channel flows introducing the two layer hypothesis and secondary flow effect into the prediction of transverse variation of depth averaged streamwise velocity are pivotal and significant problems of complex flows such as ice covered compound channel flows can be addressed by sophisticated numerical modeling methods namely direct numerical simulation lee and moser 2015 sahu and govindarajan 2016 reynolds averaged navier stokes equations including the standard k ε model the k ω turbulent model and reynolds stress model tan et al 1999 vallet 2007 wang et al 2009 yoon et al 1996 and large eddy simulation skyllingstad and denbo 2001 however considering that the planform vorticity is a key feature for overbank flow in an ice covered compound channel these turbulence numerical models even the advanced reynolds stress model cannot reproduce the planform vorticity because it is determined by the nature of reynolds averaged navier stokes equations knight et al 2007 furthermore these sophisticated numerical models need a mass of empirical parameters and lots of computational efforts that make them not very applicable to engineering design purposes thus an alternative methodology based on analytical model methods needs to be proposed for predicting the transverse distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity in ice covered compound channels motivated by the above discussions a predictive analytical model is proposed for the lateral distribution of depth averaged streamwise velocity in straight trapezoidal compound channels with ice cover by means of the shiono and knight method skm shiono and knight 1991 and secondary flow theory put forward by ervine et al 2000 first utilizing the two layer hypothesis the channel cross section is divided into the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer the additional resistance created by the ice cover is included in the reynolds stress and directly reflected in the darcy weisbach comprehensive friction factor thus the analytical solution of depth averaged streamwise velocity is acquired second the modeled results are verified against experimental results under two flow conditions namely the full ice cover and the symmetrical shore ice finally on the basis of experimental and analytical results the intensity and rotation direction of secondary currents are exhaustively discussed 2 theoretical background fig 1 shows the hydraulic parameters of an ice covered compound channel with straight trapezoidal cross section for predicting the lateral variation of depth averaged streamwise velocity in the channel with steady uniform flow field the depth averaged streamwise momentum equation containing the additional ice cover resistance needs to be derived first combining the continuity equation with the navier stokes momentum equation in longitudinal streamwise direction the governing equation is given as shiono and knight 1991 1 ρ u v y u w z ρ g s 0 τ yx y τ zx z where x y and z denote streamwise lateral and vertical directions respectively ρ is the fluid density u v and w are respectively temporal average velocity components in the x y and z directions s 0 denotes the channel bed slope g is the gravitational acceleration τ yx and τ zx are respectively the reynolds shear stresses with respect to the vertical and horizontal planes and τ yx ρ u v τ zx ρ u w u v and w respectively denote fluctuating velocities in the x y and z directions for ice covered compound channels the presence of ice cover can increase the wetted perimeter enlarge water flow resistance and decrease discharge capacity peters et al 2017 hence under the common action of bed friction and ice cover resistance the flow structure is altered as presented in fig 2 a tsai and ettema 1994 the longitudinal profile based on einstein s resistance separation theory einstein 1942 can be divided into two layers namely the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer fig 2 a illustrates that although the vertical variation of streamwise velocity u is differentiated from that of open channels it follows the logarithmic distribution within each layer which is supported by the measured results of the full ice cover case presented in fig 2 b specifically streamwise velocity u has a minimum value i e zero value at ice cover underside and channel bed and reaches its maximum value u max at the interface between two layers it is not difficult to find that the vertical distribution of u in ice covered compound channels is similar to that of the pipe turbulent flow due to the roughness difference between ice cover underside and river bed there exist two regions where shear stresses have opposite signs as presented in fig 2 a shear stress τ zx linearly varies in the vertical direction for the two layers and reaches the maximum values namely χ i τ i and χ b τ b at ice cover underside and channel bed therefore reynolds shear stress τ zx can be expressed as tsai and ettema 1994 2 τ zx χ b τ b χ b τ b χ i τ i z h f o r 0 z h where χ b and χ i are respectively the dimensionless wetted perimeters of river bed per unit width and ice cover per unit width τ b and τ i are respectively the boundary shear stresses at river bed and ice cover underside and h is the total flow depth of cross section to obtain the depth averaged form of eq 1 eq 1 is integrated over flow depth h here the immersed depth of ice cover in water is ignored and provided w 0 w h 0 thus the depth averaged form of eq 1 can be obtained as 3 ρ h uv d y ρ g h s 0 h τ yx y χ d τ d where uv d 1 h 0 h uv d z τ yx is the depth averaged transverse reynolds shear stress and τ yx 1 h 0 h ρ u v d z χ d is the dimensionless comprehensive wetted perimeter per unit width and χ d χ b χ i τ d is the comprehensive boundary shear stress and τ d χ b τ b χ i τ i χ d in view of the pervasive application of the eddy viscosity approach to the numerical modeling the approach can be utilized to express τ yx as shiono and knight 1991 4 τ yx ρ ε yx u d y where u d is the depth averaged streamwise velocity and u d 1 h 0 h u d z ε yx is the depth averaged eddy viscosity and ε yx λ d h u λ d is the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity u is the local shear velocity and u τ d ρ f d 8 u d f d is the darcy weisbach comprehensive friction factor thus the comprehensive boundary shear stress τ d can be expressed as 5 τ d ρ f d 8 u d 2 with regard to the secondary flow term ρ h uv d y related researches are few and far between and only few experimental data are available in the experiment we simply catch the rotation directions of secondary current cells which will be specifically introduced in the latter section in view of this the related theories of ervine et al 2000 are adopted here ervine et al 2000 assumed u k 1 u d and v k 2 u d thus uv d k 1 k 2 u d 2 k u d 2 hence the secondary flow term can be expressed as 6 ρ h uv d y ρ h k u d 2 y where k is the secondary flow coefficient varying with the roughness and geometry of the channel boundary thus substituting eqs 4 6 into eq 3 the depth averaged form of eq 1 can be rewritten as 7 ρ g h s 0 ρ f d 8 χ d u d 2 y ρ λ d h 2 f d 8 u d u d y ρ h k u d 2 y for the trapezoidal ice covered compound channels whose geometric characteristics are illustrated in fig 1 the analytical solution to eq 7 can be derived as follows 1 for regions with a constant flow depth namely region 1 and region 3 in fig 1 u d can be expressed as 8 u d c 1 e r 1 y c 2 e r 2 y ω 1 2 where r 1 1 λ d h 8 f d 1 2 k k 2 2 λ d χ d f d 8 3 2 r 2 2 k λ d h 8 f d 1 2 r 1 ω 8 g h s 0 f d χ d c 1 and c 2 are unknown constants 2 for regions with a linear side slope 1 s namely region 2 and region 4 in fig 1 u d can be expressed as 9 u d c 3 ξ α 1 c 4 ξ α 2 a ξ 1 2 where α 1 l m m l 2 4 n l 2 l α 2 l m m l 2 4 n l 2 l a g s 0 λ

in region 2 and ξ h h y b s 4 in region 4 3 boundary conditions for analytical solutions this study focuses on the flow structures of two working conditions namely the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice that are distributed above floodplain areas based on the flow depth i e the constant flow depth or laterally linear varying flow depth and the distribution of ice cover the cross section of the compound channels with full ice cover or with symmetrical shore ice can be divided into four regions as presented in fig 1 to acquire the corresponding analytical solutions to u d unknown constants c 1 c 4 that appear in eqs 8 and 9 need to be solved by utilizing appropriate boundary conditions knight et al 2004 indicated that the continuity of u d y is inapplicable when λ d and f d are different at two adjacent regions thus the suitable boundary condition which is the continuity of unit force h τ yx is proposed to replace the continuity of u d y for the continuous flow depth domain the continuity of h τ yx is equivalent to that of μ u d y where μ is an intermediate parameter and μ λ d f d hence for trapezoidal ice covered compound channels with continuous flow depth the continuity of μ u d y is employed here the boundary conditions employed in this study are listed as follows 1 the no slip condition namely u d 0 at the remote boundary of the channel 2 considering the symmetry of u d its velocity gradient located at the centerline of main channel ought to be zero namely u d y 0 for y 0 3 the continuity of u d at the interface of adjacent domains namely u d i u d i 1 4 the continuity of μ u d y at the interface of adjacent domains namely μ u d y i μ u d y i 1 with μ λ d f d 4 application principle and calibration coefficients the principle of utilizing eqs 8 and 9 to model the transverse distribution of u d is based on the subdivision of the channel cross section into various subdomains and employment of appropriate secondary flow coefficients for the respective subdomains for symmetrical ice covered compound channels only half of the cross section needs to be investigated and the cross section is often split into four subdomains with different flow depths here three physical parameters of each subdomain namely darcy weisbach comprehensive friction factor f d dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λ d and secondary flow coefficient k need to be ascertained and presented as follows 4 1 comprehensive friction factor fd to derive the computational formulation of comprehensive friction factor f d the relationship among river bed boundary shear stress τ b ice covered boundary shear stress τ i and comprehensive boundary shear stress τ d is mainly utilized that is τ d χ b τ b χ i τ i χ d considering that τ b ρ f b 8 u b 2 τ i ρ f i 8 u i 2 and τ d ρ f d 8 u d 2 one has 10 χ d f d u d 2 χ b f b u b 2 χ i f i u i 2 where f b is the darcy weisbach friction factor of river bed u b is the depth averaged streamwise velocity of the lower bed layer f i is the darcy weisbach friction factor of ice cover and u i is the depth averaged streamwise velocity of the upper ice layer according to einstein s hypothesis the depth averaged streamwise velocities of the lower bed and upper ice layers are approximately equal to that of the cross section namely u b u i u d in this study measured results of ub ui and ud confirmed the effectiveness of einstein s hypothesis as shown in fig 3 thus eq 10 can be transformed into 11 f d χ b f b χ i f i χ d χ b f b χ i f i χ b χ i by combining the well known chezy formula with the manning equation the expression of the friction factor can be obtained thereupon the friction factors of the river bed and ice cover can be respectively presented as 12 f b 8 g n b 2 r b 1 3 13 f i 8 g n i 2 r i 1 3 where n b and n i are the manning s roughness coefficients of the river bed and ice cover respectively r b and r i are respectively the hydraulic radiuses of the lower bed and upper ice layers similarly the depth averaged streamwise velocities of the two layers utilizing the chezy formula and the manning equation are respectively acquired as 14 u b r b 2 3 j b 1 2 n b 15 u i r i 2 3 j i 1 2 n i where j b and j i are respectively the hydraulic slopes of the lower bed and upper ice layers given that the flow condition in this study is steady and uniform there is j b j i accordingly combining u b u i with eqs 14 and 15 the relationship between r b and r i can be presented as 16 r b r i n b 3 2 n i 3 2 thus the comprehensive hydraulic radius of the channel cross section is expressed as 17 r d a d χ d a b a i χ b χ i a b χ b a i χ i χ i χ b 1 χ i χ b n b 3 2 n i 3 2 β 1 β r i where a b and a i are respectively the areas of the lower bed and upper ice layers a d is the area of the whole cross section β is the ratio of χ i to χ b namely β χ i χ b based on eq 17 we get 18 r i 1 β n b 3 2 n i 3 2 β r d therefore by substituting eqs 12 and 13 and eqs 16 18 into eq 11 the computational formulation of comprehensive friction factor f d can be obtained as 19 f d 8 g χ b χ i n b 3 2 β n i 3 2 1 β r d 1 3 χ b n b 3 2 χ i n i 3 2 4 2 dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λd although several models concerning λ have been proposed in the literature for open channels abril and knight 2004 shiono and knight 1991 van prooijen et al 2005 hardly any research has been conducted on λ for ice covered channels fortunately prior studies have pointed out that flows in the so called two layers of ice covered channels can be regarded as two pseudo free surface flows uzuner 1975 thus for ice covered compound channels flows in the upper ice layer and lower bed layer can be respectively deemed as rectangular open channel flow and compound open channel flow for the upper ice layer here we consider the standard value 0 067 for λ i i e λ i κ 6 where κ is the karman constant and κ 0 4 as regards the lower bed layer the value of λ bmc in the main channel is set as the standard value 0 067 and the value of λ bfp on floodplain can be expressed as abril and knight 2004 20 λ bfp λ bmc 0 2 1 2 d r b 1 44 where d r b is the relative flow depth of the lower bed layer and d r b h bfc h bmc h bfc is the flow depth on floodplain of the lower bed layer h bmc is the flow depth in the main channel of the lower bed layer based on the respective flow depth of the two layers the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity is proposed as 21 λ d λ i h i λ b h b h where h b and h i denote flow depths of the lower bed layer and the upper ice layer respectively tsai and ettema 1994 gave the normalized position for the interface of the two layers as 22 h b h m i m b m i where m b and m i are respectively parameters related to boundary roughnesses at channel bed and ice cover and they can be expressed as 23 m b κ 8 f b 1 2 24 m i κ 8 f i 1 2 therefore by substituting eqs 22 24 into eq 21 the dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity can be obtained as 25 λ d λ i f i 1 2 λ b f b 1 2 f i 1 2 f b 1 2 4 3 secondary flow coefficient k for ice covered compound channels the schematic vertical variations of streamwise velocity u and transverse velocity v are shown in fig 4 a which displays two secondary current cells with different rotational directions comprehending the vertical distribution of u is straightforward whereas the vertical distribution of v is slightly complex the main reason is that the additional ice cover leads to the presence of two vertically superimposed secondary current cells lotsari et al 2019 considering that flows in each layer are separately similar to the free surface flows the vertical distribution of v in ice covered compound channels should satisfy three conditions wormleaton 1996 knight et al 2007 1 zero velocity at channel bed and ice cover underside i e v 0 for z 0 and z h 2 zero shear at the interface of two layers i e v z 0 for z h b 3 continuity for the steady uniform flow i e 0 h vdz 0 thereupon the schematic vertical distribution of v is presented as fig 4 a with two different secondary current cells which is verified by the experimental results of v in fig 4 b in practice streamwise velocity u is usually positive and has larger values near the interface of two layers than near the bed and ice cover as shown in fig 4 by contrast transverse velocity v contains positive and negative values and is merely a small proportion of u thus product term uv has small values near the bed as well as ice cover and large values near the interface of two layers and the sign of uv depends on the sign of v as presented in fig 5 similarly u v d which denotes the depth averaged value of uv can be positive or negative relying on the superimposed rotational sense of two secondary current cells according to eq 6 the sign of secondary flow coefficient k is in keeping with the sign of u v d that is the value of k becomes positive if the superimposed cells rotate clockwise and negative if rotating anticlockwise for the full ice cover case in this study the sign of k may be considered positive in the main channel domain and floodplains and negative in the main channel side slope domain however for the symmetrical shore ice case the sign of k may be considered negative in the main channel as well as main channel side slope domains and positive on floodplains for further details see the discussion 5 application of analytical model 5 1 experimental setup two work conditions full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases are considered in laboratory experiments as illustrated in fig 6 and the two cases are carried out under the same channel cross section dimensions as shown in fig 7 specifically the experiments are performed in a 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 5 m deep symmetrical compound channel the channel surfaces are made up of organic glass and its longitudinal slope is s 0 0 01 the side slope of the main channel is s 2 1 the widths of the half main channel and floodplain are both 0 2 m and the bankfull height is h 0 1 m the plastic foams with widths of 1 m and 0 4 m are respectively used to model the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice whose lengths are both 12 m the symmetrical shore ice is exactly distributed above the floodplain regions the two cases are operated under the steady uniform flow condition flow depths are regulated using the tailgate installed downstream of the flume while flow discharges are controlled by an electromagnetic flowmeter mounted on upstream of the flume and point velocities are captured with a sontek 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv considering the symmetry of the ice covered compound channel the flow characteristics of half of the channel are investigated now we take the full ice cover case as an example because the experimental setup and channel features of the symmetrical shore ice case are the same as those of the full ice cover case the schematic top view and cross section features of the full ice cover case are shown in fig 7 from fig 7 a the measured cross section is located at 8 m downstream from the ice covered compound channel starting point where a fully developed flow filed can be acquired twenty two vertical lines across the measured cross section are arranged as presented in fig 7 b where there are eight vertical lines in the main channel domain six vertical lines in the side slope domain and eight vertical lines in the floodplain domain to accurately capture the velocity distribution at least 20points are measured for each vertical line in the main channel domain and 15points are taken in the floodplain domain with a measurement interval of 1 cm the instantaneous velocity components are measured using the adv with a sampling rate of 50 hz and a sampling time of 160 s then bad measured data are removed when the correlation coefficients and signal to noise ratio snr are respectively less than 70 and 15 db for the two cases two experiments with flow depths of 0 25 m and 0 30 m are respectively performed details of the experiments are listed in table 1 where fic and ssc respectively denote the abbreviations of the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases 5 2

results measured in the laboratory are compared here the parameters utilized in modeling the two cases are shown in table 2 the modeled results of u d for the two cases with different flow depths are presented in figs 8 and 9 for the full ice cover case fig 8 illustrates that the analytical results of the proposed model match well with the experimental results whether the flow depth is low or high comparing fig 8 a with b we observe that the velocity gradient u d y for the low flow depth is larger than that for the high flow depth it indicates that u d for the high flow depth can quickly increase to the maximum velocity which is in line with engineering practice furthermore as flow depth increases the absolute values of secondary flow coefficient k for the main channel domain decrease from 2 to 1 whereas such values increase from 2 to 3 5 for the floodplain domain as presented in table 2 for the symmetrical shore ice case the proposed model can also make good predictions for different flow depths as illustrated in fig 9 nevertheless along the edge of the floodplain some deviations exist between the analytical and experimental results no matter what the flow depth is which may result from transverse momentum exchange in the interface similar to that of the full ice cover case u d has a rapid growth trend toward its maximum value for the high flow depth however as flow depth increases the absolute values of secondary flow coefficient k display an opposite changing law in the main channel domain compared with that of the full ice cover case this phenomenon may result from the different flow patterns between the symmetrical shore ice and full ice cover cases to clearly and intuitively illustrate the comparison of the analytical results and the experimental data error statistics for the two cases are performed as shown in table 3 the absolute error which is defined as the difference between the calculated and measured values of u d is given as 26 ε a u d calculated u d measured on the basis of eq 26 the average absolute error can be presented as 27 ε a 1 n i 1 n ε ai where n is the number of measured vertical lines in the cross section for each case and ε ai denotes the absolute error of u d located at ith measured vertical line the average relative error is defined as 28 ε r 1 n i 1 n ε ai u di measured 100 where u di is the depth averaged streamwise velocity of ith measured vertical line table 3 presents that the predicted results of u d are credible within an accuracy of 0 005 m s as far as the average absolute error ε a is concerned except for the ssc2 case whose ε a value peaks at 0 0052 m s the variation range of average relative error ε r is 1 51 2 93 among all the cases the fic2 case which possesses the minimum ε a and ε r has the highest accuracy from the results of error statistics the proposed analytical model can thus provide good predictions for the depth averaged streamwise velocity 5 3 discussion considering that secondary flow coefficient k is concerned with the number rotational direction and strength of secondary current cells secondary flows are specifically illustrated in this section the secondary flow vectors for the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases both with high flow depth h 0 3 m which are measured by the adv system are shown in fig 10 there exists an apparent clockwise secondary current cell along the edge of the floodplain and the strength of secondary flow cell for the symmetrical shore ice case is distinctly strong an anticlockwise secondary current cell appears at the corner of the main channel side slope domain in the main channel domain the secondary flow cell tends to rotate clockwise for the full ice cover case while rotate anticlockwise for the symmetrical shore ice case hence the signs of k are respectively negative and positive in the main channel side slope and floodplain domains no matter what the case is for the main channel domain however the signs of k are respectively positive and negative for the full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice cases for the sake of verifying the impact of secondary currents on u d distribution and confirming the signs of k from the perspective of numerical simulation three circumstances for each case are considered as presented in fig 11 the secondary flow coefficients for the two cases are both set as k 1 k 2 k 3 0 k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 and k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 other parameters used in the analytical model remain unchanged as listed in table 2 from fig 11 the analytical results for the two cases without considering the secondary flow effect are obviously inconsistent with the experimental data indicating that the secondary flow effect cannot be neglected when the secondary flow coefficients for the full ice cover case and symmetric shore ice case are respectively considered k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 and k 1 2 k 2 0 2 k 3 2 the corresponding analytical results are even worse than that of ignoring the influence of secondary flows once the signs of k 1 for the two cases are both changed i e k 1 of the full ice cover case becomes 2 and k 1 of the symmetrical shore ice case becomes 2 the analytical results seem to be satisfactory thus the signs of secondary flow coefficients adopted in this study are appropriate sensitive analyses of dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λd for the two cases with flow depth h 0 25 m are also conducted as shown in fig 12 the value of λd in the main channel domain varies from 0 067 standard value in this study to 0 201 triple increment whereas other parameters remain constant as presented in table 2 from fig 12 the augment of λd has a less impact on the simulated results of the full ice cover case than that of the symmetrical shore ice case which may arise from the different flow structures between the two cases also the depth averaged streamwise velocities for both cases present different changing laws as λd increases specifically u d in the full ice cover case has a declining trend with the increase of λd whereas an increasing tendency exists in the symmetrical shore ice situation overall the changing of λd only has a minor influence on the modeled results of the two cases note that the proposed analytical model can be applied not only to two stage ice covered compound channels but also to complicated ice covered channels such as multi stage ice covered compound channels once the appropriate boundary conditions and reasonable values of fd λd and k are determined the analytical results of ud distribution for complicated ice covered channels can be obtained however there are some limitations on employing the proposed analytical model i e eqs 8 and 9 first when the flow state does not satisfy the steady uniform flow condition the analytical model will become inapplicable and infeasible second for ice covered channels the location of maximum streamwise velocity and the plane of zero shear stress have a subtle deviation in practice which depends on the roughness difference between the ice cover underside and channel bed to capture more realistic flow characteristics of ice covered channels further studies based on the actual flow conditions are required to carry out finally due to momentum exchange along the edge of floodplain in the symmetrical shore ice case secondary flows therein need to be further investigated 6 conclusions given that the flow characteristics of ice covered compound channels are different from those of open channels this study gets insight into the depth averaged streamwise velocity of straight trapezoidal compound channels with ice cover on the basis of the skm and the two layer hypothesis ice cover friction is considered into the reynolds stress and then the depth averaged governing equation for the ice covered compound channel is obtained thus the analytical solutions including lateral momentum transfer secondary flow effect ice cover resistance and bed friction are derived and applied to the compound channels with full ice cover and symmetrical shore ice by imposing appropriate boundary conditions detailed conclusions can be drawn from this study as follows 1 the analytical modeled results for the two cases compared with the measured results indicate good predictions in terms of depth averaged streamwise velocity ud for the symmetrical shore ice case however the simulated results of ud along the edge of floodplain present subtle differences with the measured results which may arise from lateral momentum exchange 2 the change laws of the secondary flow intensity for the two cases are discovered for the full ice cover case the intensity of secondary flow in the main channel domain decreases as flow depth increases whereas a positive correlation is found on the floodplain for the symmetrical shore ice case the intensity of secondary flow in the main channel domain displays an opposite change law when compared with that of the full ice cover case 3 the signs of secondary flow coefficients adopted herein are proved to be suitable by the measured secondary flow vectors specifically the rotational directions of the secondary current cells for the main channel side slope and floodplain domains are respectively anticlockwise and clockwise as far as the main channel domain is concerned secondary current cells have a clockwise rotation trend in the full ice cover case while they tend to rotate anticlockwise in the symmetrical shore ice case 4 the sensitive analysis of dimensionless comprehensive eddy viscosity λd has been performed although the computational results of the two cases show diverse change laws as λd increases the variation of λd has a minor influence on the computational results even though this study utilizing the proposed analytical model obtains some theoretical results for ice covered compound channels the universal applicability of these theoretical results needs to be further investigated first we will cooperate with hydrological stations in cold regions to collect relevant data for ice covered natural rivers then the proposed analytical model will be applied to actual fields for verifying its universality second because the additional ice cover alters number and patterns of secondary current cells further work is needed to study the difference between secondary flows of ice covered and open compound channels finally given the presence of transverse momentum exchange along the edge of the floodplain for the symmetrical shore ice case we will focus on the momentum exchange and propose a proper exchange model in our future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

5597,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is recognized as an important nutrient delivery mechanism in coastal ecosystems however water quality management in these settings is typically focused on surface waters often ignoring sgd and nearshore groundwater surface water interaction in this study we integrate a comprehensive radionuclide tracer based field investigation with watershed modeling to examine groundwater surface water partitioning and to quantify nutrient loading from fresh sgd and streamflow in a small embayment located in american samoa measurements included streamflow sgd rate and environmental tracers including 222rn concentrations nutrient levels and nitrogen isotope values in groundwater and surface water samples we then used the soil and water assessment tool swat to validate measured baseflow and sgd rates and also to estimate storm flows which were not measured in the field field results showed sgd was a significant delivery mechanism for coastal nutrient loads whereas baseflow nutrient loading from the upper watershed was minimal during the study period seepage run measurements informed a conceptual hydrogeologic model of groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction which we applied in developing the watershed model the swat model simulated flow observations satisfactorily and indicated baseflow accounts for only 39 of the total annual stream flow with surface runoff and lateral flow i e interflow making up the rest by examining water and nutrient exchange between groundwater surface water and sgd this study provides a more complete understanding of the fate and transport of water and nutrients in small island watersheds where anthropogenic activities potentially threaten the health of coastal ecosystems keywords submarine groundwater discharge sgd soil and water assessment tool swat watershed modeling coastal nutrient loading groundwater stream water interaction american samoa 1 introduction discharge of anthropogenic nutrients to coastal areas has the potential to significantly impact nearshore water quality and affect reef health bahr et al 2015 dulai et al 2016 in recent decades the effect of submarine groundwater discharge sgd on coastal nutrient budgets has become widely recognized e g johannes and hearn 1985 dulaiova et al 2006 rodellas et al 2015 and sgd has been found to be a particularly significant nutrient delivery mechanism in tropical volcanic island settings zektser 2000 moosdorf et al 2015 dulai et al 2016 nonetheless environmental water quality management typically focuses on surface waters often ignoring sgd the u s environmental protection agency s clean water act section 303 d requires states and territories to establish water quality standards and total maximum daily loads tmdls for nutrients in receiving waters in many places including the territory of american samoa such standards apply only to fresh surface and open coastal waters as epa 2013a thereby overlooking potentially important nutrient pathways spatial variability in groundwater discharge directly to streams may also affect the validity of tmdl measurements which are assumed to originate from surface water sources only recent studies from streams e g avery et al 2018 mangrove environments e g gleeson et al 2013 and large tidal estuaries e g makings et al 2014 indicate that groundwater has significant impacts on both coastal water quality and nearshore stream water quality underscoring the importance of considering groundwater surface water interaction when designing water quality monitoring protocols however accurate quantification of groundwater discharge to streams and coastlines is inherently challenging because available methods typically rely on measurements and conceptual models with high uncertainties this underscores the need to develop an improved understanding of how land use groundwater and surface water interact to deliver nutrients to the coast the naturally occurring noble gas radon 222 222rn has become one of the most widely used tracers for determining sgd rates e g burnett and dulaiova 2003 charette et al 2007 sadat noori et al 2015 and when combined with water quality sampling this method is widely used for estimating associated coastal nutrient fluxes e g dulaiova et al 2010 gleeson et al 2013 wang et al 2017 radon has also been applied successfully in stream headwaters channels and estuaries for investigating the magnitude and locations of groundwater surface water interactions in terrestrial settings e g peterson et al 2010 cartwright et al 2011 unland et al 2013 gleeson et al 2018 however very few studies have integrated these approaches and investigated groundwater surface water and coastal water interactions on a whole watershed scale e g corbett et al 1999 and to our knowledge none have done so in a tropical basaltic island setting groundwater becomes enriched in 222rn through prolonged contact with aquifer material and pore water 222rn concentrations typically reach an equilibrium between ingrowth and radioactive decay within a couple of weeks after leaving the aquifer dissolved 222rn has a short half life of 3 8 days exhibits conservative behavior through the full salinity range and shows low concentrations in surface and ocean waters making it an excellent tracer of recently discharged groundwater predictable isotopic fractionation of nitrogen n in dissolved nitrate and nitrite δ15nn n has been used extensively for tracing sources of nutrients in groundwater e g kendall and aravena 2000 cole et al 2006 hunt 2007 stream water e g lindauet al 1989 and coastal surface waters e g garrison et al 2007 wong et al 2014 wiegner 2016 bishop et al 2017 commonly referenced ranges for δ15nn n values indicate synthetic fertilizer influenced waters have relatively low δ15nn n values 5 to 5 natural soil processes typically produce porewaters with intermediate δ15nn n values 2 to 6 and manure and human wastewater leachates generally produce higher δ15nn n values albeit with a wide range 4 to 25 kendall and aravena 2000 dailer et al 2010 fenech et al 2012 abaya et al 2018a b this method does have a number of limitations for example wastewater influenced δ15nn n values in tropical island settings have been found to encompass a wide range from 5 to 23 bishop et al 2017 amato et al 2016 hunt and rosa 2009 rogers et al 2012 nonetheless δ15nn n remains a valuable tool for providing clues about nutrient sources which has made it a widely used source dependent tracer despite well known limitations xue et al 2009 in the hydrologic sciences it is common and some may argue a standard practice to integrate numerical models with field based studies to constrain or validate estimates produced by either method e g anderson 1987 biondi 2012 the wide spatial coverage of models also makes them useful for management agencies tasked with covering large areas that are difficult to fully characterize with field methods however model accuracy depends on appropriate conceptualization of the hydrologic system and sufficient calibration and validation data to constrain uncertainty and ensure accuracy watershed scale sgd focused field studies that integrate modeling components e g michael 2005 nakada et al 2011 often apply groundwater models capable of simulating variable density flow such as seawat guo and langevin 2002 or feflow wasy 2004 however calibration data for these fairly complex models is often limited leading to overparameterization and problems with equifinality kirchner 2006 on the other hand availability of above surface hydrologic data is typically better due to the existence of nation wide meteorological and streamflow measurement networks slack and landwehr 1992 nrc 2004 these data can be used to calibrate watershed models such as the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 2014 or gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis gssha downer and ogden 2006 that apply the water budget approach to partition hydrologic inputs between different pathways by using a water budget approach watershed models are also able to produce estimates of subsurface inputs and returns to surface waters without requiring difficult to obtain subsurface data although watershed models lack the fine scale resolution available with groundwater models at the watershed scale these models can provide some of the same benefits where more detailed subsurface simulation is not needed e g oberdorfer 2003 lee and kim 2007 in american samoa anthropogenic nutrient loading and sedimentation to coastal zones have been identified as primary factors in reducing the reef s ability for recovery from increasing environmental stressors mccook 1999 craig 2009 long term studies of reefs on tutuila the territory s main island suggest sgd is likely to be a significant explanatory variable in reef health houk et al 2013 whitall and holst 2015 however prior to this study there have been no known attempts to quantify sgd and its associated nutrient loading in american samoa to fill this gap we used measurements of environmental tracers including 222rn dissolved nutrients and nitrogen isotopes to trace groundwater discharge partition baseflow and fresh sgd nutrient flux and explore probable nutrient sources within a small tropical island watershed and embayment field observations provided insights for informing conceptual model development and were useful for model calibration and validation watersheds in american samoa provide unique settings to examine nutrient budgets on a basin wide scale due to small drainage areas relatively good accessibility and high precipitation rates that drive measurably significant water fluxes in this study we hypothesize that multiple hydrologic pathways including groundwater surface water and fresh sgd all act as significant controls on coastal nutrient loading in small tropical watersheds exemplified by those of american samoa to investigate this question we integrated a detailed geochemical field investigation with watershed modeling in order to partition the impact of water and nutrient discharge from different hydrologic pathways our primary objectives are to develop a better understanding of groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction and to quantify coastal nutrient loading impacts from non point sources in tropical island watersheds 2 study area faga alu watershed consists of a small 2 1 km2 steep heavily forested valley with one main perennial stream draining into faga alu bay a small arm of pago pago harbor fig 1 geologically the watershed is carved from dense inner caldera basalts formed about 1 2 mya and the valley bottom is filled with a gently inclined wedge of terrestrial and marine alluvium that extends about 1 km upstream from the coast stearns 1944 the regional scale aquifer permeability of the inter caldera basalts is likely to be significantly lower than that of the terrestrial alluvium based on aquifer properties of similar geologic units in western tutuila izuka et al 2007 however in faga alu the only known well is located in the alluvium precluding direct comparison of each unit s hydrogeologic properties significant springs found in the inter caldera unit indicate that it contains high level groundwater which is likely to be impounded by sub surface structures such as dikes perching layers or potentially faults davis 1963 in the upper watershed the soil type is primarily silty clay to clay loam lithic hapludolls ranging from 20 to 150 cm deep and the alluvial unit is covered with a fairly deep 150 cm mixture of well drained very stony silty clay loams and poorly drained silty clay to fine sandy loams nakamura 1984 faga alu s climate is warm and humid with year round average temperatures around 28 c and annual rainfall between 3000 and 6000 mm year depending on elevation the wet season extends from october to may and the drier season spans june to september in faga alu anthropogenic activities have been connected to recent degradation of reef health and reduction of stream water quality leading to its designation as a federal priority watershed management area by the united states coral reef task force sauafea le au 2013 both stream and coastal water quality in faga alu have been classified as impaired since 2006 as epa 2016 and american samoa environmental protection agency as epa coral reef monitoring suggests that faga alu s benthic ecosystem is one of the most impacted on the island houk et al 2005 previous studies implicate the stream as a pathway for terrigenous sediments and excessive nutrient loads to the bay didonato 2005 messina 2016 messina biggs 2016 however the role of groundwater as a hydrologic pathway for terrigenous contamination remains unconstrained the three primary anthropogenic nutrient sources on tutuila have been previously determined to be 1 on site wastewater disposal systems osds 2 widespread small scale pig farming operations and 3 agricultural fertilizers falkland et al 2002 polidoro et al 2017 shuler et al 2017 but the relative impact of each source on coastal ecosystems remains poorly understood 3 methods 3 1 water sampling and stream gauging methods we collected groundwater coastal water and stream water samples throughout a weeklong sampling campaign in the dry season of 2014 during a period with no significant rainfall this included a longitudinal sampling and measurement transect up faga alu stream hereafter referred to as a seepage run rosenberry and labaugh 2008 which we conducted during a single 24 hour period through the lower 1 km stream section during the seepage run we measured streamflow at ten separate locations with a price type pygmy current meter and the velocity area method turnipseed and sauer 2010 and sampled stream water at seven of those locations throughout the reach between faga alu quarry and the lowest section of stream that was not affected by the tide during the sampling period during a boat based coastal water survey see section 3 2 2 we collected coastal water samples from faga alu bay one day after the seepage run we identified three areas along the shoreline of the bay with brackish coastal springs and sampled these twice each at low tide throughout the week we also sampled the only production well in the valley well 179 all sampling locations are shown on fig 1 and streamflow data are given in supplementary material tables a1 and a2 to verify the seepage run results we conducted a second seepage run on august 10th 2016 and measured streamflow and dissolved 222rn concentrations but not nutrients or other parameters at many of the same sites as in 2014 to reduce measurement uncertainty streamflow for the second seepage run was measured with a sontek flowtracker handheld acoustic doppler velocimeter which has a higher velocity resolution and accuracy than the pygmy meter we used in 2014 sampling and analysis for 222rn concentrations was performed in the same way as was done in 2014 with all direct streamflow measurement values we conservatively assumed a measurement error of 10 as typical standard errors with pygmy meters have been reported to be between 3 and 6 sauer and meyer 1992 and field calculated measurement uncertainties for flowtracker data were always well below 10 for all nutrient samples we also collected in situ temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen data with a ysi multiparameter sonde 6600v2 4 model nutrient and isotope samples were collected in acid washed 60 ml hdpe bottles triple rinsed with sample water before filling nutrient samples were kept refrigerated whereas n isotope samples were frozen until analysis all nutrient and isotope samples were filtered through 0 45 µm capsule filters thus all measured nutrient concentrations and comparable modeled nitrogen concentrations reported here refer to dissolved species unless the particulate fraction is specifically indicated we collected grab samples for 222rn in 250 ml glass bottles with no headspace and analyzed them the same day as collection with a rad h2o radon in water analyzer manufactured by durridge inc billerica ma usa because of 222rn s short half life 3 8 days 222rn grab sample values were decay corrected to the time of collection we analyzed all water samples for dissolved nutrients including nitrate and nitrite n n ammonium nh4 phosphate po4 3 silicate si total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp dissolved 222rn concentration and nitrogen isotope δ15n n n values of n n in samples having 1 µmol l of n n the only exceptions were samples collected in 2016 which were only analyzed for 222rn concentrations nutrient samples were analyzed within two weeks of collection at the university of hawaii school of ocean and earth science and technology soest laboratory for analytical biogeochemistry using the methods described in armstrong et al 1967 and grasshoff et al 1999 nitrogen isotope samples were measured within 4 months of collection at the university of hawaii s stable isotope biogeochemistry lab using the denitrifier method of sigman et al 2001 isotopic results are expressed here in per mil notation relative to the isotopic reference standard of air coastal groundwater is composed of both oceanic and fresh water however because this study focuses on assessing nutrient flux from terrigenous sources only the oceanic component in coastal spring samples was mathematically unmixed to reveal nutrient levels of only the fresh component of each sample regardless of seawater dilution this is commonly done in settings where the subterranean estuary and recirculating seawater are not a significant source of nutrients street et al 2008 and was performed here with an unmixing calculation e g hunt and rosa 2009 that assumed conservative nutrient behavior during mixing and was based on an oceanic end member from tutuila this calculation allowed the derivation of nutrient fluxes solely contributed by fresh groundwater we collected duplicate samples at five locations and analytical uncertainty was assessed using the relative percent difference rpd method which is defined as the absolute value of the difference between two duplicates expressed as a percentage of their mean average rpd was 1 4 for n n 0 5 for si 0 6 for po4 3 2 4 for nh4 0 8 for tdn 1 9 for tdp and 6 8 for δ15n n n in about half of the samples concentrations of po4 3 were measured to be slightly greater than tdp this is likely due to small inconsistencies between the two analysis methods and suggests that in most of the samples collected nearly all of the tdp is in the form of orthophosphate 3 2 radon based sgd field estimates dissolved 222rn was used as a groundwater tracer in a temporally and spatially distributed non steady state radon flux model to calculate bay wide sgd rates following the methods of burnett and dulaiova 2003 and dulaiova et al 2010 we assessed temporal tide dependent variability with a time series of 222rn measurements taken from a fixed nearshore location over a 48 hour period this was coupled with a coastal water survey to assess spatial variation in 222rn throughout the inner bay for both the time series and survey 222rn concentrations were measured by pumping surface water through an air water exchanger connected to a radon in air monitor rad aqua durridge inc to obtain bay wide sgd fluxes we scaled up the tidally averaged sgd flux from the stationary time series to account for the additional sgd flux observed during the coastal survey in locations adjacent to the time series location as described below 3 2 1 stationary 222rn time series the 222rn time series instrument package used a peristaltic pump that pumped surface water from the bay to an instream flow cell with no headspace attached to the ysi 6600 series sonde that continuously logged water salinity and temperature the inlet hose for the pump was connected to a moored float located at a stationary point in the bay about 50 m away from the stream mouth fig 1 after passing through the ysi water flowed into an air water exchanger where 222rn gas was extracted and pumped to the rad7 tidal height was measured by a pressure transducer placed on the seafloor at the float anchor we deployed the instrumentation for about 48 h and the rad7 was set to integrate measurements of 222rn activity every 30 min typically sgd manifests as a fresh or brackish plume that overlies denser seawater we measured plume thickness at low tide by manually conducting salinity depth profiles at the water intake and this plume thickness was used for volumetric calculations in the 222rn mass balance model change in plume thickness due to tidal dilution was calculated by subtracting the thickness of the underlying salt water layer from the total depth of the water column 3 2 2 coastal water survey we performed the coastal water survey once the time series was finished during a 3 hour period bracketing low tide we transferred the time series instrument platform to a small boat and rowed throughout the bay while the air water exchanger was supplied with surface water from a bilge pump tethered to the hull of the boat the rad7 was set to integrate 222rn activity every 5 min and data was resampled to one minute intervals yielding a total of 205 points available for interpolation during the survey three distinct plumes of sgd were detected as low salinity and high 222rn anomalies we refer to these plumes as the southern central and northern plumes during analysis the surface area and geometry of each plume was determined by nearest neighbor interpolation of measurement points and contouring of the resultant 222rn activity surface boundaries for each of the three plumes were defined as the 222rn isoline representing the mid point of the range of measured activities 3 25 dpm l we defined the bottom boundary of each plume to be the salinity 28 isohaline as indicated by salinity depth profiles that we took periodically during the survey or if salinity was consistent throughout the whole water column the full water depth was used as the plume thickness note that the time series measurement described in section 3 2 1 was performed at a location that fell inside of the central plume additionally during the survey coastal water samples were collected for analysis in the same manner as stream and groundwater samples 3 2 3 sgd flux scaling fresh and recirculated fractions the 222rn flux model modified from dulaiova et al 2010 was used to calculate sgd fluxes for both survey and time series data the model uses a mass balance approach that relies on accounting for 222rn losses and additions from local and offshore processes that are not related to sgd we assumed that ambient 222rn activities from oceanic or atmospheric sources were comparable to those found in the hawaiian islands and used an ambient 222rn activity of 0 03 dpm l kelly and glenn 2012 a local excess 222rn activity of 0 08 dpm l supported by in situ 226ra street et al 2008 and an offshore 222rn activity of 0 087 dpm l derived from the offshore 226ra fröllje et al 2016 we assumed residence time of sgd affected groundwater within faga alu s inner bay to be 12 2 h the length of one tidal cycle which is within the ranges of published residence times from water circulation studies of faga alu storlazzi et al 2014 vetter and vargas angel 2014 hourly measurements of local wind speed and air temperature were obtained from the american samoa observatory noaa earth system research laboratory esrl weather station at cape matatula to assess the sgd endmember composition we collected groundwater samples from the only well in the valley and from four coastal spring locations at low tide the 222rn activity measured in coastal springs and the well showed a linear mixing relationship with salinity fig a1 supplementary material which suggests that while seawater recirculation does occur the nearshore reef substrate or the re infiltrated coastal water does not add a significant quantity of 222rn to groundwater during this process likely because circulation is rapid and recirculated seawater does not spend enough time in the subsurface to collect measurable radon the linearity of this relationship also indicates the fresh coastal spring 222rn endmembers when corrected for dilution by seawater are quite consistent with the 222rn activity measured at well 179 therefore the 222rn concentration from the well was used as the groundwater end member for fresh sgd calculations and the standard deviation of all measured salinity unmixed 222rn concentrations table 1 which equaled 54 dpm l or about 44 of the 222rn endmember value was used as the uncertainty on this quantity to be propagated through sgd calculations it should be noted that by using the fresh groundwater 222rn endmember for sgd calculations only the fresh sgd rate was calculated assuming that the recirculated fraction did not carry a 222rn signature this assumption was indicated by high salinity low 222rn water found at coastal springs most likely resulting from seawater intrusion to the coastal aquifer at high tide on relatively short time scales further this assumption is discussed in section 5 4 1 please note that all future references to sgd in this work indicate fresh groundwater discharge only the time series calculations provided a temporally integrated sgd rate but for the central plume only as this was where the water intake was located on the other hand the coastal water survey provided spatially distributed sgd rates which allowed for the identification of three distinctive sgd plumes but only as a snapshot in time therefore to calculate temporally integrated sgd flux to the whole bay the ratios of survey based sgd rates in the northern and southern plumes to the survey based sgd rate in the central plume were used as scaling factors to upscale the time series derived temporally averaged sgd flux to include the other two plumes limitations of this approach included needing to make the simplifying assumptions that tidal variation in the central plume was representative of the other two plumes that sgd only discharges from the three identified plumes and that the relative magnitudes of discharge from each plume stay consistent over time these limitations could be addressed by replicating the survey at different times or repeating the time series in different locations however due to the significant amount of time required for just one time series and survey we were unable to conduct the approach repeatedly 3 3 watershed and land use modeling we used swat a physically based semi distributed watershed scale ecohydrological model arnold et al 1998 to calculate transient estimates of flow through different hydrologic pathways i e water budget components these pathways included surface runoff lateral flow i e subsurface stormflow baseflow and groundwater recharge at different spatial and temporal scales we also applied swat s n transport capabilities however limitations in the availability and quality of existing nutrient data prevented satisfactory calibration of this portion of the model the wide applicability of swat under various conditions and to different environmental problems has been demonstrated worldwide e g gassman et al 2007 2014 dadhich and nadaoka 2012 the swat

hydrologic portion of the model was parameterized using daily rainfall and streamflow data which were collected for a different study but provided to us for this work by a m messina 2016 personal communication with supporting methodology documented in messina 2016 these data were collected at two sites within faga alu watershed during the period 2012 to 2014 daily wind speed relative humidity and maximum and minimum temperatures were only available at one of these sites solar radiation was measured at the nearby american samoa community college dataset ascc 2018 and additional relative humidity data were obtained from the noaa earth system research laboratory weather station the watershed was divided into 26 sub basins and 403 hydrological response units hrus with zero threshold values for land use soil and slope classes the model simulation was run for the period of 2005 to 2014 available data constraining the locations and magnitudes of anthropogenic nutrient sources in faga alu watershed were collected for swat s nutrient loading module locations of seventy four osds units six piggeries and 1 15 acres of agricultural lands were identified and are shown in fig a4 in the supplementary material although we parameterized sensitivity tested and worked diligently to calibrate swat s nitrogen budget module with the goal of predicting n loads in different hydrologic pathways we were not able to satisfactorily calibrate the nutrient loading module above acceptable thresholds as defined in section 3 3 1 this was likely due to large uncertainties in calibration data and unreasonably large error bounds on results even with the best fitting model run still the nutrient loading portion of the model was useful for exposing where data gaps exist methods used for the nutrient loading model set up are documented in supplementary material in section s2 3 3 1 swat model hydrologic calibration for managing the calibration process we used the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2014 with the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 method of abbaspour et al 2007 prior to calibration we ran a sensitivity analysis using the global latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method van griensven et al 2006 as implemented in swat cup in order to identify which parameters to use for model calibration the top three parameters to which the model was most sensitive for flow were 1 the runoff curve number at soil moisture condition ii 2 the effective stream channel hydraulic conductivity and 3 the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur lists of all calibration parameters used for flow and nutrient calibration are provided in supplementary material tables a3 and a4 respectively and are ordered by the most to least sensitive parameter we calibrated the hydrologic portion of model using daily streamflow observations messina 2016 for the period 2012 to 2014 from two sites on lower faga alu stream the deep aquifer partitioning coefficient rchrg dp was adjusted to match field estimated sgd as well as possible which allowed measured and modeled baseflow rates to be compared for validation see section 4 5 the first seven years of the model simulation period 2005 2011 were assigned as model warm up while the period from 2012 to 2013 was used for calibration we used the year 2014 as a validation period we evaluated swat performance by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metric nash and sutcliffe 1970 and assessed the proportion of observations that were bracketed at 95 model prediction uncertainty 95ppu interval we ran sufi 2 for 1000 simulations but the 95ppu was estimated only for those simulations parameter sets that provided a behavioral solution with nse threshold value of 0 5 the temporal evolution of observed daily streamflow hydrographs was reproduced by swat with nse values ranging between 0 65 and 0 86 for both calibration and validation periods indicating the ability of the model to simulate daily stream flow reasonably well fig 3 the streamflow simulation uncertainty was assessed by examining the number of observations bracketed at the 95 ppu for both the calibration and validation periods which ranged between 57 and 87 of the observations for most gauging sites and years the calculated 95ppu values were above the generally accepted value of 70 as recommended by abbaspour et al 2015 except for the lower gauging station that had only 57 of the observations bracketed but only during the 2014 simulation period 3 3 2 swat model nutrient transport calibration we based calibration for the nutrient flux portion of the swat model on a set of twenty no3 and nh4 nutrient measurements also taken between march 2013 and february 2014 by a m messina 2018 personal communication these measurements represented the only known long term dissolved nutrient dataset available for this location and time period the samples were analyzed as described in mccormick 2017 and measurement uncertainty was assessed by concurrently analyzing independent standards with known concentrations measurement error reported by mccormick ranged from 7 up to 30 which limited confidence in these data the nutrient transport calibration used the same methods as the hydrologic portion of swat with the top three most sensitive nutrient parameters being 1 the filtration capacity of stream edge 2 the denitrification threshold soil water content and 3 the in stream rate constant for hydrolysis of organic n to nh4 unfortunately it was not possible to calibrate the model to the point where 70 of the observations were bracketed at the 95 ppu model calibration attempts were suspended with the best simulation only able to bracket 60 of the calibration data nine of the nh4 measurements and fifteen of the no3 measurements at the 95 ppu to achieve even this level of calibration the parameter space had to be expanded to such a large width that the utility of the results was significantly limited 4 results 4 1 conceptual hydrogeologic model by integrating information about the study area s underlying geology with geochemical and physical measurements we were able to develop a simple conceptual model of faga alu s groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction during baseflow conditions fig 4 in its upper reaches dense trachyte and older lava flows underlie the stream stearns 1944 and dikes may also serve to impound groundwater in the shallow subsurface davis 1963 on basaltic islands dikes or low permeability structures commonly impound groundwater at high elevations takasaki and mink 1985 on a hike to the upper portion of the watershed we observed numerous springs and small tributaries indicating a general net transfer of groundwater to surface water in this area davis 1963 also documents the significance of springs in the upper faga alu watershed based on their historical water usage although this spring water is expected to be enriched in 222rn upon discharge numerous waterfalls and high turbulence throughout the upper reaches promote evasion which significantly reduces 222rn concentrations as the water flows downhill at faga alu quarry which lies at the upper edge of faga alu village the stream channel slope declines and the lithology changes to an alluvial valley fill likely with higher permeability izuka et al 2007 in the portion of the stream underlain by alluvial fill we observed low 222rn levels and declining streamflow except where two very small tributaries between sites s5 and s6 were seen to contribute water to the main branch suggesting the stream is probably losing water to the aquifer in this reach see section 4 2 below once the stream nears the coast streamflow 222rn and nutrient values spike indicating this is an area of groundwater discharge likely from a basal lens aquifer within the alluvium when corrected for mixing with high level baseflow the nutrient signature of this basal lens baseflow is a fairly close match to the composition of salinity unmixed coastal spring discharge suggesting that both of these water sources originate from the same nearshore aquifer at the shoreline coastal springs were found to have variable salinities indicating the presence of recirculated sgd however we also found that concentrations of 222rn in spring waters varied linearly with salinity fig a1 supplementary material suggesting that recirculated seawater at least at shallow depths does not spend sufficient time in the subsurface for significant 222rn ingrowth to occur previous studies in coastal aquifers show it is possible for fresh sgd to manifest as a separate layer above a deeper saline sgd fraction robinson et al 2007 kuan et al 2012 if this were the case in faga alu longer residence time recirculated sgd might be discharging at depths below detection of our survey methods although we did not detect any 222rn which we can attribute to a deep saline sgd source such a situation would not be surprising considering the abrupt bathymetry in faga alu bay in the inner portion of the bay the substrate is primarily composed of a shallow fringing reef sitting in 1 2 m of water but with very steep slopes at its margins where depths rapidly plunge to around 25 m fringing reef wedges in american samoa have been hypothesized to have lower hydraulic conductivities than underlying basaltic rocks houben et al 2018 which might contribute to the confinement of deeper sgd until reaching the reef margin where it could discharge at depth future deep water surveys along the reef margin would be useful for exploring this hypothesis further 4 2 characterization of baseflow components dissolved 222rn concentrations in the stream were generally low 6 10 dpm l except at the two sites nearest the coast sites s1 and s2 where values increased up to 42 dpm l coincident with increased 222rn concentrations between the uppermost s10 and lowermost s1 sites were increases in flow from 2700 to 3524 m3 d din concentrations from 4 to 12 µmol l and δ15n n n values from 4 5 to 11 5 fig 5 the simultaneous increase in δ15n n n and din input suggests a portion of this din may be derived from human or animal waste which both produce nitrogen with an elevated δ15n signature kendall 1998 because there were no observed surface tributaries above the lowest stream sampling sites the coincident increases in water nutrients and 222rn indicates the stream receives significant basal groundwater discharge just before exiting to the bay the 2016 seepage run showed almost the exact same pattern although 222rn concentrations through the whole stream and particularly near the stream mouth were observed to be higher up to 122 dpm l based on these observations baseflow discharge to the bay can be viewed as a mixture of two distinct components 1 baseflow sourced from high level groundwater davis 1963 here referred to as high level baseflow and 2 baseflow sourced from basal lens groundwater here referred to as basal lens baseflow we estimated the fraction of high level baseflow fs to basal lens baseflow fgw discharged in the stream estuary with a simple two endmember mixing model applied to 222rn concentrations using the groundwater end member and surface water from the upper portion of the stream as measured at site s3 1 f gw f s 1 2 f s c mix c gw c s c gw where cs is the average concentration of 222rn measured at site s3 cgw is the 222rn concentration in groundwater at production well 179 and cmix is the mixed sample 222rn concentration measured at the most coastal stream site s1 results from 2014 data indicate stream water at site s1 was composed of 67 high level baseflow 2368 m3 d and 33 1156 m3 d recently discharged basal lens baseflow and 222rn based unmixing results from 2016 data show that stream water at site s1 was composed of 66 high level baseflow 2412 m3 d and 34 1217 m3 d recently discharged basal lens baseflow although this calculation relies on some assumptions such as conservative radon behavior no radioactive decay and no atmospheric evasion over the timescale of the water flow the partitioning estimate compares very well to the flow increase as directly measured by stream gauging which in 2014 showed an addition of 957 m3 d or an additional 27 between site s3 and site s1 table 1 and in 2016 showed an additional flow increase of 37 or an additional 1339 m3 d between the lowest site site s1 and flow at site s3 table a2 supplementary material when these four separate and independent assessments of streamflow partitioning are averaged the arithmetic mean fractions of high level baseflow and recently discharged basal lens baseflow at site s1 are 67 and 33 respectively which were the fractions we used for calculations of nutrient fluxes through these pathways it should be noted that we did not take nutrient measurements or calculate sgd fluxes in 2016 therefore the 2016 seepage run data was used for streamflow partitioning only we calculated baseflow nutrient flux rates by multiplying the respective measured flow rates by the nutrient concentrations observed in each baseflow component high level and basal lens baseflow total baseflow loading of din and po4 3 to the bay were estimated to be 0 72 0 08 and 0 38 0 04 kg d respectively when partitioned with eqs 1 and 2 basal lens baseflow was estimated to have delivered 0 47 0 06 kg din d and 0 16 0 02 kg po4 3 d whereas only 0 25 0 03 kg din d and 0 22 0 03 kg po4 3 d were delivered by high level baseflow table 2 nutrient flux uncertainties were propagated from uncertainties in baseflow discharge and analytical errors of nutrient concentration values 4 3 sgd rates and nutrient fluxes 4 3 1 time series sgd fluxes during the stationary time series 222rn concentrations at the intake point averaged 4 8 dpm l range of 2 9 to 8 2 dpm l salinities averaged 26 9 range of 22 3 to 33 1 and the thickness of the sgd affected brackish plume averaged 38 cm range of 7 to 70 cm while the highest 222rn concentrations and the lowest salinities generally occurred at low tide as expected a continuous input of higher 222rn and lower salinity water from the nearby stream mouth was also detectable in the time series data conversion of submarine groundwater dischargern concentrations to sgd fluxes with the transient radon balance model yielded an average fresh sgd estimate of 2959 1629 m3 d to the central plume where the intake was located fig a2 supplementary material however because the time series measurement was taken just outside of the stream mouth the time series and survey points near this area were actually detecting a mixture of 222rn from coastal sgd and recently discharged basal lens baseflow from the nearshore tidally affected part of the stream subtracting the basal lens baseflow fraction 1156 117 m3 d as calculated in section 4 2 left an estimated sgd rate of 1803 1633 m3 d as groundwater coming from the coastal part of the central portion of the bay only this does assume that most or all of the 222rn from high level baseflow has evaded by the time it reaches the coast which if not would bias the coastal sgd fraction of the total measured sgd to be a slight overestimate 4 3 2 spatial distribution of sgd from coastal survey measurements the coastal water survey revealed three distinct groundwater discharge zones or plumes one each on the northern central and southern portions of the coastline fig 6 we found the highest 222rn concentrations up to 7 4 dpm l and sgd fluxes averaging 2623 1653 m3 d in the central plume which was centered just to the south of the stream outlet the southern plume had the lowest 222rn concentrations and sgd fluxes up to 4 7 dpm l and averaging 266 138 m3 d respectively with the northern plume having 222rn concentrations up to 5 0 dpm l and sgd fluxes averaging 846 78 m3 d 4 3 3 total sgd and nutrient flux scaling with coastal survey data the time series measurement provided critical information about temporal variability in sgd rates but only for discharge to the central plume therefore to calculate tidally integrated average fresh sgd fluxes to the whole bay the time series estimated discharge was upscaled to include discharge from the northern and southern plumes as well using the spatially distributed sgd information from the survey as described in section 3 2 3 calculated scaling factors were 0 10 0 08 for the southern plume and 0 32 0 21 for the northern plume or in other words sgd rates estimated during the survey showed the southern and northern plumes discharged 10 and 32 respectively of the central plume s sgd rate see section 4 3 2 bay wide sgd flux was calculated by multiplying these factors by the central plume s tidally averaged and baseflow corrected sgd rate 1803 1603 m3 d and summing flux from all three plumes which yielded an estimated sgd rate of 2587 1775 m3 d to the whole inner bay we calculated daily nutrient fluxes from sgd by multiplying coastal discharge rates by the average of salinity unmixed coastal spring nutrient concentrations table 1 fluxes were calculated to be 1 38 1 18 kg din d and 0 40 0 32 kg po4 3 d table 2 nutrient flux uncertainties were propagated from uncertainties in sgd rates and the standard deviation of averaging the nutrient concentration values of coastal spring waters 4 4 nearshore water quality in faga alu s coastal waters levels of din 1 1 to 9 2 µmol l and po4 3 0 2 to 2 0 µmol l in samples taken near to the shore were higher than those found in samples farther offshore 1 1 to 1 7 µmol din l and 0 2 to 0 3 µmol po4 3 l indicating local terrestrial nutrient sources have a detectable impact on the bay s water quality fig 6 typically n p ratios in oceanic waters are near 16 1 however n p ratios in faga alu s baseflow and sgd are for the most part disproportionately lower averaging around 6 1 in faga alu s coastal waters ratios ranged between 7 1 to 20 1 and averaged 12 1 suggesting nitrogen limiting conditions this shows that sgd not only has an impact on the amount of n and p in the bay but also on the balance of these nutrients which can have implications for biologic processes that control factors such as eutrophication within the bay nutrient concentrations are elevated in the northern relative to the southern bay fig 6 which is likely caused by circulation within the bay storlazzi et al 2018 as well as heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of sgd the northern and central plumes show discharge rates that are 5 and 10 times higher than the southern plume respectively and the persistent clockwise circulating current storlazzi et al 2014 would be expected to transport stream water and its associated nutrient load to the north rather than to the south 4 5 swat model results coastally discharging water budget components otherwise referred to as hydraulic pathways were simulated directly and indirectly with swat these included baseflow lateral flow surface runoff and sgd which was interpreted to be equivalent to deep aquifer recharge as sgd is not an explicit swat model output variable the swat model uses a water budget approach to partition precipitation inputs into evapotranspiration surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater recharge which is itself partitioned between deep aquifer recharge and baseflow using the assumption that the island s groundwater system is in a steady state the deep aquifer recharge calculated by swat of 2578 m3 d was interpreted to represent fresh sgd flux as all water recharged to an island s deep aquifer defined as the region where water no longer interacts with surface water bodies or roots must eventually discharge as sgd high level and basal lens baseflow were also interpreted from swat results by applying our conceptual model described in section 4 1 the conceptual model shows that stream baseflow originates from two distinctive aquifers 1 the high level aquifer and 2 the basal lens aquifer to approximate this scenario we divided the swat calculated baseflow into high level baseflow and basal lens baseflow by totaling baseflow from the sub basins above and below the western margin of the alluvial unit respectively based on this the swat calculated baseflow of 3203 m3 d was partitioned into 2075 m3 d of high level or upper watershed baseflow and 1128 m3 d of basal lens or lower watershed baseflow comparison between modeled and field measured water balance components showed good agreement within 2 13 and 0 3 rpd for basal lens baseflow high level baseflow and sgd respectively table 2 although streamflow via surface runoff and lateral flow were not measured the swat model provided estimates of these components at 5888 m3 d and 2303 m3 d respectively which sums to about 59 of the total annual stream flow anthropogenic din sources used for n input in the swat model included piggeries osds units and agricultural inputs which together accounted for 2317 kg n yr of n loading to the watershed the remainder of n inputs to the model were internally calculated in swat from natural cycling of organic materials based on swat land use databases limitations in calibration data as well as natural variability of nitrogen distribution potentially due to heterogeneity in sources ph and redox conditions resulted in unacceptably high uncertainties on results of the swat nutrient transport module the level of uncertainty was unsatisfactory for three reasons 1 less than 70 of the observations could be bracketed by the 95 ppu a generally accepted threshold defined by abbaspour et al 2015 2 to achieve a solution where 60 of the calibration data were bracketed by the 95 ppu the range in uncertainty for modeled loading rates encompassed several orders of magnitude and 3 other model parameters such as rates of n transformation processes also showed uncertainties ranging across several orders of magnitude suggesting that these processes were poorly constrained simulated ranges in din export to the bay as bracketed by the 95 ppu through each hydrologic pathway were calculated by the swat model to be 0 04 to 2 16 kg n d in surface runoff 0 05 to 1 39 kg n d in lateral flow 0 01 to 0 46 kg n d in upper watershed baseflow 0 12 to 0 59 kg n d in lower watershed baseflow and 1 74 to 7 41 kg n d in deep aquifer recharge i e sgd fraction model calculated rates of n uptake and denitrification were similarly wide ranging from 0 38 to 12 9 kg n d and 0 69 to 37 8 kg n d respectively indicating that constraint on these processes was poor while simulated estimates of din export encompassed the equivalent measured fluxes between their upper and lower bounds this was not surprising considering how large the ranges were although the results of the swat n transport simulation were unreliable this exercise was valuable in that it made clear where current data gaps exist and underscored the need for a more extensive dataset when calibrating a highly parameterized model such as swat as such future field efforts should focus on quantifying surface water nutrient concentrations at higher temporal resolutions and across all representative streamflow discharge rates 5 discussion 5 1 implications for natural resources management our results indicate sgd is an important factor in coastal nutrient loading in faga alu and likely in other steep basaltic island watersheds with perennial streams this is not surprising as many other studies conducted in similar settings such as jeju island and the hawaiian islands have shown sgd may deliver 5 to 62 times the nutrient load of streams e g garrison et al 2003 bishop et al 2017 knee et al 2016 dulai et al 2016 despite these findings throughout most of the coastal u s and specifically in american samoa regulatory efforts are primarily concentrated on surface water quality management only as epa 2016 very little regulatory action has been focused on groundwater as a hydrologic pathway for pollution however our findings suggest that coastal resource management may be more successful if both groundwater and stream water quality are considered when developing sampling protocols and applying tmdl standards although few jurisdictions have even developed groundwater quality standards e g kimsey 2005 n j a c 2018 american samoa s small size and strong incentive to maintain fragile reefs could make the territory a reasonable location to pioneer this type of regulatory standard our field results also indicate that impacts to groundwater quality are a major factor on stream water quality this is an important consideration when designing water quality monitoring protocols in american samoa water quality monitoring site selection is primarily based upon accessibility some streams are sampled at stream mouths and some are sampled farther upstream didonato 2004 as epa 2013b however if some stream samples consist of high level baseflow only and others taken near the coast contain a fraction of basal lens baseflow this reduces the comparability of monitoring results between different streams this issue could be mitigated by sampling across different stream reaches and considering tidal effects in a standardized manner 5 2 conceptual model insights the conceptual hydrogeologic model of groundwater surface water coastal water interaction suggested by the results of this study provides new insight into hydrologic processes occurring in small steep volcanic island watersheds while geochemical methods similar to those applied here have been used to examine groundwater surface water interaction in continental streams estuaries and wetlands genereux et al 1993 cook et al 2008 gleeson et al 2013 and also to assess groundwater coastal water interaction at the shoreline e g jacob et al 2009 very few other studies have attempted to trace interactions in water and nutrient flux between hydrologic pathways on a ridge to reef scale e g jarsjö et al 2007 the conceptual hydrogeologic model is likely valid in other watersheds around tutuila and in other high island settings specifically where near shore coastal plains are underlain by more permeable alluvium or marine sediments human development is often concentrated in coastal regions and when sediments underlying developments are more permeable than the surrounding rock as appears to be the case in faga alu they may facilitate a more direct connection between anthropogenic contaminant sources and basal groundwater in these areas groundwater may play a larger role in coastal nutrient transport than surface water however the reverse may be true in settings where development is concentrated above less permeable layers which has been determined to be the case in oahu hawaii where a low permeability marine carbonate formation locally known as caprock has been shown to protect the underlying aquifer from contaminants oki et al 1998 therefore in basaltic island settings the partitioning of nutrients from non point sources into different hydrologic pathways is likely to be highly dependent on the relative permeabilities of different nearshore geologic layers this farther underscores the importance of developing an accurate conceptualization of local hydrogeologic systems when designing sampling schemes and assessing nutrient fluxes on a ridge to reef scale the locality specific understanding of groundwater surface water interaction was also useful for interpreting results of the swat watershed model discharge or loss between groundwater and a stream is generally controlled by water table elevation which makes this parameter important for predicting the distribution of baseflow in a watershed however the swat model uses a simplified linear reservoir model to control loss or gain from groundwater and does not consider water table elevations for baseflow partitioning this gap is commonly filled by coupling surface water models with groundwater models e g kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 however subsurface models rely on calibrated parameterization of stream conductance and hydraulic conductivity and in settings such as faga alu the variable and steep terrain kampf and burges 2007 as well as a lack of groundwater elevation data apart from a single well in the valley imparts large uncertainties to groundwater models instead we used the conceptual hydrogeologic model to determine where the local water table elevation was generally below the stream bed losing reach below the quarry and above the stream bed gaining reach above the quarry and area proximal to the coast the model s deep aquifer baseflow partitioning coefficient was then adjusted to match field estimated sgd rates in this manner measured fluxes from high level and basal lens baseflow could be compared against swat s estimates and predictions of surface runoff and lateral flow could be developed likely within the same or greater certainty as would have been achieved through a more time consuming and costly groundwater modeling process 5 3 nitrogen source tracing while extensive source dependent nutrient tracing efforts were not performed in this study moderate correlation between elevated din concentrations and δ15nn n isotopes in baseflow and coastal surface water r2 of 0 93 and 0 45 respectively provided insight into the transport history of nutrients from source to sink the correlation between δ15nn n values and din values suggests a large component of sampled din originates from a high δ15nn n source such as wastewater or manure as opposed to synthetic agricultural fertilizers which typically have δ15nn n values near 0 kendall and aravena 2000 this result is reasonable as most agricultural operations in the valley are small and focused on traditional samoan crops that require few to no chemical inputs another management need in american samoa is to better constrain the impacts of piggeries vs osds sourced wastewater falkland et al 2002 shuler et al 2017 unfortunately the overlap of δ15nn n values from animal manure and wastewater böhlke 2003 in addition to complications from mixing of nutrients from different sources prevents the reliable partitioning of din from these sources with this method more specific source dependent tracers like microbial source tracing scott et al 2002 kirs et al 2011 or wastewater specific compounds petrie et al 2015 krall et al 2018 would be useful for separating and prioritizing the impacts between human wastewater and pig manure in samoa 5 4 uncertainties and limitations due to the inherent challenges in measuring sgd there are many well known uncertainties associated with using the 222rn mass balance model approach burnett et al 2007 schubert et al 2019 burnett et al 2007 describes selection of an appropriate 222rn endmember activity to be one of the most critical however obtaining enough endmember samples to constrain uncertainty is difficult knee et al 2016 peterson et al 2008 and zhu et al 2019 acknowledges that qualitative judgements are usually a major factor in determining which samples are chosen to represent the endmember we acknowledge this is the case for this study as well therefore we applied all available information to constrain the sgd 222rn end member including four coastal spring samples linear salinity unmixing approach yielded a 222rn endmember value of 116 54 dpm l one well sample measured activity of 124 2 dpm l and through rearranging eqs 1 and 2 we back calculated an estimated 222rn concentration in the basal lens baseflow of 142 9 dpm l at stream sample site s1 although each of these independent observations yielded fairly similar results additional samples from any of the above would increase confidence in the endmember value used selection of the 222rn endmember value was also subject to another major assumption that all of the 222rn detected was derived from fresh groundwater and not recirculated seawater we made this assumption because our sampling strategy indicated that of the recirculated sgd detected in coastal springs none contained significant levels of 222rn this is somewhat surprising as recirculated seawater with a residence time long enough to pick up a 222rn signal is typically a significant part of sgd budgets e g garrison et al 2003 knee et al 2016 however as discussed in section 4 1 some studies have suggested it is possible for fresh sgd to manifest as a separate layer above a deeper saline sgd fraction robinson et al 2007 kuan et al 2012 if a deeper layer of longer residence time saline sgd existed in faga alu we may have missed it by only sampling end members in the surficial layer extreme gradients in the nearshore bathymetry caused by a potentially low permeability reef wedge can be seen where the reef abruptly plunges from 1 to 2 m down to 25 m this feature could have obscured a deep longer residence time sgd signal from our survey supplementary material fig a3 it is feasible that sgd from below the reef wedge may remain unmixed with the shallow waters we sampled therefore even if the coastal spring 222rn salinity ratios found in our samples only represented a surficial layer of fresh sgd these samples were nonetheless representative of our survey and time series data in other words if deeper longer residence time recirculated sgd does occur in faga alu then a we likely did not detect it meaning it did not affect our sgd flux calculation and b any undetected deep sgd likely did not contain a significant fresh fraction because this would have caused a discrepancy in the swat water budget estimates based on balancing discharge from both baseflow fractions and sgd another uncertainty to consider is the use of assumed ambient 222rn activities from non sgd sources while this is a fairly standard practice e g burnett and dulaiova 2003 bishop et al 2017 a reasonable method for assessing the effect of these and other parameters on the final model output is to perform a sensitivity analysis on different parameters of interest we performed a sensitivity analysis on the 222rn box model parameters table 3 and the results suggest the ambient 222rn activity parameters have a negligible effect on the final output the sensitivity test also showed the horizontal area of the plume has a significant effect on final sgd rates considering this issue is shared by nearly all previous studies using this method e g dulaiova et al 2010 swarzenski et al 2013 we acknowledge that the uncertainty in simplification of the plume geometry is very difficult to constrain and represents a weakness of the method for this study since the plume definition was dependent on the survey track we believe that the plumes were well defined vertically and along the shoreline but are more uncertain in the offshore direction we also assumed that the geometry of the plumes did not significantly change during the survey period these limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the study results the swat model uses a simplified linear reservoir model for representation of the groundwater system which applies a single parameter for total groundwater recharge partitioning to the deep aquifer interpreted here as sgd hence swat s sgd results are sensitive to this parameter table a3 supplementary material additionally this interpretation hinges on the assumption that watershed boundaries also represent aquifer divides which is reasonable based on the horizontal bedding of the adjacent geologic units and estimates of water table elevations from izuka 1999 and izuka et al 2007 that show that the water table conforming closely to the land s surface also the hydrologic portion of the swat model was calibrated with streamflow data from two stations black diamonds in fig 2 and therefore different parameter values were assigned for the upper watershed above the quarry and for the lower watershed below this was justified geologically considering that the quarry location coincides with the contact between basalts and alluvium however in reality the local geology is probably heterogeneous particularly within the basalt unit itself thus the bi modal parameterization of the model area is likely to be somewhat of an oversimplification 6 conclusions by combining a terrestrial and coastal hydrologic field investigation with model based watershed characterization we were able to reveal impacts of different nutrient sources and hydrologic pathways in a small american samoan watershed this methodological framework demonstrates how snapshot scale observations and transient watershed modeling can be integrated to develop a fairly comprehensive understanding of water and nutrient dynamics in steep watersheds on tropical basaltic islands in faga alu watershed during low flow conditions field measurements suggest sgd and nearshore basal lens baseflow contribute nearly all of the terrigenous din to the coastline with high level baseflow contributing very little groundwater discharge was also found to be significant in coastal loading of dissolved po4 3 seepage run measurements indicated groundwater discharge to the stream occurs as two geochemically distinct fractions 1 high level baseflow and 2 basal lens baseflow that discharges near the stream estuary during baseflow conditions measurements indicated high level streamflow contributes about two thirds of the stream s water but nearshore basal lens baseflow contributes the majority of the stream s nutrient load 222rn based measurements suggest that while saltwater recirculation does occur in the shallow portion of the nearshore aquifer that seawater does not spend sufficient time in the subsurface to pick up a 222rn signature the geologic structure of the fringing reef could contain deeper recirculated sgd but we were not able to confirm the existence of such a source these field results facilitated the development of a conceptual model of groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction within steep basaltic island watersheds this conceptual model was foundational for developing the watershed model and interpreting its results the swat model matched field estimated water fluxes reasonably well within 2 13 and 0 3 rpd for basal lens baseflow high level baseflow and sgd respectively the n transport capabilities of swat were also tested however limitations in the availability and quality of existing nutrient data prevented satisfactory calibration of this portion of the model overall field and model results suggest sgd is an important water budget component in this and likely other geologically similar watersheds additionally because our measurements indicated that both sgd and basal lens baseflow are likely to be important coastal nutrient loading pathways in these systems both should be considered when developing nutrient sampling and management plans although sampling surface runoff baseflow and groundwater nutrients from multiple locations throughout a watershed would require a significant deviation from current water quality management practices in american samoa if these data can be collected they would be very useful for improving upon existing watershed models continued development of hydrological models in faga alu would be a valuable future research activity for further developing these

5597,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is recognized as an important nutrient delivery mechanism in coastal ecosystems however water quality management in these settings is typically focused on surface waters often ignoring sgd and nearshore groundwater surface water interaction in this study we integrate a comprehensive radionuclide tracer based field investigation with watershed modeling to examine groundwater surface water partitioning and to quantify nutrient loading from fresh sgd and streamflow in a small embayment located in american samoa measurements included streamflow sgd rate and environmental tracers including 222rn concentrations nutrient levels and nitrogen isotope values in groundwater and surface water samples we then used the soil and water assessment tool swat to validate measured baseflow and sgd rates and also to estimate storm flows which were not measured in the field field results showed sgd was a significant delivery mechanism for coastal nutrient loads whereas baseflow nutrient loading from the upper watershed was minimal during the study period seepage run measurements informed a conceptual hydrogeologic model of groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction which we applied in developing the watershed model the swat model simulated flow observations satisfactorily and indicated baseflow accounts for only 39 of the total annual stream flow with surface runoff and lateral flow i e interflow making up the rest by examining water and nutrient exchange between groundwater surface water and sgd this study provides a more complete understanding of the fate and transport of water and nutrients in small island watersheds where anthropogenic activities potentially threaten the health of coastal ecosystems keywords submarine groundwater discharge sgd soil and water assessment tool swat watershed modeling coastal nutrient loading groundwater stream water interaction american samoa 1 introduction discharge of anthropogenic nutrients to coastal areas has the potential to significantly impact nearshore water quality and affect reef health bahr et al 2015 dulai et al 2016 in recent decades the effect of submarine groundwater discharge sgd on coastal nutrient budgets has become widely recognized e g johannes and hearn 1985 dulaiova et al 2006 rodellas et al 2015 and sgd has been found to be a particularly significant nutrient delivery mechanism in tropical volcanic island settings zektser 2000 moosdorf et al 2015 dulai et al 2016 nonetheless environmental water quality management typically focuses on surface waters often ignoring sgd the u s environmental protection agency s clean water act section 303 d requires states and territories to establish water quality standards and total maximum daily loads tmdls for nutrients in receiving waters in many places including the territory of american samoa such standards apply only to fresh surface and open coastal waters as epa 2013a thereby overlooking potentially important nutrient pathways spatial variability in groundwater discharge directly to streams may also affect the validity of tmdl measurements which are assumed to originate from surface water sources only recent studies from streams e g avery et al 2018 mangrove environments e g gleeson et al 2013 and large tidal estuaries e g makings et al 2014 indicate that groundwater has significant impacts on both coastal water quality and nearshore stream water quality underscoring the importance of considering groundwater surface water interaction when designing water quality monitoring protocols however accurate quantification of groundwater discharge to streams and coastlines is inherently challenging because available methods typically rely on measurements and conceptual models with high uncertainties this underscores the need to develop an improved understanding of how land use groundwater and surface water interact to deliver nutrients to the coast the naturally occurring noble gas radon 222 222rn has become one of the most widely used tracers for determining sgd rates e g burnett and dulaiova 2003 charette et al 2007 sadat noori et al 2015 and when combined with water quality sampling this method is widely used for estimating associated coastal nutrient fluxes e g dulaiova et al 2010 gleeson et al 2013 wang et al 2017 radon has also been applied successfully in stream headwaters channels and estuaries for investigating the magnitude and locations of groundwater surface water interactions in terrestrial settings e g peterson et al 2010 cartwright et al 2011 unland et al 2013 gleeson et al 2018 however very few studies have integrated these approaches and investigated groundwater surface water and coastal water interactions on a whole watershed scale e g corbett et al 1999 and to our knowledge none have done so in a tropical basaltic island setting groundwater becomes enriched in 222rn through prolonged contact with aquifer material and pore water 222rn concentrations typically reach an equilibrium between ingrowth and radioactive decay within a couple of weeks after leaving the aquifer dissolved 222rn has a short half life of 3 8 days exhibits conservative behavior through the full salinity range and shows low concentrations in surface and ocean waters making it an excellent tracer of recently discharged groundwater predictable isotopic fractionation of nitrogen n in dissolved nitrate and nitrite δ15nn n has been used extensively for tracing sources of nutrients in groundwater e g kendall and aravena 2000 cole et al 2006 hunt 2007 stream water e g lindauet al 1989 and coastal surface waters e g garrison et al 2007 wong et al 2014 wiegner 2016 bishop et al 2017 commonly referenced ranges for δ15nn n values indicate synthetic fertilizer influenced waters have relatively low δ15nn n values 5 to 5 natural soil processes typically produce porewaters with intermediate δ15nn n values 2 to 6 and manure and human wastewater leachates generally produce higher δ15nn n values albeit with a wide range 4 to 25 kendall and aravena 2000 dailer et al 2010 fenech et al 2012 abaya et al 2018a b this method does have a number of limitations for example wastewater influenced δ15nn n values in tropical island settings have been found to encompass a wide range from 5 to 23 bishop et al 2017 amato et al 2016 hunt and rosa 2009 rogers et al 2012 nonetheless δ15nn n remains a valuable tool for providing clues about nutrient sources which has made it a widely used source dependent tracer despite well known limitations xue et al 2009 in the hydrologic sciences it is common and some may argue a standard practice to integrate numerical models with field based studies to constrain or validate estimates produced by either method e g anderson 1987 biondi 2012 the wide spatial coverage of models also makes them useful for management agencies tasked with covering large areas that are difficult to fully characterize with field methods however model accuracy depends on appropriate conceptualization of the hydrologic system and sufficient calibration and validation data to constrain uncertainty and ensure accuracy watershed scale sgd focused field studies that integrate modeling components e g michael 2005 nakada et al 2011 often apply groundwater models capable of simulating variable density flow such as seawat guo and langevin 2002 or feflow wasy 2004 however calibration data for these fairly complex models is often limited leading to overparameterization and problems with equifinality kirchner 2006 on the other hand availability of above surface hydrologic data is typically better due to the existence of nation wide meteorological and streamflow measurement networks slack and landwehr 1992 nrc 2004 these data can be used to calibrate watershed models such as the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 2014 or gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis gssha downer and ogden 2006 that apply the water budget approach to partition hydrologic inputs between different pathways by using a water budget approach watershed models are also able to produce estimates of subsurface inputs and returns to surface waters without requiring difficult to obtain subsurface data although watershed models lack the fine scale resolution available with groundwater models at the watershed scale these models can provide some of the same benefits where more detailed subsurface simulation is not needed e g oberdorfer 2003 lee and kim 2007 in american samoa anthropogenic nutrient loading and sedimentation to coastal zones have been identified as primary factors in reducing the reef s ability for recovery from increasing environmental stressors mccook 1999 craig 2009 long term studies of reefs on tutuila the territory s main island suggest sgd is likely to be a significant explanatory variable in reef health houk et al 2013 whitall and holst 2015 however prior to this study there have been no known attempts to quantify sgd and its associated nutrient loading in american samoa to fill this gap we used measurements of environmental tracers including 222rn dissolved nutrients and nitrogen isotopes to trace groundwater discharge partition baseflow and fresh sgd nutrient flux and explore probable nutrient sources within a small tropical island watershed and embayment field observations provided insights for informing conceptual model development and were useful for model calibration and validation watersheds in american samoa provide unique settings to examine nutrient budgets on a basin wide scale due to small drainage areas relatively good accessibility and high precipitation rates that drive measurably significant water fluxes in this study we hypothesize that multiple hydrologic pathways including groundwater surface water and fresh sgd all act as significant controls on coastal nutrient loading in small tropical watersheds exemplified by those of american samoa to investigate this question we integrated a detailed geochemical field investigation with watershed modeling in order to partition the impact of water and nutrient discharge from different hydrologic pathways our primary objectives are to develop a better understanding of groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction and to quantify coastal nutrient loading impacts from non point sources in tropical island watersheds 2 study area faga alu watershed consists of a small 2 1 km2 steep heavily forested valley with one main perennial stream draining into faga alu bay a small arm of pago pago harbor fig 1 geologically the watershed is carved from dense inner caldera basalts formed about 1 2 mya and the valley bottom is filled with a gently inclined wedge of terrestrial and marine alluvium that extends about 1 km upstream from the coast stearns 1944 the regional scale aquifer permeability of the inter caldera basalts is likely to be significantly lower than that of the terrestrial alluvium based on aquifer properties of similar geologic units in western tutuila izuka et al 2007 however in faga alu the only known well is located in the alluvium precluding direct comparison of each unit s hydrogeologic properties significant springs found in the inter caldera unit indicate that it contains high level groundwater which is likely to be impounded by sub surface structures such as dikes perching layers or potentially faults davis 1963 in the upper watershed the soil type is primarily silty clay to clay loam lithic hapludolls ranging from 20 to 150 cm deep and the alluvial unit is covered with a fairly deep 150 cm mixture of well drained very stony silty clay loams and poorly drained silty clay to fine sandy loams nakamura 1984 faga alu s climate is warm and humid with year round average temperatures around 28 c and annual rainfall between 3000 and 6000 mm year depending on elevation the wet season extends from october to may and the drier season spans june to september in faga alu anthropogenic activities have been connected to recent degradation of reef health and reduction of stream water quality leading to its designation as a federal priority watershed management area by the united states coral reef task force sauafea le au 2013 both stream and coastal water quality in faga alu have been classified as impaired since 2006 as epa 2016 and american samoa environmental protection agency as epa coral reef monitoring suggests that faga alu s benthic ecosystem is one of the most impacted on the island houk et al 2005 previous studies implicate the stream as a pathway for terrigenous sediments and excessive nutrient loads to the bay didonato 2005 messina 2016 messina biggs 2016 however the role of groundwater as a hydrologic pathway for terrigenous contamination remains unconstrained the three primary anthropogenic nutrient sources on tutuila have been previously determined to be 1 on site wastewater disposal systems osds 2 widespread small scale pig farming operations and 3 agricultural fertilizers falkland et al 2002 polidoro et al 2017 shuler et al 2017 but the relative impact of each source on coastal ecosystems remains poorly understood 3 methods 3 1 water sampling and stream gauging methods we collected groundwater coastal water and stream water samples throughout a weeklong sampling campaign in the dry season of 2014 during a period with no significant rainfall this included a longitudinal sampling and measurement transect up faga alu stream hereafter referred to as a seepage run rosenberry and labaugh 2008 which we conducted during a single 24 hour period through the lower 1 km stream section during the seepage run we measured streamflow at ten separate locations with a price type pygmy current meter and the velocity area method turnipseed and sauer 2010 and sampled stream water at seven of those locations throughout the reach between faga alu quarry and the lowest section of stream that was not affected by the tide during the sampling period during a boat based coastal water survey see section 3 2 2 we collected coastal water samples from faga alu bay one day after the seepage run we identified three areas along the shoreline of the bay with brackish coastal springs and sampled these twice each at low tide throughout the week we also sampled the only production well in the valley well 179 all sampling locations are shown on fig 1 and streamflow data are given in supplementary material tables a1 and a2 to verify the seepage run results we conducted a second seepage run on august 10th 2016 and measured streamflow and dissolved 222rn concentrations but not nutrients or other parameters at many of the same sites as in 2014 to reduce measurement uncertainty streamflow for the second seepage run was measured with a sontek flowtracker handheld acoustic doppler velocimeter which has a higher velocity resolution and accuracy than the pygmy meter we used in 2014 sampling and analysis for 222rn concentrations was performed in the same way as was done in 2014 with all direct streamflow measurement values we conservatively assumed a measurement error of 10 as typical standard errors with pygmy meters have been reported to be between 3 and 6 sauer and meyer 1992 and field calculated measurement uncertainties for flowtracker data were always well below 10 for all nutrient samples we also collected in situ temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen data with a ysi multiparameter sonde 6600v2 4 model nutrient and isotope samples were collected in acid washed 60 ml hdpe bottles triple rinsed with sample water before filling nutrient samples were kept refrigerated whereas n isotope samples were frozen until analysis all nutrient and isotope samples were filtered through 0 45 µm capsule filters thus all measured nutrient concentrations and comparable modeled nitrogen concentrations reported here refer to dissolved species unless the particulate fraction is specifically indicated we collected grab samples for 222rn in 250 ml glass bottles with no headspace and analyzed them the same day as collection with a rad h2o radon in water analyzer manufactured by durridge inc billerica ma usa because of 222rn s short half life 3 8 days 222rn grab sample values were decay corrected to the time of collection we analyzed all water samples for dissolved nutrients including nitrate and nitrite n n ammonium nh4 phosphate po4 3 silicate si total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp dissolved 222rn concentration and nitrogen isotope δ15n n n values of n n in samples having 1 µmol l of n n the only exceptions were samples collected in 2016 which were only analyzed for 222rn concentrations nutrient samples were analyzed within two weeks of collection at the university of hawaii school of ocean and earth science and technology soest laboratory for analytical biogeochemistry using the methods described in armstrong et al 1967 and grasshoff et al 1999 nitrogen isotope samples were measured within 4 months of collection at the university of hawaii s stable isotope biogeochemistry lab using the denitrifier method of sigman et al 2001 isotopic results are expressed here in per mil notation relative to the isotopic reference standard of air coastal groundwater is composed of both oceanic and fresh water however because this study focuses on assessing nutrient flux from terrigenous sources only the oceanic component in coastal spring samples was mathematically unmixed to reveal nutrient levels of only the fresh component of each sample regardless of seawater dilution this is commonly done in settings where the subterranean estuary and recirculating seawater are not a significant source of nutrients street et al 2008 and was performed here with an unmixing calculation e g hunt and rosa 2009 that assumed conservative nutrient behavior during mixing and was based on an oceanic end member from tutuila this calculation allowed the derivation of nutrient fluxes solely contributed by fresh groundwater we collected duplicate samples at five locations and analytical uncertainty was assessed using the relative percent difference rpd method which is defined as the absolute value of the difference between two duplicates expressed as a percentage of their mean average rpd was 1 4 for n n 0 5 for si 0 6 for po4 3 2 4 for nh4 0 8 for tdn 1 9 for tdp and 6 8 for δ15n n n in about half of the samples concentrations of po4 3 were measured to be slightly greater than tdp this is likely due to small inconsistencies between the two analysis methods and suggests that in most of the samples collected nearly all of the tdp is in the form of orthophosphate 3 2 radon based sgd field estimates dissolved 222rn was used as a groundwater tracer in a temporally and spatially distributed non steady state radon flux model to calculate bay wide sgd rates following the methods of burnett and dulaiova 2003 and dulaiova et al 2010 we assessed temporal tide dependent variability with a time series of 222rn measurements taken from a fixed nearshore location over a 48 hour period this was coupled with a coastal water survey to assess spatial variation in 222rn throughout the inner bay for both the time series and survey 222rn concentrations were measured by pumping surface water through an air water exchanger connected to a radon in air monitor rad aqua durridge inc to obtain bay wide sgd fluxes we scaled up the tidally averaged sgd flux from the stationary time series to account for the additional sgd flux observed during the coastal survey in locations adjacent to the time series location as described below 3 2 1 stationary 222rn time series the 222rn time series instrument package used a peristaltic pump that pumped surface water from the bay to an instream flow cell with no headspace attached to the ysi 6600 series sonde that continuously logged water salinity and temperature the inlet hose for the pump was connected to a moored float located at a stationary point in the bay about 50 m away from the stream mouth fig 1 after passing through the ysi water flowed into an air water exchanger where 222rn gas was extracted and pumped to the rad7 tidal height was measured by a pressure transducer placed on the seafloor at the float anchor we deployed the instrumentation for about 48 h and the rad7 was set to integrate measurements of 222rn activity every 30 min typically sgd manifests as a fresh or brackish plume that overlies denser seawater we measured plume thickness at low tide by manually conducting salinity depth profiles at the water intake and this plume thickness was used for volumetric calculations in the 222rn mass balance model change in plume thickness due to tidal dilution was calculated by subtracting the thickness of the underlying salt water layer from the total depth of the water column 3 2 2 coastal water survey we performed the coastal water survey once the time series was finished during a 3 hour period bracketing low tide we transferred the time series instrument platform to a small boat and rowed throughout the bay while the air water exchanger was supplied with surface water from a bilge pump tethered to the hull of the boat the rad7 was set to integrate 222rn activity every 5 min and data was resampled to one minute intervals yielding a total of 205 points available for interpolation during the survey three distinct plumes of sgd were detected as low salinity and high 222rn anomalies we refer to these plumes as the southern central and northern plumes during analysis the surface area and geometry of each plume was determined by nearest neighbor interpolation of measurement points and contouring of the resultant 222rn activity surface boundaries for each of the three plumes were defined as the 222rn isoline representing the mid point of the range of measured activities 3 25 dpm l we defined the bottom boundary of each plume to be the salinity 28 isohaline as indicated by salinity depth profiles that we took periodically during the survey or if salinity was consistent throughout the whole water column the full water depth was used as the plume thickness note that the time series measurement described in section 3 2 1 was performed at a location that fell inside of the central plume additionally during the survey coastal water samples were collected for analysis in the same manner as stream and groundwater samples 3 2 3 sgd flux scaling fresh and recirculated fractions the 222rn flux model modified from dulaiova et al 2010 was used to calculate sgd fluxes for both survey and time series data the model uses a mass balance approach that relies on accounting for 222rn losses and additions from local and offshore processes that are not related to sgd we assumed that ambient 222rn activities from oceanic or atmospheric sources were comparable to those found in the hawaiian islands and used an ambient 222rn activity of 0 03 dpm l kelly and glenn 2012 a local excess 222rn activity of 0 08 dpm l supported by in situ 226ra street et al 2008 and an offshore 222rn activity of 0 087 dpm l derived from the offshore 226ra fröllje et al 2016 we assumed residence time of sgd affected groundwater within faga alu s inner bay to be 12 2 h the length of one tidal cycle which is within the ranges of published residence times from water circulation studies of faga alu storlazzi et al 2014 vetter and vargas angel 2014 hourly measurements of local wind speed and air temperature were obtained from the american samoa observatory noaa earth system research laboratory esrl weather station at cape matatula to assess the sgd endmember composition we collected groundwater samples from the only well in the valley and from four coastal spring locations at low tide the 222rn activity measured in coastal springs and the well showed a linear mixing relationship with salinity fig a1 supplementary material which suggests that while seawater recirculation does occur the nearshore reef substrate or the re infiltrated coastal water does not add a significant quantity of 222rn to groundwater during this process likely because circulation is rapid and recirculated seawater does not spend enough time in the subsurface to collect measurable radon the linearity of this relationship also indicates the fresh coastal spring 222rn endmembers when corrected for dilution by seawater are quite consistent with the 222rn activity measured at well 179 therefore the 222rn concentration from the well was used as the groundwater end member for fresh sgd calculations and the standard deviation of all measured salinity unmixed 222rn concentrations table 1 which equaled 54 dpm l or about 44 of the 222rn endmember value was used as the uncertainty on this quantity to be propagated through sgd calculations it should be noted that by using the fresh groundwater 222rn endmember for sgd calculations only the fresh sgd rate was calculated assuming that the recirculated fraction did not carry a 222rn signature this assumption was indicated by high salinity low 222rn water found at coastal springs most likely resulting from seawater intrusion to the coastal aquifer at high tide on relatively short time scales further this assumption is discussed in section 5 4 1 please note that all future references to sgd in this work indicate fresh groundwater discharge only the time series calculations provided a temporally integrated sgd rate but for the central plume only as this was where the water intake was located on the other hand the coastal water survey provided spatially distributed sgd rates which allowed for the identification of three distinctive sgd plumes but only as a snapshot in time therefore to calculate temporally integrated sgd flux to the whole bay the ratios of survey based sgd rates in the northern and southern plumes to the survey based sgd rate in the central plume were used as scaling factors to upscale the time series derived temporally averaged sgd flux to include the other two plumes limitations of this approach included needing to make the simplifying assumptions that tidal variation in the central plume was representative of the other two plumes that sgd only discharges from the three identified plumes and that the relative magnitudes of discharge from each plume stay consistent over time these limitations could be addressed by replicating the survey at different times or repeating the time series in different locations however due to the significant amount of time required for just one time series and survey we were unable to conduct the approach repeatedly 3 3 watershed and land use modeling we used swat a physically based semi distributed watershed scale ecohydrological model arnold et al 1998 to calculate transient estimates of flow through different hydrologic pathways i e water budget components these pathways included surface runoff lateral flow i e subsurface stormflow baseflow and groundwater recharge at different spatial and temporal scales we also applied swat s n transport capabilities however limitations in the availability and quality of existing nutrient data prevented satisfactory calibration of this portion of the model the wide applicability of swat under various conditions and to different environmental problems has been demonstrated worldwide e g gassman et al 2007 2014 dadhich and nadaoka 2012 the swat model was set up with the following input data fig 2 a 3 3 m digital elevation model dem from the national geophysical data center dataset ngdc 2013 and obtained from noaa ocean and coastal services center 1 24 000 scale soil maps from the natural resources conservation service soil survey geographic ssurgo database a 2 4 2 4 m 2010 land use map from the coastal change analysis program c cap the hydrologic portion of the model was parameterized using daily rainfall and streamflow data which were collected for a different study but provided to us for this work by a m messina 2016 personal communication with supporting methodology documented in messina 2016 these data were collected at two sites within faga alu watershed during the period 2012 to 2014 daily wind speed relative humidity and maximum and minimum temperatures were only available at one of these sites solar radiation was measured at the nearby american samoa community college dataset ascc 2018 and additional relative humidity data were obtained from the noaa earth system research laboratory weather station the watershed was divided into 26 sub basins and 403 hydrological response units hrus with zero threshold values for land use soil and slope classes the model simulation was run for the period of 2005 to 2014 available data constraining the locations and magnitudes of anthropogenic nutrient sources in faga alu watershed were collected for swat s nutrient loading module locations of seventy four osds units six piggeries and 1 15 acres of agricultural lands were identified and are shown in fig a4 in the supplementary material although we parameterized sensitivity tested and worked diligently to calibrate swat s nitrogen budget module with the goal of predicting n loads in different hydrologic pathways we were not able to satisfactorily calibrate the nutrient loading module above acceptable thresholds as defined in section 3 3 1 this was likely due to large uncertainties in calibration data and unreasonably large error bounds on results even with the best fitting model run still the nutrient loading portion of the model was useful for exposing where data gaps exist methods used for the nutrient loading model set up are documented in supplementary material in section s2 3 3 1 swat model hydrologic calibration for managing the calibration process we used the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2014 with the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 method of abbaspour et al 2007 prior to calibration we ran a sensitivity analysis using the global latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method van griensven et al 2006 as implemented in swat cup in order to identify which parameters to use for model calibration the top three parameters to which the model was most sensitive for flow were 1 the runoff curve number at soil moisture condition ii 2 the effective stream channel hydraulic conductivity and 3 the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur lists of all calibration parameters used for flow and nutrient calibration are provided in supplementary material tables a3 and a4 respectively and are ordered by the most to least sensitive parameter we calibrated the hydrologic portion of model using daily streamflow observations messina 2016 for the period 2012 to 2014 from two sites on lower faga alu stream the deep aquifer partitioning coefficient rchrg dp was adjusted to match field estimated sgd as well as possible which allowed measured and modeled baseflow rates to be compared for validation see section 4 5 the first seven years of the model simulation period 2005 2011 were assigned as model warm up while the period from 2012 to 2013 was used for calibration we used the year 2014 as a validation period we evaluated swat performance by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metric nash and sutcliffe 1970 and assessed the proportion of observations that were bracketed at 95 model prediction uncertainty 95ppu interval we ran sufi 2 for 1000 simulations but the 95ppu was estimated only for those simulations parameter sets that provided a behavioral solution with nse threshold value of 0 5 the temporal evolution of observed daily streamflow hydrographs was reproduced by swat with nse values ranging between 0 65 and 0 86 for both calibration and validation periods indicating the ability of the model to simulate daily stream flow reasonably well fig 3 the streamflow simulation uncertainty was assessed by examining the number of observations bracketed at the 95 ppu for both the calibration and validation periods which ranged between 57 and 87 of the observations for most gauging sites and years the calculated 95ppu values were above the generally accepted value of 70 as recommended by abbaspour et al 2015 except for the lower gauging station that had only 57 of the observations bracketed but only during the 2014 simulation period 3 3 2 swat model nutrient transport calibration we based calibration for the nutrient flux portion of the swat model on a set of twenty no3 and nh4 nutrient measurements also taken between march 2013 and february 2014 by a m messina 2018 personal communication these measurements represented the only known long term dissolved nutrient dataset available for this location and time period the samples were analyzed as described in mccormick 2017 and measurement uncertainty was assessed by concurrently analyzing independent standards with known concentrations measurement error reported by mccormick ranged from 7 up to 30 which limited confidence in these data the nutrient transport calibration used the same methods as the hydrologic portion of swat with the top three most sensitive nutrient parameters being 1 the filtration capacity of stream edge 2 the denitrification threshold soil water content and 3 the in stream rate constant for hydrolysis of organic n to nh4 unfortunately it was not possible to calibrate the model to the point where 70 of the observations were bracketed at the 95 ppu model calibration attempts were suspended with the best simulation only able to bracket 60 of the calibration data nine of the nh4 measurements and fifteen of the no3 measurements at the 95 ppu to achieve even this level of calibration the parameter space had to be expanded to such a large width that the utility of the results was significantly limited 4 results 4 1 conceptual hydrogeologic model by integrating information about the study area s underlying geology with geochemical and physical measurements we were able to develop a simple conceptual model of faga alu s groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction during baseflow conditions fig 4 in its upper reaches dense

structures commonly impound groundwater at high elevations takasaki and mink 1985 on a hike to the upper portion of the watershed we observed numerous springs and small tributaries indicating a general net transfer of groundwater to surface water in this area davis 1963 also documents the significance of springs in the upper faga alu watershed based on their historical water usage although this spring water is expected to be enriched in 222rn upon discharge numerous waterfalls and high turbulence throughout the upper reaches promote evasion which significantly reduces 222rn concentrations as the water flows downhill at faga alu quarry which lies at the upper edge of faga alu village the stream channel slope declines and the lithology changes to an alluvial valley fill likely with higher permeability izuka et al 2007 in the portion of the stream underlain by alluvial fill we observed low 222rn levels and declining streamflow except where two very small tributaries between sites s5 and s6 were seen to contribute water to the main branch suggesting the stream is probably losing water to the aquifer in this reach see section 4 2 below once the stream nears the coast streamflow 222rn and nutrient values spike indicating this is an area of groundwater discharge likely from a basal lens aquifer within the alluvium when corrected for mixing with high level baseflow the nutrient signature of this basal lens baseflow is a fairly close match to the composition of salinity unmixed coastal spring discharge suggesting that both of these water sources originate from the same nearshore aquifer at the shoreline coastal springs were found to have variable salinities indicating the presence of recirculated sgd however we also found that concentrations of 222rn in spring waters varied linearly with salinity fig a1 supplementary material suggesting that recirculated seawater at least at shallow depths does not spend sufficient time in the subsurface for significant 222rn ingrowth to occur previous studies in coastal aquifers show it is possible for fresh sgd to manifest as a separate layer above a deeper saline sgd fraction robinson et al 2007 kuan et al 2012 if this were the case in faga alu longer residence time recirculated sgd might be discharging at depths below detection of our survey methods although we did not detect any 222rn which we can attribute to a deep saline sgd source such a situation would not be surprising considering the abrupt bathymetry in faga alu bay in the inner portion of the bay the substrate is primarily composed of a shallow fringing reef sitting in 1 2 m of water but with very steep slopes at its margins where depths rapidly plunge to around 25 m fringing reef wedges in american samoa have been hypothesized to have lower hydraulic conductivities than underlying basaltic rocks houben et al 2018 which might contribute to the confinement of deeper sgd until reaching the reef margin where it could discharge at depth future deep water surveys along the reef margin would be useful for exploring this hypothesis further 4 2 characterization of baseflow components dissolved 222rn concentrations in the stream were generally low 6 10 dpm l except at the two sites nearest the coast sites s1 and s2 where values increased up to 42 dpm l coincident with increased 222rn concentrations between the uppermost s10 and lowermost s1 sites were increases in flow from 2700 to 3524 m3 d din concentrations from 4 to 12 µmol l and δ15n n n values from 4 5 to 11 5 fig 5 the simultaneous increase in δ15n n n and din input suggests a portion of this din may be derived from human or animal waste which both produce nitrogen with an elevated δ15n signature kendall 1998 because there were no observed surface tributaries above the lowest stream sampling sites the coincident increases in water nutrients and 222rn indicates the stream receives significant basal groundwater discharge just before exiting to the bay the 2016 seepage run showed almost the exact same pattern although 222rn concentrations through the whole stream and particularly near the stream mouth were observed to be higher up to 122 dpm l based on these observations baseflow discharge to the bay can be viewed as a mixture of two distinct components 1 baseflow sourced from high level groundwater davis 1963 here referred to as high level baseflow and 2 baseflow sourced from basal lens groundwater here referred to as basal lens baseflow we estimated the fraction of high level baseflow fs to basal lens baseflow fgw discharged in the stream estuary with a simple two endmember mixing model applied to 222rn concentrations using the groundwater end member and surface water from the upper portion of the stream as measured at site s3 1 f gw f s 1 2 f s c mix c gw c s c gw where cs is the average concentration of 222rn measured at site s3 cgw is the 222rn concentration in groundwater at production well 179 and cmix is the mixed sample 222rn concentration measured at the most coastal stream site s1 results from 2014 data indicate stream water at site s1 was composed of 67 high level baseflow 2368 m3 d and 33 1156 m3 d recently discharged basal lens baseflow and 222rn based unmixing results from 2016 data show that stream water at site s1 was composed of 66 high level baseflow 2412 m3 d and 34 1217 m3 d recently discharged basal lens baseflow although this calculation relies on some assumptions such as conservative radon behavior no radioactive decay and no atmospheric evasion over the timescale of the water flow the partitioning estimate compares very well to the flow increase as directly measured by stream gauging which in 2014 showed an addition of 957 m3 d or an additional 27 between site s3 and site s1 table 1 and in 2016 showed an additional flow increase of 37 or an additional 1339 m3 d between the lowest site site s1 and flow at site s3 table a2 supplementary material when these four separate and independent assessments of streamflow partitioning are averaged the arithmetic mean fractions of high level baseflow and recently discharged basal lens baseflow at site s1 are 67 and 33 respectively which were the fractions we used for calculations of nutrient fluxes through these pathways it should be noted that we did not take nutrient measurements or calculate sgd fluxes in 2016 therefore the 2016 seepage run data was used for streamflow partitioning only we calculated baseflow nutrient flux rates by multiplying the respective measured flow rates by the nutrient concentrations observed in each baseflow component high level and basal lens baseflow total baseflow loading of din and po4 3 to the bay were estimated to be 0 72 0 08 and 0 38 0 04 kg d respectively when partitioned with eqs 1 and 2 basal lens baseflow was estimated to have delivered 0 47 0 06 kg din d and 0 16 0 02 kg po4 3 d whereas only 0 25 0 03 kg din d and 0 22 0 03 kg po4 3 d were delivered by high level baseflow table 2 nutrient flux uncertainties were propagated from uncertainties in baseflow discharge and analytical errors of nutrient concentration values 4 3 sgd rates and nutrient fluxes 4 3 1 time series sgd fluxes during the stationary time series 222rn concentrations at the intake point averaged 4 8 dpm l range of 2 9 to 8 2 dpm l salinities averaged 26 9 range of 22 3 to 33 1 and the thickness of the sgd affected brackish plume averaged 38 cm range of 7 to 70 cm while the highest 222rn concentrations and the lowest salinities generally occurred at low tide as expected a continuous input of higher 222rn and lower salinity water from the nearby stream mouth was also detectable in the time series data conversion of submarine groundwater dischargern concentrations to sgd fluxes with the transient radon balance model yielded an average fresh sgd estimate of 2959 1629 m3 d to the central plume where the intake was located fig a2 supplementary material however because the time series measurement was taken just outside of the stream mouth the time series and survey points near this area were actually detecting a mixture of 222rn from coastal sgd and recently discharged basal lens baseflow from the nearshore tidally affected part of the stream subtracting the basal lens baseflow fraction 1156 117 m3 d as calculated in section 4 2 left an estimated sgd rate of 1803 1633 m3 d as groundwater coming from the coastal part of the central portion of the bay only this does assume that most or all of the 222rn from high level baseflow has evaded by the time it reaches the coast which if not would bias the coastal sgd fraction of the total measured sgd to be a slight overestimate 4 3 2 spatial distribution of sgd from coastal survey measurements the coastal water survey revealed three distinct groundwater discharge zones or plumes one each on the northern central and southern portions of the coastline fig 6 we found the highest 222rn concentrations up to 7 4 dpm l and sgd fluxes averaging 2623 1653 m3 d in the central plume which was centered just to the south of the stream outlet the southern plume had the lowest 222rn concentrations and sgd fluxes up to 4 7 dpm l and averaging 266 138 m3 d respectively with the northern plume having 222rn concentrations up to 5 0 dpm l and sgd fluxes averaging 846 78 m3 d 4 3 3 total sgd and nutrient flux scaling with coastal survey data the time series measurement provided critical information about temporal variability in sgd rates but only for discharge to the central plume therefore to calculate tidally integrated average fresh sgd fluxes to the whole bay the time series estimated discharge was upscaled to include discharge from the northern and southern plumes as well using the spatially distributed sgd information from the survey as described in section 3 2 3 calculated scaling factors were 0 10 0 08 for the southern plume and 0 32 0 21 for the northern plume or in other words sgd rates estimated during the survey showed the southern and northern plumes discharged 10 and 32 respectively of the central plume s sgd rate see section 4 3 2 bay wide sgd flux was calculated by multiplying these factors by the central plume s tidally averaged and baseflow corrected sgd rate 1803 1603 m3 d and summing flux from all three plumes which yielded an estimated sgd rate of 2587 1775 m3 d to the whole inner bay we calculated daily nutrient fluxes from sgd by multiplying coastal discharge rates by the average of salinity unmixed coastal spring nutrient concentrations table 1 fluxes were calculated to be 1 38 1 18 kg din d and 0 40 0 32 kg po4 3 d table 2 nutrient flux uncertainties were propagated from uncertainties in sgd rates and the standard deviation of averaging the nutrient concentration values of coastal spring waters 4 4 nearshore water quality in faga alu s coastal waters levels of din 1 1 to 9 2 µmol l and po4 3 0 2 to 2 0 µmol l in samples taken near to the shore were higher than those found in samples farther offshore 1 1 to 1 7 µmol din l and 0 2 to 0 3 µmol po4 3 l indicating local terrestrial nutrient sources have a detectable impact on the bay s water quality fig 6 typically n p ratios in oceanic waters are near 16 1 however n p ratios in faga alu s baseflow and sgd are for the most part disproportionately lower averaging around 6 1 in faga alu s coastal waters ratios ranged between 7 1 to 20 1 and averaged 12 1 suggesting nitrogen limiting conditions this shows that sgd not only has an impact on the amount of n and p in the bay but also on the balance of these nutrients which can have implications for biologic processes that control factors such as eutrophication within the bay nutrient concentrations are elevated in the northern relative to the southern bay fig 6 which is likely caused by circulation within the bay storlazzi et al 2018 as well as heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of sgd the northern and central plumes show discharge rates that are 5 and 10 times higher than the southern plume respectively and the persistent clockwise circulating current storlazzi et al 2014 would be expected to transport stream water and its associated nutrient load to the north rather than to the south 4 5 swat model results coastally discharging water budget components otherwise referred to as hydraulic pathways were simulated directly and indirectly with swat these included baseflow lateral flow surface runoff and sgd which was interpreted to be equivalent to deep aquifer recharge as sgd is not an explicit swat model output variable the swat model uses a water budget approach to partition precipitation inputs into evapotranspiration surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater recharge which is itself partitioned between deep aquifer recharge and baseflow using the assumption that the island s groundwater system is in a steady state the deep aquifer recharge calculated by swat of 2578 m3 d was interpreted to represent fresh sgd flux as all water recharged to an island s deep aquifer defined as the region where water no longer interacts with surface water bodies or roots must eventually discharge as sgd high level and basal lens baseflow were also interpreted from swat results by applying our conceptual model described in section 4 1 the conceptual model shows that stream baseflow originates from two distinctive aquifers 1 the high level aquifer and 2 the basal lens aquifer to approximate this scenario we divided the swat calculated baseflow into high level baseflow and basal lens baseflow by totaling baseflow from the sub basins above and below the western margin of the alluvial unit respectively based on this the swat calculated baseflow of 3203 m3 d was partitioned into 2075 m3 d of high level or upper watershed baseflow and 1128 m3 d of basal lens or lower watershed baseflow comparison between modeled and field measured water balance components showed good agreement within 2 13 and 0 3 rpd for basal lens baseflow high level baseflow and sgd respectively table 2 although streamflow via surface runoff and lateral flow were not measured the swat model provided estimates of these components at 5888 m3 d and 2303 m3 d respectively which sums to about 59 of the total annual stream flow anthropogenic din sources used for n input in the swat model included piggeries osds units and agricultural inputs which together accounted for 2317 kg n yr of n loading to the watershed the remainder of n inputs to the model were internally calculated in swat from natural cycling of organic materials based on swat land use databases limitations in calibration data as well as natural variability of nitrogen distribution potentially due to heterogeneity in sources ph and redox conditions resulted in unacceptably high uncertainties on results of the swat nutrient transport module the level of uncertainty was unsatisfactory for three reasons 1 less than 70 of the observations could be bracketed by the 95 ppu a generally accepted threshold defined by abbaspour et al 2015 2 to achieve a solution where 60 of the calibration data were bracketed by the 95 ppu the range in uncertainty for modeled loading rates encompassed several orders of magnitude and 3 other model parameters such as rates of n transformation processes also showed uncertainties ranging across several orders of magnitude suggesting that these processes were poorly constrained simulated ranges in din export to the bay as bracketed by the 95 ppu through each hydrologic pathway were calculated by the swat model to be 0 04 to 2 16 kg n d in surface runoff 0 05 to 1 39 kg n d in lateral flow 0 01 to 0 46 kg n d in upper watershed baseflow 0 12 to 0 59 kg n d in lower watershed baseflow and 1 74 to 7 41 kg n d in deep aquifer recharge i e sgd fraction model calculated rates of n uptake and denitrification were similarly wide ranging from 0 38 to 12 9 kg n d and 0 69 to 37 8 kg n d respectively indicating that constraint on these processes was poor while simulated estimates of din export encompassed the equivalent measured fluxes between their upper and lower bounds this was not surprising considering how large the ranges were although the results of the swat n transport simulation were unreliable this exercise was valuable in that it made clear where current data gaps exist and underscored the need for a more extensive dataset when calibrating a highly parameterized model such as swat as such future field efforts should focus on quantifying surface water nutrient concentrations at higher temporal resolutions and across all representative streamflow discharge rates 5 discussion 5 1 implications for natural resources management our results indicate sgd is an important factor in coastal nutrient loading in faga alu and likely in other steep basaltic island watersheds with perennial streams this is not surprising as many other studies conducted in similar settings such as jeju island and the hawaiian islands have shown sgd may deliver 5 to 62 times the nutrient load of streams e g garrison et al 2003 bishop et al 2017 knee et al 2016 dulai et al 2016 despite these findings throughout most of the coastal u s and specifically in american samoa regulatory efforts are primarily concentrated on surface water quality management only as epa 2016 very little regulatory action has been focused on groundwater as a hydrologic pathway for pollution however our findings suggest that coastal resource management may be more successful if both groundwater and stream water quality are considered when developing sampling protocols and applying tmdl standards although few jurisdictions have even developed groundwater quality standards e g kimsey 2005 n j a c 2018 american samoa s small size and strong incentive to maintain fragile reefs could make the territory a reasonable location to pioneer this type of regulatory standard our field results also indicate that impacts to groundwater quality are a major factor on stream water quality this is an important consideration when designing water quality monitoring protocols in american samoa water quality monitoring site selection is primarily based upon accessibility some streams are sampled at stream mouths and some are sampled farther upstream didonato 2004 as epa 2013b however if some stream samples consist of high level baseflow only and others taken near the coast contain a fraction of basal lens baseflow this reduces the comparability of monitoring results between different streams this issue could be mitigated by sampling across different stream reaches and considering tidal effects in a standardized manner 5 2 conceptual model insights the conceptual hydrogeologic model of groundwater surface water coastal water interaction suggested by the results of this study provides new insight into hydrologic processes occurring in small steep volcanic island watersheds while geochemical methods similar to those applied here have been used to examine groundwater surface water interaction in continental streams estuaries and wetlands genereux et al 1993 cook et al 2008 gleeson et al 2013 and also to assess groundwater coastal water interaction at the shoreline e g jacob et al 2009 very few other studies have attempted to trace interactions in water and nutrient flux between hydrologic pathways on a ridge to reef scale e g jarsjö et al 2007 the conceptual hydrogeologic model is likely valid in other watersheds around tutuila and in other high island settings specifically where near shore coastal plains are underlain by more permeable alluvium or marine sediments human development is often concentrated in coastal regions and when sediments underlying developments are more permeable than the surrounding rock as appears to be the case in faga alu they may facilitate a more direct connection between anthropogenic contaminant sources and basal groundwater in these areas groundwater may play a larger role in coastal nutrient transport than surface water however the reverse may be true in settings where development is concentrated above less permeable layers which has been determined to be the case in oahu hawaii where a low permeability marine carbonate formation locally known as caprock has been shown to protect the underlying aquifer from contaminants oki et al 1998 therefore in basaltic island settings the partitioning of nutrients from non point sources into different hydrologic pathways is likely to be highly dependent on the relative permeabilities of different nearshore geologic layers this farther underscores the importance of developing an accurate conceptualization of local hydrogeologic systems when designing sampling schemes and assessing nutrient fluxes on a ridge to reef scale the locality specific understanding of groundwater surface water interaction was also useful for interpreting results of the swat watershed model discharge or loss between groundwater and a stream is generally controlled by water table elevation which makes this parameter important for predicting the distribution of baseflow in a watershed however the swat model uses a simplified linear reservoir model to control loss or gain from groundwater and does not consider water table elevations for baseflow partitioning this gap is commonly filled by coupling surface water models with groundwater models e g kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 however subsurface models rely on calibrated parameterization of stream conductance and hydraulic conductivity and in settings such as faga alu the variable and steep terrain kampf and burges 2007 as well as a lack of groundwater elevation data apart from a single well in the valley imparts large uncertainties to groundwater models instead we used the conceptual hydrogeologic model to determine where the local water table elevation was generally below the stream bed losing reach below the quarry and above the stream bed gaining reach above the quarry and area proximal to the coast the model s deep aquifer baseflow partitioning coefficient was then adjusted to match field estimated sgd rates in this manner measured fluxes from high level and basal lens baseflow could be compared against swat s estimates and predictions of surface runoff and lateral flow could be developed likely within the same or greater certainty as would have been achieved through a more time consuming and costly groundwater modeling process 5 3 nitrogen source tracing while extensive source dependent nutrient tracing efforts were not performed in this study moderate correlation between elevated din concentrations and δ15nn n isotopes in baseflow and coastal surface water r2 of 0 93 and 0 45 respectively provided insight into the transport history of nutrients from source to sink the correlation between δ15nn n values and din values suggests a large component of sampled din originates from a high δ15nn n source such as wastewater or manure as opposed to synthetic agricultural fertilizers which typically have δ15nn n values near 0 kendall and aravena 2000 this result is reasonable as most agricultural operations in the valley are small and focused on traditional samoan crops that require few to no chemical inputs another management need in american samoa is to better constrain the impacts of piggeries vs osds sourced wastewater falkland et al 2002 shuler et al 2017 unfortunately the overlap of δ15nn n values from animal manure and wastewater böhlke 2003 in addition to complications from mixing of nutrients from different sources prevents the reliable partitioning of din from these sources with this method more specific source dependent tracers like microbial source tracing scott et al 2002 kirs et al 2011 or wastewater specific compounds petrie et al 2015 krall et al 2018 would be useful for separating and prioritizing the impacts between human wastewater and pig manure in samoa 5 4 uncertainties and limitations due to the inherent challenges in measuring sgd there are many well known uncertainties associated with using the 222rn mass balance model approach burnett et al 2007 schubert et al 2019 burnett et al 2007 describes selection of an appropriate 222rn endmember activity to be one of the most critical however obtaining enough endmember samples to constrain uncertainty is difficult knee et al 2016 peterson et al 2008 and zhu et al 2019 acknowledges that qualitative judgements are usually a major factor in determining which samples are chosen to represent the endmember we acknowledge this is the case for this study as well therefore we applied all available information to constrain the sgd 222rn end member including four coastal spring samples linear salinity unmixing approach yielded a 222rn endmember value of 116 54 dpm l one well sample measured activity of 124 2 dpm l and through rearranging eqs 1 and 2 we back calculated an estimated 222rn concentration in the basal lens baseflow of 142 9 dpm l at stream sample site s1 although each of these independent observations yielded fairly similar results additional samples from any of the above would increase confidence in the endmember value used selection of the 222rn endmember value was also subject to another major assumption that all of the 222rn detected was derived from fresh groundwater and not recirculated seawater we made this assumption because our sampling strategy indicated that of the recirculated sgd detected in coastal springs none contained significant levels of 222rn this is somewhat surprising as recirculated seawater with a residence time long enough to pick up a 222rn signal is typically a significant part of sgd budgets e g garrison et al 2003 knee et al 2016 however as discussed in section 4 1 some studies have suggested it is possible for fresh sgd to manifest as a separate layer above a deeper saline sgd fraction robinson et al 2007 kuan et al 2012 if a deeper layer of longer residence time saline sgd existed in faga alu we may have missed it by only sampling end members in the surficial layer extreme gradients in the nearshore bathymetry caused by a potentially low permeability reef wedge can be seen where the reef abruptly plunges from 1 to 2 m down to 25 m this feature could have obscured a deep longer residence time sgd signal from our survey supplementary material fig a3 it is feasible that sgd from below the reef wedge may remain unmixed with the shallow waters we sampled therefore even if the coastal spring 222rn salinity ratios found in our samples only represented a surficial layer of fresh sgd these samples were nonetheless representative of our survey and time series data in other words if deeper longer residence time recirculated sgd does occur in faga alu then a we likely did not detect it meaning it did not affect our sgd flux calculation and b any undetected deep sgd likely did not contain a significant fresh fraction because this would have caused a discrepancy in the swat water budget estimates based on balancing discharge from both baseflow fractions and sgd another uncertainty to consider is the use of assumed ambient 222rn activities from non sgd sources while this is a fairly standard practice e g burnett and dulaiova 2003 bishop et al 2017 a reasonable method for assessing the effect of these and other parameters on the final model output is to perform a sensitivity analysis on different parameters of interest we performed a sensitivity analysis on the 222rn box model parameters table 3 and the results suggest the ambient 222rn activity parameters have a negligible effect on the final output the sensitivity test also showed the horizontal area of the plume has a significant effect on final sgd rates considering this issue is shared by nearly all previous studies using this method e g dulaiova et al 2010 swarzenski et al 2013 we acknowledge that the uncertainty in simplification of the plume geometry is very difficult to constrain and represents a weakness of the method for this study since the plume definition was dependent on the survey track we believe that the plumes were well defined vertically and along the shoreline but are more uncertain in the offshore direction we also assumed that the geometry of the plumes did not significantly change during the survey period these limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the study results the swat model uses a simplified linear reservoir model for representation of the groundwater system which applies a single parameter for total groundwater recharge partitioning to the deep aquifer interpreted here as sgd hence swat s sgd results are sensitive to this parameter table a3 supplementary material additionally this interpretation hinges on the assumption that watershed boundaries also represent aquifer divides which is reasonable based on the horizontal bedding of the adjacent geologic units and estimates of water table elevations from izuka 1999 and izuka et al 2007 that show that the water table conforming closely to the land s surface also the hydrologic portion of the swat model was calibrated with streamflow data from two stations black diamonds in fig 2 and therefore different parameter values were assigned for the upper watershed above the quarry and for the lower watershed below this was justified geologically considering that the quarry location coincides with the contact between basalts and alluvium however in reality the local geology is probably heterogeneous particularly within the basalt unit itself thus the bi modal parameterization of the model area is likely to be somewhat of an oversimplification 6 conclusions by combining a terrestrial and coastal hydrologic field investigation with model based watershed characterization we were able to reveal impacts of different nutrient sources and hydrologic pathways in a small american samoan watershed this methodological framework demonstrates how snapshot scale observations and transient watershed modeling can be integrated to develop a fairly comprehensive understanding of water and nutrient dynamics in steep watersheds on tropical basaltic islands in faga alu watershed during low flow conditions field measurements suggest sgd and nearshore basal lens baseflow contribute nearly all of the terrigenous din to the coastline with high level baseflow contributing very little groundwater discharge was also found to be significant in coastal loading of dissolved po4 3 seepage run measurements indicated groundwater discharge to the stream occurs as two geochemically distinct fractions 1 high level baseflow and 2 basal lens baseflow that discharges near the stream estuary during baseflow conditions measurements indicated high level streamflow contributes about two thirds of the stream s water but nearshore basal lens baseflow contributes the majority of the stream s nutrient load 222rn based measurements suggest that while saltwater recirculation does occur in the shallow portion of the nearshore aquifer that seawater does not spend sufficient time in the subsurface to pick up a 222rn signature the geologic structure of the fringing reef could contain deeper recirculated sgd but we were not able to confirm the existence of such a source these field results facilitated the development of a conceptual model of groundwater surface water and coastal water interaction within steep basaltic island watersheds this conceptual model was foundational for developing the watershed model and interpreting its results the swat model matched field estimated water fluxes reasonably well within 2 13 and 0 3 rpd for basal lens baseflow high level baseflow and sgd respectively the n transport capabilities of swat were also tested however limitations in the availability and quality of existing nutrient data prevented satisfactory calibration of this portion of the model overall field and model results suggest sgd is an important water budget component in this and likely other geologically similar watersheds additionally because our measurements indicated that both sgd and basal lens baseflow are likely to be important coastal nutrient loading pathways in these systems both should be considered when developing nutrient sampling and management plans although sampling surface runoff baseflow and groundwater nutrients from multiple locations throughout a watershed would require a significant deviation from current water quality management practices in american samoa if these data can be collected they would be very useful for improving upon existing watershed models continued development of hydrological models in faga alu would be a valuable future research activity for further developing these

5598,stable isotopes of oxygen δ18o and deuterium δ2h in precipitation are used as tracers of the hydrologic cycle in studies of both past and present climate in ethiopia a drought sensitive region

stations have similar amount weighted mean δ18o values but exhibit different seasonal patterns in δ18o values as clearly shown in daily and weekly data the most striking feature of this dataset is the synchronous decrease in δ18o values in daily and weekly precipitation samples from the three stations in the northwestern highlands gondar debre markos jimma during the first three weeks of august 2013 this decrease in δ18o values does not correlate strongly to precipitation amount but it is likely due to a combination of increased storm intensity and deep convection at the time of lower δ18o

worden et al 2007 risi et al 2008 the isotopic composition of precipitation is monitored by the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip operated by the international atomic energy agency and the world meteorological organization iaea wmo since the 1960s gnip includes over a 1000 monthly precipitation collection stations in more than 125 countries iaea 2013 with uneven spatial distribution in ethiopia there is only one long term gnip station located in addis ababa fig 1 collecting monthly data only because of these limited data our understanding of the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of meteoric water in ethiopia comes mostly from groundwater rivers lakes and spotty rainwater collections e g mckenzie et al 2001 darling and giza 2002 ayenew et al 2008 kebede et al 2008 levin et al 2009 wynn and bedaso 2010 the existing isotopic data indicate that the δ18o values of ethiopian precipitation are higher than expected from models given its inland location 563 km from the nearest coastline and high elevation 2386 m above mean sea level rozanski et al 1996 bowen and wilkinson 2002 levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 the causes for such anomalously high values and isotopic variations in general are poorly understood largely because of such limitations in the available data 1 the monthly data only reflect the mean isotopic composition of water vapor in the atmosphere during these time intervals darling et al 2005 and 2 a single location addis ababa cannot capture the complicated topography and diverse hydroclimates in the region in order to characterize and understand the driving forces for the isotopic variability of meteoric water in the region we need to generate isotopic data of higher temporal resolution from the country s different climatic regimes such datasets have the potential to expand the utility of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in studies of hydrology water resources climate sensitivity and change in the region as well as providing a baseline for interpreting stable isotopic records of climate and environmental change in the past e g sultan et al 1997 aronson et al 2008 bedaso et al 2010 2013 levin et al 2011 tierney et al 2011 abouelmagd et al 2012 feakins 2013 tierney et al 2017 bedaso et al 2019 in this study we report the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation collected at daily weekly and monthly intervals between august 2012 and november 2013 at four locations in ethiopia gondar debre markos jimma and jijiga fig 1 using these data this study aims to 1 evaluate the importance of high frequency precipitation sampling for isotope based investigations of climatic processes 2 characterize the temporal and spatial distributions of δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation within ethiopia 3 investigate how variation in the isotopic composition of precipitation relates to climatic and meteorological parameters and how in turn we can use isotopic data as indicators of climatic processes in the present and past and 4 evaluate whether the isotopic composition of precipitation from the long term gnip station in addis ababa is representative of precipitation from elsewhere in ethiopia 2 methods 2 1 precipitation collections in total 894 precipitation samples were collected at four meteorological stations owned and operated by the ethiopian national meteorological agency at daily weekly and monthly intervals between august 2012 and november 2013 these four precipitation sampling stations gondar debre markos jimma and jijiga were selected to represent different physiographic and climatic regions of ethiopia fig 1 the gondar elev 2133 m and debre markos elev 2446 m stations are located in the western highlands that experience one rainy season the kiremt per year as the northernmost station gondar has a shorter rainy season than debre markos and its proximity to lake tana could influence precipitation dynamics the jimma station elev 1780 m located in the southwestern corner of the ethiopian highlands experiences rainfall year round due to the passage of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz diro et al 2008 the jijiga station elev 1609 m in the southeastern highlands experiences two distinct rainy seasons but receives considerably less precipitation each year than other three stations fig 1 custom made devices comprised of a funnel affixed to a plastic jug were used to collect precipitation mineral oil density 0 8 g cc was placed in the jugs of the weekly and monthly collectors to prevent evaporation of water precipitation samples were collected in the morning between 9 00 11 00 am at each station the volumetric amount of precipitation and the prevailing weather conditions were documented with each collection the daily water samples were stored in 3 8 ml 1 dram glass vials with polycone seal caps the weekly and monthly samples were stored in 15 ml glass vials with polycone seal caps the seals of all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and the vials were stored in a covered box daily precipitations samples were passed through 0 45 μm filter to remove particulates following procedures described by west et al 2010 the weekly and monthly water samples were separated from the mineral oil using a separatory funnel treated with activated charcoal for 24 h to remove organics and then passed through a 0 2 μm filter to remove particulates 2 2 laboratory analyses precipitation samples were analyzed for 18o 16o and 2h 1h ratios using a los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer model lwia 24ep and lgr triple water isotope analyzer model iwa 45ep via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy at johns hopkins university jhu following the iaea standard procedure iaea 2009 a subset of the samples from the daily collections were analyzed at the university of utah s sirfer laboratory using a picarro l2130 i analyzer via cavity ring down spectroscopy to confirm the mineral oil used in the weekly and monthly samples has no effect on the isotopic composition we analyzed randomly selected samples on isotope ratio mass spectrometer and compared with result of the lgr analysis we found no significant difference between the two analyses of the two samples results are reported as δ18o and δ2h values which are defined as δ 2 h or δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios in the sample and standard the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow based on craig 1961 d excess is calculated as d excess δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o in reporting δ18o δ2h and d excess values in the text below we use the subscript precip to indicate that these values are associated with precipitation repeated measurements of the commercially available united states geological survey usgs isotopic reference waters usgs 45 46 47 and 48 were used as internal and external references calibrated to the vsmow slap scale an analytical run five samples bracketed by standards typically yielded standard deviations of 0 1 for δ18o and 0 3 for δ2h at jhu and 0 04 for δ18o and 0 3 for δ2h at sirfer the external precision of d excess precip is calculated as 0 8 and 0 4 for the analyses at jhu and sirfer for respectively outliers in this dataset were identified using d excess values two weekly data points jij w 120917 and jim w 130520 have very low d excess values 58 1 and 26 7 whereas d excess values of all other samples were 10 the combination of very low d excess precip and high δ18oprecip values from these samples suggests post collection evaporation might have modified their isotopic composition for this reason they were excluded from plots and statistical analyses but still included in table s1 for completeness 2 3 climate data and hysplit trajectories in order to explore how climate conditions affect the isotopic composition of precipitation we used the nearest grid point era interim daily 24 hours average climate reanalysis data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf including such variables as 2 meter air temperature and relative humidity intercomparisons of reanalysis products performed for ethiopia have shown that era interim compares favorably with other available reanalysis data tesfaye et al 2017 we measured the amount of water associated with each collection interval to determine the association between precipitation amount and the isotopic composition of precipitation table s1 in addition as a proxy for convective intensity the daily outgoing longwave radiation olr data from the nearest grid point were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data interp olr html we used the noaa hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model draxler 2011 to generate backward trajectories of air in order to evaluate potential changes in moisture source at the different collection stations during the study interval the global data assimilation system gdas 0 5 data were used for hysplit model runs and a starting height of 1000 m above ground level agl was chosen to target vapor rich parcels as most of the moisture is found within the lower 2000 m of the atmosphere wallace and hobbs 2006 for sensitivity tests different starting heights 500 m and 2000 m were also used for the trajectory calculations with similar results the daily vapor trajectories back to 240 h were calculated for six time intervals aug sep 2012 nov 2012 jan 2013 feb apr 2013 may jun 2013 aug 2013 and sep 2013 selected based on δ18oprecip value variations e g low δ18oprecip values in august 2013 high δ18oprecip values in march 2013 see gray boxes on fig 2 for the trajectory calculation the duration of 240 h 10 days was chosen because it is an average residence time of moisture in the atmosphere gat 2000 and the precipitation collection stations in ethiopia are located well in land all back trajectories were started at noon 12 00 local time because our precipitation samples for isotopic analysis were typically collected in the morning hours 3 results 3 1 isotopic variation of precipitation with different sampling intervals the stable isotopic composition of samples collected from the four stations between august 2012 and november 2013 are summarized in table 1 and fig 2 all original data are provided in table s1 across the four stations the daily data exhibit a larger range in δ18oprecip and δ2hprecip values 12 6 to 10 3 for δ18o 91 8 to 80 8 for δ2h than the weekly and monthly data fig 2 table 1 the daily d excess precip values range from 9 9 and 29 9 the limited number of data points for some time intervals e g january march at gondar december february at jijiga reflects the absence of rainfall i e the dry season not missing data fig 2 considering that δ2hprecip values generally vary linearly with δ18oprecip values craig 1961 for the remainder of this paper we mainly discuss variation in the observed δ18oprecip values and use d excess precip values to track deviations from the average δ18oprecip δ2hprecip relationship fig 3 amount weighted means of δ18oprecip values are used for comparisons of δ18oprecip values from different collection intervals i e daily weekly monthly comparisons of the amount of precipitation recovered from the daily weekly and monthly collectors indicate equivalent recovery and retention of precipitation among the different collectors tables s1 and s2 the measurements of the amount of monthly rainfall data are within 2σ of the long term monthly precipitation means for each meteorological station fig 1b f the amount weighted mean δ18oprecip and δ2hprecip values are highly consistent among daily weekly and monthly data table s2 the amount weighted daily data over the same collection periods are highly correlated with the weekly and monthly data table s3 the robust nature of the comparison suggests high level of data integrity and that the samples did not experience significant evaporation or isotopic fractionation during and after sample collection 3 2 isotopic distinctions among stations and seasons there is no significant difference in the amount weighted mean δ18oprecip values of daily samples among the four sampling stations over the 16 month sampling period anova p value 0 05 these values are similar to the amount weighted mean δ18oprecip values from monthly data in addis ababa sampled between 1961 and 2009 1 3 2 3 table 1 in contrast the mean d excess precip values are significantly different among the four stations p value 0 05 debre markos has the highest weighted mean d excess precip values 18 2 4 6 and jijiga yields the lowest mean d excess 11 1 4 2 table 1 these values bracket the amount weighted annual d excess precip value for the gnip station at addis ababa 13 8 4 2 table 1 despite similarities in the weighted mean δ18oprecip values from the different stations there are seasonal trends in the daily and weekly δ18oprecip values that distinguish the northwestern highland stations i e debre markos gondar jimma from the southeastern station of jijiga fig 2 the temporal variations of δ18oprecip values are similar for the three northwestern highland stations these stations are characterized by relatively low δ18oprecip values during the main rainy season june september and relatively high δ18oprecip values for the rest of the year fig 2a b d they also exhibit seasonal trends in d excess precip values with the lowest values between november and may fig 2a b d the seasonal patterns in d excess precip values are not as distinct as those observed in δ18oprecip values there are some seasonal variations in the δ18oprecip and d excess precip values from jijiga although they are not as strong as those observed in the northwest highland stations fig 2c we examined the seasonal pattern fig 2 and the correlations fig 4 table 2 between δ18oprecip values and local meteorological parameters precipitation amount temperature relative humidity and olr there is a weak negative correlation between δ18oprecip values and precipitation amount at all stations δ18oprecip values decrease with increasing relative humidity and decreasing outgoing long wavelength radiation olr at all stations there is no significant correlation observed between δ18oprecip values and temperature at the stations except for debre markos more detailed discussion on this is presented later in section 4 3 1 comparison of local meteoric water lines lmwls which are linear regressions of the δ18oprecip and δ2hprecip values provides a way to summarize the distribution of isotopic data from precipitation in one place the slopes of the amount weighted lmwls of the daily weekly and monthly collections from the four stations in this study cluster around 7 6 0 4 fig 3 the amount weighted lmwls slopes from the daily weekly and monthly data at all stations are similar and do not show statistically significant differences except for the weekly collection at jijiga slope which could be caused by sub cloud evaporation the slopes from all stations are close to the slope determined from the long term monthly collections at addis ababa 7 0 0 2 and elsewhere in eastern africa 7 0 0 2 to 8 1 0 2 table 3 rozanski et al 1996 however the intercepts of the mwls at our four stations vary from 10 5 0 3 at jijiga to 18 3 0 4 at debre markos the range in the observed intercepts is similar to the range observed at eastern and central africa from 6 8 0 7 at kericho kenya to 16 2 0 3 at virunga d r congo table 3 rozanski et al 1996 balagizi et al 2018 the intercept for the mwl at the addis ababa gnip station 11 5 0 6 plots within the range of intercepts observed from the stations monitored for this study 4 discussion 4 1 temporal trends precipitation samples collected at different frequencies enable us to evaluate whether daily and weekly isotopic data add value to monthly data which is the standard collection interval for gnip datasets iaea 2013 although daily weekly and monthly data show similar temporal trends in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values fig 2 the daily data show the highest amplitude in the seasonal variations of δ18oprecip and d excess precip values fig 2 the availability of daily data makes it possible to examine the influence of a single storm system on the isotopic composition of precipitation for example the low δ18oprecip values of the weekly and monthly data at jijiga in october 2012 are strongly influenced by a single storm event on october 27 2012 fig 2 the most prominent feature of the precipitation isotope record is the decrease in δ18oprecip values observed in the daily and weekly samples from gondar debre markos and jimma during the first three weeks of august 2013 fig 2a b d this trend in δ18oprecip values which is nearly synchronous at gondar debre markos and jimma cannot be clearly identified with the monthly samples alone the gnip monthly rainfall isotope data in addis ababa also misses the sub monthly trend in δ18oprecip values that is evident from both the daily and weekly collections at the three northwestern highlands stations the regional coherency and amplitude of this short decrease in δ18oprecip values with an amplitude of 4 in the weekly collections 8 in the daily collections is not evident in the monthly collections because it occurs over a 3 week time interval that spans two of the monthly collection intervals to evaluate the climatic controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation we performed correlation analysis between daily δ18oprecip values and variables representing daily climate conditions e g precipitation amount olr temperature rh table 2 fig 4b f j n daily δ18oprecip values show significant correlations with precipitation amount relative humidity and olr at all stations and with temperature at debre markos and gondar p 0 05 on the contrary no significant correlations are observed between monthly δ18oprecip values and these climate factors on monthly time scales except for with relative humidity and olr at debre markos and olr at gondar table 2 weekly δ18oprecip values show significant correlation with relative humidity and olr at the northwestern highland stations p 0 05 but no correlation with temperature at all four stations and largely insignificant correlation with precipitation amount table 2 the lack of statistical significance between our monthly δ18oprecip values and the climate factors could also be due to small sample size nevertheless our daily and weekly data signifies the need for high frequency sampling of precipitation to examine the climatic controls of isotopes in precipitation that are not evident in our monthly samples collection and the gnip monthly interval data collection in addis ababa 4 2 spatial and seasonal variation comparisons of the isotopic composition of precipitation at the four stations sampled for this study reflect climatological differences within ethiopia stations in the northwestern highlands of ethiopia debre markos gondar and jimma follow similar annual trends in daily weekly and monthly δ18oprecip values with low δ18oprecip values during the main rainy season this phenomenon is clearly exhibited in the latter half of our sampling campaign when we captured the full rainy season in 2013 specifically daily and weekly δ18oprecip values from gondar debre markos and jimma were consistently 2 between mid july and early september in 2013 with minima in daily δ18oprecip values occurring on the same day august 3 2013 at debre markos 10 9 and gondar 10 4 and then 5 days later at jimma 10 0 august 8 2013 fig 2 relatively low δ18oprecip values are also observed at these stations in the beginning of the study period in mid august 2012 although our sampling did not start early enough to capture the full rainy season in 2012 these trends are consistent with the monthly collections made at gondar debre markos and the long term gnip station at addis ababa which yield lower δ18oprecip values during the june september rainy season fig 2 however the amplitude of the trends in monthly data is considerably muted relative to the seasonal trends observed in the daily and weekly δ18oprecip values fig 2 the seasonal trend in δ18oprecip values from jijiga in the southeastern ethiopia highlands is less distinct than the seasonal trends in the northwestern highlands the variation in d excess precip values from the four collection stations is not as coherent as the records of δ18oprecip values but there is a clear difference in d excess precip values among the stations table 1 the spatial and seasonal variation in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values among stations we monitored provide avenues to understand the controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia the clearest separation among the isotopic data from precipitation collected at the four stations is between jijiga and the northwest highland stations jijiga does not exhibit the clear seasonal pattern in δ18oprecip values as the other stations and the d excess precip values are lower than the other stations table 1 jijiga s position in the southeastern plateau where it receives substantially less annual precipitation likely explains these distinctions the storms that result in rainfall in the northwest highlands do not reach jijiga the precipitation that does fall in jijiga is also likely susceptible to evaporation of raindrops which would result in lower d excess precip values as a result of re evaporation of falling raindrops which is typical in arid climates dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 gat 1996 guan et al 2013 among the three northwestern highland stations gondar debre markos and jimma the most striking observations are as follows 1 there are distinct decreases in δ18oprecip values in the june september rainy season at all three stations 2 the seasonal trend in δ18oprecip values is synchronous among the stations and 3 d excess precip values from these three stations do not exhibit seasonal trends that are as distinct as δ18oprecip values but yield the lowest values during the drier part of the year january april when δ18oprecip values are highest fig 2 we explore explanations for these observations in the following section section 4 3 and summarize these explanations in table 4 4 3 explanations for the observed spatial and seasonal isotope variations 4 3 1 local climate controls on δ18oprecip 4 3 1 1 precipitation amount the isotopic composition of precipitation is influenced by the amount of precipitation amount effect temperature distance from the source continentality altitude continental recycling and convective activity dansgaard 1964 salati et al 1979 rozanski et al 1993 worden et al 2007 risi et al 2008 in the tropics the most obvious explanation between the association of lower δ18oprecip values during the peak of the rainy season would be the amount effect which is a phenomenon observed throughout the tropics where there is a strong negative correlation between the amount of precipitation and monthly δ18oprecip values dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 high rainfall amounts have been traditionally associated with lower δ18oprecip values this is commonly attributed to the progressive distillation of the heavier water isotopologues from an air parcel and because raindrops associated with bigger rain events experience less evaporation and less exchange with vapor below the cloud base dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 vuille et al 2003 lee and fung 2008 however in this study we show no significant correlation between monthly δ18oprecip values and the amount of rainfall p 0 05 and only a weak correlation with daily δ18oprecip values fig 4 table 2 even in the case of the daily δ18oprecip values that show weak correlation p 0 05 the correlation coefficient r is low fig 4 table 2 the apparent difference in the relationships between precipitation amount and δ18oprecip values for the daily weekly and monthly collections is likely due to the strong influence of small storms on the amount δ18oprecip relationship for the daily collections the correlations weaken for the daily collections if small precipitation amounts 5 mm are excluded r 0 3 for all sites p 0 05 for all sites but gondar the strong influence of small precipitation amount samples in the regressions of the daily data also explains why the δ18oprecip amount trends are muted or absent in the weekly and monthly collections where smaller precipitation amounts that may comprise a daily sample contribute to a smaller proportion of a total weekly or monthly sample likewise we also observe that the relationship between δ18oprecip values and precipitation amount is particularly strong for daily collections of rainfall during the dry season r 0 4 and p 0 05 for all sites but jijiga where δ18oprecip values of low intensity rains are more affected by re evaporation of falling raindrops than larger events kebede and travi 2012 as a result the very low daily δ18oprecip values that we observe in august 2013 at gondar debre markos and jimma cannot exclusively be explained by the increase in the amount of precipitation this observation agrees with results from other studies that show that the high rainfall amounts and local rainout mechanisms do not fully explain low δ18oprecip values associated with rainy season precipitation in eastern africa and elsewhere in the tropics rozanski et al 1996 kebede and travi 2012 otte et al 2017 balagizi et al 2018 martin et al 2018 4 3 1 2 evaporation at source and during precipitation the d excess precip values are informative as they can provide insight into synoptic weather systems and moisture source guan et al 2013 the global average d excess in precipitation is 10 craig 1961 and it is attributed to direct moisture from ocean evaporation but high 10 d excess precip values can be indicative of moisture sources with a continental recycled component dansgaard 1964 the high 10 d excess precip values that we observe in the northwestern highland stations fig 3 table 1 are consistent with evaporative moisture sources from central africa the red sea and or the mediterranean that have been identified by viste and sorteberg 2013a table 4 high d excess precip values are also observed elsewhere in africa such as in tanzania where they have been attributed to the influence of recycled moisture on precipitation e g otte et al 2017 the lowest d excess and highest δ18oprecip values among the northwestern highland stations occur during january may when there is the least amount of rain this might be attributable to sub cloud evaporation i e re evaporation of the falling raindrops due to low relative humidity compared to the rainy season δ18oprecip inversely related to relative humidity fig 4d h i p lower d excess precip values during short rains is also observed elsewhere in eastern africa and in the tropics which corresponds with low intensity rains and lower relative humidity and can result from sub cloud evaporation of rain droplets e g otte et al 2017 table 4 4 3 1 3 role of convection convective rainfall makes a significant contribution to rainfall in the tropics and in ethiopia mutai and ward 2000 segele and lamb 2005 in the tropics convective activity is also associated with lower δ18oprecip values and considered to be a strong determinant of low δ18oprecip values with rainy season precipitation e g tharammal et al 2017 martin et al 2018 higher rain rates and droplet formation at higher elevations and lower temperatures are associated with lower δ18oprecip values of convective rainfall in the tropics e g risi et al 2008 kurita et al 2009 martin et al 2018 for this reason we used olr as a proxy for convective intensity as it measures top of cloud temperature which is inversely related with the depth of convection arkin and ardanuy 1989 the northwestern highland stations show clear seasonality in olr values olr is lowest in the rainy season june september corresponding to the lowest δ18oprecip values suggesting that strong deep convective activities during the rainy season fig 2 δ18oprecip is significantly correlated to olr for all stations fig 4 with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 31 jimma to 0 5 debre markos the correlation is even stronger between the δ18oprecip and the olr values of the previous day 0 36 r 0 58 because the precipitation samples are usually collected in the morning hence represent the rainfall of the previous 24 h the similar olr seasonal variations among the three northwestern highland stations as with δ18oprecip also suggest that regional scale convective systems affect the entire northwestern part of ethiopia during the rainy season in contrast olr in jijiga does not exhibit a similar seasonality as the rest of the northwestern highland stations which is consistent with distinct weather conditions in the southeastern highlands using a multiple regression model we examined how much variability in δ18oprecip could be explained by the combination of all four climate factors precipitation amount temperature olr relative humidity see table 5 the models based on weekly data results in the highest r2 ranging from 0 37 jimma up to 0 61 debre markos the model based on daily data are also highly significant with r2 ranging from 0 25 jimma to 0 42 debre markos however none of the models based on monthly data are significant and this could also be partly due to small monthly sample size given the complexity in the spatial and seasonal variations of precipitation in ethiopia in addition to the potential effects of climatic conditions during precipitation events discussed above sources of moisture and moisture transport path could also affect the isotopic composition of precipitation 4 3 2 effects of moisture source and transport path on δ18oprecip and d excessprecip values moisture from multiple sources including the indian ocean the mediterranean and red seas central africa and the gulf of guinea reaches the western ethiopian highlands during the rainy season seleshi and demaree 1995 segele and lamb 2005 viste and sorteberg 2013a b many studies have tried to invoke the relative contribution of these different sources to explain seasonal trends in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values in ethiopia and the anomalously enriched δ18oprecip values at addis ababa rozanski et al 1996 levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 costa et al 2014 however the conclusions from these studies are limited because they rely on isotopic data from monthly rainfall collections in addis ababa that do not have the resolution required to attribute isotopic variation in precipitation to specific climatological phenomena table 4 presents possible ways that moisture source and transport path might affect the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia to explore some of these processes we calculated air mass back trajectories using the hysplit model see section 2 3 at our four sampling stations for 6 time periods that are representative of the isotopic variation we observed over the 16 month precipitation collection interval gray boxes fig 2 figs s1 s4 table s4 the hysplit trajectory analyses indicate that in august 2013 when δ18oprecip values are lowest at gondar debre markos and jimma back trajectories indicate moisture sources with a southerly component fig 5 this southerly component can also be seen in the 2012 rainy season august september 2012 at jimma and to some degree at debre markos although northerly and westerly trajectories dominate at gondar at this time figs s1 s2 s4 outside of the june september rainy season trajectories reaching debre markos and gondar predominantly come from the north and east at jimma the trajectories are primarily from the south except between november 2012 and january 2013 when the back trajectories indicate easterly transport at all times of year trajectories reaching jijiga are southerly or southeasterly with a small northerly or northeasterly component except during the march may rains when the southeasterly component is most clear fig s3 although there is some coherency to these results the spatial and seasonal patterns of the hysplit trajectory results do not match the patterns that we observe in the isotopic data as such we cannot make clear links between moisture paths and the variation in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values while moisture source and transport path likely place important controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia this level of analysis cannot resolve them additional and more comprehensive analyses of moisture sources and fluxes along the transport path during the rainy season would help to resolve the role of moisture source on the δ18oprecip values in ethiopia in summary our analysis shows that the main controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia are likely conditions during precipitation events and particularly the presence of regional scale convective systems that cover the northwestern highlands of ethiopia it appears that convective activity might be more important than rainfall amount in controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation during the rainy season while moisture source and path may also be important we do not yet have enough information to fully probe these effects 5 conclusions ethiopian precipitation isotope data collected on daily weekly and monthly intervals at four stations debre markos gondar jijiga and jimma shows seasonal and spatial variability the most prominent observations include 1 the three northwest highland stations exhibit similar seasonal variations in δ18oprecip values that is not apparent in jijiga in the southeastern highland and 2 there is a nearly synchronous pronounced decrease 8 in δ18oprecip values in the three northwest highland stations in august 2013 that cannot be explained by the amount effect the daily δ18oprecip data provide the opportunity to investigate local controlling factors precipitation amount relative humidity and olr which explain up to 50 of variation in δ18oprecip values in ethiopian precipitation using daily olr data we also demonstrate that convective activity explains seasonal δ18oprecip variations in ethiopia precipitation as with the trends in δ18oprecip values the olr results from the three northwestern highland stations are in synchronous with each other and suggest regional scale convective systems affect the entire northwestern part of ethiopia during the rainy season the moisture trajectory analysis indicates that this strong convective activity and low δ18oprecip values in august 2013 coincide with southerly trajectories at all three northwestern highland stations this coincidence suggests that moisture source or transport path may also play a role in the regional decrease in δ18oprecip values but we are reluctant to take these explanations further as a more detailed moisture source and trajectory analysis would be required to fully understand these links fully moreover with 16 month isotope data collection alone we do not claim to have an all inclusive explanation of the variability of the isotopic composition of ethiopian precipitation if isotopic variation in precipitation is to be used as an effective tool for documenting and monitoring hydroclimate variability in ethiopia then we need to generate additional records of this variability and probe the mechanisms that drive it comprehensive moisture source analysis will be particularly useful to investigate the impact of moisture source and transport path on variations in δ18oprecip values in addition to providing integrated views of modern processes the data from our study provide useful perspective for paleoclimate studies in the region as sedimentary archives of δ18o and δ2h values are commonly used to infer past variations in rainfall amount and changes in moisture dynamics e g bedaso et al 2010 levin et al 2011 feakins 2013 costa et al 2014 tierney et al 2017 the weak correlation between rainfall amount and δ18oprecip or δ2hprecip values in ethiopian rainfall today should temper interpretations that equate lower δ18o or δ2h values from sedimentary archives with wetter intervals likewise we do not observe a strong association between the isotopic composition of precipitation and moisture source instead lower δ18o or δ2h values from sedimentary archives may indicate times of greater storm intensity or more convection but not necessarily a change in the amount of moisture delivered to a region author contribution

5598,stable isotopes of oxygen δ18o and deuterium δ2h in precipitation are used as tracers of the hydrologic cycle in studies of both past and present climate in ethiopia a drought sensitive region where direct observations of climate are limited understanding the stable isotopic composition of precipitation can provide an integrated view of the hydroclimate today and help interpret records of climate variability in the past to date the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia is known primarily from monthly precipitation collections from one long term monitoring station in addis ababa here we report δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation from a 16 month long sampling campaign at four stations in ethiopia that represent different climate regimes precipitation samples collected at daily weekly and monthly intervals between august 2012 and november 2013 at these stations exhibit a large range of δ18o 12 6 to 10 3 δ2h 91 8 to 80 8 and d excess values 9 9 to 29 9 the four stations have similar amount weighted mean δ18o values but exhibit different seasonal patterns in δ18o values as clearly shown in daily and weekly data the most striking feature of this dataset is the synchronous decrease in δ18o values in daily and weekly precipitation samples from the three stations in the northwestern highlands gondar debre markos jimma during the first three weeks of august 2013 this decrease in δ18o values does not correlate strongly to precipitation amount but it is likely due to a combination of increased storm intensity and deep convection at the time of lower δ18o values of precipitation our high resolution dataset provides new insights into the controls on the isotopic composition of rainfall in ethiopia and how we might use it to understand hydroclimate variability today and in the past keywords precipitation stable isotopes d excess convective storm hysplit ethiopia 1 introduction the stable isotopes of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h in precipitation are used as conservative tracers in the hydrologic cycle because they track both local and large scale atmospheric processes dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 darling et al 2005 in order to use this tool to its full potential it is critical to establish a detailed understanding of how the isotopic composition of precipitation varies spatially and temporally isotopes in precipitation vary due to the fractionation of water isotopologues e g 1h2 16o 1h2h16o and 1h2 18o during evaporation condensation and other processes within the hydrologic cycle in the tropics the isotopic composition of precipitation is controlled by the amount of precipitation distance from the moisture source altitude continental recycling and convective activity dansgaard 1964 salati et al 1979 rozanski et al 1993 worden et al 2007 risi et al 2008 the isotopic composition of precipitation is monitored by the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip operated by the international atomic energy agency and the world meteorological organization iaea wmo since the 1960s gnip includes over a 1000 monthly precipitation collection stations in more than 125 countries iaea 2013 with uneven spatial distribution in ethiopia there is only one long term gnip station located in addis ababa fig 1 collecting monthly data only because of these limited data our understanding of the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of meteoric water in ethiopia comes mostly from groundwater rivers lakes and spotty rainwater collections e g mckenzie et al 2001 darling and giza 2002 ayenew et al 2008 kebede et al 2008 levin et al 2009 wynn and bedaso 2010 the existing isotopic data indicate that the δ18o values of ethiopian precipitation are higher than expected from models given its inland location 563 km from the nearest coastline and high elevation 2386 m above mean sea level rozanski et al 1996 bowen and wilkinson 2002 levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 the causes for such anomalously high values and isotopic variations in general are poorly understood largely because of such limitations in the available data 1 the monthly data only reflect the mean isotopic composition of water vapor in the atmosphere during these time intervals darling et al 2005 and 2 a single location addis ababa cannot capture the complicated topography and diverse hydroclimates in the region in order to characterize and understand the driving forces for the isotopic variability of meteoric water in the region we need to generate isotopic data of higher temporal resolution from the country s different climatic regimes such datasets have the potential to expand the utility of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in studies of hydrology water resources climate sensitivity and change in the region as well as providing a baseline for interpreting stable isotopic records of climate and environmental change in the past e g sultan et al 1997 aronson et al 2008 bedaso et al 2010 2013 levin et al 2011 tierney et al 2011 abouelmagd et al 2012 feakins 2013 tierney et al 2017 bedaso et al 2019 in this study we report the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation collected at daily weekly and monthly intervals between august 2012 and november 2013 at four locations in ethiopia gondar debre markos jimma and jijiga fig 1 using these data this study aims to 1 evaluate the importance of high frequency precipitation sampling for isotope based investigations of climatic processes 2 characterize the temporal and spatial distributions of δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation within ethiopia 3 investigate how variation in the isotopic composition of precipitation relates to climatic and meteorological parameters and how in turn we can use isotopic data as indicators of climatic processes in the present and past and 4 evaluate whether the isotopic composition of precipitation from the long term gnip station in addis ababa is representative of precipitation from elsewhere in ethiopia 2 methods 2 1 precipitation collections in total 894 precipitation samples were collected at four meteorological stations owned and operated by the ethiopian national meteorological agency at daily weekly and monthly intervals between august 2012 and november 2013 these four precipitation sampling stations gondar debre markos jimma and jijiga were selected to represent different physiographic and climatic regions of ethiopia fig 1 the gondar elev 2133 m and debre markos elev 2446 m stations are located in the western highlands that experience one rainy season the kiremt per year as the northernmost station gondar has a shorter rainy season than debre markos and its proximity to lake tana could influence precipitation dynamics the jimma station elev 1780 m located in the southwestern corner of the ethiopian highlands experiences rainfall year round due to the passage of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz diro et al 2008 the jijiga station elev 1609 m in the southeastern highlands experiences two distinct rainy seasons but receives considerably less precipitation each year than other three stations fig 1 custom made devices comprised of a funnel affixed to a plastic jug were used to collect precipitation mineral oil density 0 8 g cc was placed in the jugs of the weekly and monthly collectors to prevent evaporation of water precipitation samples were collected in the morning between 9 00 11 00 am at each station the volumetric amount of precipitation and the prevailing weather conditions were documented with each collection the daily water samples were stored in 3 8 ml 1 dram glass vials with polycone seal caps the weekly and monthly samples were stored in 15 ml glass vials with polycone seal caps the seals of all vials were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation and the vials were stored in a covered box daily precipitations samples were passed through 0 45 μm filter to remove particulates following procedures described by west et al 2010 the weekly and monthly water samples were separated from the mineral oil using a separatory funnel treated with activated charcoal for 24 h to remove organics and then passed through a 0 2 μm filter to remove particulates 2 2 laboratory analyses precipitation samples were analyzed for 18o 16o and 2h 1h ratios using a los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer model lwia 24ep and lgr triple water isotope analyzer model iwa 45ep via off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy at johns hopkins university jhu following the iaea standard procedure iaea 2009 a subset of the samples from the daily collections were analyzed at the university of utah s sirfer laboratory using a picarro l2130 i analyzer via cavity ring down spectroscopy to confirm the mineral oil used in the weekly and monthly samples has no effect on the isotopic composition we analyzed randomly selected samples on isotope ratio mass spectrometer and compared with result of the lgr analysis we found no significant difference between the two analyses of the two samples results are reported as δ18o and δ2h values which are defined as δ 2 h or δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios in the sample and standard the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow based on craig 1961 d excess is calculated as d excess δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o in reporting δ18o δ2h and d excess values in the text below we use the subscript precip to indicate that these values are associated with precipitation repeated measurements of the commercially available united states geological survey usgs isotopic reference waters usgs 45 46 47 and 48 were used as internal and external references calibrated to the vsmow slap scale an analytical run five samples bracketed by standards typically yielded standard deviations of 0 1 for δ18o and 0 3 for δ2h at jhu and 0 04 for δ18o and 0 3 for δ2h at sirfer the external precision of d excess precip is calculated as 0 8 and 0 4 for the analyses at jhu and sirfer for respectively outliers in this dataset were identified using d excess values two weekly data points jij w 120917 and jim w 130520 have very low d excess values 58 1 and 26 7 whereas d excess values of all other samples were 10 the combination of very low d excess precip and high δ18oprecip values from these samples suggests post collection evaporation might have modified their isotopic composition for this reason they were excluded from plots and statistical analyses but still included in table s1 for completeness 2 3 climate data and hysplit trajectories in order to explore how climate conditions affect the isotopic composition of precipitation we used the nearest grid point era interim daily 24 hours average climate reanalysis data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf including such variables as 2 meter air temperature and relative humidity intercomparisons of reanalysis products performed for ethiopia have shown that era interim compares favorably with other available reanalysis data tesfaye et al 2017 we measured the amount of water associated with each collection interval to determine the association between precipitation amount and the isotopic composition of precipitation table s1 in addition as a proxy for convective intensity the daily outgoing longwave radiation olr data from the nearest grid point were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data interp olr html we used the noaa hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model draxler 2011 to generate backward trajectories of air in order to evaluate potential changes in moisture source at the different collection stations during the study interval the global data assimilation system gdas 0 5 data were used for hysplit model runs and a starting height of 1000 m above ground level agl was chosen to target vapor rich parcels as most of the moisture is found within the lower 2000 m of the atmosphere wallace and hobbs 2006 for sensitivity tests different starting heights 500 m and 2000 m were also used for the trajectory calculations with similar results the daily vapor trajectories back to 240 h were calculated for six time intervals aug sep 2012 nov 2012 jan 2013 feb apr 2013 may jun 2013 aug 2013 and sep 2013 selected based on δ18oprecip value variations e g low δ18oprecip values in august 2013 high δ18oprecip values in march 2013 see gray boxes on fig 2 for the trajectory calculation the duration of 240 h 10 days was chosen because it is an average residence time of moisture in the atmosphere gat 2000 and the precipitation collection stations in ethiopia are located well in land all back trajectories were started at noon 12 00 local time because our precipitation samples for isotopic analysis were typically collected in the morning hours 3 results 3 1 isotopic variation of precipitation with different sampling intervals the stable isotopic composition of samples collected from the four stations between august 2012 and november 2013 are summarized in table 1 and fig 2 all original data are provided in table s1 across the four stations the daily data exhibit a larger range in δ18oprecip and δ2hprecip values 12 6 to 10 3 for δ18o 91 8 to 80 8 for δ2h than the weekly and monthly data fig 2 table 1 the daily d excess precip values range from 9 9 and 29 9 the limited number of data points for some time intervals e g january march at gondar december february at jijiga reflects the absence of rainfall i e the dry season not missing data fig 2 considering that δ2hprecip values generally vary linearly with δ18oprecip values craig 1961 for the remainder of this paper we mainly discuss variation in the observed δ18oprecip values and use d excess precip values to track deviations from the average δ18oprecip δ2hprecip relationship fig 3 amount weighted means of δ18oprecip values are used for comparisons of δ18oprecip values from different collection intervals i e daily weekly monthly comparisons of the amount of precipitation recovered from the daily weekly and monthly collectors indicate equivalent recovery and retention of precipitation among the different collectors tables s1 and s2 the measurements of the amount of monthly rainfall data are within 2σ of the long term monthly precipitation means for each meteorological station fig 1b f the amount weighted mean δ18oprecip and δ2hprecip values are highly consistent among daily weekly and monthly data table s2 the amount weighted daily data over the same collection periods are highly correlated with the weekly and monthly data table s3 the robust nature of the comparison suggests high level of data integrity and that the samples did not experience significant evaporation or isotopic fractionation during and after sample collection 3 2 isotopic distinctions among stations and seasons there is no significant difference in the amount weighted mean δ18oprecip values of daily samples among the four sampling stations over the 16 month sampling period anova p value 0 05 these values are similar to the amount weighted mean δ18oprecip values from monthly data in addis ababa sampled between 1961 and 2009 1 3 2 3 table 1 in contrast the mean d excess precip values are significantly different among the four stations p value 0 05 debre markos has the highest weighted mean d excess precip values 18 2 4 6 and jijiga yields the lowest mean d excess 11 1 4 2 table 1 these values bracket the amount weighted annual d excess precip value for the gnip station at addis ababa 13 8 4 2 table 1 despite similarities in the weighted mean δ18oprecip values from the different stations there are seasonal trends in the daily and weekly δ18oprecip values that distinguish the northwestern highland stations i e debre markos gondar jimma from the southeastern station of jijiga fig 2 the temporal variations of δ18oprecip values are similar for the three northwestern highland stations these stations are characterized by relatively low δ18oprecip values during the main rainy season june september and relatively high δ18oprecip values for the rest of the year fig 2a b d they also exhibit seasonal trends in d excess precip values with the lowest values between november and may fig 2a b d the seasonal patterns in d excess precip values are not as distinct as those observed in δ18oprecip values there are some seasonal variations in the δ18oprecip and d excess precip values from jijiga although they are not as strong as those observed in the northwest highland stations fig 2c we examined the seasonal pattern fig 2 and the correlations fig 4 table 2 between δ18oprecip values and local meteorological parameters precipitation amount temperature relative humidity and olr there is a weak negative correlation between δ18oprecip values and precipitation amount at all stations δ18oprecip values decrease with increasing relative humidity and decreasing outgoing long wavelength radiation olr at all stations there is no significant correlation observed between δ18oprecip values and temperature at the stations except for debre markos more detailed discussion on this is presented later in section 4 3 1 comparison of local meteoric water lines lmwls which are linear regressions of the δ18oprecip and δ2hprecip values provides a way to summarize the distribution of isotopic data from precipitation in one place the slopes of the amount weighted lmwls of the daily weekly and monthly collections from the four stations in this study cluster around 7 6 0 4 fig 3 the amount weighted lmwls slopes from the daily weekly and monthly data at all stations are similar and do not show statistically significant differences except for the weekly collection at jijiga slope which could be caused by sub cloud evaporation the slopes from all stations are close to the slope determined from the long term monthly collections at addis ababa 7 0 0 2 and elsewhere in eastern africa 7 0 0 2 to 8 1 0 2 table 3 rozanski et al 1996 however the intercepts of the mwls at our four stations vary from 10 5 0 3 at jijiga to 18 3 0 4 at debre markos the range in the observed intercepts is similar to the range observed at eastern and central africa from 6 8 0 7 at kericho kenya to 16 2 0 3 at virunga d r congo table 3 rozanski et al 1996 balagizi et al 2018 the intercept for the mwl at the addis ababa gnip station 11 5 0 6 plots within the range of intercepts observed from the stations monitored for this study 4 discussion 4 1 temporal trends precipitation samples collected at different frequencies enable us to evaluate whether daily and weekly isotopic data add value to monthly data which is the standard collection interval for gnip datasets iaea 2013 although daily weekly and monthly data show similar temporal trends in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values fig 2 the daily data show the highest amplitude in the seasonal variations of δ18oprecip and d excess precip values fig 2 the availability of daily data makes it possible to examine the influence of a single storm system on the isotopic composition of precipitation for example the low δ18oprecip values of the weekly and monthly data at jijiga in october 2012 are strongly influenced by a single storm event on october 27 2012 fig 2 the most prominent feature of the precipitation isotope record is the decrease in δ18oprecip values observed in the daily and weekly samples from gondar debre markos and jimma during the first three weeks of august 2013 fig 2a b d this trend in δ18oprecip values which is nearly synchronous at gondar debre markos and jimma cannot be clearly identified with the monthly samples alone the gnip monthly rainfall isotope data in addis ababa also misses the sub monthly trend in δ18oprecip values that is evident from both the daily and weekly collections at the three northwestern highlands stations the regional coherency and amplitude of this short decrease in δ18oprecip values with an amplitude of 4 in the weekly collections 8 in the daily collections is not evident in the monthly collections because it occurs over a 3 week time interval that spans two of the monthly collection intervals to evaluate the climatic controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation we performed correlation analysis between daily δ18oprecip values and variables representing daily climate conditions e g precipitation amount olr temperature rh table 2 fig 4b f j n daily δ18oprecip values show significant correlations with precipitation amount relative humidity and olr at all stations and with temperature at debre markos and gondar p 0 05 on the contrary no significant correlations are observed between monthly δ18oprecip values and these climate factors on monthly time scales except for with relative humidity and olr at debre markos and olr at gondar table 2 weekly δ18oprecip values show significant correlation with relative humidity and olr at the northwestern highland stations p 0 05 but no correlation with temperature at all four stations and largely insignificant correlation with precipitation amount table 2 the lack of statistical significance between our monthly δ18oprecip values and the climate factors could also be due to small sample size nevertheless our daily and weekly data signifies the need for high frequency sampling of precipitation to examine the climatic controls of isotopes in precipitation that are not evident in our monthly samples collection and the gnip monthly interval data collection in addis ababa 4 2 spatial and seasonal variation comparisons of the isotopic composition of precipitation at the four stations sampled for this study reflect climatological differences within ethiopia stations in the northwestern highlands of ethiopia debre markos gondar and jimma follow similar annual trends in daily weekly and monthly δ18oprecip values with low δ18oprecip values during the main rainy season this phenomenon is clearly exhibited in the latter half of our sampling campaign when we captured the full rainy season in 2013 specifically daily and weekly δ18oprecip values from gondar debre markos and jimma were consistently 2 between mid july and early september in 2013 with minima in daily δ18oprecip values occurring on the same day august 3 2013 at debre markos 10 9 and gondar 10 4 and then 5 days later at jimma 10 0 august 8 2013 fig 2 relatively low δ18oprecip values are also observed at these stations in the beginning of the study period in mid august 2012 although our sampling did not start early enough to capture the full rainy season in 2012 these trends are consistent with the monthly collections made at gondar debre markos and the long term gnip station at addis ababa which yield lower δ18oprecip values during the june september rainy season fig 2 however the amplitude of the trends in monthly data is considerably muted relative to the seasonal trends observed in the daily and weekly δ18oprecip values fig 2 the seasonal trend in δ18oprecip values from jijiga in the southeastern ethiopia highlands is less distinct than the seasonal trends in the northwestern highlands the variation in d excess precip values from the four collection stations is not as coherent as the records of δ18oprecip values but there is a clear difference in d excess precip values among the stations table 1 the spatial and seasonal variation in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values among stations we monitored provide avenues to understand the controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia the clearest separation among the isotopic data from precipitation collected at the four stations is between jijiga and the northwest highland stations jijiga does not exhibit the clear seasonal pattern in δ18oprecip values as the other stations and the d excess precip values are lower than the other stations table 1 jijiga s position in the southeastern plateau where it receives substantially less annual precipitation likely explains these distinctions the storms that result in rainfall in the northwest highlands do not reach jijiga the precipitation that does fall in jijiga is also likely susceptible to evaporation of raindrops which would result in lower d excess precip values as a result of re evaporation of falling raindrops which is typical in arid climates dansgaard 1964 stewart 1975 gat 1996 guan et al 2013 among the three northwestern highland stations gondar debre markos and jimma the most striking observations are as follows 1 there are distinct decreases in δ18oprecip values in the june september rainy season at all three stations 2 the seasonal trend in δ18oprecip values is synchronous among the stations and 3 d excess precip values from these three stations do not exhibit seasonal trends that are as distinct as δ18oprecip values but yield the lowest values during the drier part of the year january april when δ18oprecip values are highest fig 2 we explore explanations for these observations in the following section section 4 3 and summarize these explanations in table 4 4 3 explanations for the observed spatial and seasonal isotope variations 4 3 1 local climate controls on δ18oprecip 4 3 1 1 precipitation amount the isotopic composition of precipitation is influenced by the amount of precipitation amount effect temperature distance from the source continentality altitude continental recycling and convective activity dansgaard 1964 salati et al 1979 rozanski et al 1993 worden et al 2007 risi et al 2008 in the tropics the most obvious explanation between the association of lower δ18oprecip values during the peak of the rainy season would be the amount effect which is a phenomenon observed throughout the tropics where there is a strong negative correlation between the amount of precipitation and monthly δ18oprecip values dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 high rainfall amounts have been traditionally associated with lower δ18oprecip values this is commonly attributed to the progressive distillation of the heavier water isotopologues from an air parcel and because raindrops associated with bigger rain events experience less evaporation and less exchange with vapor below the cloud base dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 vuille et al 2003 lee and fung 2008 however in this study we show no significant correlation between monthly δ18oprecip values and the amount of rainfall p 0 05 and only a weak correlation with daily δ18oprecip values fig 4 table 2 even in the case of the daily δ18oprecip values that show weak correlation p 0 05 the correlation coefficient r is low fig 4 table 2 the apparent difference in the relationships between precipitation amount and δ18oprecip values for the daily weekly and monthly collections is likely due to the strong influence of small storms on the amount δ18oprecip relationship for the daily collections the correlations weaken for the daily collections if small precipitation amounts 5 mm are excluded r 0 3 for all sites p 0 05 for all sites but gondar the strong influence of small precipitation amount samples in the regressions of the daily data also explains why the δ18oprecip amount trends are muted or absent in the weekly and monthly collections where smaller precipitation amounts that may comprise a daily sample contribute to a smaller proportion of a total weekly or monthly sample likewise we also observe that the relationship between δ18oprecip values and precipitation amount is particularly strong for daily collections of rainfall during the dry season r 0 4 and p 0 05 for all sites but jijiga where δ18oprecip values of low intensity rains are more affected by re evaporation of falling raindrops than larger events kebede and travi 2012 as a result the very low daily δ18oprecip values that we observe in august 2013 at gondar debre markos and jimma cannot exclusively be explained by the increase in the amount of precipitation this observation agrees with results from other studies that show that the high rainfall amounts and local rainout mechanisms do not fully explain low δ18oprecip values associated with rainy season precipitation in eastern africa and elsewhere in the tropics rozanski et al 1996 kebede and travi 2012 otte et al 2017 balagizi et al 2018 martin et al 2018 4 3 1 2 evaporation at source and during precipitation the d excess precip values are informative as they can provide insight into synoptic weather systems and moisture source guan et al 2013 the global average d excess in precipitation is 10 craig 1961 and it is attributed to direct moisture from ocean evaporation but high 10 d excess precip values can be indicative of moisture sources with a continental recycled component dansgaard 1964 the high 10 d excess precip values that we observe in the northwestern highland stations fig 3 table 1 are consistent with evaporative moisture sources from central africa the red sea and or the mediterranean that have been identified by viste and sorteberg 2013a table 4 high d excess precip values are also observed elsewhere in africa such as in tanzania where they have been attributed to the influence of recycled moisture on precipitation e g otte et al 2017 the lowest d excess and highest δ18oprecip values among the northwestern highland stations occur during january may when there is the least amount of rain this might be attributable to sub cloud evaporation i e re evaporation of the falling raindrops due to low relative humidity compared to the rainy season δ18oprecip inversely related to relative humidity fig 4d h i p lower d excess precip values during short rains is also observed elsewhere in eastern africa and in the tropics which corresponds with low intensity rains and lower relative humidity and can result from sub cloud evaporation of rain droplets e g otte et al 2017 table 4 4 3 1 3 role of convection convective rainfall makes a significant contribution to rainfall in the tropics and in ethiopia mutai and ward 2000 segele and lamb 2005 in the tropics convective activity is also associated with lower δ18oprecip values and considered to be a strong determinant of low δ18oprecip values with rainy season precipitation e g tharammal et al 2017 martin et al 2018 higher rain rates and droplet formation at higher elevations and lower temperatures are associated with lower δ18oprecip values of convective rainfall in the tropics e g risi et al 2008 kurita et al 2009 martin et al 2018 for this reason we used olr as a proxy for convective intensity as it measures top of cloud temperature which is inversely related with the depth of convection arkin and ardanuy 1989 the northwestern highland stations show clear seasonality in olr values olr is lowest in the rainy season june september corresponding to the lowest δ18oprecip values suggesting that strong deep convective activities during the rainy season fig 2 δ18oprecip is significantly correlated to olr for all stations fig 4 with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 31 jimma to 0 5 debre markos the correlation is even stronger between the δ18oprecip and the olr values of the previous day 0 36 r 0 58 because the precipitation samples are usually collected in the morning hence represent the rainfall of the previous 24 h the similar olr seasonal variations among the three northwestern highland stations as with δ18oprecip also suggest that regional scale convective systems affect the entire northwestern part of ethiopia during the rainy season in contrast olr in jijiga does not exhibit a similar seasonality as the rest of the northwestern highland stations which is consistent with distinct weather conditions in the southeastern highlands using a multiple regression model we examined how much variability in δ18oprecip could be explained by the combination of all four climate factors precipitation amount temperature olr relative humidity see table 5 the models based on weekly data results in the highest r2 ranging from 0 37 jimma up to 0 61 debre markos the model based on daily data are also highly significant with r2 ranging from 0 25 jimma to 0 42 debre markos however none of the models based on monthly data are significant and this could also be partly due to small monthly sample size given the complexity in the spatial and seasonal variations of precipitation in ethiopia in addition to the potential effects of climatic conditions during precipitation events discussed above sources of moisture and moisture transport path could also affect the isotopic composition of precipitation 4 3 2 effects of moisture source and transport path on δ18oprecip and d excessprecip values moisture from multiple sources including the indian ocean the mediterranean and red seas central africa and the gulf of guinea reaches the western ethiopian highlands during the rainy season seleshi and demaree 1995 segele and lamb 2005 viste and sorteberg 2013a b many studies have tried to invoke the relative contribution of these different sources to explain seasonal trends in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values in ethiopia and the anomalously enriched δ18oprecip values at addis ababa rozanski et al 1996 levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 costa et al 2014 however the conclusions from these studies are limited because they rely on isotopic data from monthly rainfall collections in addis ababa that do not have the resolution required to attribute isotopic variation in precipitation to specific climatological phenomena table 4 presents possible ways that moisture source and transport path might affect the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia to explore some of these processes we calculated air mass back trajectories using the hysplit model see section 2 3 at our four sampling stations for 6 time periods that are representative of the isotopic variation we observed over the 16 month precipitation collection interval gray boxes fig 2 figs s1 s4 table s4 the hysplit trajectory analyses indicate that in august 2013 when δ18oprecip values are lowest at gondar debre markos and jimma back trajectories indicate moisture sources with a southerly component fig 5 this southerly component can also be seen in the 2012 rainy season august september 2012 at jimma and to some degree at debre markos although northerly and westerly trajectories dominate at gondar at this time figs s1 s2 s4 outside of the june september rainy season trajectories reaching debre markos and gondar predominantly come from the north and east at jimma the trajectories are primarily from the south except between november 2012 and january 2013 when the back trajectories indicate easterly transport at all times of year trajectories reaching jijiga are southerly or southeasterly with a small northerly or northeasterly component except during the march may rains when the southeasterly component is most clear fig s3 although there is some coherency to these results the spatial and seasonal patterns of the hysplit trajectory results do not match the patterns that we observe in the isotopic data as such we cannot make clear links between moisture paths and the variation in δ18oprecip and d excess precip values while moisture source and transport path likely place important controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia this level of analysis cannot resolve them additional and more comprehensive analyses of moisture sources and fluxes along the transport path during the rainy season would help to resolve the role of moisture source on the δ18oprecip values in ethiopia in summary our analysis shows that the main controls on the isotopic composition of precipitation in ethiopia are likely conditions during precipitation events and particularly the presence of regional scale convective systems that cover the northwestern highlands of ethiopia it appears that convective activity might be more important than rainfall amount in controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation during the rainy season while moisture source and path may also be important we do not yet have enough information to fully probe these effects 5 conclusions ethiopian precipitation isotope data collected on daily weekly and monthly intervals at four stations debre markos gondar jijiga and jimma shows seasonal and spatial variability the most prominent observations include 1 the three northwest highland stations exhibit similar seasonal variations in δ18oprecip values that is not apparent in jijiga in the southeastern highland and 2 there is a nearly synchronous pronounced decrease 8 in δ18oprecip values in the three northwest highland stations in august 2013 that cannot be explained by the amount effect the daily δ18oprecip data provide the opportunity to investigate local controlling factors precipitation amount relative humidity and olr which explain up to 50 of variation in δ18oprecip values in ethiopian precipitation using daily olr data we also demonstrate that convective activity explains seasonal δ18oprecip variations in ethiopia precipitation as with the trends in δ18oprecip values the olr results from the three northwestern highland stations are in synchronous with each other and suggest regional scale convective systems affect the entire northwestern part of ethiopia during the rainy season the moisture trajectory analysis indicates that this strong convective activity and low δ18oprecip values in august 2013 coincide with southerly trajectories at all three northwestern highland stations this coincidence suggests that moisture source or transport path may also play a role in the regional decrease in δ18oprecip values but we are reluctant to take these explanations further as a more detailed moisture source and trajectory analysis would be required to fully understand these links fully moreover with 16 month isotope data collection alone we do not claim to have an all inclusive explanation of the variability of the isotopic composition of ethiopian precipitation if isotopic variation in precipitation is to be used as an effective tool for documenting and monitoring hydroclimate variability in ethiopia then we need to generate additional records of this variability and probe the mechanisms that drive it comprehensive moisture source analysis will be particularly useful to investigate the impact of moisture source and transport path on variations in δ18oprecip values in addition to providing integrated views of modern processes the data from our study provide useful perspective for paleoclimate studies in the region as sedimentary archives of δ18o and δ2h values are commonly used to infer past variations in rainfall amount and changes in moisture dynamics e g bedaso et al 2010 levin et al 2011 feakins 2013 costa et al 2014 tierney et al 2017 the weak correlation between rainfall amount and δ18oprecip or δ2hprecip values in ethiopian rainfall today should temper interpretations that equate lower δ18o or δ2h values from sedimentary archives with wetter intervals likewise we do not observe a strong association between the isotopic composition of precipitation and moisture source instead lower δ18o or δ2h values from sedimentary archives may indicate times of greater storm intensity or more convection but not necessarily a change in the amount of moisture delivered to a region author contribution

5599,traditional water retention models that use the residual water content parameter fail to accurately describe the dry end of the soil water retention curve swrc we developed two and three segment smooth continuous swrc models acknowledging the existence of three saturation states for water contents ranging from saturation to oven dryness the equations near the oven dryness end in both models were obtained based on the assumption of proportionality between the soil water content and the logarithm of suction the equations in the wet range for both models were modified from the van genuchten model and or brook corey model s by removing the residual water content parameter the continuity and smoothness conditions at the junction points reduced the fitting parameters of the three and two segment models from 9 to 4 and from 6 to 3 respectively both models were tested with water retention data from the washington soil database and the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda over nearly the entire range both models were also compared with seven existing swrc models and were evaluated on the basis of the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 the root mean square error rmse and the kashyap information criteria kic the testing results showed that the three segment model performed better than the two segment model at fitting the swrc at the dry end for the three segment model the adj r2 value was greater than 0 90 the rmse was less than 0 02 and the mean kic value was 67 0 and these values were superior to those of the other models in addition the three segment model was robust and stable for extrapolation of values in the dry range when data near the dry end were unavailable keywords water retention curve full range oven dryness segmental models 1 introduction the soil water retention curve swrc which relates the soil water content and the matric potential is the most fundamental soil hydraulic parameter for simulating unsaturated soil behaviors accurate swrc models are essential for providing realistic descriptions of soil hydrology broadbridge and white 1988 silva and grifoll 2007 dan et al 2015 over the past decades various swrc models have been developed to fit retention data e g brooks and corey 1966 van genuchten 1980 khlosi et al 2008 madi et al 2018 the models of brook and corey 1966 and van genuchten 1980 are among the most popular for fitting swrc data in the wet range kuang and jiao 2014 and can be combined with hydraulic conductivity models mualem 1976 vogel and cislerova 1988 however they are not appropriate for dry soil webb 2000 silva and grifoll 2007 when used in numerical simulations the traditional swrc models fail to describe evaporation from dry soil since they do not account for water contents below the residual water content nimmo 1991 groenevelt and grant 2004 ciocca et al 2014 the traditional models assume that the minimum of soil water content is associated with an infinite suction which contrasts with the finite suctions experimentally obtained at oven dry water contents campbell and shiozawa 1992 rossi and nimmo 1994 lu et al 2008 since the 1990s swrc models have been proposed for the entire range of soil water content first by extending traditional models towards the dry end and later by introducing novel segmental models ross et al 1991 added a term to the original campbell 1974 model to ensure that the curves were extended to oven dryness morel seytoux and nimmo 1999 extrapolated the brooks corey model b c model to zero residual water content by using the junction model by rossi and nimmo 1994 webb 2000 extended the van genuchten model vg model to zero liquid saturation by using a log linear relationship fayer and simmons 1995 modified the b c and vg models for oven dryness by replacing the residual saturation with an adsorption equation zhang 2011 extended the lower bound of the b c and vg models from the residual water content to the oven dry condition by dividing the swrc into two segments fredlund and xing 1994 derived a general model for swrcs across the whole range according to the assumption that the shape of a retention curve is a model of the soil pore size distribution the general model can provide a good fit for sand silt and clay soils over the entire suction range from 0 to 107 cm water many other retention models with the full range of matric suction have been proposed by applying a lognormal distribution law to the soil pore radius distribution function kosugi 1996 nimmo 1997 khlosi et al 2006 in addition due to the distinct characteristics of the high medium and low suction ranges of swrcs segmental models were developed to describe swrcs across the entire range for instance rossi and nimmo 1994 developed two models a sum model and a junction model over the complete range based on segmental models dan et al 2015 proposed a two step model for describing a continuous swrc over the full range of saturation by separating the water retention curve into dry and wet regions the evaluation of swrc models has shown that compared with a single swrc model the segmental models can better fit the retention data over the full range of saturation and may be applied to more soil types cornelis et al 2005 khlosi et al 2008 lu et al 2008 schneider and goss 2012b however most of the segmental models have no physical meaning due to only fitting the data with a polynomial silva and grifoll 2007 goss and madliger 2007 found that the segmental model rossi and nimmo 1994 did not satisfactorily fit the experimental data because there has been a general lack of measured dry end swrc data there is a lack of models to predict the entire swrc from saturation to oven dryness for all soil textures khlosi et al 2008 with the development of measuring equipment for swrcs the soil water content and matric potential under dry conditions can be measured more rapidly and accurately using different techniques such as a water activity meter dew point potential meter relative humidity sensor and vacuum microbalance gee et al 1992 sokołowska et al 2002 schneider and goss 2012a at present a substantial amount of data is available from published studies e g campbell and shiozawa 1992 nemes et al 2001 zhang 2011 therefore it is necessary to develop a segmental model with physical significance to satisfactorily describe the whole range of swrcs the objectives of this study are to develop novel two and three segment swrc models based on the physical features of the three flow states for the dehydration process from saturation to oven dryness and to compare the performances of these models with those of existing swrc models using a variety of published soil water retention data 2 theory 2 1 the swrc description as graphically illustrated in fig 1 the saturation states of the desorption process from saturation to oven dryness are categorized into three states saturated flow capillary flow and film flow tuller and or 2005 zhang 2011 or et al 2013 correspondingly a complete swrc can be approximated as a composite of three segments at the beginning of soil desorption state 1 the soil pores are filled with water the soil is saturated and the corresponding matric suction is zero segment 1 as soil water content decreases air begins to enter into the pores the saturated soil becomes unsaturated with interconnected pendular rings state 2 the matric suction significantly increases with a decrease in the soil water content as described by the second segment of the retention curve segment 2 unsaturated flow during this stage is mainly forced by capillary pressure when the soil water content is less than the residual water content a thin film of water mediates flux between adjacent particles state 3 during this stage liquid water becomes incapable of moving freely and vapor becomes the major component of the water flux saito et al 2006 in addition the liquid water content near oven dryness decreases linearly with increasing logarithmic matric suction segment 3 therefore three distinct states of soil water during dehydration correspond to the three segments of the full range of swrc and each segment of the complete swrc has its own characteristics traditional swrc models generally provide suitable descriptions of segments 1 and 2 but mostly fail to describe the dry end of the swrc in addition none of these models are suitable for all soil textures therefore a novel model needs to be developed to generally describe all types of swrcs from saturation to oven dryness according to the features of the three segments of the swrc 2 2 the three segment swrc model for segment 1 of the swrc the campbell 1974 model b c model and vg model are universal basic models however the b c and campbell 1974 models are both exponential with a sharp discontinuity at the air entry point when it is greater than the air entry value the water content is regarded as a constant by the two models which is not consistent with the actual curve for segment 1 therefore these two models are not suitable for describing the swrc at the saturated end although the vg model can well describe the saturation end of the swrc it cannot describe the dry end due to the infinite suction associated with the residual water content therefore the vg model must be modified to describe segment 1 namely the saturation s is used to replace the effective saturation s e in the original vg model ciocca et al 2014 1 s θ θ s 1 α ϕ n 1 n 1 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where s e is the effective saturation s is the modified saturation θ is the soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 θ s is the saturated soil water content cm3 cm 3 θ r is the residual soil water content cm3 cm 3 and ϕ is the soil matric suction cm α 0 cm 1 and n 1 are the curve fitting parameters the air entry point along the swrc is a distinct feature of segment 2 among traditional models only the b c model takes into account this conspicuous feature and can effectively fit the retention data for segment 2 however the b c model also has the same problem as the vg model this study modifies the b c model by taking the residual water content as zero which is an alternate form of the campbell 1974 model 2 θ θ s ϕ e ϕ λ ϕ ϕ e where ϕ e is the air entry matric suction cm and λ is a fitting parameter related to the shape of the curve during the film flow stage water retention is governed by adsorption the relationship of water content versus suction can be described by a logarithmic model proposed by campbell and shiozawa 1992 which assumes that the water content becomes approximately proportional to the logarithm of the suction in a dry soil orchiston 1953 tested the proportionality of water content and suction and found a good fit for the low content data the relationship between water content and suction is expressed by the following equation fayer and simmons 1995 3 θ 1 ln ϕ ln ϕ 0 θ a where θ a is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 when ϕ 1 m and ϕ 0 is the matric suction at the oven dry water content m according to the features of the three segments of the retention curve we propose a three segment swrc model in the whole range as follows 4 θ i θ s 1 α ϕ n 1 n 1 0 ϕ ϕ a θ ii θ s ϕ e ϕ λ ϕ a ϕ ϕ b θ iii log 10 ϕ 0 log 10 ϕ log 10 ϕ 0 log 10 ϕ b θ b ϕ b ϕ ϕ 0 where θ i θ ii and θ iii are the water contents in the three segments of the retention curve cm 3 cm3 ϕ a and ϕ b are the soil matric potentials at the two junction points of the three segments of the retention curve cm θ b is the water content corresponding to the suction ϕ b at the second junction point the other variables and parameters in eq 4 are the same as those mentioned above to ensure the continuity and smoothness of the segmental swrc the four equations that impose the continuity of the global model and its first derivatives at the two junction points are expressed as follows 5 θ i ϕ a θ ii ϕ a 6 θ i ϕ a ϕ θ ii ϕ a ϕ 7 θ ii ϕ b θ iii ϕ b 8 θ ii ϕ b ϕ θ iii ϕ b ϕ eq 4 contains nine parameters if θ s and ϕ 0 are known the number of the unknown parameters is seven α n ϕ a ϕ b ϕ e λ and θ b four of the parameters α ϕ a ϕ b and θ b can be determined by the continuous conditions described above i e eqs 5 8 9 ϕ a ϕ e n 1 n 1 λ 1 λ 1 1 n 10 α ϕ a λ n 1 λ 1 n 11 ϕ b ϕ 0 exp 1 λ 12 θ b e θ s ϕ e ϕ 0 λ in this study θ s is predetermined according to the laboratory measurement and ϕ 0 is obtained by fitting the retention data 2 3 the two segment swrc model traditional swrc models with a single equation generally describe segments 1 and 2 of swrcs these two segments can be combined as one segment which corresponds to segment 1 in some two segment models e g the webb model zhang model and others in table 4 as an alternate version of the three segment swrc model the two segment swrc model directly combines the first and last equations of the three segment swrc model 13 θ i θ s 1 α ϕ n 1 n 1 0 ϕ ϕ i θ ii log 10 ϕ 0 log 10 ϕ log 10 ϕ 0 log 10 ϕ i θ i ϕ i ϕ ϕ 0 where θ i and θ ii are the water contents for the two segments of the retention curve cm 3 cm3 θ i and ϕ i are the soil water content and its corresponding matric suction at the junction point cm other symbols in eq 13 are the same as those of eq 4 if θ s is known the number of fitting parameters in eq 13 is five α n ϕ i θ i and ϕ 0 but two of these are determined by the conditions that ensure the continuity of both the model and its first derivative at ϕ i such continuity conditions are expressed by the following equations 14 θ i ϕ

zero water content is sometimes difficult and time consuming in this study published water retention data sets are used to test the two proposed segmental swrc models the data sets are abstracted from the washington soil datasets campbell and shiozawa 1992 and the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda nemes et al 2001 the soil properties of the washington soil data are shown in table 1 this dataset includes six different soils with sand contents of 9 89 and clay content of 5 47 and the measured matric suction ranges from water column heights of 30 to 3 106 cm from near saturation to near air dry this dataset has been used extensively to develop or test complete swrc models this study also adopts this dataset to test the two novel swrc models the unsoda database publicly and freely provides information on unsaturated soil hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity and basic soil properties particle size bulk density etc nemes et al 2001 the laboratory drying branch of the retention curve includes data from 730 soil samples however some of the data are of poor quality and cannot be used to fit the full range swrc model thus 43 samples are selected from the laboratory drying branch using the following criteria 1 water retention data were obtained from at least near saturation to when possible near oven dryness 2 nearly all soil texture classes are considered and 3 the basic soil information is available as much as possible particle size distribution texture bulk density and saturation the water retention data from the unsoda database are listed in table 2 the soil particle size distribution of the 49 soil samples from the washington soil data and the unsoda database are presented in the soil texture ternary diagram fig 2 3 2 statistical analyses numerous statistical indices can be applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the swrc models in this study the fitting performance of the different swrc models is assessed by using the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 the root mean square error rmse and kashyap information criteria kic the adj r2 is designed to take into account the number of parameters in the model and is employed to assess how well the soil water content approximates the observed data 18 adj r 2 1 n 1 n p 1 r 2 19 r 2 1 i 1 n θ i θ i 2 i 1 n θ i θ 2 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination

continuity and smoothness of the segmental models at junction points the optimal solution of the segmental models may become a difficult problem in this study although the continuity conditions of the two models reduce the fitting parameters the models still remain highly nonlinear popular optimization software programs e g matlab originpro and spss depend highly on the appropriate initial values of parameters which are provided or guessed by users for finding the optimal solution however the software program 1stopt first optimization has strong optimization power for nonlinear complex models because its computational core uses the universal global optimization ugo algorithm developed by the algorithm s developers http www 7d soft com en this algorithm solves the problem of needing to provide for numerical optimization in other words a random initial value is provided by the algorithm instead of by the user and the ugo algorithm then finds the optimal solution in addition the code is very accessible for users and is almost the same as the original form of the equation constraint conditions for the optimization calculations can be directly reflected in the objective function this algorithm can reach the correct result with a random initial starting value in most cases 90 this study adopts the quasi newton ugo algorithms of the 1stopt software to obtain the best numerical solution of the nonlinear swrc models 4 results 4 1 test of the novel segmental swrc models the performances of both novel segmental swrc models are tested with the 49 published retention data six data points from the washington datasets and 43 from the unsoda because of the wide use of the washington soil dataset for developing an entire swrc model the fitting results of this dataset are taken as an example to discuss the performances of the two models fig 3 depicts the measured retention data and fitted swrcs in the semilog coordinate system the scattered open squares are the measured water retention data the solid red lines and blue dashed lines are the retention curves fitted by the three and two segment swrc models respectively the two models provide continuous and smooth curves from saturation to oven dryness by satisfactorily fitting the measured retention data for the six soils especially for the palouse b and salkum soil samples the goodness of fit values of the two novel swrc models are almost the same for instance the adj r2 values of the two models for palouse b are 0 990 and 0 991 and the rmse values are 0 013 and 0 012 for the other four soil retention datasets the fitting performances of the three segment model are better than those of the two segment model as table 3 presents the adj r2 values of the two models for the washington datasets are very high between 0 919 and 0 994 in addition their rmse values are relatively low and vary between 0 009 and 0 022 it is concluded that the two novel swrc models both perform well at describing the washington retention data across the full range from saturation to oven dryness to further test both novel swrc models the 43 soil retention data from the unsoda are fitted by the two swrc models fig 4 shows the variations in the adj r2 and rmse values for the two novel swrc models using the unsoda data fig 4 a shows that the adj r2 values for the three segment model are between 0 913 and 0 999 and that those for the two segment model are between 0 873 and 0 995 although the adj r2 range of the two segment model is larger than that of the three segment model these two swrc models have almost the same performance in terms of the maximum the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles of adj r2 values the maximum adj r2 values of the two models are almost 1 0 and the median values of the two models are also similar approximately 0 985 the 25th and 75th percentiles for the two models are 0 995 and 0 965 respectively most of the adj r2 values of the two models fall between the 25th and 75th percentiles these results illustrate that the measured retention data can be effectively fitted by these two models as shown in fig 4 b the rmse values of the three segment swrc model are between 0 003 and 0 021 and those of the two segment model are between 0 002 and 0 037 the rmse values approaching to zero for these two models indicate that the overall error between the measured and fitted swrc is very small the fitting results of the unsoda retention data show that the two novel models can satisfactorily describe the swrcs of almost all soil types and that the three segment model exhibits better performance than the two segment model 4 2 comparison of segmental models to evaluate the behavior of both novel models we compared them with seven other popular swrc models using the unsoda data the expressions and parameters of the seven swrc models are listed in table 4 the rn2 model by rossi and nimmo 1994 generalizes a complete swrc as two segments and combines a power model with a logarithmic model by adding them the rn3 model by rossi and nimmo 1994 splits the swrc into three segments and combines a power law and a logarithmic equation with a junction rather than a summation the peter model peter 2013 is a popular entire swrc model that accounts for capillary and adsorptive water retention the zhang model zhang 2011 is an extended vg model which separates a swrc into two segments by defining the critical pressure head and the critical water content based on the capillary flow and the absorbed flow the dg model vanderlinden 2017 is the sum of a double exponential model and the groenevelt and grant model the webb model extended the vg model to zero water content by a linear equation on a semilog plot in the adsorption region webb 2000 the vg model is a traditional model for describing the swrc between saturated and residual water contents and is very popular these models have been tested with different soil water retention data and have been widely used to describe the swrcs of different soil types worldwide this study employs these seven models as references to evaluate the performances of the two novel segmental models this study employs adj r2 rmse and kic to evaluate and compare the performances of the two novel segmental models and the seven other swrc models as shown in fig 5 although the maximum adj r2 value close to 1 and the 25th percentile is greater than 0 90 for each model fig 5 a the variations in the adj r2 values of the models are significantly different the adj r2 for the novel three segment model varies only between 0 90 and 1 00 and most adj r2 values fall between the 25th and 75th percentiles the 25th and 75th percentiles of adj r2 values for the novel two segment model peter model and dg model are similar to those of the three segment model but the ranges of the minimum to the maximum adj r2 values of these models are greater than that of the novel three segment model although the rn2 rn3 zhang and webb models are also segmental models that consist of two or three equations the adj r2 variations of these models and the differences between the 25th and 75th percentiles are larger than those of the two novel segmental swrc models the vg model is a traditional and single segment model and its adj r2 range is the largest with a maximum of 0 995 and a minimum of 0 330 the adj r2 results show that the novel three segment model explains the measured retention data better than the other segmental models and that the segmental models can describe the retention data better than the single segment model the vg model fig 5 b depicts the rmse variations of the nine swrc models the minimum rmse value of each model is close to 0 but the maximum varies greatly the maximum rmse value of the vg model is four times that of the novel three segment model the maximum rmse value of the novel three segment model is only 0 021 but that for the vg model is 0 093 the maximum rmse values of the other models novel two segment rn2 rn3 peter zhang dg and webb are less than 0 04 and the 75th percentiles of these models are not greater than 0 02 on the whole the segmental models have a much smaller error than the vg model and the three segment model has a better performance than any other model the kic is employed as the model discrimination criterion the best model is associated with the lowest kic value fig 5 c shows the kic variations of all the models the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles of the kic values of the novel three segment model are smaller than those of the other models and this model ranks first among the compared models according to the maximum minimum and median values and the 25th and 75th percentiles of the kic values three models the novel two segment rn2 and rn3 together rank second among all the models the kic ranges of the other four models peter zhang dg and webb are significantly worse because they have more fitting parameters although their adj r2 and rmse values indicate good performances therefore these four models are grouped into the third rank the kic values of the vg model are between those of the selected models but the performances of the vg model based on the adj r2 and rmse values are very poor because of the effect of the residual water content parameter that does not allow the water content to approach zero the adj r2 rmse and kic results indicate that the novel three segment model has the best ability to describe the entire swrc from saturation to oven dryness and should be the preferred model among all the candidate swrc models in contrast the vg model is the opposite the performances of the other segmental swrc models vary but can acceptably fit the full range of retention data 4 3 effects of cutoff values ϕ c on the models extrapolation in the dry range to evaluate the ability of the two novel models to extrapolate the swrc in the dry range regression analysis has been performed on subsets of data that exclude all the measured points with suctions greater than a certain cutoff value ϕ c in this scheme subsets of different lengths generated from the washington retention data used for the model test in section 4 1 are employed to check the sensitivity of the segmental swrc models to an incomplete range of data because the matric suction ϕ 0 corresponding to the oven dry water content is known or can be predetermined this calculation is an interpolation between cutoff suction ϕ c and the maximum value ϕ 0 rather than an extrapolation however this procedure is referred to as extrapolation since the modeling is outside the range of the measured data because the washington soil water retention data cover the entire range from near saturation to near oven dryness these data are employed to analyze the effect of cutoff suction on the performance of swrc models according to the ranges of the water retention data four different cutoff suctions are set namely 1 106 1 105 1 104 and 1 103 cm for the six soils each measured dataset with suction greater than the cutoff values is excluded and four different subsets of data for each of the soils are generated corresponding to four different suction ranges of 0 1 103 0 1 104 0 1 105 and 0 1 106 cm water therefore there are adequate data for the extrapolation computations these new subsets of data are used to extrapolate the retention data in the dry range fig 6 presents the adj r2 and rmse values calculated for the two novel models using the whole dataset and the four subsets as shown in fig 6 a and b for the six soils the adj r2 values of the three segment model decrease and rmse values increase with the lowing of the cutoff suction when the cutoff suction is not less than 1 104 cm the adj r2 and rmse values vary little with the decrease in the cutoff suction however when the cutoff value decreases to 1 103 cm the adj r2 values of the six soils suddenly decrease and the rmse values suddenly increase for example the adj r2 and rmse values of soil 4 salkum soil vary the most the adj r2 decreases from 0 99 to 0 77 and the rmse increases from 0 01 to 0 07 therefore when the cutoff suction is not less than 1 104 cm the model still has a good ability to describe the curve in the dry range furthermore it is concluded that the novel three segment model is not strictly sensitive to the length of the soil water retention data and its performance is robust and stable for different data lengths fig 6 c and d depict the adj r2 and rmse variations of the six soil samples for the two segment swrc model corresponding to the five cutoff suction schemes the adj r2 and rmse variations of the two segment model are different from those of the three segment model for the two segment model although the adj r2 values decrease and rmse values increase with the decrease in the cutoff suction overall the responses of the adj r2 and rmse values to the cutoff suctions differ among the six soil samples for example adj r2 and rmse values of soils 1 and 3 palouse and walla walla soil begin to suddenly change when the cutoff suction decreases from ϕ 0 to 1 105 cm additionally the adj r2 and rmse values of soils 2 and 5 palouse b and royal soil are not sensitive to the different cutoff suction schemes however with the decrease in cutoff suction from 1 104 cm to 1 103 cm the adj r2 values increase instead of decreasing while the rmse values decrease instead of increasing therefore the performance of the two segment model is highly dependent on the length of soil retention data and has significant uncertainty to better describe swrcs from saturation to oven dryness if the measured data length is longer and the number of data samples is large lower values of cutoff suction may be acceptable rossi and nimmo 1994 however because many factors e g soil texture bulk density and organic matter content affect the swrc distribution the acceptable minimum cutoff suction or number of data points for a given soil is difficult to determine in the laboratory the measured swrcs for many soils are generally determined under wet conditions and their maximum suction ranges are between 103 and 104 cm the three segment swrc model solves the issues of dependence on the data length and can effectively provide the full range of swrcs using the general retention data measured in the laboratory 5 conclusions traditional swrc models e g the vg model and b c model with the residual water content parameter cannot be applied for dry conditions according to the three saturation states saturated flow capillary flow and film flow of soil water during the desorption process this study developed two novel segmental models that span the entire range of saturation one model is called the three segment model which generalizes a complete swrc into three segments corresponding to the three saturation states compared with other popular segmental swrc models this model with three fitting parameters provides good fits over the whole range of saturation for almost all soil types the extrapolation ability of this model to dry conditions has been tested with limited data subsets the results illustrate that the three segment model is robust and stable for finite soil water retention data the other model is called the two segment model which generalizes a complete swrc into two segments this model can be considered a simplified version of the three segment model it is also tested by comparison with other segmental swrc models and can provide good fits for most soils the suction ϕ 0 corresponding to the zero water content in this model is indirectly determined by the analytical expression of other parameters according to the continuous conditions the length of the measured retention data in the wet range can affect the performance of the two segment model in the dry range the comparison of models shows that the goodness of fit of both models to measured data supports the validity of the assumption of proportionality between the soil water content and the logarithm of suction near the oven dryness end the combination of this logarithmic equation with other equations developed for the high water content range produces a model that is practical and realistic from saturation to oven dryness credit authorship contribution statement chaoyang du

5599,traditional water retention models that use the residual water content parameter fail to accurately describe the dry end of the soil water retention curve swrc we developed two and three segment smooth continuous swrc models acknowledging the existence of three saturation states for water contents ranging from saturation to oven dryness the equations near the oven dryness end in both models were obtained based on the assumption of proportionality between the soil water content and the logarithm of suction the equations in the wet range for both models were modified from the van genuchten model and or brook corey model s by removing the residual water content parameter the continuity and smoothness conditions at the junction points reduced the fitting parameters of the three and two segment models from 9 to 4 and from 6 to 3 respectively both models were tested with water retention data from the washington soil database and the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda over nearly the entire range both models were also compared with seven existing swrc models and were evaluated on the basis of the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 the root mean square error rmse and the kashyap information criteria kic the testing results showed that the three segment model performed better than the two segment model at fitting the swrc at the dry end for the three segment model the adj r2 value was greater than 0 90 the rmse was less than 0 02 and the mean kic value was 67 0 and these values were superior to those of the other models in addition the three segment model was robust and stable for extrapolation of values in the dry range when data near the dry end were unavailable keywords water retention curve full range oven dryness segmental models 1 introduction the soil water retention curve swrc which relates the soil water content and the matric potential is the most fundamental soil hydraulic parameter for simulating unsaturated soil behaviors accurate swrc models are essential for providing realistic descriptions of soil hydrology broadbridge and white 1988 silva and grifoll 2007 dan et al 2015 over the past decades various swrc models have been developed to fit retention data e g brooks and corey 1966 van genuchten 1980 khlosi et al 2008 madi et al 2018 the models of brook and corey 1966 and van genuchten 1980 are among the most popular for fitting swrc data in the wet range kuang and jiao 2014 and can be combined with hydraulic conductivity models mualem 1976 vogel and cislerova 1988 however they are not appropriate for dry soil webb 2000 silva and grifoll 2007 when used in numerical simulations the traditional swrc models fail to describe evaporation from dry soil since they do not account for water contents below the residual water content nimmo 1991 groenevelt and grant 2004 ciocca et al 2014 the traditional models assume that the minimum of soil water content is associated with an infinite suction which contrasts with the finite suctions experimentally obtained at oven dry water contents campbell and shiozawa 1992 rossi and nimmo 1994 lu et al 2008 since the 1990s swrc models have been proposed for the entire range of soil water content first by extending traditional models towards the dry end and later by introducing novel segmental models ross et al 1991 added a term to the original campbell 1974 model to ensure that the curves were extended to oven dryness morel seytoux and nimmo 1999 extrapolated the brooks corey model b c model to zero residual water content by using the junction model by rossi and nimmo 1994 webb 2000 extended the van genuchten model vg model to zero liquid saturation by using a log linear relationship fayer and simmons 1995 modified the b c and vg models for oven dryness by replacing the residual saturation with an adsorption equation zhang 2011 extended the lower bound of the b c and vg models from the residual water content to the oven dry condition by dividing the swrc into two segments fredlund and xing 1994 derived a general model for swrcs across the whole range according to the assumption that the shape of a retention curve is a model of the soil pore size distribution the general model can provide a good fit for sand silt and clay soils over the entire suction range from 0 to 107 cm water many other retention models with the full range of matric suction have been proposed by applying a lognormal distribution law to the soil pore radius distribution function kosugi 1996 nimmo 1997 khlosi et al 2006 in addition due to the distinct characteristics of the high medium and low suction ranges of swrcs segmental models were developed to describe swrcs across the entire range for instance rossi and nimmo 1994 developed two models a sum model and a junction model over the complete range based on segmental models dan et al 2015 proposed a two step model for describing a continuous swrc over the full range of saturation by separating the water retention curve into dry and wet regions the evaluation of swrc models has shown that compared with a single swrc model the segmental models can better fit the retention data over the full range of saturation and may be applied to more soil types cornelis et al 2005 khlosi et al 2008 lu et al 2008 schneider and goss 2012b however most of the segmental models have no physical meaning due to only fitting the data with a polynomial silva and grifoll 2007 goss and madliger 2007 found that the segmental model rossi and nimmo 1994 did not satisfactorily fit the experimental data because there has been a general lack of measured dry end swrc data there is a lack of models to predict the entire swrc from saturation to oven dryness for all soil textures khlosi et al 2008 with the development of measuring equipment for swrcs the soil water content and matric potential under dry conditions can be measured more rapidly and accurately using different techniques such as a water activity meter dew point potential meter relative humidity sensor and vacuum microbalance gee et al 1992 sokołowska et al 2002 schneider and goss 2012a at present a substantial amount of data is available from published studies e g campbell and shiozawa 1992 nemes et al 2001 zhang 2011 therefore it is necessary to develop a segmental model with physical significance to satisfactorily describe the whole range of swrcs the objectives of this study are to develop novel two and three segment swrc models based on the physical features of the three flow states for the dehydration process from saturation to oven dryness and to compare the performances of these models with those of existing swrc models using a variety of published soil water retention data 2 theory 2 1 the swrc description as graphically illustrated in fig 1 the saturation states of the desorption process from saturation to oven dryness are categorized into three states saturated flow capillary flow and film flow tuller and or 2005 zhang 2011 or et al 2013 correspondingly a complete swrc can be approximated as a composite of three segments at the beginning of soil desorption state 1 the soil pores are filled with water the soil is saturated and the corresponding matric suction is zero segment 1 as soil water content decreases air begins to enter into the pores the saturated soil becomes unsaturated with interconnected pendular rings state 2 the matric suction significantly increases with a decrease in the soil water content as described by the second segment of the retention curve segment 2 unsaturated flow during this stage is mainly forced by capillary pressure when the soil water content is less than the residual water content a thin film of water mediates flux between adjacent particles state 3 during this stage liquid water becomes incapable of moving freely and vapor becomes the major component of the water flux saito et al 2006 in addition the liquid water content near oven dryness decreases linearly with increasing logarithmic matric suction segment 3 therefore three distinct states of soil water during dehydration correspond to the three segments of the full range of swrc and each segment of the complete swrc has its own characteristics traditional swrc models generally provide suitable descriptions of segments 1 and 2 but mostly fail to describe the dry end of the swrc in addition none of these models are suitable for all soil textures therefore a novel model needs to be developed to generally describe all types of swrcs from saturation to oven dryness according to the features of the three segments of the swrc 2 2 the three segment swrc model for segment 1 of the swrc the campbell 1974 model b c model and vg model are universal basic models however the b c and campbell 1974 models are both exponential with a sharp discontinuity at the air entry point when it is greater than the air entry value the water content is regarded as a constant by the two models which is not consistent with the actual curve for segment 1 therefore these two models are not suitable for describing the swrc at the saturated end although the vg model can well describe the saturation end of the swrc it cannot describe the dry end due to the infinite suction associated with the residual water content therefore the vg model must be modified to describe segment 1 namely the saturation s is used to replace the effective saturation s e in the original vg model ciocca et al 2014 1 s θ θ s 1 α ϕ n 1 n 1 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where s e is the effective saturation s is the modified saturation θ is the soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 θ s is the saturated soil water content cm3 cm 3 θ r is the residual soil water content cm3 cm 3 and ϕ is the soil matric suction cm α 0 cm 1 and n 1 are the curve fitting parameters the air entry point along the swrc is a distinct feature of segment 2 among traditional models only the b c model takes into account this conspicuous feature and can effectively fit the retention data for segment 2 however the b c model also has the same problem as the vg model this study modifies the b c model by taking the residual water content as zero which is an alternate form of the campbell 1974 model 2 θ θ s ϕ e ϕ λ ϕ ϕ e where ϕ e is the air entry matric suction cm and λ is a fitting parameter related to the shape of the curve during the film flow stage water retention is governed by adsorption the relationship of water content versus suction can be described by a logarithmic model proposed by campbell and shiozawa 1992 which assumes that the water content becomes approximately proportional to the logarithm of the suction in a dry soil orchiston 1953 tested the proportionality of water content and suction and found a good fit for the low content data the relationship between water content and suction is expressed by the following equation fayer and simmons 1995 3 θ 1 ln ϕ ln ϕ 0 θ a where θ a is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 when ϕ 1 m and ϕ 0 is the matric suction at the oven dry water content m according to the features of the three segments of the retention curve we propose a three segment swrc model in the whole range as follows 4 θ i θ s 1 α ϕ n 1 n 1 0 ϕ ϕ a θ ii θ s ϕ e ϕ λ ϕ a ϕ ϕ b θ iii log 10 ϕ 0 log 10 ϕ log 10 ϕ 0 log 10 ϕ b θ b ϕ b ϕ ϕ 0 where θ i θ ii and θ iii are the water contents in the three segments of the retention curve cm 3 cm3 ϕ a and ϕ b are the soil matric potentials at the two junction points of the three segments of the retention curve cm θ b is the water content corresponding to the suction ϕ b at the second junction point the other variables and parameters in eq 4 are the same as those mentioned above to ensure the continuity and smoothness of the segmental swrc the four equations that impose the continuity of the global model and its first derivatives at the two junction points are expressed as follows 5 θ i ϕ a θ ii ϕ a 6 θ i ϕ a ϕ θ ii ϕ a ϕ 7 θ ii ϕ b θ iii ϕ b 8 θ ii ϕ b ϕ θ iii ϕ b ϕ eq 4 contains nine parameters if θ s and ϕ 0 are known the number of the unknown parameters is seven α n ϕ a ϕ b ϕ e λ and θ b four of the parameters α ϕ a ϕ b and θ b can be determined by the continuous conditions described above i e eqs 5 8 9 ϕ a ϕ e n 1 n 1 λ 1 λ 1 1 n 10 α ϕ a λ n 1 λ 1 n 11 ϕ b ϕ 0 exp 1 λ 12 θ b e θ s ϕ e ϕ 0 λ in this study θ s is predetermined according to the laboratory measurement and ϕ 0 is obtained by fitting the retention data 2 3 the two segment swrc model traditional swrc models with a single equation generally describe segments 1 and 2 of swrcs these two segments can be combined as one segment which corresponds to segment 1 in some two segment models e g the webb model zhang model and others in table 4 as an alternate version of the three segment swrc model the two segment swrc model directly combines the first and last equations of the three segment swrc model 13 θ i θ s 1 α ϕ n 1 n 1 0 ϕ ϕ

its corresponding matric suction at the junction point cm other symbols in eq 13 are the same as those of eq 4 if θ s is known the number of fitting parameters in eq 13 is five α n ϕ i θ i and ϕ 0 but two of these are determined by the conditions that ensure the continuity of both the model and its first derivative at ϕ i such continuity conditions are expressed by the following equations 14 θ i ϕ

zero water content is sometimes difficult and time consuming in this study published water retention data sets are used to test the two proposed segmental swrc models the data sets are abstracted from the washington soil datasets campbell and shiozawa 1992 and the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda nemes et al 2001 the soil properties of the washington soil data are shown in table 1 this dataset includes six different soils with sand contents of 9 89 and clay content of 5 47 and the measured matric suction ranges from water column heights of 30 to 3 106 cm from near saturation to near air dry this dataset has been used extensively to develop or test complete swrc models this study also adopts this dataset to test the two novel swrc models the unsoda database publicly and freely provides information on unsaturated soil hydraulic properties water retention and hydraulic conductivity and basic soil properties particle size bulk density etc nemes et al 2001 the laboratory drying branch of the retention curve includes data from 730 soil samples however some of the data are of poor quality and cannot be used to fit the full range swrc model thus 43 samples are selected from the laboratory drying branch using the following criteria 1 water retention data were obtained from at least near saturation to when possible near oven dryness 2 nearly all soil texture classes are considered and 3 the basic soil information is available as much as possible particle size distribution texture bulk density and saturation the water retention data from the unsoda database are listed in table 2 the soil particle size distribution of the 49 soil samples from the washington soil data and the unsoda database are presented in the soil texture ternary diagram fig 2 3 2 statistical analyses numerous statistical indices can be applied to evaluate the goodness of fit of the swrc models in this study the fitting performance of the different swrc models is assessed by using the adjusted coefficient of determination adj r2 the root mean square error rmse and kashyap information criteria kic the adj r2 is designed to take into account the number of parameters in the model and is employed to assess how well the soil water content approximates the observed data 18 adj r 2 1 n 1 n p 1 r 2 19 r 2 1 i 1 n θ i θ i 2 i 1 n θ i θ 2 where r 2 is the coefficient of determination

continuity and smoothness of the segmental models at junction points the optimal solution of the segmental models may become a difficult problem in this study although the continuity conditions of the two models reduce the fitting parameters the models still remain highly nonlinear popular optimization software programs e g matlab originpro and spss depend highly on the appropriate initial values of parameters which are provided or guessed by users for finding the optimal solution however the software program 1stopt first optimization has strong optimization power for nonlinear complex models because its computational core uses the universal global optimization ugo algorithm developed by the algorithm s developers http www 7d soft com en this algorithm solves the problem of needing to provide for numerical optimization in other words a random initial value is provided by the algorithm instead of by the user and the ugo algorithm then finds the optimal solution in addition the code is very accessible for users and is almost the same as the original form of the equation constraint conditions for the optimization calculations can be directly reflected in the objective function this algorithm can reach the correct result with a random initial starting value in most cases 90 this study adopts the quasi newton ugo algorithms of the 1stopt software to obtain the best numerical solution of the nonlinear swrc models 4 results 4 1 test of the novel segmental swrc models the performances of both novel segmental swrc models are tested with the 49 published retention data six data points from the washington datasets and 43 from the unsoda because of the wide use of the washington soil dataset for developing an entire swrc model the fitting results of this dataset are taken as an example to discuss the performances of the two models fig 3 depicts the measured retention data and fitted swrcs in the semilog coordinate system the scattered open squares are the measured water retention data the solid red lines and blue dashed lines are the retention curves fitted by the three and two segment swrc models respectively the two models provide continuous and smooth curves from saturation to oven dryness by satisfactorily fitting the measured retention data for the six soils especially for the palouse b and salkum soil samples the goodness of fit values of the two novel swrc models are almost the same for instance the adj r2 values of the two models for palouse b are 0 990 and 0 991 and the rmse values are 0 013 and 0 012 for the other four soil retention datasets the fitting performances of the three segment model are better than those of the two segment model as table 3 presents the adj r2 values of the two models for the washington datasets are very high between 0 919 and 0 994 in addition their rmse values are relatively low and vary between 0 009 and 0 022 it is concluded that the two novel swrc models both perform well at describing the washington retention data across the full range from saturation to oven dryness to further test both novel swrc models the 43 soil retention data from the unsoda are fitted by the two swrc models fig 4 shows the variations in the adj r2 and rmse values for the two novel swrc models using the unsoda data fig 4 a shows that the adj r2 values for the three segment model are between 0 913 and 0 999 and that those for the two segment model are between 0 873 and 0 995 although the adj r2 range of the two segment model is larger than that of the three segment model these two swrc models have almost the same performance in terms of the maximum the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles of adj r2 values the maximum adj r2 values of the two models are almost 1 0 and the median values of the two models are also similar approximately 0 985 the 25th and 75th percentiles for the two models are 0 995 and 0 965 respectively most of the adj r2 values of the two models fall between the 25th and 75th percentiles these results illustrate that the measured retention data can be effectively fitted by these two models as shown in fig 4 b the rmse values of the three segment swrc model are between 0 003 and 0 021 and those of the two segment model are between 0 002 and 0 037 the rmse values approaching to zero for these two models indicate that the overall error between the measured and fitted swrc is very small the fitting results of the unsoda retention data show that the two novel models can satisfactorily describe the swrcs of almost all soil types and that the three segment model exhibits better performance than the two segment model 4 2 comparison of segmental models to evaluate the behavior of both novel models we compared them with seven other popular swrc models using the unsoda data the expressions and parameters of the seven swrc models are listed in table 4 the rn2 model by rossi and nimmo 1994 generalizes a complete swrc as two segments and combines a power model with a logarithmic model by adding them the rn3 model by rossi and nimmo 1994 splits the swrc into three segments and combines a power law and a logarithmic equation with a junction rather than a summation the peter model peter 2013 is a popular entire swrc model that accounts for capillary and adsorptive water retention the zhang model zhang 2011 is an extended vg model which separates a swrc into two segments by defining the critical pressure head and the critical water content based on the capillary flow and the absorbed flow the dg model vanderlinden 2017 is the sum of a double exponential model and the groenevelt and grant model the webb model extended the vg model to zero water content by a linear equation on a semilog plot in the adsorption region webb 2000 the vg model is a traditional model for describing the swrc between saturated and residual water contents and is very popular these models have been tested with different soil water retention data and have been widely used to describe the swrcs of different soil types worldwide this study employs these seven models as references to evaluate the performances of the two novel segmental models this study employs adj r2 rmse and kic to evaluate and compare the performances of the two novel segmental models and the seven other swrc models as shown in fig 5 although the maximum adj r2 value close to 1 and the 25th percentile is greater than 0 90 for each model fig 5 a the variations in the adj r2 values of the models are significantly different the adj r2 for the novel three segment model varies only between 0 90 and 1 00 and most adj r2 values fall between the 25th and 75th percentiles the 25th and 75th percentiles of adj r2 values for the novel two segment model peter model and dg model are similar to those of the three segment model but the ranges of the minimum to the maximum adj r2 values of these models are greater than that of the novel three segment model although the rn2 rn3 zhang and webb models are also segmental models that consist of two or three equations the adj r2 variations of these models and the differences between the 25th and 75th percentiles are larger than those of the two novel segmental swrc models the vg model is a traditional and single segment model and its adj r2 range is the largest with a maximum of 0 995 and a minimum of 0 330 the adj r2 results show that the novel three segment model explains the measured retention data better than the other segmental models and that the segmental models can describe the retention data better than the single segment model the vg model fig 5 b depicts the rmse variations of the nine swrc models the minimum rmse value of each model is close to 0 but the maximum varies greatly the maximum rmse value of the vg model is four times that of the novel three segment model the maximum rmse value of the novel three segment model is only 0 021 but that for the vg model is 0 093 the maximum rmse values of the other models novel two segment rn2 rn3 peter zhang dg and webb are less than 0 04 and the 75th percentiles of these models are not greater than 0 02 on the whole the segmental models have a much smaller error than the vg model and the three segment model has a better performance than any other model the kic is employed as the model discrimination criterion the best model is associated with the lowest kic value fig 5 c shows the kic variations of all the models the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles of the kic values of the novel three segment model are smaller than those of the other models and this model ranks first among the compared models according to the maximum minimum and median values and the 25th and 75th percentiles of the kic values three models the novel two segment rn2 and rn3 together rank second among all the models the kic ranges of the other four models peter zhang dg and webb are significantly worse because they have more fitting parameters although their adj r2 and rmse values indicate good performances therefore these four models are grouped into the third rank the kic values of the vg model are between those of the selected models but the performances of the vg model based on the adj r2 and rmse values are very poor because of the effect of the residual water content parameter that does not allow the water content to approach zero the adj r2 rmse and kic results indicate that the novel three segment model has the best ability to describe the entire swrc from saturation to oven dryness and should be the preferred model among all the candidate swrc models in contrast the vg model is the opposite the performances of the other segmental swrc models vary but can acceptably fit the full range of retention data 4 3 effects of cutoff values ϕ c on the models extrapolation in the dry range to evaluate the ability of the two novel models to extrapolate the swrc in the dry range regression analysis has been performed on subsets of data that exclude all the measured points with suctions greater than a certain cutoff value ϕ c in this scheme subsets of different lengths generated from the washington retention data used for the model test in section 4 1 are employed to check the sensitivity of the segmental swrc models to an incomplete range of data because the matric suction ϕ 0 corresponding to the oven dry water content is known or can be predetermined this calculation is an interpolation between cutoff suction ϕ c and the maximum value ϕ 0 rather than an extrapolation however this procedure is referred to as extrapolation since the modeling is outside the range of the measured data because the washington soil water retention data cover the entire range from near saturation to near oven dryness these data are employed to analyze the effect of cutoff suction on the performance of swrc models according to the ranges of the water retention data four different cutoff suctions are set namely 1 106 1 105 1 104 and 1 103 cm for the six soils each measured dataset with suction greater than the cutoff values is excluded and four different subsets of data for each of the soils are generated corresponding to four different suction ranges of 0 1 103 0 1 104 0 1 105 and 0 1 106 cm water therefore there are adequate data for the extrapolation computations these new subsets of data are used to extrapolate the retention data in the dry range fig 6 presents the adj r2 and rmse values calculated for the two novel models using the whole dataset and the four subsets as shown in fig 6 a and b for the six soils the adj r2 values of the three segment model decrease and rmse values increase with the lowing of the cutoff suction when the cutoff suction is not less than 1 104 cm the adj r2 and rmse values vary little with the decrease in the cutoff suction however when the cutoff value decreases to 1 103 cm the adj r2 values of the six soils suddenly decrease and the rmse values suddenly increase for example the adj r2 and rmse values of soil 4 salkum soil vary the most the adj r2 decreases from 0 99 to 0 77 and the rmse increases from 0 01 to 0 07 therefore when the cutoff suction is not less than 1 104 cm the model still has a good ability to describe the curve in the dry range furthermore it is concluded that the novel three segment model is not strictly sensitive to the length of the soil water retention data and its performance is robust and stable for different data lengths fig 6 c and d depict the adj r2 and rmse variations of the six soil samples for the two segment swrc model corresponding to the five cutoff suction schemes the adj r2 and rmse variations of the two segment model are different from those of the three segment model for the two segment model although the adj r2 values decrease and rmse values increase with the decrease in the cutoff suction overall the responses of the adj r2 and rmse values to the cutoff suctions differ among the six soil samples for example adj r2 and rmse values of soils 1 and 3 palouse and walla walla soil begin to suddenly change when the cutoff suction decreases from ϕ 0 to 1 105 cm additionally the adj r2 and rmse values of soils 2 and 5 palouse b and royal soil are not sensitive to the different cutoff suction schemes however with the decrease in cutoff suction from 1 104 cm to 1 103 cm the adj r2 values increase instead of decreasing while the rmse values decrease instead of increasing therefore the performance of the two segment model is highly dependent on the length of soil retention data and has significant uncertainty to better describe swrcs from saturation to oven dryness if the measured data length is longer and the number of data samples is large lower values of cutoff suction may be acceptable rossi and nimmo 1994 however because many factors e g soil texture bulk density and organic matter content affect the swrc distribution the acceptable minimum cutoff suction or number of data points for a given soil is difficult to determine in the laboratory the measured swrcs for many soils are generally determined under wet conditions and their maximum suction ranges are between 103 and 104 cm the three segment swrc model solves the issues of dependence on the data length and can effectively provide the full range of swrcs using the general retention data measured in the laboratory 5 conclusions traditional swrc models e g the vg model and b c model with the residual water content parameter cannot be applied for dry conditions according to the three saturation states saturated flow capillary flow and film flow of soil water during the desorption process this study developed two novel segmental models that span the entire range of saturation one model is called the three segment model which generalizes a complete swrc into three segments corresponding to the three saturation states compared with other popular segmental swrc models this model with three fitting parameters provides good fits over the whole range of saturation for almost all soil types the extrapolation ability of this model to dry conditions has been tested with limited data subsets the results illustrate that the three segment model is robust and stable for finite soil water retention data the other model is called the two segment model which generalizes a complete swrc into two segments this model can be considered a simplified version of the three segment model it is also tested by comparison with other segmental swrc models and can provide good fits for most soils the suction ϕ 0 corresponding to the zero water content in this model is indirectly determined by the analytical expression of other parameters according to the continuous conditions the length of the measured retention data in the wet range can affect the performance of the two segment model in the dry range the comparison of models shows that the goodness of fit of both models to measured data supports the validity of the assumption of proportionality between the soil water content and the logarithm of suction near the oven dryness end the combination of this logarithmic equation with other equations developed for the high water content range produces a model that is practical and realistic from saturation to oven dryness credit authorship contribution statement chaoyang du
