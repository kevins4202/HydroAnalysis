4580,this study presents an analysis of daily field scale soil moisture sm variations measured using the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos over a tropical monsoon site iitm pune in india for the period 2017 2020 being located in the core zone of the indian summer monsoon the daily field scale sm observations at cosmos iitm provide an unique opportunity to understand the sm response to monsoon precipitation variations on sub seasonal seasonal and interannual time scales in addition to the cosmos iitm observations we also evaluated sm variations over this location using satellite reanalysis and model products for the same period an important result from our analysis reveals the presence of biweekly time scale 10 20 days and low frequency intra seasonal time scale 30 60 days variations in the field scale sm which are linked to the dominant modes of indian summer monsoon subseasonal variability in particular we find a pronounced enhancement of the low frequency signal of sm variations during the 2019 monsoon which was characterized by abnormally excess precipitation and prolongation of rains well beyond the summer monsoon season in contrast to 2018 monsoon moreover this study highlights a longer persistence of sm memory time scale about 60 days during 2019 as compared to 2017 2018 and 2020 the validation of coarser resolution data sets revealed that gldas and era5 reasonably capture a range of observed field scale sm variabilities over cosmos iitm site keywords cosmic ray soil moisture sensor cosmos iitm field scale soil moisture validation

better representation of land surface hydrological processes in climate models agricultural applications real time hydro meteorological monitoring and prediction koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 whan et al 2015 zhang 2004 brocca et al 2017 recently a few studies highlighted the importance of high resolution spatio temporal soil moisture observations for validation and modeling purposes evans et al 2016 kędzior and zawadzki 2016 kim et al 2015 rötzer et al 2014 while global sm products derived from satellite reanalyses and model simulations have helped climate studies comparison of gridded sm products and in situ measurements is often challenging owing to its spatial heterogeneity ronda et al 2002 yang et al 2017 the complexities in comparing satellite reanalyses and model derived sm data sets against in situ observations over the monsoon dominated regions have been highlighted by several studies ganeshi et al 2020 sathyanadh et al 2016 unnikrishnan et al 2016 mousa and shu 2020 montzka et al 2017 recent technological advances have made it possible to measure area averaged sm for an effective depth with a footprint exceeding 400 m i e radius 200 m using a non invasive cosmic ray neutron sensing crns system zreda et al 2008 2012a 2012b bogena et al 2010 franz et al 2012 2013 lv et al 2014 here variation of effective depth is confined to 10 40 cm depending on the wetness of sm the cnrs representation of area averaged field scale sm takes into account soil heterogeneity and helps bridge the scale gap between conventional point scale 5 cm and satellite retrieved coarse resolution 12 km sm measurements evett and parkin 2005 loew and schlenz 2011 reynolds 1970 susha lekshmi et al 2014 the crns technique is based on detection of secondary neutrons reflected from the earth s surface which are generated by the interaction of cosmic rays with atomic nuclei in the upper atmosphere through a variety of processes and its subsequent interaction with soil atoms on reaching ground level stevanato et al 2019 further details can be seen in sub section 2 2 1 several studies have documented that the intensity of neutrons above ground is inversely proportional to the soil moisture content stevanato et al 2019 zreda et al 2008 2012a 2012b evans et al 2016 the spread of the crns technique worldwide for the cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos network activity has helped in advancing our understanding of biospheric processes and hydrogen pools for socio scientific applications andreasen et al 2017 for example a high density network of sm observations in south germany has provided fresh insights into soil moisture dynamics relevant to a variety of hydro meteorological applications and this data can be accessed from the eudat collaborative data infrastructure fersch et al 2020 this high density network with 23 units of sm sensors from multiple platforms are spread over an area of 1 square km includes fixed and mobile crns units remotely sensed thermal images from unmanned aerial systems uas permanent and temporary wireless sensor networks profile probes and comprehensive manual soil sampling fersch et al 2020 this study presents an analysis of sm variations observed from a site cosmos iitm in pune which is located in the tropical core monsoon zone of india rajeevan et al 2010 the geographical coordinates of this site are given by 18 5374 n latitude 73 8054 e latitude 560 m altitude above mean sea level and is located in the campus of the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune and has been operational since the end of january 2017 fig 1 this location comes in the deccan plateau and lies in the meteorological subdivision of madhya maharashtra guhathakurta et al 2015 india this region located in the tropical core monsoon zone of india is also characterized by strong land atmosphere coupling ganeshi et al 2020 convective activities during the indian summer monsoon are characterized by prominent sub seasonal variations in cloud cover and rainfall rf on the time scale of 10 20 days and 30 60 respectively krishnamurti and bhalme 1976 yasunari 1979 1980 sikka and gadgil 1980 hartmann and michelsen 1989 singh and kriplani 1990 kulkarni et al 2009 furthermore the subseasonal low frequency 10 days variations in the monsoon rainfall also exhibit significant year to year variations kulkarni et al 2009 it is not clear however as to whether the subseasonal low frequency variations in monsoon rainfall can influence soil moisture variability and extremes over the region in order to address the above scientific issue we have examined soil moisture and hydrometeorological datasets from multiple sources viz cosmos iitm field scale satellite reanalysis and model products at coarser resolution our study also includes wavelet analysis of daily data of rf and sm for the period 2017 2020 to estimate time frequency power spectra additionally we have examined the memory characteristics of the sm response to rainfall and temperature variations the paper is organized in 4 sections section 2 discusses the data methodology and cross validation of sm variability section 3 describes interannual seasonal sub seasonal hydro meteorological features around the cosmos iitm site as well as the analysis of coarser resolution gridded sm datasets and their comparison with field scale observations finally the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 data in this study our focus is on the validation and analysis of hydro meteorological variables continuously monitored at the cosmos iitm site e g 2 meter temperature pressure relative humidity surface rainfall low energy neutron counts soil moisture since end of january 2017 beside the recently installed flux tower and multilevel weather sensors also satellite smos smap amsr2 reanalysis era5 merra 2 and modeled gldas and ldas sm products described in supplementary text are analysed and validated against cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 2 1 1 the experimental site and measurements the observational site at pune receives southwest monsoon rainfall during the months of june to september guhathakurta et al 2015 revadekar et al 2015 and characterized by a region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling ganeshi et al 2020 the cosmos iitm site is mostly covered with vegetation 75 of type bushes grasses forbes and trees having an average height of 4 5 m the bulk density 1 14 g cm3 latic water 0 01 g cm3 and soil oraganic carbon 0 082 are used for the crns calibration further details of the soil properties of the site are given in supplementary table s1 the instruments used for the in situ hydro meteorological observations are cosmic ray neutron sensor

eml make tipping bucket http www emltd net arg314 eml html for precipitation and met one instruments usa https metone com for temperature pressure and humidity these real time observations are archived at one hourly intervals using standard telemetry technology preliminary quality control is applied to filter out errors in raw data 2 1 2 in situ soil moisture samplings across the cosmos iitm site soil samples were collected from three different concentric circles of radii 5 m 25 m and 75 m centered around the cosmos sensor from 18 locations at 6 depths with 5 cm interval 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 cm the sm sampling dates are 30 january 6 september 21 november 2017 and 25 september 2018 a gravimetric method is used in the present study for in situ comparison and calibration of cosmos observations following the previous studies franz et al 2012 2013 köhli et al 2015 zreda et al 2012a 2012b schrön et al 2017 baroni et al 2018 these soil samples are processed in the lab and the gravimetric soil moisture content is estimated in terms of weight as the ratio of the mass of water present to the dry weight of the soil sample g g for the simplicity of representation the gravimetric soil moisture can be converted to volumetric soil moisture content ratio of the volume of water to the total volume of the soil sample cm3 cm3 for each individual sample in this study sm is customised in terms of of volumetric water content vwc using a representative bulk density value see supplementary fig s1 for sm profiles obtained from soil samples of 6 september 2017 the best fit reference neutron count n0 from available soil moisture profiles were used to calibrate the cosmos vwc data n0 for cosmos iitm varies between the range 1088 and 1260 counts per hour for four different gravimetric profiles the best fit n0 is 1194 out of the available four data sets with r 0 80 rmse 2 and p 0 1 the standard deviation for best fit n0 is about 0 047 m3 m 3 see the supplementary table s2 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 estimation of volumetric water content vwc from cosmos observations the relationship between epithermal neutrons and volumetric water content in terms of of volumetric water content and effective depth is described by desilets et al 2010 this relationship is based on particle source function domain and neutron detector as described by zreda et al 2008 zreda et al 2012a zreda et al 2012b and evans et al 2016 further it may be noted that the three dimensional monte carlo n particle extended model mcnpx pelowitz 2005 is used for simulation of epithermal neutron flux and the area average water content along with effective depth captured by crns at cosmos iitm site more recently the uranos model has been developed for applications in neutron sensing of sm köhli et al 2015 2016 and has a revised measurement footprint weighting the theoretical relationship between the relative neutron counts and area average volumetric water content θ m3 m 3 is described by previous studies such as desilets et al 2010 evans et al 2016 franz et al 2012 and baatz et al 2014 desilet equation is given below θ n a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ bd where θ m3 m3 is the volumetric or gravimetric water content n is the neutron counting rate normalized to a reference atmospheric pressure desilets et al 2006 and solar activity level kuwabara et al 2006 n0 is the counting rate over dry soil under the same reference conditions ρ bd is dry soil bulk density and a0 a1 and a2 are fitting parameters the soil moisture dependence of near surface neutron intensity on a per mass basis in the fast to epithermal energy range is given by a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 and a2 0 115 for θ 0 02 kg kg 1 the fitting parameter no estimated here by calibrating four different gravimetric soil moisture sample datasets see section 2 1 2 and supplementary table s2 more details can be found in desilets et al 2006 desilets et al 2010 zreda et al 2008 zreda et al 2012a zreda et al 2012b franz et al 2013 schrön et al 2017 furthermore the effective depth of the cosmos sm measurement is known as the thickness of soil from which 86 of counted neutrons originate zreda et al 2008 the effective depth z cm is calculated using the hypothetical equation of franz et al 2012 as z 5 8 ρ τ θ 0 0829 where ρ is the soil dry bulk density g cm3 τ is the weight fraction of lattice water of soil mineral grains defined as the amount of water released at 1000 c g g and θ is volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 the enhanced concentration of hydrogen atoms dominates neutron scattering reduction in neutron counts for wetter conditions reduction in the effective depth as that of drier conditions relatively deeper effective depth and enhanced neutron counts indicating a stronger variation at the dry end desilets et al 2010 the sensitivity to various sources of hydrogen e g above and below ground biomass humidity of the atmosphere lattice water of the soil minerals organic matter and water in the litter layer intercepted water in the canopy and soil organic matter limits the accuracy of field scale sm along with its effective depth measurements bogena et al 2015 franz et al 2013 heidbüchel et al 2016 montzka et al 2017 interestingly the variation in neutron counts at cosmos iitm is found to be sensitive enough to weaker rain spells rf 5 mm as described by franz et al 2012 before computing soil moisture quality control processes are applied to raw cosmos iitm data the correction is applied to account for temporal changes in pressure ambient water vapour and incoming neutron flux n0 and then rescaled to match the initial cosmos iitm configuration baroni et al 2018 scheiffele et al 2020 zreda et al 2008 2012a 2012b it is worth mentioning that the calibration and accuracy of field scale cosmos observations are still in research mode bogena et al 2015 coopersmith et al 2014 heidbüchel et al 2016 finally the area average daily sm values are estimated from these sm profiles following desilets et al 2010 and validated with the respective neutron counts to test that validation data points lie on the desilet s curve desilets et al 2006 mujumdar et al 2017 2 2 2 analytical techniques in the present paper we have used various mathematical and statistical techniques such as wavelet analysis kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 torrence and webster 1999 wavelet coherence analysis grinsted et al 2004 niu 2013 niu et al 2014 and taylor statistics taylor 2005 2001 to evaluate the field scale soil moisture variability and its association with regional hydro meteorological variables wavelet and wavelet coherence analysis are used in present study to evaluate localized variations of power within a time series wavelet method determines both dominant modes of variability and variation by decomposing the time series into time frequency domain in other words wavelet transform decomposes the signals into daughter wavelets that are indicative of the mother wavelet version mother wavelet is referred to here from the second derivative of gaussian function this method has been used previously in various atmospheric and climate science studies such as el niño southern oscillation enso gu and philander 1995 wang and wang 1996 wave growth and breaking liu 1994 and tropical convection weng and lau 1994 more details about the wavelet application and theoretical structure is described in foufoula georgiou et al 1997 and daubechies 1990 whereas wavelet coherence method consistently brings out the relationship between the two signals in time frequency domain our study also includes probability density function pdf statistical significance test autocorrelation analysis time series standard deviation root mean square error rmse analysis and unbiased root mean square error analysis ubrmse watterson 2008 wilks 2011 to examine association between various hydro meteorological products table 2 from above mention statistical techniques rmse and ubrmse are mainly used to define the level of agreement between the in situ and satellite retrieval soil moisture products the bias can be easily eliminated by identifying the ubrmse which characterises random error in order to obtain a reliable estimate of rmse albergel et al 2012 brocca et al 2013 wu 2016 3 hydro meteorological analysis of cosmos iitm observations pune lies in the southwest part of the core monsoon zone and experiences the seasonal southwest monsoon rains from june through september jjas guhathakurta et al 2015 revadekar et al 2015 the annual mean rainfall over pune is about 680 mm out of which 80 560 mm is received during the southwest monsoon season revadekar et al 2015 http imdpune gov in over pune the average maximum and minimum temperatures are 31 7 c and 17 8 c respectively diurnal variability of temperatures is strong during the pre monsoon months of march april and may with daytime maximum temperatures exceeding 40 c and night time temperatures dropping below 20 c during the winter months of december and january the night time temperatures drop below 10 c www imdpune gov in diurnal variability of temperature over pune is generally lowest during the southwest monsoon season additionally this region is characterized by strong soil moisture temperature coupling ganeshi et al 2020 3 1 rainfall variations during 2017 2020 the time series of daily rainfall rf over the cosmos iitm site from 31 january 2017 to 30 september 2020 is shown in fig 2 a a distinct seasonality in the precipitation associated with the indian summer monsoon is predominantly observed in rf time series from the end of may till early october we also see year to year variations in the monsoon rainfall in fig 2a the total seasonal rf from 01 june to 30 september over the cosmos iitm site for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 is found to be 674 mm 592 mm 1104 mm and 775 mm respectively table 1a the corresponding seasonal rf over pune for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 is 1303 mm 990 mm 1804 mm 1202 mm respectively table 1a and the long term climatological mean rf over pune is 560 mm revadekar et al 2015 in addition table 1a provides the values of the total seasonal june to september rf over a larger region of madhya maharashtra and all india for the period 2017 2020 we can clearly see that the interannual variations of monsoon rainfall over the cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 are consistent with the pattern of rf variability on larger spatial scales over pune madhya maharashtra and all india table 1a an important point to be noted is the significantly excess monsoon rains over the cosmos iitm site and pune during 2019 and 2020 as compared to 2018 and 2017 fig 2a table 1a the accumulated seasonal monsoon rainfall during 2019 over cosmos iitm was nearly double that of 2018 the excess monsoon rainfall in 2019 as compared to 2018 is also seen over larger spatial scales i e pune madhya maharashtra and all india table 1a although the year 2018 witnessed some rf events prior to the onset of the summer monsoon the total monsoon rainfall was considerably low over the cosmos iitm site particularly 2018 rf during the second half of the core summer monsoon season was significantly deficit fig 2a the dates of the summer monsoon onset and withdrawal over pune during 2017 2020 are listed based on the india meteorological department imd records table 1a a summary of the daily rf analysis over the cosmos iitm site for the june september monsoon season during 2017 2020 is provided in table 1b the total seasonal monsoon rainfall during 2019 was largely contributed by rain accumulations lasting for 5 9 consecutive days and also beyond 10 days table 1b a notable aspect of the 2019 monsoon is the prolongation of rf until early november fig 2a which is also consistently reflected in significantly cooler temperatures t2m over the cosmos iitm site fig 2b 3 1 1 wavelet analysis of rainfall time scale variability of dominant rainfall periodicities at the cosmos iitm site fig 3 is examined using the morlet wavelet analysis kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 torrence and webster 1999 the white contours denote the statistically significant periodicities of rainfall spectrum at 95 thin conic demarcation highlights the cone of confluence coi the region indicating importance of edge effects stronger variability confined to jjas in the spectral power is well distributed in frequency domain under coi at 95 statistical significance fig 3 the daily rf distribution at the cosmos iitm site mainly exhibits three different periodicities confined to respective southwest summer monsoon seasons during 2017 2020 these monsoonal periodicities are categorized in weak power 0 25 moderate 0 25 power 4 and strong power 4 using normalized local wavelet power spectrum along with its statistical significance under coi interestingly the power spectrum is void during non monsoon seasons these three monsoonal periodicities are described as synoptic scale oscillation 3 7 days quasi biweekly oscillation 10 20 days and low frequency oscillations 30 60 days relevant to the respective power spectrum categorized above these three periodicities are confined to the first half of the summer monsoon season during 2018 in contrast to 2017 2019 and 2020 the power variation in fig 3 also consistently and clearly depicts the onset gradually increased and withdrawal gradually decreased phases of indian summer monsoon during 2017 2020 as seen in fig 2a and table 1a the three distinct statistically significant monsoonal rainfall periodicities are dominant at the cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 relatively higher spectral power in three significantly dominant periodicities synoptic scale quasi biweekly scale and low frequency oscillations during 2019 is the implication of long persisting rain spells table 1b the persistence of prolonged rain spells beyond monsoon season during 2019 in contrast to 2018 is consistent with the extended contours of strong low frequency spectra significant at 95 thus rainfall and temperature analysis illustrating distinct phases of monsoon onset and withdrawal seasonal sub seasonal variations during 2017 2020 provide scope for unrevealing their impacts on concurrent field scale sm variations and memory time scale at cosmos iitm site 3 2 analysis of field scale soil moisture variability at cosmos iitm site the daily variations of cosmos field scale sm and the effective depth of the cosmos measurement during 2017 2020 at cosmos iitm are shown in fig 4 validation of cosmos iitm sm data against the statistical mean of the in situ profiles 30 january 6 september 21 november 2017 and 25 september 2018 is satisfactory see marked symbols in fig 4 study uses best fit n0 of 1194 franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 2016 from gravimetric sampling to get vwc from the cosmic ray method supplementary table s2 analysis of scales of sm variations in the context of rainfall and temperature variations is crucial for better understanding of land surface processes particularly over the core monsoon zone with strong coupling between soil moisture and surface temperature the annual cycle of sm and the effective depth clearly depict the monsoon cycle fig 4 the sharp sm variations increasing decreasing exceeding 20 vwc and almost 20 cm shallowing deepening effective depth of cosmos iitm sm around monsoon onset and withdrawal phases during 2017 2020 are clearly seen the sm turns out to be around 30 and above having effective depth 15 cm with standard deviations of 8 10 during wet periods while it remains below 15 rising effective depth above 25 cm with standard deviation around 5 7 during dry periods fig 4 moreover variations of field scale sm and its effective depth within the monsoon season are intriguing fig 4 interestingly during jjas pre monsoon march april may 2019 excessively wet dry sm depicts the vwc exceeding 40 confined to 10 with effective depth close to 10 cm exceeding 40 cm the consistency of cosmos iitm field scale sm data set with in situ rainfall temperature humidity and pressure also provide strong support for depicting the appropriate variability fig 2 supplementary fig s2 and fig 4 the focus of this study is more on the variability of high spatio temporal sm variations along with the validation of ground truth the validation of soil moisture using cosmos measurements with the in situ observations by gravimetric method at iitm site depicts the root mean square error rmse value in the range of 1 2 supplimentry table s2 3 2 1 wavelet analysis of cosmos iitm field scale soil moisture variability the temporal variability of the field scale soil moisture at cosmos iitm site and its linkage with the in situ rainfall variations are analyzed in this section to begin with a continuous wavelet spectrum of daily field scale cosmos iitm sm observations is computed to find dominant periodicities in the time frequency domain fig 5 the white contours denote the statistically significant periodicities of rf under the cone of influence coi further this standardized local wavelet power spectrum is categorized in weak power 0 25 moderate 0 25 power 4 and strong power 4 bins which are statistically significant the standardized local wavelet power spectrums of field scale sm observations fig 5 clearly depict the distinct periodicities broadly consistent with those of rf fig 3 it is worth mentioning that the sm power spectrum is not only confined to monsoon seasons but prevails throughout 2017 2020 fig 5 in contrast to seasonal cyclic spectrum of rf fig 3 this temporal persistence of the sm spectrum is indicative of a red noise process kulkarni et al 2009 delworth and manabe 1988 manabe and delworth 1990 ganeshi et al 2020 the memory characteristic of sm related to the red noise process is analysed further using autocorrelation see sub section 3 5 the power variation in fig 5 is also consistent with the onset gradually increasing and withdrawal gradually decreasing phases of indian summer monsoon rainfall during the 2017 2020 figs 2 5 stronger variability in the spectral power is mostly confined to low frequency oscillations 30 60 day mode for sm data statistically significant at 95 in contrast to rf sm wavelet power is trivial in the synoptic scale oscillations less than ten days band while it is moderate in quasi bi weekly oscillations 10 20 days band at the 95 confidence level under coi fig 5 additionally during 2019 sm wavelet spectra in 10 20 days band is persisting over time domain beyond monsoon season during 2019 relative to those of 2020 2018 and 2017 the power distribution in cosmos iitm sm data fig 5 seems to be closely associated with the intensities and frequencies of monsoonal rain fig 3 and table 1b the sm power in the 30 60 days band is reasonably distributed over the 2017 monsoonal and post monsoon months the distribution of 2018 wavelet power for sm in the 30 40 days band at 95 confidence level is mostly confined to the early monsoon months it is worth noticing that the cosmos iitm sm data depicts the highest power of the low frequency 30 60 day band during 2019 at 95 confidence level extending well beyond monsoon season as compared to that of 2017 2018 and 2020 fig 5 a contrast between figs 3 and 5 shows that power of short term variability for sm is trivial however it reasonably extends beyond monsoon season for the low frequency band the long term variation in precipitation modulates sm memory time scale through terrestrial hydrological processes it is worth mentioning that the ratio of magnitude and temporal extent between low and high frequency mode turns out to be relatively higher for sm as that of rf interestingly the detected highest power in rf is periodically transferred to lower frequency of field scale sm this transformation of power evolves from the large spikes in rf to the spikes in field scale sm as shown in niu et al 2014 this transformation of power is also validated using wavelet cross power of field scale sm between daily cosmos iitm observations and in situ rf figure not shown the wavelet analysis of the field scale sm and in situ rf shows the regions of large common power of the low frequency band at 95 confidence level during 2019 relative to 2017 2018 and 2020 see figs 3 and 5 moreover the consistency of onset and withdrawal phases of monsoon is remarkable among rf and sm during 2017 2020 3 3 validation of satellite reanalysis and modeled soil moisture data sets with the cosmos iitm observations this section presents the cross validation results from the impact of rainfall variability on soil moisture variabilities using comparative analysis among coarser resolution satellite reanalysis and model products and field scale cosmos iitm observations it is interesting to see how the onset and withdrawal phases of monsoon are captured by various soil moisture products in this study cosmos iitm field scale sm data is considered as a ground truth for the validation of various available coarser resolution products this subsection contains comparison analysis on daily time scale of coarser resolution satellite smos smap amsr2 reanalysis era5 merra 2 and modeled gldas products see detailed description in supplementary section with field scale cosmos iitm soil moisture observations during 2017 2020 the daily time series of all sm datasets are prepared in terms of of volumetric water content and evaluated for the realistic representation of cosmos iitm field scale sm observation fig 6 a the inter comparison of the annual cycle of sm among various data sets is carried out by standardized statistical estimates i e standard deviation std rmse ubrmse and correlation with daily cosmos iitm sm observations fig 6b and table 2 the annual cycle of daily distribution of sm is reasonably depicted by coarser resolution sm products fig 6a relative to cosmos iitm observations for the period 2017 2020 the monsoon onset and withdrawal phases are well captured by gldas and era5 datasets relative to those of satellite observations over the cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 the moderate ranges of soil moisture variability among satellite gldas and era5 data sets clearly bring out realistic summer monsoon influences as depicted by cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 fig 6a it is to be mentioned that the consistency of cosmos iitm field scale daily observations with the high resolution ldas daily data set is remarkable for the year 2017 see supplementary figs s3 and s4 in representing monsoon onset and withdrawal phases seasonal and sub seasonal cycles the standardized stdz statistical scores of field scale sm cosmos iitm data along with satellite reanalysis and simulated products are better summarized using the taylor diagram fig 6b taylor 2001 this approach is useful to quantify sm validation using daily field scale observations against the coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis and model data products smos smap amsr2 era5 merra 2 and the gldas over cosmos iitm site furthermore graphical summary fig 6b better describes validation of daily sm variations of coarser resolution data sets against the reference of field scale cosmos iitm observations for this purpose we have carried out correlation standard deviation root mean square error rmse unbiased root mean square analysis the stdz statistics for each sm data set is computed and presented in fig 6b labelled with a distinct symbol it is to be noted that the pattern correlation of gldas open square symbol product with cosmos iitm observations is about 0 9 fig 6b furthermore rmse between gldas and observed patterns cosmos iitm is about 0 04 m3 m3 stdz 0 35 table 2 the standard deviation of gldas is proportional to the radial distance from the origin which is about 1 09 stdz value and found to be marginally higher than cosmos iitm standard deviation subsequently era5 is found to be close to cosmos observation with relatively high correlation r 0 95 and rmse of 0 04 m3 m3 stdz 0 34 among the satellite sm products smap has a higher correlation r 0 91 with cosmos observations than smos r 0 7 and amsr2 r 0 88 while least variability can be observed in smos sm product stdz standard deviation 1 31 than other satellite products smap and amsr2 it is worth noting that the satellite sm data sets exhibit higher rmse relative to gldas and era5 sm products table 2 though merra has higher correlation r 0 89 it has largest variations with standard deviation of 3 76 stdz value and rmse of about 2 39 stdz value thus among all the sm data products gldas and era5 have relatively close resemblance to the cosmos iitm observations fig 6b present study also evaluated mean bias and ubrmse to compare all coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis and model soil moisture data products with cosmos iitm results suggest that merra 2 sm product has a maximum bias of 0 39 m3 m3 over the pune region whereas least bias can be found in gldas sm product 0 03 m3 m3 the statistical quantity ubrmse is well in proportion with rmse and showing close correspondence of cosmos iitm sm data with gldas product 3 70 table 2 3 4 evaluation of periodicities for various soil moisture data products this section contains wavelet coherence analysis of coarser resolution satellite smos smap and amsr2 reanalysis era5 and merra 2 and modeled gldas daily soil moisture data sets with field scale cosmos iitm observations over pune site during 2017 2020 the daily standardized time series of all datasets are analysed in the time frequency domain to understand the association of distinct characteristics of sm variability at this observational site during 2017 2020 the cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence in the time frequency domain is used to explore the consistency and relative phase relationship among various coarser resolution daily sm data products and cosmos iitm observations the cross wavelet transform of the field scale soil moisture observations and coarser resolution gldas over cosmos iitm site is shown in fig 7 the region under white contour indicates standardized high power of spectra exceeding 95 confidence level under the cone of influence coi the arrows depict the relative phase relationship in phase by right pointing arrows out of phase by left pointing arrows cosmos iitm observations leading gldas by arrows pointing straight downward gldas leading cosmos iitm observations by arrows pointing straight upward overall there is a good agreement for consistency and phase relationship among gldas and cosmos iitm sm data sets the cross wavelet transform fig 7 depicts low frequency 30 60 day mode band with standardized larger common power of spectra at 95 confidence level under coi between cosmos iitm and gldas time series during 2019 as those of 2017 2018 and 2020 thus the phase relationship for low frequency band and consistency in the 2019 power spectra among cosmos iitm and gldas is remarkable fig 7 the substantial agreement of gldas sm data product with the observational data at cosmos iitm site is also highlighted in a recent study by ganeshi et al 2020 interestingly among other coarser resolution sm data products era5 also depicts the reasonable distribution of standardized large common power and significant coherence of variation in the time frequency domain during 2019 as compared to 2017 2018 and 2020 with field scale sm at cosmos iitm site figure not shown interestingly the power variation associated with the summer monsoon onset and withdrawal phases is also better captured in gldas and era5 sm products it is worth mentioning that other coarser resolution data sets such as smos smap amsr2 and merra2 differ considerably in the representation of coherent periodicities and the power of spectra are very much scattered in the time frequency domain over cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 figures not shown furthermore unrealistic sm power distribution is found in smos spreading over high as well as low bands the smap depicts the low frequency band with unrealistic lag in time domain and coherence power during 2017 2020 interestingly the resolution of sm variability by satellite product is not found to be as realistic as model and reanalysis sm data products this could be due to the induction of appropriate data assimilation methods and simulation of land surface processes in reanalysis and model sm products thus it can be inferred that periodic transfer of higher rf power to lower frequency of sm is reasonably depicted by gldas and era5 data sets as that of cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 particularly over the core monsoon zone with strong coupling characteristic 3 5 analysis of soil moisture auto correlation soil moisture is also known to show its distinct persistence characteristics such as memory time scale memory characteristics of sm normally depend on the latitudinal variation climate models estimated memory time scale of sm are found to be relatively higher in the extra tropics yearly as compared to the lower latitudes monthly delworth and manabe 1988 manabe and delworth 1990 ganeshi et al 2020 a similar study by wang et al 2010 investigated latitudinal dependability of soil moisture memory time scale using the e folding time scale also known as exponential decay time scale however this latitudinal dependent relationship of soil moisture memory time scale is highly non linear particularly over the tropical regions like the core monsoon zone of south asia dong and ochsner 2018 rajeevan et al 2010 in the present study we have analysed soil moisture memory time scale over the cosmos iitm observational site using the auto correlation method the auto correlation of daily sm data products is estimated here with respect to the 30 day lag in time period in days fig 8 the drop of auto correlation with the lag of time period in days indicates drying of sm the reduced rate of auto correlation with respect to the lag in days determines the persistent characteristics of soil moisture memory time scale the sharper decreasing rate of auto correlation with lags in days implies faster drying of sm auto correlation analysis of cosmos iitm field scale soil moisture fig 8 shows that the gradual drop is mostly confined to 0 4 during 2019 while the drop is faster and extends below 0 4 during 2017 2018 and 2020 the sharp decrease of auto correlation during 2017 2018 and 2020 indicates drying of sm is relatively faster fig 8 thus the auto correlation drop restricted to 0 4 with a lag time of a couple of months during 2019 shows a longer persistence for the period about 60 days this analysis clearly brings out that distinction in soil moisture memory time scale smm during 2017 2020 is reasonably captured using cosmos iitm data set the sharp drop of the 2018 auto correlation curve seems to be consistent with the weaker rain spells particularly during the later part of the summer monsoon season the drop of the auto correlation curve is relatively uniform during 2017 and distinct from that of 2018 this feature is more prominent in fig 8 depicting the robustness of cosmos iitm field scale sm variability associated with stronger rain spells and prevailing surface conditions during the second half of the 2019 summer monsoon this observed field scale sm auto correlation analysis is repeated for available coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis model data products figures not shown further comparison of decreasing rates of auto correlations among various sm data products are carried out to distinguish their soil moisture memory time scales smm among available daily sm satellite reanalysis and model data products only gldas and era5 data sets are found to be relatively close to cosmos iitm observation in depicting the realistic persistence characteristics of soil moisture memory time scale particularly over region of strong coupling ganeshi et al 2020 the ingestion of satellite and in situ observations in the model and reanalysis land surface products through objective data assimilation methodology and simulation of surface processes provides value addition for optimal surface field estimates rodell et al 2004 jimenez et al 2011 4 conclusion this study presents analysis of novel field scale soil moisture sm observations hourly area average estimate for 400 m diameter at cosmos iitm pune site located across the tropical core monsoon zone of india the association of field scale sm variations with distinct periodicities of in situ rainfall rf is evaluated here for the period 2017 2020 the assessment of field scale sm variabilities in time frequency domain synoptic bi weekly and low frequency is found to be crucial for bridging the gap between point scale and coarser resolution satellite reanalysis and modeled smos smap amsr2 era5 merra 2 and gldas respectively sm data products furthermore quantitative analysis using wavelet transform and autocorrelation highlights power transformation of rain spells into sm in the time frequency domain and the memory time scale characteristic of sm respectively the distinct variabilities of rainfall and temperature over cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 clearly demonstrate the predominance of the year 2019 the distinct features of long persisting heavy rain spells during 2019 particularly in the later part of the summer monsoon are found to be consistent with the rf over larger areas of pune region madhya maharashtra and larger part of india the gradual variations of the rf exhibit the evolution of summer monsoon onset and withdrawal phases during 2017 2020 also the intense temperature extremes with a peak exceeding 45 c during pre monsoon march april may 2019 supplementary fig s3 clearly differentiate it from that of 2017 2018 and 2020 interestingly the summer season march june of the 2020 critical period of covid 19 did not observe extreme temperatures exceeding 40 c at the cosmos iitm site the daily variations of field scale cosmos iitm soil moisture along with its effective depth fairly depict seasonal sub seasonal features along with the onset and withdrawal phases of summer monsoon during 2017 2020 in agreement with those of daily rainfall and temperature variations interestingly the concurrent variations in the effective depth of cosmos iitm sm also provide better insight into hydrological processes the distribution of local wavelet power spectrums in the time frequency domain of rf and field scale sm during 2017 2020 considerably reveals the transfer of high frequencies 7 days and 10 20 days power spectrum in rf to the low frequency 30 60 days power of sm at cosmos iitm site the comparison of rf and sm wavelet analysis depict the influence of long lasting rain spells on sm persistence beyond monsoon season during 2019 the ratio of low and high frequency mode during 2019 is highest for sm as that of rf the sm validation statistics using the taylor diagram brings out the close agreement of coarser resolution gldas and era5 sm products with that of field scale sm observations over cosmos iitm site the wavelet analysis carried out with coarser resolution sm products also depict the good agreement of gldas and era5 data sets with that of field scale cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 specifically the power transfer to the low frequency including summer monsoon onset and withdrawal phases and its extension in time domain beyond monsoon season during 2019 is well represented by gldas and era5 products as compared to those of smos smap and amsr2 furthermore the longer persistence time scale of about 60 days period is observed during 2019 for the cosmos iitm sm the longer memory time scale clearly depicts the dominant influence of stronger rain spells during 2019 while the relatively lower range of sm variations during 2017 2018 and 2020 tend to confined the persistence time scale below 50 days period thus the high frequency field scale cosmos iitm sm observations realistically represent the influence of distinct variabilities of rainfall including seasonal sub seasonal onset and withdrawal phases of the indian summer monsoon during 2017 2020 it would be interesting to investigate the influence of rf variations on sm memory time scale in the backdrop of climate change this calibration validation and soil moisture memory time scale analyses could be extended over other cosmos sites to get better insight into the field scale soil moisture variability in time frequency domain across extra tropical subtropical and tropical regions the extension of the observed network of high frequency field scale cosmos observations are not only useful to produce the long term reliable sm data products but also very crucial for validation of coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis and model simulation sm products along with hydrological applications across core monsoon zone credit authorship contribution statement milind mujumdar conceptualization resources writing original draft

4580,this study presents an analysis of daily field scale soil moisture sm variations measured using the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos over a tropical monsoon site iitm pune in india for the period 2017 2020 being located in the core zone of the indian summer monsoon the daily field scale sm observations at cosmos iitm provide an unique opportunity to understand the sm response to monsoon precipitation variations on sub seasonal seasonal and interannual time scales in addition to the cosmos iitm observations we also evaluated sm variations over this location using satellite reanalysis and model products for the same period an important result from our analysis reveals the presence of biweekly time scale 10 20 days and low frequency intra seasonal time scale 30 60 days variations in the field scale sm which are linked to the dominant modes of indian summer monsoon subseasonal variability in particular we find a pronounced enhancement of the low frequency signal of sm variations during the 2019 monsoon which was characterized by abnormally excess precipitation and prolongation of rains well beyond the summer monsoon season in contrast to 2018 monsoon moreover this study highlights a longer persistence of sm memory time scale about 60 days during 2019 as compared to 2017 2018 and 2020 the validation of coarser resolution data sets revealed that gldas and era5 reasonably capture a range of observed field scale sm variabilities over cosmos iitm site keywords cosmic ray soil moisture sensor cosmos iitm field scale soil moisture validation

better representation of land surface hydrological processes in climate models agricultural applications real time hydro meteorological monitoring and prediction koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 whan et al 2015 zhang 2004 brocca et al 2017 recently a few studies highlighted the importance of high resolution spatio temporal soil moisture observations for validation and modeling purposes evans et al 2016 kędzior and zawadzki 2016 kim et al 2015 rötzer et al 2014 while global sm products derived from satellite reanalyses and model simulations have helped climate studies comparison of gridded sm products and in situ measurements is often challenging owing to its spatial heterogeneity ronda et al 2002 yang et al 2017 the complexities in comparing satellite reanalyses and model derived sm data sets against in situ observations over the monsoon dominated regions have been highlighted by several studies ganeshi et al 2020 sathyanadh et al 2016 unnikrishnan et al 2016 mousa and shu 2020 montzka et al 2017 recent technological advances have made it possible to measure area averaged sm for an effective depth with a footprint exceeding 400 m i e radius 200 m using a non invasive cosmic ray neutron sensing crns system zreda et al 2008 2012a 2012b bogena et al 2010 franz et al 2012 2013 lv et al 2014 here variation of effective depth is confined to 10 40 cm depending on the wetness of sm the cnrs representation of area averaged field scale sm takes into account soil heterogeneity and helps bridge the scale gap between conventional point scale 5 cm and satellite retrieved coarse resolution 12 km sm measurements evett and parkin 2005 loew and schlenz 2011 reynolds 1970 susha lekshmi et al 2014 the crns technique is based on detection of secondary neutrons reflected from the earth s surface which are generated by the interaction of cosmic rays with atomic nuclei in the upper atmosphere through a variety of processes and its subsequent interaction with soil atoms on reaching ground level stevanato et al 2019 further details can be seen in sub section 2 2 1 several studies have documented that the intensity of neutrons above ground is inversely proportional to the soil moisture content stevanato et al 2019 zreda et al 2008 2012a 2012b evans et al 2016 the spread of the crns technique worldwide for the cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos network activity has helped in advancing our understanding of biospheric processes and hydrogen pools for socio scientific applications andreasen et al 2017 for example a high density network of sm observations in south germany has provided fresh insights into soil moisture dynamics relevant to a variety of hydro meteorological applications and this data can be accessed from the eudat collaborative data infrastructure fersch et al 2020 this high density network with 23 units of sm sensors from multiple platforms are spread over an area of 1 square km includes fixed and mobile crns units remotely sensed thermal images from unmanned aerial systems uas permanent and temporary wireless sensor networks profile probes and comprehensive manual soil sampling fersch et al 2020 this study presents an analysis of sm variations observed from a site cosmos iitm in pune which is located in the tropical core monsoon zone of india rajeevan et al 2010 the geographical coordinates of this site are given by 18 5374 n latitude 73 8054 e latitude 560 m altitude above mean sea level and is located in the campus of the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune and has been operational since the end of january 2017 fig 1 this location comes in the deccan plateau and lies in the meteorological subdivision of madhya maharashtra guhathakurta et al 2015 india this region located in the tropical core monsoon zone of india is also characterized by strong land atmosphere coupling ganeshi et al 2020 convective activities during the indian summer monsoon are characterized by prominent sub seasonal variations in cloud cover and rainfall rf on the time scale of 10 20 days and 30 60 respectively krishnamurti and bhalme 1976 yasunari 1979 1980 sikka and gadgil 1980 hartmann and michelsen 1989 singh and kriplani 1990 kulkarni et al 2009 furthermore the subseasonal low frequency 10 days variations in the monsoon rainfall also exhibit significant year to year variations kulkarni et al 2009 it is not clear however as to whether the subseasonal low frequency variations in monsoon rainfall can influence soil moisture variability and extremes over the region in order to address the above scientific issue we have examined soil moisture and hydrometeorological datasets from multiple sources viz cosmos iitm field scale satellite reanalysis and model products at coarser resolution our study also includes wavelet analysis of daily data of rf and sm for the period 2017 2020 to estimate time frequency power spectra additionally we have examined the memory characteristics of the sm response to rainfall and temperature variations the paper is organized in 4 sections section 2 discusses the data methodology and cross validation of sm variability section 3 describes interannual seasonal sub seasonal hydro meteorological features around the cosmos iitm site as well as the analysis of coarser resolution gridded sm datasets and their comparison with field scale observations finally the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 data in this study our focus is on the validation and analysis of hydro meteorological variables continuously monitored at the cosmos iitm site e g 2 meter temperature pressure relative humidity surface rainfall low energy neutron counts soil moisture since end of january 2017 beside the recently installed flux tower and multilevel weather sensors also satellite smos smap amsr2 reanalysis era5 merra 2 and modeled gldas and ldas sm products described in supplementary text are analysed and validated against cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 2 1 1 the experimental site and measurements the observational site at pune receives southwest monsoon rainfall during the months of june to september guhathakurta et al 2015 revadekar et al 2015 and characterized by a region of strong soil moisture temperature coupling ganeshi et al 2020 the cosmos iitm site is mostly covered with vegetation 75 of type bushes grasses forbes and trees having an average height of 4 5 m the bulk density 1 14 g cm3 latic water 0 01 g cm3 and soil oraganic carbon 0 082 are used for the crns calibration further details of the soil properties of the site are given in supplementary table s1 the instruments used for the in situ hydro meteorological observations are cosmic ray neutron sensor crns model crs 1000 from hydroinnova llc albuquerque nm usa http hydroinnova com for soil moisture stevens hydraprobe https stevenswater com products hydraprobe for soil moisture and soil temperature eml make tipping bucket http www emltd net arg314 eml html for precipitation and met one instruments usa https metone com for temperature pressure and humidity these real time observations are archived at one hourly intervals using standard telemetry technology preliminary quality control is applied to filter out errors in raw data 2 1 2 in situ soil moisture samplings across the cosmos iitm site soil samples were collected from three different concentric circles of radii 5 m 25 m and 75 m centered around the cosmos sensor from 18 locations at 6 depths with 5 cm interval 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 cm the sm sampling dates are 30 january 6 september 21 november 2017 and 25 september 2018 a gravimetric method is used in the present study for in situ comparison and calibration of cosmos observations following the previous studies franz et al 2012 2013 köhli et al 2015 zreda et al 2012a 2012b schrön et al 2017 baroni et al 2018 these soil samples are processed in the lab and the gravimetric soil moisture content is estimated in terms of weight as the ratio of the mass of water present to the dry weight of the soil sample g g for the simplicity of representation the gravimetric soil moisture can be converted to volumetric soil moisture content ratio of the volume of water to the total volume of the soil sample cm3 cm3 for each individual sample in this study sm is customised in terms of of volumetric water content vwc using a representative bulk density value see supplementary fig s1 for sm profiles obtained from soil samples of 6 september 2017 the best fit reference neutron count n0 from available soil moisture profiles were used to calibrate the cosmos vwc data n0 for cosmos iitm varies between the range 1088 and 1260 counts per hour for four different gravimetric profiles the best fit n0 is 1194 out of the available four data sets with r 0 80 rmse 2 and p 0 1 the standard deviation for best fit n0 is about 0 047 m3 m 3 see the supplementary table s2 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 estimation of volumetric water content vwc from cosmos observations the relationship between epithermal neutrons and volumetric water content in terms of of volumetric water content and effective depth is described by desilets et al 2010 this relationship is based on particle source function domain and neutron detector as described by zreda et al 2008 zreda et al 2012a zreda et al 2012b and evans et al 2016 further it may be noted that the three dimensional monte carlo n particle extended model mcnpx pelowitz 2005 is used for simulation of epithermal neutron flux and the area average water content along with effective depth captured by crns at cosmos iitm site more recently the uranos model has been developed for applications in neutron sensing of sm köhli et al 2015 2016 and has a revised measurement footprint weighting the theoretical relationship between the relative neutron counts and area average volumetric water content θ m3 m 3 is described by previous studies such as desilets et al 2010 evans et al 2016 franz et al 2012 and baatz et al 2014 desilet equation is given below θ n a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ bd where θ m3 m3 is the volumetric or gravimetric water content n is the neutron counting rate normalized to a reference atmospheric pressure desilets et al 2006 and solar activity level kuwabara et al 2006 n0 is the counting rate over dry soil under the same reference conditions ρ bd is dry soil bulk density and a0 a1 and a2 are fitting parameters the soil moisture dependence of near surface neutron intensity on a per mass basis in the fast to epithermal energy range is given by a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 and a2 0 115 for θ 0 02 kg kg 1 the fitting parameter no estimated here by calibrating four different gravimetric soil moisture sample datasets see section 2 1 2 and supplementary table s2 more details can be found in desilets et al 2006 desilets et al 2010 zreda et al 2008 zreda et al 2012a zreda et al 2012b franz et al 2013 schrön et al 2017 furthermore the effective depth of the cosmos sm measurement is known as the thickness of soil from which 86 of counted neutrons originate zreda et al 2008 the effective depth z cm is calculated using the hypothetical equation of franz et al 2012 as z 5 8 ρ τ θ 0 0829 where ρ is the soil dry bulk density g cm3 τ is the weight fraction of lattice water of soil mineral grains defined as the amount of water released at 1000 c g g and θ is volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 the enhanced concentration of hydrogen atoms dominates neutron scattering reduction in neutron counts for wetter conditions reduction in the effective depth as that of drier conditions relatively deeper effective depth and enhanced neutron counts indicating a stronger variation at the dry end desilets et al 2010 the sensitivity to various sources of hydrogen e g above and below ground biomass humidity of the atmosphere lattice water of the soil minerals organic matter and water in the litter layer intercepted water in the canopy and soil organic matter limits the accuracy of field scale sm along with its effective depth measurements bogena et al 2015 franz et al 2013 heidbüchel et al 2016 montzka et al 2017 interestingly the variation in neutron counts at cosmos iitm is found to be sensitive enough to weaker rain spells rf 5 mm as described by franz et al 2012 before computing soil moisture quality control processes are applied to raw cosmos iitm data the correction is applied to account for temporal changes in pressure ambient water vapour and incoming neutron flux n0 and then rescaled to match the initial cosmos iitm configuration baroni et al 2018 scheiffele et al 2020 zreda et al 2008 2012a 2012b it is worth mentioning that the calibration and accuracy of field scale cosmos observations are still in research mode bogena et al 2015 coopersmith et al 2014 heidbüchel et al 2016 finally the area average daily sm values are estimated from these sm profiles following desilets et al 2010 and validated with the respective neutron counts to test that validation data points lie on the desilet s curve desilets et al 2006 mujumdar et al 2017 2 2 2 analytical techniques in the present paper we have used various mathematical and statistical techniques such as wavelet analysis kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 torrence and webster 1999 wavelet coherence analysis grinsted et al 2004 niu 2013 niu et al 2014 and taylor statistics taylor 2005 2001 to evaluate the field scale soil moisture variability and its association with regional hydro meteorological variables wavelet and wavelet coherence analysis are used in present study to evaluate localized variations of power within a time series wavelet method determines both dominant modes of variability and variation by decomposing the time series into time frequency domain in other words wavelet transform decomposes the signals into daughter wavelets that are indicative of the mother wavelet version mother wavelet is referred to here from the second derivative of gaussian function this method has been used previously in various atmospheric and climate science studies such as el niño southern oscillation enso gu and philander 1995 wang and wang 1996 wave growth and breaking liu 1994 and tropical convection weng and lau 1994 more details about the wavelet application and theoretical structure is described in foufoula georgiou et al 1997 and daubechies 1990 whereas wavelet coherence method consistently brings out the relationship between the two signals in time frequency domain our study also includes probability density function pdf statistical significance test autocorrelation analysis time series standard deviation root mean square error rmse analysis and unbiased root mean square error analysis ubrmse watterson 2008 wilks 2011 to examine association between various hydro meteorological products table 2 from above mention statistical techniques rmse and ubrmse are mainly used to define the level of agreement between the in situ and satellite retrieval soil moisture products the bias can be easily eliminated by identifying the ubrmse which characterises random error in order to obtain a reliable estimate of rmse albergel et al 2012 brocca et al 2013 wu 2016 3 hydro meteorological analysis of cosmos iitm observations pune lies in the southwest part of the core monsoon zone and experiences the seasonal southwest monsoon rains from june through september jjas guhathakurta et al 2015 revadekar et al 2015 the annual mean rainfall over pune is about 680 mm out of which 80 560 mm is received during the southwest monsoon season revadekar et al 2015 http imdpune gov in over pune the average maximum and minimum temperatures are 31 7 c and 17 8 c respectively diurnal variability of temperatures is strong during the pre monsoon months of march april and may with daytime maximum temperatures exceeding 40 c and night time temperatures dropping below 20 c during the winter months of december and january the night time temperatures drop below 10 c www imdpune gov in diurnal variability of temperature over pune is generally lowest during the southwest monsoon season additionally this region is characterized by strong soil moisture temperature coupling ganeshi et al 2020 3 1 rainfall variations during 2017 2020 the time series of daily rainfall rf over the cosmos iitm site from 31 january 2017 to 30 september 2020 is shown in fig 2 a a distinct seasonality in the precipitation associated with the indian summer monsoon is predominantly observed in rf time series from the end of may till early october we also see year to year variations in the monsoon rainfall in fig 2a the total seasonal rf from 01 june to 30 september over the cosmos iitm site for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 is found to be 674 mm 592 mm 1104 mm and 775 mm respectively table 1a the corresponding seasonal rf over pune for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 is 1303 mm 990 mm 1804 mm 1202 mm respectively table 1a and the long term climatological mean rf over pune is 560 mm revadekar et al 2015 in addition table 1a provides the values of the total seasonal june to september rf over a larger region of madhya maharashtra and all india for the period 2017 2020 we can clearly see that the interannual variations of monsoon rainfall over the cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 are consistent with the pattern of rf variability on larger spatial scales over pune madhya maharashtra and all india table 1a an important point to be noted is the significantly excess monsoon rains over the cosmos iitm site and pune during 2019 and 2020 as compared to 2018 and 2017 fig 2a table 1a the accumulated seasonal monsoon rainfall during 2019 over cosmos iitm was nearly double that of 2018 the excess monsoon rainfall in 2019 as compared to 2018 is also seen over larger spatial scales i e pune madhya maharashtra and all india table 1a although the year 2018 witnessed some rf events prior to the onset of the summer monsoon the total monsoon rainfall was considerably low over the cosmos iitm site particularly 2018 rf during the second half of the core summer monsoon season was significantly deficit fig 2a the dates of the summer monsoon onset and withdrawal over pune during 2017 2020 are listed based on the india meteorological department imd records table 1a a summary of the daily rf analysis over the cosmos iitm site for the june september monsoon season during 2017 2020 is provided in table 1b the total seasonal monsoon rainfall during 2019 was largely contributed by rain accumulations lasting for 5 9 consecutive days and also beyond 10 days table 1b a notable aspect of the 2019 monsoon is the prolongation of rf until early november fig 2a which is also consistently reflected in significantly cooler temperatures t2m over the cosmos iitm site fig 2b 3 1 1 wavelet analysis of rainfall time scale variability of dominant rainfall periodicities at the cosmos iitm site fig 3 is examined using the morlet wavelet analysis kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 torrence and webster 1999 the white contours denote the statistically significant periodicities of rainfall spectrum at 95 thin conic demarcation highlights the cone of confluence coi the region indicating importance of edge effects stronger variability confined to jjas in the spectral power is well distributed in frequency domain under coi at 95 statistical significance fig 3 the daily rf distribution at the cosmos iitm site mainly exhibits three different periodicities confined to respective southwest summer monsoon seasons during 2017 2020 these monsoonal periodicities are categorized in weak power 0 25 moderate 0 25 power 4 and strong power 4 using normalized local wavelet power spectrum along with its statistical significance under coi interestingly the power spectrum is void during non monsoon seasons these three monsoonal periodicities are described as synoptic scale oscillation 3 7 days quasi biweekly oscillation 10 20 days and low frequency oscillations 30 60 days relevant to the respective power spectrum categorized above these three periodicities are confined to the first half of the summer monsoon season during 2018 in contrast to 2017 2019 and 2020 the power variation in fig 3 also consistently and clearly depicts the onset gradually increased and withdrawal gradually decreased phases of indian summer monsoon during 2017 2020 as seen in fig 2a and table 1a the three distinct statistically significant monsoonal rainfall periodicities are dominant at the cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 relatively higher spectral power in three significantly dominant periodicities synoptic scale quasi biweekly scale and low frequency oscillations during 2019 is the implication of long persisting rain spells table 1b the persistence of prolonged rain spells beyond monsoon season during 2019 in contrast to 2018 is consistent with the extended contours of strong low frequency spectra significant at 95 thus rainfall and temperature analysis illustrating distinct phases of monsoon onset and withdrawal seasonal sub seasonal variations during 2017 2020 provide scope for unrevealing their impacts on concurrent field scale sm variations and memory time scale at cosmos iitm site 3 2 analysis of field scale soil moisture variability at cosmos iitm site the daily variations of cosmos field scale sm and the effective depth of the cosmos measurement during 2017 2020 at cosmos iitm are shown in fig 4 validation of cosmos iitm sm data against the statistical mean of the in situ profiles 30 january 6 september 21 november 2017 and 25 september 2018 is satisfactory see marked symbols in fig 4 study uses best fit n0 of 1194 franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 2016 from gravimetric sampling to get vwc from the cosmic ray method supplementary table s2 analysis of scales of sm variations in the context of rainfall and temperature variations is crucial for better understanding of land surface processes particularly over the core monsoon zone with strong coupling between soil moisture and surface temperature the annual cycle of sm and the effective depth clearly depict the monsoon cycle fig 4 the sharp sm variations increasing decreasing exceeding 20 vwc and almost 20 cm shallowing deepening effective depth of cosmos iitm sm around monsoon onset and withdrawal phases during 2017 2020 are clearly seen the sm turns out to be around 30 and above having effective depth 15 cm with standard deviations of 8 10 during wet periods while it remains below 15 rising effective depth above 25 cm with standard deviation around 5 7 during dry periods fig 4 moreover variations of field scale sm and its effective depth within the monsoon season are intriguing fig 4 interestingly during jjas pre monsoon march april may 2019 excessively wet dry sm depicts the vwc exceeding 40 confined to 10 with effective depth close to 10 cm exceeding 40 cm the consistency of cosmos iitm field scale sm data set with in situ rainfall temperature humidity and pressure also provide strong support for depicting the appropriate variability fig 2 supplementary fig s2 and fig 4 the focus of this study is more on the variability of high spatio temporal sm variations along with the validation of ground truth the validation of soil moisture using cosmos measurements with the in situ observations by gravimetric method at iitm site depicts the root mean square error rmse value in the range of 1 2 supplimentry table s2 3 2 1 wavelet analysis of cosmos iitm field scale soil moisture variability the temporal variability of the field scale soil moisture at cosmos iitm site and its linkage with the in situ rainfall variations are analyzed in this section to begin with a continuous wavelet spectrum of daily field scale cosmos iitm sm observations is computed to find dominant periodicities in the time frequency domain fig 5 the white contours denote the statistically significant periodicities of rf under the cone of influence coi further this standardized local wavelet power spectrum is categorized in weak power 0 25 moderate 0 25 power 4 and strong power 4 bins which are statistically significant the standardized local wavelet power spectrums of field scale sm observations fig 5 clearly depict the distinct periodicities broadly consistent with those of rf fig 3 it is worth mentioning that the sm power spectrum is not only confined to monsoon seasons but prevails throughout 2017 2020 fig 5 in contrast to seasonal cyclic spectrum of rf fig 3 this temporal persistence of the sm spectrum is indicative of a red noise process kulkarni et al 2009 delworth and manabe 1988 manabe and delworth 1990 ganeshi et al 2020 the memory characteristic of sm related to the red noise process is analysed further using autocorrelation see sub section 3 5 the power variation in fig 5 is also consistent with the onset gradually increasing and withdrawal gradually decreasing phases of indian summer monsoon rainfall during the 2017 2020 figs 2 5 stronger variability in the spectral power is mostly confined to low frequency oscillations 30 60 day mode for sm data statistically significant at 95 in contrast to rf sm wavelet power is trivial in the synoptic scale oscillations less than ten days band while it is moderate in quasi bi weekly oscillations 10 20 days band at the 95 confidence level under coi fig 5 additionally during 2019 sm wavelet spectra in 10 20 days band is persisting over time domain beyond monsoon season during 2019 relative to those of 2020 2018 and 2017 the power distribution in cosmos iitm sm data fig 5 seems to be closely associated with the intensities and frequencies of monsoonal rain fig 3 and table 1b the sm power in the 30 60 days band is reasonably distributed over the 2017 monsoonal and post monsoon months the distribution of 2018 wavelet power for sm in the 30 40 days band at 95 confidence level is mostly confined to the early monsoon months it is worth noticing that the cosmos iitm sm data depicts the highest power of the low frequency 30 60 day band during 2019 at 95 confidence level extending well beyond monsoon season as compared to that of 2017 2018 and 2020 fig 5 a contrast between figs 3 and 5 shows that power of short term variability for sm is trivial however it reasonably extends beyond monsoon season for the low frequency band the long term variation in precipitation modulates sm memory time scale through terrestrial hydrological processes it is worth mentioning that the ratio of magnitude and temporal extent between low and high frequency mode turns out to be relatively higher for sm as that of rf interestingly the detected highest power in rf is periodically transferred to lower frequency of field scale sm this transformation of power evolves from the large spikes in rf to the spikes in field scale sm as shown in niu et al 2014 this transformation of power is also validated using wavelet cross power of field scale sm between daily cosmos iitm observations and in situ rf figure not shown the wavelet analysis of the field scale sm and in situ rf shows the regions of large common power of the low frequency band at 95 confidence level during 2019 relative to 2017 2018 and 2020 see figs 3 and 5 moreover the consistency of onset and withdrawal phases of monsoon is remarkable among rf and sm during 2017 2020 3 3 validation of satellite reanalysis and modeled soil moisture data sets with the cosmos iitm observations this section presents the cross validation results from the impact of rainfall variability on soil moisture variabilities using comparative analysis among coarser resolution satellite reanalysis and model products and field scale cosmos iitm observations it is interesting to see how the onset and withdrawal phases of monsoon are captured by various soil moisture products in this study cosmos iitm field scale sm data is considered as a ground truth for the validation of various available coarser resolution products this subsection contains comparison analysis on daily time scale of coarser resolution satellite smos smap amsr2 reanalysis era5 merra 2 and modeled gldas products see detailed description in supplementary section with field scale cosmos iitm soil moisture observations during 2017 2020 the daily time series of all sm datasets are prepared in terms of of volumetric water content and evaluated for the realistic representation of cosmos iitm field scale sm observation fig 6 a the inter comparison of the annual cycle of sm among various data sets is carried out by standardized statistical estimates i e standard deviation std rmse ubrmse and correlation with daily cosmos iitm sm observations fig 6b and table 2 the annual cycle of daily distribution of sm is reasonably depicted by coarser resolution sm products fig 6a relative to cosmos iitm observations for the period 2017 2020 the monsoon onset and withdrawal phases are well captured by gldas and era5 datasets relative to those of satellite observations over the cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 the moderate ranges of soil moisture variability among satellite gldas and era5 data sets clearly bring out realistic summer monsoon influences as depicted by cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 fig 6a it is to be mentioned that the consistency of cosmos iitm field scale daily observations with the high resolution ldas daily data set is remarkable for the year 2017 see supplementary figs s3 and s4 in representing monsoon onset and withdrawal phases seasonal and sub seasonal cycles the standardized stdz statistical scores of field scale sm cosmos iitm data along with satellite reanalysis and simulated products are better summarized using the taylor diagram fig 6b taylor 2001 this approach is useful to quantify sm validation using daily field scale observations against the coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis and model data products smos smap amsr2 era5 merra 2 and the gldas over cosmos iitm site furthermore graphical summary fig 6b better describes validation of daily sm variations of coarser resolution data sets against the reference of field scale cosmos iitm observations for this purpose we have carried out correlation standard deviation root mean square error rmse unbiased root mean square analysis the stdz statistics for each sm data set is computed and presented in fig 6b labelled with a distinct symbol it is to be noted that the pattern correlation of gldas open square symbol product with cosmos iitm observations is about 0 9 fig 6b furthermore rmse between gldas and observed patterns cosmos iitm is about 0 04 m3 m3 stdz 0 35 table 2 the standard deviation of gldas is proportional to the radial distance from the origin which is about 1 09 stdz value and found to be marginally higher than cosmos iitm standard deviation subsequently era5 is found to be close to cosmos observation with relatively high correlation r 0 95 and rmse of 0 04 m3 m3 stdz 0 34 among the satellite sm products smap has a higher correlation r 0 91 with cosmos observations than smos r 0 7 and amsr2 r 0 88 while least variability can be observed in smos sm product stdz standard deviation 1 31 than other satellite products smap and amsr2 it is worth noting that the satellite sm data sets exhibit higher rmse relative to gldas and era5 sm products table 2 though merra has higher correlation r 0 89 it has largest variations with standard deviation of 3 76 stdz value and rmse of about 2 39 stdz value thus among all the sm data products gldas and era5 have relatively close resemblance to the cosmos iitm observations fig 6b present study also evaluated mean bias and ubrmse to compare all coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis and model soil moisture data products with cosmos iitm results suggest that merra 2 sm product has a maximum bias of 0 39 m3 m3 over the pune region whereas least bias can be found in gldas sm product 0 03 m3 m3 the statistical quantity ubrmse is well in proportion with rmse and showing close correspondence of cosmos iitm sm data with gldas product 3 70 table 2 3 4 evaluation of periodicities for various soil moisture data products this section contains wavelet coherence analysis of coarser resolution satellite smos smap and amsr2 reanalysis era5 and merra 2 and modeled gldas daily soil moisture data sets with field scale cosmos iitm observations over pune site during 2017 2020 the daily standardized time series of all datasets are analysed in the time frequency domain to understand the association of distinct characteristics of sm variability at this observational site during 2017 2020 the cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence in the time frequency domain is used to explore the consistency and relative phase relationship among various coarser resolution daily sm data products and cosmos iitm observations the cross wavelet transform of the field scale soil moisture observations and coarser resolution gldas over cosmos iitm site is shown in fig 7 the region under white contour indicates standardized high power of spectra exceeding 95 confidence level under the cone of influence coi the arrows depict the relative phase relationship in phase by right pointing arrows out of phase by left pointing arrows cosmos iitm observations leading gldas by arrows pointing straight downward gldas leading cosmos iitm observations by arrows pointing straight upward overall there is a good agreement for consistency and phase relationship among gldas and cosmos iitm sm data sets the cross wavelet transform fig 7 depicts low frequency 30 60 day mode band with standardized larger common power of spectra at 95 confidence level under coi between cosmos iitm and gldas time series during 2019 as those of 2017 2018 and 2020 thus the phase relationship for low frequency band and consistency in the 2019 power spectra among cosmos iitm and gldas is remarkable fig 7 the substantial agreement of gldas sm data product with the observational data at cosmos iitm site is also highlighted in a recent study by ganeshi et al 2020 interestingly among other coarser resolution sm data products era5 also depicts the reasonable distribution of standardized large common power and significant coherence of variation in the time frequency domain during 2019 as compared to 2017 2018 and 2020 with field scale sm at cosmos iitm site figure not shown interestingly the power variation associated with the summer monsoon onset and withdrawal phases is also better captured in gldas and era5 sm products it is worth mentioning that other coarser resolution data sets such as smos smap amsr2 and merra2 differ considerably in the representation of coherent periodicities and the power of spectra are very much scattered in the time frequency domain over cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 figures not shown furthermore unrealistic sm power distribution is found in smos spreading over high as well as low bands the smap depicts the low frequency band with unrealistic lag in time domain and coherence power during 2017 2020 interestingly the resolution of sm variability by satellite product is not found to be as realistic as model and reanalysis sm data products this could be due to the induction of appropriate data assimilation methods and simulation of land surface processes in reanalysis and model sm products thus it can be inferred that periodic transfer of higher rf power to lower frequency of sm is reasonably depicted by gldas and era5 data sets as that of cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 particularly over the core monsoon zone with strong coupling characteristic 3 5 analysis of soil moisture auto correlation soil moisture is also known to show its distinct persistence characteristics such as memory time scale memory characteristics of sm normally depend on the latitudinal variation climate models estimated memory time scale of sm are found to be relatively higher in the extra tropics yearly as compared to the lower latitudes monthly delworth and manabe 1988 manabe and delworth 1990 ganeshi et al 2020 a similar study by wang et al 2010 investigated latitudinal dependability of soil moisture memory time scale using the e folding time scale also known as exponential decay time scale however this latitudinal dependent relationship of soil moisture memory time scale is highly non linear particularly over the tropical regions like the core monsoon zone of south asia dong and ochsner 2018 rajeevan et al 2010 in the present study we have analysed soil moisture memory time scale over the cosmos iitm observational site using the auto correlation method the auto correlation of daily sm data products is estimated here with respect to the 30 day lag in time period in days fig 8 the drop of auto correlation with the lag of time period in days indicates drying of sm the reduced rate of auto correlation with respect to the lag in days determines the persistent characteristics of soil moisture memory time scale the sharper decreasing rate of auto correlation with lags in days implies faster drying of sm auto correlation analysis of cosmos iitm field scale soil moisture fig 8 shows that the gradual drop is mostly confined to 0 4 during 2019 while the drop is faster and extends below 0 4 during 2017 2018 and 2020 the sharp decrease of auto correlation during 2017 2018 and 2020 indicates drying of sm is relatively faster fig 8 thus the auto correlation drop restricted to 0 4 with a lag time of a couple of months during 2019 shows a longer persistence for the period about 60 days this analysis clearly brings out that distinction in soil moisture memory time scale smm during 2017 2020 is reasonably captured using cosmos iitm data set the sharp drop of the 2018 auto correlation curve seems to be consistent with the weaker rain spells particularly during the later part of the summer monsoon season the drop of the auto correlation curve is relatively uniform during 2017 and distinct from that of 2018 this feature is more prominent in fig 8 depicting the robustness of cosmos iitm field scale sm variability associated with stronger rain spells and prevailing surface conditions during the second half of the 2019 summer monsoon this observed field scale sm auto correlation analysis is repeated for available coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis model data products figures not shown further comparison of decreasing rates of auto correlations among various sm data products are carried out to distinguish their soil moisture memory time scales smm among available daily sm satellite reanalysis and model data products only gldas and era5 data sets are found to be relatively close to cosmos iitm observation in depicting the realistic persistence characteristics of soil moisture memory time scale particularly over region of strong coupling ganeshi et al 2020 the ingestion of satellite and in situ observations in the model and reanalysis land surface products through objective data assimilation methodology and simulation of surface processes provides value addition for optimal surface field estimates rodell et al 2004 jimenez et al 2011 4 conclusion this study presents analysis of novel field scale soil moisture sm observations hourly area average estimate for 400 m diameter at cosmos iitm pune site located across the tropical core monsoon zone of india the association of field scale sm variations with distinct periodicities of in situ rainfall rf is evaluated here for the period 2017 2020 the assessment of field scale sm variabilities in time frequency domain synoptic bi weekly and low frequency is found to be crucial for bridging the gap between point scale and coarser resolution satellite reanalysis and modeled smos smap amsr2 era5 merra 2 and gldas respectively sm data products furthermore quantitative analysis using wavelet transform and autocorrelation highlights power transformation of rain spells into sm in the time frequency domain and the memory time scale characteristic of sm respectively the distinct variabilities of rainfall and temperature over cosmos iitm site during 2017 2020 clearly demonstrate the predominance of the year 2019 the distinct features of long persisting heavy rain spells during 2019 particularly in the later part of the summer monsoon are found to be consistent with the rf over larger areas of pune region madhya maharashtra and larger part of india the gradual variations of the rf exhibit the evolution of summer monsoon onset and withdrawal phases during 2017 2020 also the intense temperature extremes with a peak exceeding 45 c during pre monsoon march april may 2019 supplementary fig s3 clearly differentiate it from that of 2017 2018 and 2020 interestingly the summer season march june of the 2020 critical period of covid 19 did not observe extreme temperatures exceeding 40 c at the cosmos iitm site the daily variations of field scale cosmos iitm soil moisture along with its effective depth fairly depict seasonal sub seasonal features along with the onset and withdrawal phases of summer monsoon during 2017 2020 in agreement with those of daily rainfall and temperature variations interestingly the concurrent variations in the effective depth of cosmos iitm sm also provide better insight into hydrological processes the distribution of local wavelet power spectrums in the time frequency domain of rf and field scale sm during 2017 2020 considerably reveals the transfer of high frequencies 7 days and 10 20 days power spectrum in rf to the low frequency 30 60 days power of sm at cosmos iitm site the comparison of rf and sm wavelet analysis depict the influence of long lasting rain spells on sm persistence beyond monsoon season during 2019 the ratio of low and high frequency mode during 2019 is highest for sm as that of rf the sm validation statistics using the taylor diagram brings out the close agreement of coarser resolution gldas and era5 sm products with that of field scale sm observations over cosmos iitm site the wavelet analysis carried out with coarser resolution sm products also depict the good agreement of gldas and era5 data sets with that of field scale cosmos iitm observations during 2017 2020 specifically the power transfer to the low frequency including summer monsoon onset and withdrawal phases and its extension in time domain beyond monsoon season during 2019 is well represented by gldas and era5 products as compared to those of smos smap and amsr2 furthermore the longer persistence time scale of about 60 days period is observed during 2019 for the cosmos iitm sm the longer memory time scale clearly depicts the dominant influence of stronger rain spells during 2019 while the relatively lower range of sm variations during 2017 2018 and 2020 tend to confined the persistence time scale below 50 days period thus the high frequency field scale cosmos iitm sm observations realistically represent the influence of distinct variabilities of rainfall including seasonal sub seasonal onset and withdrawal phases of the indian summer monsoon during 2017 2020 it would be interesting to investigate the influence of rf variations on sm memory time scale in the backdrop of climate change this calibration validation and soil moisture memory time scale analyses could be extended over other cosmos sites to get better insight into the field scale soil moisture variability in time frequency domain across extra tropical subtropical and tropical regions the extension of the observed network of high frequency field scale cosmos observations are not only useful to produce the long term reliable sm data products but also very crucial for validation of coarser resolution remote sensing reanalysis and model simulation sm products along with hydrological applications across core monsoon zone credit authorship contribution statement milind mujumdar conceptualization resources writing original draft

4581,cluster analysis is a valuable tool for understanding spatial and temporal patterns e g spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry to determine cluster numbers and cluster memberships that are unknown in real world problems a number of methods have been used to assist cluster analysis among which graphic approaches are popular and intuitive this study introduced for the first time the t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne method as a graphic approach to assist cluster analysis for groundwater geochemistry data the hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied to original groundwater geochemistry data and t sne was used to help determine the number of cluster and cluster memberships afterward t sne was used to help delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry the t sne based cluster visualization was compared to the visualization based on principal component analysis pca by applying hca pca and t sne to three geochemical datasets oslo transect taiyuan karst water and jianghan plain groundwater datasets which are characterized by different number of samples and features collected across different space and time scales we found that t sne outperformed pca to assist hca as a promising tool for helping determine the number of hca clusters and delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry it should be noted that t sne alone cannot be used for cluster analyses partly because t sne visualization depends on a hyperparameter called perplexity that is a priori unknown for real world problems the perplexity values used in this study were determined empirically and a small value of 0 1 was used for the taiyuan karst water dataset with 14 samples for the other two datasets with hundreds of samples the corresponding perplexity values were 20 and 30 within the range of 5 50 commonly used in t sne keywords statistical analysis geochemical zones dimension reduction cluster validity principal component analysis 1 introduction groundwater resources may be effectively and efficiently protected if spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry are understood especially in light of variable future conditions that will change according to climate population expansion and decreasing freshwater availability cloutier et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 gorelick and zheng 2015 green et al 2011 zhu et al 2020 groundwater geochemistry is affected by both natural processes and anthropogenic activities with broad variability in space and time especially at the regional scale güler and thyne 2004b haile and fryar 2017 tóth 1999 2009 discovering spatio temporal patterns and further delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry is a primary goal of hydrogeochemical studies güler et al 2012 nguyen et al 2015 yang et al 2020 this goal is complicated because groundwater geochemical datasets are multivariate in nature one groundwater sample has multiple physical chemical and biological features while multiple samples are collected at various locations and times to understand the spatio temporal patterns embedded in a groundwater geochemistry dataset cluster analyses have been used to separate the dataset into a number of clusters each of which has similar groundwater geochemistry that reflects the controlling processes of groundwater quality gan et al 2018 güler and thyne 2004a b pacheco castro et al 2018 pant et al 2018 templ et al 2008 cluster analysis addresses two fundamental questions 1 how many clusters are appropriate i e cluster numbers and 2 how are individual groundwater samples assigned to a cluster i e cluster memberships because neither the number of clusters nor cluster memberships are known a priori cluster analyses must be evaluated evaluation can be as simple as mapping the locations of clusters or by applying statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca for the convenience of visualizing pca results in two dimensional graphs high dimensional geochemical data are always projected onto two principal components e g pc1 vs pc2 where pc standing for principal component it has been found that pca plots are not always successful at distinguishing clustered data and overlaps between clusters are constantly observed making clear interpretation challenging in the review article by templ et al 2008 wherein cluster analysis was applied to regional geochemical data a question arose is there a graphical way to evaluate the stability or validity of clusters this study was motivated to answer this question this study introduced the t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne method as a new graphical technique to support cluster analysis the t sne method developed by van der maaten and hinton 2008 is a state of the art machine learning technique for dimensionality reduction to visualize high dimensional data the method has been used in many research fields such as gene expression aizarani et al 2019 dobie et al 2019 kobak and berens 2019 tumor classification abdelmoula et al 2016 roche et al 2018 hyperspectral imaging analysis melit devassy and george 2020 pouyet et al 2018 and fault diagnosis zheng et al 2018 zheng and zhao 2020 recently there have been several studies using t sne for visualization of geochemical and hydrological data balamurali and melkumyan 2016 used t sne for dimension reduction and found that t sne outperformed other dimension reduction methods e g pca kernel pca and locally linear embedding for visualizing patterns of shape trend embedded in large geological assay datasets balamurali et al 2019 further applied different clustering algorithms to reduced dimensions produced by t sne such as self organizing map and spanning tree progression analysis of density normalized events leung et al 2019 conducted a similar research to apply the spectral clustering algorithm to t sne reduced dimensions and they further linked clustering results to a consensus matrix obtained from multiple t sne runs and spectral clustering classifications for detecting outliers in a geochemical dataset horrocks et al 2019 used random forest methods to select 11 out of 31 elements for separating unaltered and altered host rock specimens and then used t sne to validate the selection of the 11 elements mazher 2020 applied t sne to a large dataset generated by a hydrologic model that produces 9 variables over 273 time steps the high dimensions of 2 457 9 273 was reduced to two dimensions using four methods i e pca generative topographic mapping t sne and uniform manifold approximation and projection mazher 2020 concluded that the latter two methods outperformed the former two methods for visualizing spatial patterns of the modeling results to the best of our knowledge t sne has not been used to assist cluster analysis for groundwater geochemistry data this study tackled the following two questions that have not been attempted by the groundwater hydrology community 1 can t sne be used as a graphical method to assist cluster analyses with respect to determining the number of clusters 2 can t sne be used as a tool to delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results in response to the first question we used t sne in conjunction with hierarchical cluster analyses hca in hca one way to determine the number of clusters is to subjectively place the so called phenon line at a linkage distance which is discussed in section 2 adjusting the phenon line upward or downward changes the number of clusters determining the appropriate number of clusters requires additional lines of evidence such as geochemical analysis using piper or stiff plots appelo and postma 2005 yang et al 2020 the appropriate number of clusters can also be determined by using various statistical methods and the elbow method average silhouette method and the gap statistic method kassambara 2017 explored in this study this study focused on the pca method which produces two dimensional visualization of the clustered data pca visualizations however are often not ideal because data of one cluster may significantly overlap data of another cluster in this work we illustrated that t sne outperformed pca when visualizing clustered geochemical data in the two dimensional t sne visualization to answer the second question about delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results the conventional approach is to first plot cluster data on a map and then examine the resulting spatial distribution of the clusters to determine spatial zones while considering the geological hydrogeological and geochemical information relevant to the site of interest a drawback of this approach is that when a series of samples are collected over time at a sampling location it is impossible to plot the data series on the map and one has to either incorporate the statistics of the data or discard certain data samples for example in the study of yang et al 2020 because groundwater samples collected at one well belonged to different clusters in different years the clusters of the majority samples were used to delineate spatial zones this problem is intrinsically resolved when using t sne because it reduces high dimensional data to low dimensions and can use all data for delineating spatial zones without discarding any data an example of doing so was given by mazher 2020 who used t sne to visualize a dataset comprising nine variables simulated at 273 time steps on a two dimensional plot more importantly when t sne visualizes high dimensional data on a reduced set of dimensions pair wise distances and structures in the high dimensional data space are maintained to the extent possible in the low dimensional t sne space therefore t sne by default is suitable for delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry a feature that has not received adequate attention to explore the two questions discussed above t sne was applied to three geochemical datasets the oslo transect the taiyuan karst water and the jianghan plain groundwater datasets with different sample sizes and dimensions i e the number of geochemical features the oslo transect dataset included geochemical data of nine plant materials e g different species or leaves wood bark of birch and spruce collected at 40 sites reimann et al 2007 because it is theoretically known that the dataset can be divided into nine clusters each for one plant material this dataset was used to benchmark t sne s capability of assisting hca it should be noted that this dataset is not suitable for spatial zone delineation because the sampling sites were along a transect and the nine samples corresponding to nine plant materials were collected from the same sites the taiyuan karst water dataset of ma et al 2011 was used not only to assist hca but also to evaluate t sne s ability to delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry the evaluation was possible because ma et al 2011 divided the groundwater system into three sub systems and further delineated three groundwater geochemistry zones e g a recharge and flow through zone a cold water discharge zone and a thermal water discharge zone for each subsystem the jianghan plain groundwater dataset of yang et al 2020 was used in the same manner as the taiyuan karst water dataset except that the former dataset is substantially more complicated than the latter dataset in terms of dimensionality and spatial and temporal scales over which the data were collected the jianghan plain groundwater dataset can better evaluate t sne s capability of both assisting cluster analysis and spatial zone delineation for regional aquifers in this study hca pca and t sne analyses were applied to the three geochemical datasets hca was used as the basis for the cluster analysis and pca and t sne were used as graphic means of evaluating the hca determined number of clusters and cluster memberships for this purpose t sne outperformed pca for all three datasets because t sne provides better visualizations of clustered data we demonstrated that t sne is an effective and efficient graphical way to assist cluster analysis with respect to determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships it is also a promising tool for delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results however since t sne was not designed for cluster analysis we suggest using t sne only as a graphical way to assist hca based cluster analyses t sne visualization strongly depends on a hyperparameter called perplexity that is a priori unknowable for real world problems 2 geochemistry data and statistical methodologies 2 1

known theoretically that these data can be separated into nine clusters one for each plant materials because different plants uptake nutrients in different ways and variously partition those elements between wood leaves and bark templ et al 2008 this logical result of nine clusters makes the dataset suitable as a benchmark to evaluate the potential of using t sne to evaluate cluster analyses the taiyuan karst water dataset ma et al 2001 consists of 37 samples of cold water temperature 30 and thermal karst groundwater from taiyuan city china and the locations of the samples are shown in fig 1 for each sample a total of 31 geochemical parameters were analyzed including 3 physiochemistry variables temperature ph and ec nine major elements co3 2 hco3 f cl no3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 and na 4 minor elements k fe si and sr and 15 trace elements as ag al b ba cd co cu hg li mn mo ni sb and zn therefore the dataset has a total of 37 31 1 147 measurements based on site specific information related to structural geology hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry the karst groundwater system was divided into three sub systems as follows the dongshan mountain karst groundwater subsystem dmk the beishan mountain karst groundwater subsystem bmk and the xishan mountain karst groundwater subsystem xmk ma et al 2011 further grouped samples of dmk into three zones recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone and thermal water discharge zone samples of bmk into three zones recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone at the margin of the mountain and cold water discharge zone in buried karst zone and samples from xmk into three zones recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone and thermal water discharge zone generally speaking the groundwater geochemistry evolved from the recharge and flow through zone toward the cold water discharge zones and further to the thermal water discharge zones in fig 1 the samples collected from the dmk bmk and xmk subsystems are denoted by squares circles and triangles respectively within each subsystem the samples in the recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone and thermal water discharge zone are highlighted in black blue and red colors respectively the dataset and geochemical analysis of ma et al 2011 facilitate an evaluation of the potential for t sne to assist cluster analysis for hundreds of groundwater geochemical data and to delineate groundwater geochemical zones at the scale of tens of kilometers the jianghan plain groundwater dataset used in our previous study of yang et al 2020 includes 1 184 groundwater samples collected over 23 years 1992 2014 from 29 monitoring wells drilled into the middle confined aquifer of jianghan plain china fig 2 each sample has 11 geochemical parameters ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 nh4 f and fe and the dataset has a total of 1 184 11 13 024 measurements yang et al 2020 conducted cluster and hydrogeochemical analyses for this large dataset and delineated seven clusters and four groundwater geochemical zones of the regional aquifer i e recharge zone i transition zone ii flow through zone iii and discharge mixing zones zone iv fig 2 this large dataset and the four delineated zones enable us to evaluate the effectives of t sne in assisting cluster analysis for tens of thousands of groundwater geochemical data and in delineating groundwater geochemical zones at the scale of hundreds of kilometers 2 2 data preprocessing preprocessing geochemical data before conducting cluster analysis is always necessary templ et al 2008 ellefsen et al 2014 the three datasets were pre processed by 1 geochemical feature selection 2 substitution of censored data 3 screening missing values 4 data transformation and 5 standardization the first step defines appropriate parameters for cluster analysis a geochemical parameter may be excluded if one or more of the following conditions is met 1 the parameter is not continuously measured over time i e the parameter values are not reported for many sampling campaigns resulting in a large number of missing values 2 the parameter is closely related to other parameters e g alkalinity can be computed by using ph and hco3 according to appelo and postma 2005 and 3 40 of measurements are censored data that are either less than or greater than a detection limit sanford et al 1993 if censored data exist for a selected geochemical parameter further data preprocessing is required this study used a simple approach to replace the censored values with 3 4 of the detection limit for less than conditions and 4 3 of the upper limit for greater than conditions sanford et al 1993 for the issue of missing values samples that contain missing values are removed afterward the natural log transformation was applied to the datasets and the z score standardization subtracting the data mean and dividing the residuals by data standard deviation was applied to the transformed data to remove the impacts of data units and scales reimann and filzmoser 2000 templ et al 2008 it however should be noted that the use of substitution method and log transformation is simple but may not be ideal as they may skew the distribution of the data and hamper the statistical analysis reimann and filzmoser 2000 sanford et al 1993 2 3 hca and pca statistical analyses the hca and pca statistical methods are described briefly here and a more thorough description is available in statistical books e g rencher 2003 hca with the ward method ward 1963 as an agglomerative approach starts by treating each sample as its own cluster and merges the clusters stepwise to generate larger clusters ending with one cluster containing all samples at each successive step clusters are merged according to the ward criterion with the smallest increase of sum of squared errors sse for cluster al with nl observations ss e a l i 1 n l o i o 2 where oi i 1 2 nl is the i th observation in the cluster o is the mean of all observations in the cluster and o i o 2 is the squared euclidean distance between oi and o at the beginning of hca there are n clusters for n samples and sse of each cluster is zero in the next step all possible cluster combinations are considered and sse is calculated for each combination for the case that clusters a and b are merged into cluster c the sse changes to δ s s e s s e c s s e a s s e b in the ward method the two clusters that yield the smallest δ s s e are merged the merging continues until only one cluster remains when the variance of clusters is minimized in such a way the merging history is recorded in a dendrogram whose horizontal axis is for all the samples and the vertical axis shows the linkage distances defined as 2 δ s s e between the merged clusters the number of clusters is determined by placing the phenon line at a linkage distance and one needs to carefully evaluate whether the number of clusters is appropriate by using various approaches among which pca is a popular one pca is a dimension reduction technique that performs a linear mapping of high dimensional space to a lower dimensional space with the variance of the low dimensional data maximized pca reduces data dimensionality and allows focusing on a few new combinatorial components that describe a large portion of the variance in the data ouyang 2005 in pca the covariance matrix of the high dimensional variables is evaluated and then the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalues the principal components are used to reconstruct a significant fraction of the variance of the high dimensional data in the context of using pca to assist cluster analysis the first two principal components or any two selected principal components can be used to generate a two dimensional graph to visualize the high dimensional data and to examine whether the assigned cluster number is reasonable generally speaking data in one cluster should be close to one another but are maximally separated from data in any other clusters on the two dimensional plot 2 4 sne and t sne methods the t sne algorithm is an improved variation of stochastic neighbor embedding sne developed by hinton and roweis 2002 the first task of sne is to convert the distance between two points in a high dimensional space to a conditional probability that represents the similarity of the two points in the high dimensional space and then to match the conditional probability between two points data points in the high dimensional space to the conditional probability between two points map points in a low dimensional space the conditional probability p j i between data points xi and xj is the probability that xi would pick xj as its neighbor and pi i 0 by definition the conditional probability is defined using a gaussian kernel p j i exp x i x j 2 2 σ i 2 k i exp x i x k 2 2 σ i 2 where x i x j is the euclidean distance between data points xi and xj the variance σ i 2 of the gaussian kernel is calculated using a binary search such that the entropy h p i j p j i log 2 p j i of the probability distribution over all the data points is equal to log2 perp where perp is the user specified perplexity in the low dimensional space sne computes a similar conditional probability for map points yi and yj corresponding to the two data points xi and xj using another gaussian kernel with variance equaling 1 2 q j i exp y i y j 2 i k exp y i y k 2 and qi i 0 by definition the conditional probabilities pj i and qj i should be equal if the map points yi and yj exactly represent the similarity between the high dimensional data points xi and xj sne thus arranges map points in the low dimensional space to minimize the discrepancy between pj i and qj i measured by the kullback leibler divergence considering all data points the cost function to be minimized is c i k l p i q i i j p j i log p j i q j i where p i is the conditional probability distribution of data point xi over all other data points and q i is the conditional probability distribution of map point yi over all other map points the cost function is minimized through various optimization methods such as gradient descent sne was further developed into t sne by van der maaten and hinton 2008 with two major improvements one was to use a symmetric version of sne to estimate pairwise similarities in the both high and low dimensional spaces for data points xi and xj t sne introduces p ij p j i p i j 2 n as the probability that xi would pick xj as its neighbor such that pij pji the symmetric property where n is the number of data points the other improvement was to use a student s t distribution rather than a gaussian kernel to compute the similarity between map points so that the map points are more scattered in low dimensional space strictly speaking for map points yi and yj in low dimensional space t sne uses a heavy tailed t distribution with one degree of freedom to compute q ij 1 y i y j 2 1 k l 1 y k y l 2 1 which is the probability that yi would pick yj as its neighbor again qij qji as a symmetric property correspondingly the cost function becomes c k l p q i j p ij log p ij q ij where p and q are the joint probability distributions in high and low dimensional spaces respectively perplexity is the most important hyperparameter in the t sne method there are other important hyperparameters such as learning rate and number of iterations used in gradient descent optimization a small perplexity corresponds to a small σ i 2 used in eq 3 which results in selecting a data pair xi and xj with small distance a large perplexity corresponds to a large σ i 2 which can pair data at large distances in the extreme case of perp xi would pick any point as its neighbor with the equal possibility of 1 n 1 with n being the number of data points a commonly used perplexity is 30 and a typical range is 5 50 van der maaten and hinton 2008 argued that performance of sne is fairly robust to changes in the perplexity this study explored the effects of perplexity on t sne performance for the three geochemical datasets and found that a smaller perplexity should be used for small sample sizes with unknown perplexity values t sne was used in this study as a visualization tool to assist hca and this is empirically described below step 1 conduct hca to determine the number of clusters and cluster memberships based on the best understanding of the problem of interest and or appropriate statistical methods step 2 assign different colors to different clusters e g red for cluster 1 and blue for cluster 2 the colors will be used in step 4 below step 3 conduct t sne with different perplexity values the t sne runs are independent of the hca in step 1 step 4 for each perplexity value plot the samples in a two dimensional t sne space with samples highlighted in the colors determined in step 1 for example if a sample belongs to cluster 1 it will be plotted in red step 5 examine the spatial patterns of the colored samples in the t sne plots to determine which perplexity value yields the best results according to the following two criteria a whether samples of the same cluster are close to each other and b whether the samples of different clusters are maximally separated step 6 if the visual examination in step 5 yields satisfactory results for one perplexity value likely for multiple perplexity values it confirms that the cluster number and membership determined in step 1 are reasonable otherwise it is necessary to adjust the cluster number and memberships in step 1 and to repeat steps 2 4 and 5 there is no need to repeat the t sne runs in step 3 this procedure indicates that t sne is not use as a stand alone algorithm for cluster analysis but as a visualization tool to assist cluster analysis for determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships all the statistical analyses were performed using python 3 7 and hca pca and t sne were implemented using the python libraries scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 https scikit learn org stable index html and scipy jones et al 2001 https www scipy org the codes and the datasets used in this study are available at https github com jyangfsu geochemical t sne 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster analysis for oslo transect dataset because it is known theoretically that the oslo transect dataset should be separated into nine clusters one for each plant material this information was used to evaluate the potential of using t sne to assist cluster analysis delineation of spatial zones of geochemistry was not attempted for this dataset because the sampling sites were along a transect and the nine samples corresponding to nine plant materials were collected from the same sites given that data preprocessing was completed by reimann et al 2007 and todorov and filzmoser 2010 the dataset used by todorov and filzmoser 2010 was used directly in this study fig 3 a illustrates the two dimensional t sne visualization of the oslo transect dataset with perp 20 which yields the best visualization the t sne plot shows that the nine plant material clusters are distinct and without overlap this separation is consistent with the hca results fig 3 c plots the dendrogram of the hca using the ward method with euclidian distance placing the phenon line at a linkage distance of 18 results in nine clusters corresponding almost completely to the nine plant materials indicating that t sne provides a graphic way to evaluate validity of clusters pca does not yield such a consistent graphic validation as shown in fig 3 b which is the two dimensional pca visualization using the same color scheme of fig 3 a fig 3 b shows substantial overlaps between the clusters indicating that pca is not as adept as t sne for graphically validating the nine hca based clusters it is noted that while hca misclassified one sample with an index of x id 134 in the oslo transect dataset of rog into the fer cluster fig 3 c this did not occur to t sne because discrepancy between t sne and hca results is not uncommon it is worth analyzing the reasons fig 4 a plots the hca dendrogram for clusters rog c5 and fer c6 cluster rog is further separated into two clusters b 1 and b 2 and fer into four clusters b 3 b 6 the misclassified sample x id 134 of rog is denoted as cluster a in hca cluster a was merged with cluster b 4 not with b 1 or b 2 as explained in section 2 3 hca initially treats each sample as an individual cluster and proceeds to merge the two closest clusters until only a single cluster remains if cluster a is merged with cluster b 1 or b 2 the increase in sse is 7 17 or 6 06 larger than the increase of 5 35 upon merging clusters a and b 4 as a result the sample x id 134 of rog was assigned to cluster fer because of the smaller increase in sse this is consistent with hca theory because sse does not consider distances between samples instead sse considers distances between the sample and centers of other clusters this differs from t sne which is based on distance between paired data points or map points fig 4 b shows the probability of sample x id 134 picking another sample in clusters b 1 b 6 as its neighbor according to eq 6 the probability is substantially higher for samples in cluster b 2 of rog which explains why sample x id 134 was assigned to rog by t sne fig 3a because t sne and hca are based on different theories it is not surprising that the two methods yield different results for certain samples although the nine groups of samples shown in the t sne visualization fully agree with the theoretically known number of sample groups and group memberships it should be noted that t sne alone cannot be used for cluster analysis because the visualizations strongly depend on perplexity see section 4 because both perplexity and the number of clusters are unknown in practice the oslo transect dataset is a special case with known number of clusters we only recommend using t sne in conjunction with hca because the theoretical number of clusters is known for the oslo transect dataset it is an opportunity to evaluate the effects of alternative transformations we applied the box cox transformation as an alternative to the log transformation to the 24 elements and the loss on ignition of the oslo transect dataset the histograms of the log transformed data are plotted in fig s1 and the histograms of the box cox transformed data are plotted in fig s2 in the supplementary information file the box cox transformation was conducted by using the box cox function of scipy and the resulted λ values are shown in fig s2 the lilliefors test was used to examine normality of the transformed data lilliefors 1967 and the p values are shown in figs s1 and s2 the results of the lilliefors test show that neither of the two transformations yield data following normal distributions although the results of the box cox transformation are slightly closer to the normal distribution than the results of the log transformation pca analysis was applied to the log transformed and box cox transformed data and the results are plotted in fig s3 the similar visualization patterns in this figure indicate that the two transformations have negligible effects on the pca results the hca and t sne were also applied to the box cox transformed data and the results are plotted in fig s4 the figure shows that the performance of the box cox transformation is worse than that of the log transformation in that there are more samples misclassified as shown in fig s4 a for the box cox transformed data we also evaluated other statistical methods that have been used to assist cluster analysis for determining the appropriate number of clusters they are the elbow silhouette and gap statistic methods and a description of the methods is given in text s1 of the supplementary information file the results of the three methods are shown in fig 5 while the elbow and silhouette methods indicated that optimal cluster number was 2 the gap statistic values monotonically increased and the optimal number of clusters was 16 by using the rule of one standard error it was surprising that all three methods failed to yield the correct number of clusters this is also the case for the taiyuan karst water dataset and the jianghan plain groundwater dataset the results for these two datasets are shown in figs s5 and s6 exploring the reasons is beyond the scope of this study but it is warranted in future studies 3 2 cluster analysis and spatial zone delineation for taiyuan karst water dataset the taiyuan karst water dataset was subject to a t sne analysis to support hca clustering results and to delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry the results of ma et al 2011 were used a reference for the evaluation by following the preprocessing procedure described in section 2 2 parameter co3 2 was excluded from the dataset because all its measurements were less than the detection limit in addition ten samples were removed because of missing measurements ultimately fourteen samples in xmk seven in bmk and six in dmk were used in this study due to the small sample size for the bmk and dmk subsystems only the results of xmk are presented and discussed below the results of hca pca and t sne for bmk and dmk data are shown in fig s7 of the supplementary information file fig 6 a is the two dimensional t sne visualization using perp 0 1 of the 14 geochemical samples collected from the xmk sub system the three clusters shown in fig 6 a correspond exactly to the three clusters shown in fig 6 c by placing the phenon line at a linkage distance of 11 comparing the t sne visualization to the pca visualization shown in fig 6 b revealed that t sne outperformed pca when graphically validating the clustering results for the samples collected from the xml sub system denoted by triangles in fig 1 the three clusters shown in fig 6 a for t sne visualization agreed with the three groundwater geochemistry zones identified by ma et al 2011 and shown in fig 1 to facilitate a visual comparison the three clusters and the three spatial zones were distinguished using the same color scheme i e black for the recharge and flow through zone blue for the cold water discharge zone and red for the thermal water discharge zone the only disagreement between the clusters and the spatial zones was for sample rn32 because the sample s temperature was 30 c it should have belonged to the thermal water discharge zone fig 1 however both hca and t sne misclassified the sample into the cold water discharge zone because the sample s so4 2 concentration is 172 mg l about one order of magnitude less than the concentrations of other samples in the thermal water discharge zone but about the same order of magnitude as the concentrations of the samples in the cold water discharge zone 3 3 cluster analysis and spatial zone delineation for jianghan plain groundwater dataset the jianghan plain groundwater dataset has 1 184 samples collected over 23 years 1992 2014 from 29 monitoring wells distributed throughout a regional aquifer at the scale of hundreds of kilometers the 13 024 geochemical measurements pre processed by yang et al 2020 were used in this study fig 7 a shows that by drawing the phenon line at a linkage distance of 25 the 1 184 samples were grouped into seven clusters denoted as c1 c7 fig 7 b is the two dimensional pca visualization of the seven clusters while the seven clusters were generally separated there were substantial overlaps especially for c5 c7 the overlaps were substantially decreased in the two dimensional t sne visualization shown in fig 7 c for example the dots of c5 c7 were mostly separated demonstrating that t sne outperformed pca fig 7 c shows that t sne divided c4 and c7 each into two sub clusters the same results were obtained by moving the phenon line down from the linkage distance of 24 fig 7 a to that of 22 fig 7 d the two sub clusters of c4 were denoted as c4s1 and c4s2 and the two sub cluster of c7 as c7s1 and c7s2 fig 7 e and 7 f are the corresponding pca and t sne visualizations respectively for the nine clusters the overlap shown in fig 7 b is also observed in fig 7 e comparing the pca based visualization and the t sne based visualization indicates that t sne was a better visualization tool for the reduced dimensions the investigation on whether it is reasonable to have seven or nine clusters started with c7s1 and c7s2 of the 50 samples comprising c7s1 39 were from well j1 fig s8 a of the 33 samples in c7s2 31 were from well j8 fig s8 b as shown in fig 2 well j1 was located in the recharge zone zone i with limited water rock interaction while well j8 was located in the transition zone zone ii it appears reasonable to separate the data from the two wells into two clusters based on their locations this was also supported by examining the groundwater geochemistry of the two clusters the box plots of 11 groundwater geochemical parameters in fig 8 a indicate that the concentrations of k nh4 and fe were substantially lower in c7s1 than in c7s2 and that the concentrations of mg2 na cl and hco3 were substantially higher in c7s1 than in c7s2 the differences between the two clusters may justify separation of c7 into c7s1 and c7s2 part of the difference may be explained by the impacts of the yangtz river on the groundwater samples in c7s2 wherein 31 out of 33 samples were from well j8 which was only 200 m from the river yang et al 2020 found that river water recharged groundwater in the area where well j8 was located and li et al 2014 reported that the mean concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of the river water were 37 16 6 77 and 126 89 mg l respectively which were lower than the groundwater concentrations groundwater geochemistry of well j8 reflected the mixing of river water and groundwater and this may explain why the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 were substantially lower in c7s2 than in c7s1 separation of c7 into c7s1 and c7s2 inspired by the t sne visualization helped better understand groundwater geochemistry subject to groundwater and surface water interactions the geochemical reasons that c4 was separated into c4s1 and c4s2 were not fully understood yang et al 2020 found that c4 had high so4 2 concentrations caused by anthropogenic activities and this was true for both c4s1 and c4s2 as shown in fig 8 b however the 62 samples of c4s1 were from 16 wells fig s8 c while the 57 samples of c4s2 were from only nine wells with 40 out of the 57 samples from well j9 fig s8 d as a result the concentration ranges of the geochemical parameters except ph nh4 and fe were larger in c4s1 than in c4s2 as shown in fig 8 b this finding however was not useful for better understanding groundwater geochemistry in the jianghan plain aquifer t sne visualization is a promising tool for delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale the two dimensional t sne visualization of fig 7 f shows three zones denoted as a b and c that correspond to zones i iv delineated by yang et al 2020 and shown in fig 2 zone a of cluster c7s2 corresponds to zone i the recharge zone zone b of clusters c5 c6 and c7s1 corresponds to zone ii the transition zone zone c of clusters c1 and c2 corresponds to zones iii and iv the flow through zone and discharge mixing zone respectively zones iii and iv were separated by yang et al 2020 to reflect the impacts of the three gorges dam on the groundwater geochemistry observed at well j21 this separation was supported by the t sne visualization because clusters c1 and c2 were broadly separated although yang et al 2020 delineated the four zones of groundwater geochemistry without using t sne visualization the delineation would have been more obvious if t sne visualization had been used for example yang et al 2020 first determined the clusters that the majority of the samples belonged to and then mapped the locations of the wells and their corresponding clusters based on which zone delineation was made the two steps could be simplified into a single step by examining the zone patterns revealed by the t sne visualization in fig 7 f the samples from c3 c4s1 and c4s2 were not used for zone delineation because they were impacted by anthropogenic actives for example the samples in c3 were from well j10 located at one of the largest pesticide factories in china and the samples were characterized by extremely high concentrations of na and cl due to wastewater infiltration from the factory to the aquifer of the 62 samples in c4s1 15 were from well j25 located in a water supply plant while 10 samples were from well j8 about 300 m away from a cotton mill fig s2 c of the 57 samples in c4s2 40 were from well j9 located near another cotton mill fig s2 d it is interesting that the impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality are unambiguously revealed on the t sne visualization 4 discussion 4 1 running t sne with different perplexity values using different perplexity values can substantially change the t sne visualization patterns wattenberget al 2016 in the original t sne paper van der maaten and hinton 2008 used five datasets to compare the performance of t sne and the size of the datasets ranged from 400 to 10 000 they stated that the performance of sne is fairly robust to changes in the perplexity and typical values are between 5 and 50 our literature review indicates that 30 and 50 are two commonly used perplexity values for datasets with hundreds to thousands of samples table 1 to explore the impacts of perplexity on clustering analyses of groundwater geochemistry t sne was conducted with different perplexity values for all three datasets fig 9 illustrates results from the jianghan plain groundwater dataset while the results from the oslo transect and taiyuan karst water datasets are shown in figs s9 and s10 respectively in the supplementary information file van der maaten and hinton 2008 reported stable t sne results for 5 perp 50 this was true for the oslo transect dataset with 350 samples as well as for the jianghan plain groundwater data with 1 184 samples fig 9 shows that with the perplexity values in the range from 20 to 50 similar patterns were observed in the t sne visualizations for perp 10 local variations within each cluster dominated and too many clusters were returned for perp 300 the samples could not be separated into distinct clusters because perplexity is a priori unknown for most real world problems it must be determined in conjunction with hca a small perplexity value should be assigned when sample size is small for the 14 samples of xmk in the taiyuan karst water dataset as shown in fig s4 perp 1 yielded three groups for perp 1 the three groups started mixing into one based on our experience of applying t sne to the three datasets rather than using the range of 5 perp 50 the range should be n 200 perp n 10 where n is number of samples 4 2 three dimensional t sne visualization t sne can map high dimensional data to any number e g two or three of lower dimensions and a three dimensional t sne visualization may be more useful than a two dimensional t sne visualization for visually determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships we explored this for the oslo transect dataset for which the theoretical number of clusters and cluster memberships are known fig 10 a shows the three dimensional t sne visualization based on a perplexity value of 20 that was used to generate the two dimensional t sne visualization shown in fig 3 a although cluster overlaps are observed in fig 10 a these were simply caused by plotting the three dimensional figure on a two dimensional paper rotating the three dimensional figure shows that the nine clusters for the nine plant materials were well separated in the three dimensional t sne visualization in comparison with the two dimensional visualization shown in fig 3 a the three dimensional visualization in fig 10 a does not add value to cluster analysis because the nine clusters were equally well separated in the two figures after rotating the three dimensional figure this can be explained by examining the kullback leibler divergence the cost function eq 8 minimized during a t sne run the kullback leibler divergence measures discrepancy between the joint probability distributions p and q in high and low dimensional spaces respectively a smaller value of the kullback leibler divergence indicates that p and q are closer to each other fig 10 b shows convergence of the kullback leibler divergence for generating the two and three dimensional t sne visualizations of the oslo transect dataset the figure shows that the kullback leibler divergence converged to a similar value but the two dimensional t sne run converged substantially faster than the three dimensional t sne run this case study for the oslo transect dataset suggested that it was unnecessary to generate the three dimensional t sne visualization it was also the case for the other two datasets considered in this study because their corresponding two dimensional t sne visualizations sufficiently separated the hca clusters three dimensional or higher t sne visualizations may be useful when two dimensional t sne visualizations cannot separate hca clusters and the kullback leibler divergence may be an indicator for when three dimensional t sne visualizations are needed 5 conclusions this study for the first time applied t sne as a graphic approach to assist hca cluster analysis and delineation of spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results the application of hca pca and t sne to the three geochemical datasets leads to the following major conclusions 1 in comparison with pca t sne was a better graphical way to assist hca cluster analysis with respect to determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships the t sne visualization outperformed the pca visualization to separate the clusters determined by hca 2 in comparison with the conventional way of delineating spatial zones based on clustering results t sne is a promising tool for effectively and efficiently delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry because t sne maintains pair wise distances and structures in the high dimensional data space to the extent possible in the low dimensional t sne space 3 hca clustering results may differ from t sne grouping results because the two methods are based on different theories it is recommended to use t sne as a graphic way to support hca cluster analysis not to use t sne alone for cluster analysis because t sne visualization depends substantially on perplexity that is unknown for real world problems 4 although t sne developers recommended constraining perplexity to within 5 50 a substantially smaller perplexity i e 1 was appropriate for this small geochemical dataset with only tens of samples based on our experience we suggest setting perplexity within the range of n 200 n 10 where n is number of samples t sne cannot be used as a standalone algorithm for cluster analysis and can only be used as a graphic approach to assist clustering methods such as hca and k means there remains room to improve t sne for general applications for example measures other than euclidian distance or kernels other than gaussian could be used to estimate similarities between geochemical samples these are warranted in a future study

4581,cluster analysis is a valuable tool for understanding spatial and temporal patterns e g spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry to determine cluster numbers and cluster memberships that are unknown in real world problems a number of methods have been used to assist cluster analysis among which graphic approaches are popular and intuitive this study introduced for the first time the t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne method as a graphic approach to assist cluster analysis for groundwater geochemistry data the hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied to original groundwater geochemistry data and t sne was used to help determine the number of cluster and cluster memberships afterward t sne was used to help delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry the t sne based cluster visualization was compared to the visualization based on principal component analysis pca by applying hca pca and t sne to three geochemical datasets oslo transect taiyuan karst water and jianghan plain groundwater datasets which are characterized by different number of samples and features collected across different space and time scales we found that t sne outperformed pca to assist hca as a promising tool for helping determine the number of hca clusters and delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry it should be noted that t sne alone cannot be used for cluster analyses partly because t sne visualization depends on a hyperparameter called perplexity that is a priori unknown for real world problems the perplexity values used in this study were determined empirically and a small value of 0 1 was used for the taiyuan karst water dataset with 14 samples for the other two datasets with hundreds of samples the corresponding perplexity values were 20 and 30 within the range of 5 50 commonly used in t sne keywords statistical analysis geochemical zones dimension reduction cluster validity principal component analysis 1 introduction groundwater resources may be effectively and efficiently protected if spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater geochemistry are understood especially in light of variable future conditions that will change according to climate population expansion and decreasing freshwater availability cloutier et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 gorelick and zheng 2015 green et al 2011 zhu et al 2020 groundwater geochemistry is affected by both natural processes and anthropogenic activities with broad variability in space and time especially at the regional scale güler and thyne 2004b haile and fryar 2017 tóth 1999 2009 discovering spatio temporal patterns and further delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry is a primary goal of hydrogeochemical studies güler et al 2012 nguyen et al 2015 yang et al 2020 this goal is complicated because groundwater geochemical datasets are multivariate in nature one groundwater sample has multiple physical chemical and biological features while multiple samples are collected at various locations and times to understand the spatio temporal patterns embedded in a groundwater geochemistry dataset cluster analyses have been used to separate the dataset into a number of clusters each of which has similar groundwater geochemistry that reflects the controlling processes of groundwater quality gan et al 2018 güler and thyne 2004a b pacheco castro et al 2018 pant et al 2018 templ et al 2008 cluster analysis addresses two fundamental questions 1 how many clusters are appropriate i e cluster numbers and 2 how are individual groundwater samples assigned to a cluster i e cluster memberships because neither the number of clusters nor cluster memberships are known a priori cluster analyses must be evaluated evaluation can be as simple as mapping the locations of clusters or by applying statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca for the convenience of visualizing pca results in two dimensional graphs high dimensional geochemical data are always projected onto two principal components e g pc1 vs pc2 where pc standing for principal component it has been found that pca plots are not always successful at distinguishing clustered data and overlaps between clusters are constantly observed making clear interpretation challenging in the review article by templ et al 2008 wherein cluster analysis was applied to regional geochemical data a question arose is there a graphical way to evaluate the stability or validity of clusters this study was motivated to answer this question this study introduced the t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne method as a new graphical technique to support cluster analysis the t sne method developed by van der maaten and hinton 2008 is a state of the art machine learning technique for dimensionality reduction to visualize high dimensional data the method has been used in many research fields such as gene expression aizarani et al 2019 dobie et al 2019 kobak and berens 2019 tumor classification abdelmoula et al 2016 roche et al 2018 hyperspectral imaging analysis melit devassy and george 2020 pouyet et al 2018 and fault diagnosis zheng et al 2018 zheng and zhao 2020 recently there have been several studies using t sne for visualization of geochemical and hydrological data balamurali and melkumyan 2016 used t sne for dimension reduction and found that t sne outperformed other dimension reduction methods e g pca kernel pca and locally linear embedding for visualizing patterns of shape trend embedded in large geological assay datasets balamurali et al 2019 further applied different clustering algorithms to reduced dimensions produced by t sne such as self organizing map and spanning tree progression analysis of density normalized events leung et al 2019 conducted a similar research to apply the spectral clustering algorithm to t sne reduced dimensions and they further linked clustering results to a consensus matrix obtained from multiple t sne runs and spectral clustering classifications for detecting outliers in a geochemical dataset horrocks et al 2019 used random forest methods to select 11 out of 31 elements for separating unaltered and altered host rock specimens and then used t sne to validate the selection of the 11 elements mazher 2020 applied t sne to a large dataset generated by a hydrologic model that produces 9 variables over 273 time steps the high dimensions of 2 457 9 273 was reduced to two dimensions using four methods i e pca generative topographic mapping t sne and uniform manifold approximation and projection mazher 2020 concluded that the latter two methods outperformed the former two methods for visualizing spatial patterns of the modeling results to the best of our knowledge t sne has not been used to assist cluster analysis for groundwater geochemistry data this study tackled the following two questions that have not been attempted by the groundwater hydrology community 1 can t sne be used as a graphical method to assist cluster analyses with respect to determining the number of clusters 2 can t sne be used as a tool to delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results in response to the first question we used t sne in conjunction with hierarchical cluster analyses hca in hca one way to determine the number of clusters is to subjectively place the so called phenon line at a linkage distance which is discussed in section 2 adjusting the phenon line upward or downward changes the number of clusters determining the appropriate number of clusters requires additional lines of evidence such as geochemical analysis using piper or stiff plots appelo and postma 2005 yang et al 2020 the appropriate number of clusters can also be determined by using various statistical methods and the elbow method average silhouette method and the gap statistic method kassambara 2017 explored in this study this study focused on the pca method which produces two dimensional visualization of the clustered data pca visualizations however are often not ideal because data of one cluster may significantly overlap data of another cluster in this work we illustrated that t sne outperformed pca when visualizing clustered geochemical data in the two dimensional t sne visualization to answer the second question about delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results the conventional approach is to first plot cluster data on a map and then examine the resulting spatial distribution of the clusters to determine spatial zones while considering the geological hydrogeological and geochemical information relevant to the site of interest a drawback of this approach is that when a series of samples are collected over time at a sampling location it is impossible to plot the data series on the map and one has to either incorporate the statistics of the data or discard certain data samples for example in the study of yang et al 2020 because groundwater samples collected at one well belonged to different clusters in different years the clusters of the majority samples were used to delineate spatial zones this problem is intrinsically resolved when using t sne because it reduces high dimensional data to low dimensions and can use all data for delineating spatial zones without discarding any data an example of doing so was given by mazher 2020 who used t sne to visualize a dataset comprising nine variables simulated at 273 time steps on a two dimensional plot more importantly when t sne visualizes high dimensional data on a reduced set of dimensions pair wise distances and structures in the high dimensional data space are maintained to the extent possible in the low dimensional t sne space therefore t sne by default is suitable for delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry a feature that has not received adequate attention to explore the two questions discussed above t sne was applied to three geochemical datasets the oslo transect the taiyuan karst water and the jianghan plain groundwater datasets with different sample sizes and dimensions i e the number of geochemical features the oslo transect dataset included geochemical data of nine plant materials e g different species or leaves wood bark of birch and spruce collected at 40 sites reimann et al 2007 because it is theoretically known that the dataset can be divided into nine clusters each for one plant material this dataset was used to benchmark t sne s capability of assisting hca it should be noted that this dataset is not suitable for spatial zone delineation because the sampling sites were along a transect and the nine samples corresponding to nine plant materials were collected from the same sites the taiyuan karst water dataset of ma et al 2011 was used not only to assist hca but also to evaluate t sne s ability to delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry the evaluation was possible because ma et al 2011 divided the groundwater system into three sub systems and further delineated three groundwater geochemistry zones e g a recharge and flow through zone a cold water discharge zone and a thermal water discharge zone for each subsystem the jianghan plain groundwater dataset of yang et al 2020 was used in the same manner as the taiyuan karst water dataset except that the former dataset is substantially more complicated than the latter dataset in terms of dimensionality and spatial and temporal scales over which the data were collected the jianghan plain groundwater dataset can better evaluate t sne s capability of both assisting cluster analysis and spatial zone delineation for regional aquifers in this study hca pca and t sne analyses were applied to the three geochemical datasets hca was used as the basis for the cluster analysis and pca and t sne were used as graphic means of evaluating the hca determined number of clusters and cluster memberships for this purpose t sne outperformed pca for all three datasets because t sne provides better visualizations of clustered data we demonstrated that t sne is an effective and efficient graphical way to assist cluster analysis with respect to determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships it is also a promising tool for delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results however since t sne was not designed for cluster analysis we suggest using t sne only as a graphical way to assist hca based cluster analyses t sne visualization strongly depends on a hyperparameter called perplexity that is a priori unknowable for real world problems 2 geochemistry data and statistical methodologies 2 1 three geochemical datasets the oslo transect dataset includes 360 samples of nine different plant materials collected at 40 sites along a 120 km transect crossing oslo norway templ et al 2008 the nine plant materials are terrestrial moss mos fern fer european mountain ash leaves rog birch leaves bil bark bba and wood bwo and spruce needles sne twigs twi and wood stw details of the samples element concentrations of the sample and quality control of the concentrations are available see reimann et al 2007 the dataset used in this analysis was downloaded from the r package rrcov developed by todorov and filzmoser 2010 available at https cran r project org web packages rrcov index html accessed 2 20 2021 the dataset includes concentrations of 24 elements ag as b ba ca cd co cr cu fe hg k la mg mn mo ni p pb s sb sr ti and zn and loss on ignition for 350 samples concentrations of ten samples are missing in this dataset the oslo transect dataset comprises 350 25 8 750 measurements it is known theoretically that these data can be separated into nine clusters one for each plant materials because different plants uptake nutrients in different ways and variously partition those elements between wood leaves and bark templ et al 2008 this logical result of nine clusters makes the dataset suitable as a benchmark to evaluate the potential of using t sne to evaluate cluster analyses the taiyuan karst water dataset ma et al 2001 consists of 37 samples of cold water temperature 30 and thermal karst groundwater from taiyuan city china and the locations of the samples are shown in fig 1 for each sample a total of 31 geochemical parameters were analyzed including 3 physiochemistry variables temperature ph and ec nine major elements co3 2 hco3 f cl no3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 and na 4 minor elements k fe si and sr and 15 trace elements as ag al b ba cd co cu hg li mn mo ni sb and zn therefore the dataset has a total of 37 31 1 147 measurements based on site specific information related to structural geology hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry the karst groundwater system was divided into three sub systems as follows the dongshan mountain karst groundwater subsystem dmk the beishan mountain karst groundwater subsystem bmk and the xishan mountain karst groundwater subsystem xmk ma et al 2011 further grouped samples of dmk into three zones recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone and thermal water discharge zone samples of bmk into three zones recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone at the margin of the mountain and cold water discharge zone in buried karst zone and samples from xmk into three zones recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone and thermal water discharge zone generally speaking the groundwater geochemistry evolved from the recharge and flow through zone toward the cold water discharge zones and further to the thermal water discharge zones in fig 1 the samples collected from the dmk bmk and xmk subsystems are denoted by squares circles and triangles respectively within each subsystem the samples in the recharge and flow through zone cold water discharge zone and thermal water discharge zone are highlighted in black blue and red colors respectively the dataset and geochemical analysis of ma et al 2011 facilitate an evaluation of the potential for t sne to assist cluster analysis for hundreds of groundwater geochemical data and to delineate groundwater geochemical zones at the scale of tens of kilometers the jianghan plain groundwater dataset used in our previous study of yang et al 2020 includes 1 184 groundwater samples collected over 23 years 1992 2014 from 29 monitoring wells drilled into the middle confined aquifer of jianghan plain china fig 2 each sample has 11 geochemical parameters ph ca2 mg2 k na cl so4 2 hco3 nh4 f and fe and the dataset has a total of 1 184 11 13 024 measurements yang et al 2020 conducted cluster and hydrogeochemical analyses for this large dataset and delineated seven clusters and four groundwater geochemical zones of the regional aquifer i e recharge zone i transition zone ii flow through zone iii and discharge mixing zones zone iv fig 2 this large dataset and the four delineated zones enable us to evaluate the effectives of t sne in assisting cluster analysis for tens of thousands of groundwater geochemical data and in delineating groundwater geochemical zones at the scale of hundreds of kilometers 2 2 data preprocessing preprocessing geochemical data before conducting cluster analysis is always necessary templ et al 2008 ellefsen et al 2014 the three datasets were pre processed by 1 geochemical feature selection 2 substitution of censored data 3 screening missing values 4 data transformation and 5 standardization the first step defines appropriate parameters for cluster analysis a geochemical parameter may be excluded if one or more of the following conditions is met 1 the parameter is not continuously measured over time i e the parameter values are not reported for many sampling campaigns resulting in a large number of missing values 2 the parameter is closely related to other parameters e g alkalinity can be computed by using ph and hco3 according to appelo and postma 2005 and 3 40 of measurements are censored data that are either less than or greater than a detection limit sanford et al 1993 if censored data exist for a selected geochemical parameter further data preprocessing is required this study used a simple approach to replace the censored values with 3 4 of the detection limit for less than conditions and 4 3 of the upper limit for greater than conditions sanford et al 1993 for the issue of missing values samples that contain missing values are removed afterward the natural log transformation was applied to the datasets and the z score standardization subtracting the data mean and dividing the residuals by data standard deviation was applied to the transformed data to remove the impacts of data units and scales reimann and filzmoser 2000 templ et al 2008 it however should be noted that the use of substitution method and log transformation is simple but may not be ideal as they may skew the distribution of the data and hamper the statistical analysis reimann and filzmoser 2000 sanford et al 1993 2 3 hca and pca statistical analyses the hca and pca statistical methods are described briefly here and a more thorough description is available in statistical books e g rencher 2003 hca with the ward method ward 1963 as an agglomerative approach starts by treating each sample as its own cluster and merges the clusters stepwise to generate larger clusters ending with one cluster containing all samples at each successive step clusters are merged according to the ward criterion with the smallest increase of sum of squared errors sse for cluster al with nl observations ss e a l i 1 n l o i o 2 where oi i 1 2 nl is the i th observation in the cluster o is the mean of all observations in the cluster and o i o 2 is the squared euclidean distance between oi and o at the beginning of hca there are n clusters for n samples and sse of each cluster is zero in the next step all possible cluster combinations are considered and sse is calculated for each combination for the case that clusters a and b are merged into cluster c the sse changes to δ s s e s s e c s s e a s s e b in the ward method the two clusters that yield the smallest δ s s e are merged the merging continues until only one cluster remains when the variance of clusters is minimized in such a way the merging history is recorded in a dendrogram whose horizontal axis is for all the samples and the vertical axis shows the linkage distances defined as 2 δ s s e between the merged clusters the number of clusters is determined by placing the phenon line at a linkage distance and one needs to carefully evaluate whether the number of clusters is appropriate by using various approaches among which pca is a popular one pca is a dimension reduction technique that performs a linear mapping of high dimensional space to a lower dimensional space with the variance of the low dimensional data maximized pca reduces data dimensionality and allows focusing on a few new combinatorial components that describe a large portion of the variance in the data ouyang 2005 in pca the covariance matrix of the high dimensional variables is evaluated and then the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalues the principal components are used to reconstruct a significant fraction of the variance of the high dimensional data in the context of using pca to assist cluster analysis the first two principal components or any two selected principal components can be used to generate a two dimensional graph to visualize the high dimensional data and to examine whether the assigned cluster number is reasonable generally speaking data in one cluster should be close to one another but are maximally separated from data in any other clusters on the two dimensional plot 2 4 sne and t sne methods the t sne algorithm is an improved variation of stochastic neighbor embedding sne developed by hinton and roweis 2002 the first task of sne is to convert the distance between two points in a high dimensional space to a conditional probability that represents the similarity of the two points in the high dimensional space and then to match the conditional probability between two points data points in the high dimensional space to the conditional probability between two points map points in a low dimensional space the conditional probability p j i between data points xi and xj is the probability that xi would pick xj as its neighbor and pi i 0 by definition the conditional probability is defined using a gaussian kernel p j i exp x i x j 2 2 σ i 2 k i exp x i x k 2 2 σ i 2 where x i x j is the euclidean distance between data points xi and xj the variance σ i 2 of the gaussian kernel is calculated using a binary search such that the entropy h p i j p j i log 2 p j i of the probability distribution over all the data points is equal to log2 perp where perp is the user specified perplexity in the low dimensional space sne computes a similar conditional probability for map points yi and yj corresponding to the two data points xi and xj using another gaussian kernel with variance equaling 1 2 q j i exp y i y j 2 i k exp y i y k 2 and qi i 0 by definition the conditional probabilities pj i and qj i should be equal if the map points yi and yj exactly represent the similarity between the high dimensional data points xi and xj sne thus arranges map points in the low dimensional space to minimize the discrepancy between pj i and qj i measured by the kullback leibler divergence considering all data points the cost function to be minimized is c i k l p i q i i j p j i log p j i q j i where p i is the conditional probability distribution of data point xi over all other data points and q i is the conditional probability distribution of map point yi over all other map points the cost function is minimized through various optimization methods such as gradient descent sne was further developed into t sne by van der maaten and hinton 2008 with two major improvements one was to use a symmetric version of sne to estimate pairwise similarities in the both high and low dimensional spaces for data points xi and xj t sne introduces p ij p j i p i j 2 n as the probability that xi would pick xj as its neighbor such that pij pji the symmetric property where n is the number of data points the other improvement was to use a student s t distribution rather than a gaussian kernel to compute the similarity between map points so that the map points are more scattered in low dimensional space strictly speaking for map points yi and yj in low dimensional space t sne uses a heavy tailed t distribution with one degree of freedom to compute q ij 1 y i y j 2 1 k l 1 y k y l 2 1 which is the probability that yi would pick yj as its neighbor again qij qji as a symmetric property correspondingly the cost function becomes c k l p q i j p ij log p ij q ij where p and q are the joint probability distributions in high and low dimensional spaces respectively perplexity is the most important hyperparameter in the t sne method there are other important hyperparameters such as learning rate and number of iterations used in gradient descent optimization a small perplexity corresponds to a small σ i 2 used in eq 3 which results in selecting a data pair xi and xj with small distance a large perplexity corresponds to a large σ i 2 which can pair data at large distances in the extreme case of perp xi would pick any point as its neighbor with the equal possibility of 1 n 1 with n being the number of data points a commonly used perplexity is 30 and a typical range is 5 50 van der maaten and hinton 2008 argued that performance of sne is fairly robust to changes in the perplexity this study explored the effects of perplexity on t sne performance for the three geochemical datasets and found that a smaller perplexity should be used for small sample sizes with unknown perplexity values t sne was used in this study as a visualization tool to assist hca and this is empirically described below step 1 conduct hca to determine the number of clusters and cluster memberships based on the best understanding of the problem of interest and or appropriate statistical methods step 2 assign different colors to different clusters e g red for cluster 1 and blue for cluster 2 the colors will be used in step 4 below step 3 conduct t sne with different perplexity values the t sne runs are independent of the hca in step 1 step 4 for each perplexity value plot the samples in a two dimensional t sne space with samples highlighted in the colors determined in step 1 for example if a sample belongs to cluster 1 it will be plotted in red step 5 examine the spatial patterns of the colored samples in the t sne plots to determine which perplexity value yields the best results according to the following two criteria a whether samples of the same cluster are close to each other and b whether the samples of different clusters are maximally separated step 6 if the visual examination in step 5 yields satisfactory results for one perplexity value likely for multiple perplexity values it confirms that the cluster number and membership determined in step 1 are reasonable otherwise it is necessary to adjust the cluster number and memberships in step 1 and to repeat steps 2 4 and 5 there is no need to repeat the t sne runs in step 3 this procedure indicates that t sne is not use as a stand alone algorithm for cluster analysis but as a visualization tool to assist cluster analysis for determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships all the statistical analyses were performed using python 3 7 and hca pca and t sne were implemented using the python libraries scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 https scikit learn org stable index html and scipy jones et al 2001 https www scipy org the codes and the datasets used in this study are available at https github com jyangfsu geochemical t sne 3 results and discussion 3 1 cluster analysis for oslo transect dataset because it is known theoretically that the oslo transect dataset should be separated into nine clusters one for each plant material this information was used to evaluate the potential of using t sne to assist cluster analysis delineation of spatial zones of geochemistry was not attempted for this dataset because the sampling sites were along a transect and the nine samples corresponding to nine plant materials were collected from the same sites given that data preprocessing was completed by reimann et al 2007 and todorov and filzmoser 2010 the dataset used by todorov and filzmoser 2010 was used directly in this study fig 3 a illustrates the two dimensional t sne visualization of the oslo transect dataset with perp 20 which yields the best visualization the t sne plot shows that the nine plant material clusters are distinct and without overlap this separation is consistent with the hca results fig 3 c plots the dendrogram of the hca using the ward method with euclidian distance placing the phenon line at a linkage distance of 18 results in nine clusters corresponding almost completely to the nine plant materials indicating that t sne provides a graphic way to evaluate validity of clusters pca does not yield such a consistent graphic validation as shown in fig 3 b which is the two dimensional pca visualization using the same color scheme of fig 3 a fig 3 b shows substantial overlaps between the clusters indicating that pca is not as adept as t sne for graphically validating the nine hca based clusters it is noted that while hca misclassified one sample with an index of x id 134 in the oslo transect dataset of rog into the fer cluster fig 3 c this did not occur to t sne because discrepancy between t sne and hca results is not uncommon it is worth analyzing the reasons fig 4 a plots the hca dendrogram for clusters rog c5 and fer c6 cluster rog is further separated into two clusters b 1 and b 2 and fer into four clusters b 3 b 6 the misclassified sample x id 134 of rog is denoted as cluster a in hca cluster a was merged with cluster b 4 not with b 1 or b 2 as explained in section 2 3 hca initially treats each sample as an individual cluster and proceeds to merge the two closest clusters until only a single cluster remains if cluster a is merged with cluster b 1 or b 2 the increase in sse is 7 17 or 6 06 larger than the increase of 5 35 upon merging clusters a and b 4 as a result the sample x id 134 of rog was assigned to cluster fer because of the smaller increase in sse this is consistent with hca theory because sse does not consider distances between samples instead sse considers distances between the sample and centers of other clusters this differs from t sne which is based on distance between paired data points or map points fig 4 b shows the probability of sample x id 134 picking another sample in clusters b 1 b 6 as its neighbor according to eq 6 the probability is substantially higher for samples in cluster b 2 of rog which explains why sample x id 134 was assigned to rog by t sne fig 3a because t sne and hca are based on different theories it is not surprising that the two methods yield different results for certain samples although the nine groups of samples shown in the t sne visualization fully agree with the theoretically known number of sample groups and group memberships it should be noted that t sne alone cannot be used for cluster analysis because the visualizations strongly depend on perplexity see section 4 because both perplexity and the number of clusters are unknown in practice the oslo transect dataset is a special case with known number of clusters we only recommend using t sne in conjunction with hca because the theoretical number of clusters is known for the oslo transect dataset it is an opportunity to evaluate the effects of alternative transformations we applied the box cox transformation as an alternative to the log transformation to the 24 elements and the loss on ignition of the oslo transect dataset the histograms of the log transformed data are plotted in fig s1 and the histograms of the box cox transformed data are plotted in fig s2 in the supplementary information file the box cox transformation was conducted by using the box cox function of scipy and the resulted λ values are shown in fig s2 the lilliefors test was used to examine normality of the transformed data lilliefors 1967 and the p values are shown in figs s1 and s2 the results of the lilliefors test show that neither of the two transformations yield data following normal distributions although the results of the box cox transformation are slightly closer to the normal distribution than the results of the log transformation pca analysis was applied to the log transformed and box cox transformed data and the results are plotted in fig s3 the similar visualization patterns in this figure indicate that the two transformations have negligible effects on the pca results the hca and t sne were also applied to the box cox transformed data and the results are plotted in fig s4 the figure shows that the performance of the box cox transformation is worse than that of the log transformation in that there are more samples misclassified as shown in fig s4 a for the box cox transformed data we also evaluated other statistical methods that have been used to assist cluster analysis for determining the appropriate number of clusters they are the elbow silhouette and gap statistic methods and a description of the methods is given in text s1 of the supplementary information file the results of the three methods are shown in fig 5 while the elbow and silhouette methods indicated that optimal cluster number was 2 the gap statistic values monotonically increased and the optimal number of clusters was 16 by using the rule of one standard error it was surprising that all three methods failed to yield the correct number of clusters this is also the case for the taiyuan karst water dataset and the jianghan plain groundwater dataset the results for these two datasets are shown in figs s5 and s6 exploring the reasons is beyond the scope of this study but it is warranted in future studies 3 2 cluster analysis and spatial zone delineation for taiyuan karst water dataset the taiyuan karst water dataset was subject to a t sne analysis to support hca clustering results and to delineate spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry the results of ma et al 2011 were used a reference for the evaluation by following the preprocessing procedure described in section 2 2 parameter co3 2 was excluded from the dataset because all its measurements were less than the detection limit in addition ten samples were removed because of missing measurements ultimately fourteen samples in xmk seven in bmk and six in dmk were used in this study due to the small sample size for the bmk and dmk subsystems only the results of xmk are presented and discussed below the results of hca pca and t sne for bmk and dmk data are shown in fig s7 of the supplementary information file fig 6 a is the two dimensional t sne visualization using perp 0 1 of the 14 geochemical samples collected from the xmk sub system the three clusters shown in fig 6 a correspond exactly to the three clusters shown in fig 6 c by placing the phenon line at a linkage distance of 11 comparing the t sne visualization to the pca visualization shown in fig 6 b revealed that t sne outperformed pca when graphically validating the clustering results for the samples collected from the xml sub system denoted by triangles in fig 1 the three clusters shown in fig 6 a for t sne visualization agreed with the three groundwater geochemistry zones identified by ma et al 2011 and shown in fig 1 to facilitate a visual comparison the three clusters and the three spatial zones were distinguished using the same color scheme i e black for the recharge and flow through zone blue for the cold water discharge zone and red for the thermal water discharge zone the only disagreement between the clusters and the spatial zones was for sample rn32 because the sample s temperature was 30 c it should have belonged to the thermal water discharge zone fig 1 however both hca and t sne misclassified the sample into the cold water discharge zone because the sample s so4 2 concentration is 172 mg l about one order of magnitude less than the concentrations of other samples in the thermal water discharge zone but about the same order of magnitude as the concentrations of the samples in the cold water discharge zone 3 3 cluster analysis and spatial zone delineation for jianghan plain groundwater dataset the jianghan plain groundwater dataset has 1 184 samples collected over 23 years 1992 2014 from 29 monitoring wells distributed throughout a regional aquifer at the scale of hundreds of kilometers the 13 024 geochemical measurements pre processed by yang et al 2020 were used in this study fig 7 a shows that by drawing the phenon line at a linkage distance of 25 the 1 184 samples were grouped into seven clusters denoted as c1 c7 fig 7 b is the two dimensional pca visualization of the seven clusters while the seven clusters were generally separated there were substantial overlaps especially for c5 c7 the overlaps were substantially decreased in the two dimensional t sne visualization shown in fig 7 c for example the dots of c5 c7 were mostly separated demonstrating that t sne outperformed pca fig 7 c shows that t sne divided c4 and c7 each into two sub clusters the same results were obtained by moving the phenon line down from the linkage distance of 24 fig 7 a to that of 22 fig 7 d the two sub clusters of c4 were denoted as c4s1 and c4s2 and the two sub cluster of c7 as c7s1 and c7s2 fig 7 e and 7 f are the corresponding pca and t sne visualizations respectively for the nine clusters the overlap shown in fig 7 b is also observed in fig 7 e comparing the pca based visualization and the t sne based visualization indicates that t sne was a better visualization tool for the reduced dimensions the investigation on whether it is reasonable to have seven or nine clusters started with c7s1 and c7s2 of the 50 samples comprising c7s1 39 were from well j1 fig s8 a of the 33 samples in c7s2 31 were from well j8 fig s8 b as shown in fig 2 well j1 was located in the recharge zone zone i with limited water rock interaction while well j8 was located in the transition zone zone ii it appears reasonable to separate the data from the two wells into two clusters based on their locations this was also supported by examining the groundwater geochemistry of the two clusters the box plots of 11 groundwater geochemical parameters in fig 8 a indicate that the concentrations of k nh4 and fe were substantially lower in c7s1 than in c7s2 and that the concentrations of mg2 na cl and hco3 were substantially higher in c7s1 than in c7s2 the differences between the two clusters may justify separation of c7 into c7s1 and c7s2 part of the difference may be explained by the impacts of the yangtz river on the groundwater samples in c7s2 wherein 31 out of 33 samples were from well j8 which was only 200 m from the river yang et al 2020 found that river water recharged groundwater in the area where well j8 was located and li et al 2014 reported that the mean concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 of the river water were 37 16 6 77 and 126 89 mg l respectively which were lower than the groundwater concentrations groundwater geochemistry of well j8 reflected the mixing of river water and groundwater and this may explain why the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 were substantially lower in c7s2 than in c7s1 separation of c7 into c7s1 and c7s2 inspired by the t sne visualization helped better understand groundwater geochemistry subject to groundwater and surface water interactions the geochemical reasons that c4 was separated into c4s1 and c4s2 were not fully understood yang et al 2020 found that c4 had high so4 2 concentrations caused by anthropogenic activities and this was true for both c4s1 and c4s2 as shown in fig 8 b however the 62 samples of c4s1 were from 16 wells fig s8 c while the 57 samples of c4s2 were from only nine wells with 40 out of the 57 samples from well j9 fig s8 d as a result the concentration ranges of the geochemical parameters except ph nh4 and fe were larger in c4s1 than in c4s2 as shown in fig 8 b this finding however was not useful for better understanding groundwater geochemistry in the jianghan plain aquifer t sne visualization is a promising tool for delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry at the regional scale the two dimensional t sne visualization of fig 7 f shows three zones denoted as a b and c that correspond to zones i iv delineated by yang et al 2020 and shown in fig 2 zone a of cluster c7s2 corresponds to zone i the recharge zone zone b of clusters c5 c6 and c7s1 corresponds to zone ii the transition zone zone c of clusters c1 and c2 corresponds to zones iii and iv the flow through zone and discharge mixing zone respectively zones iii and iv were separated by yang et al 2020 to reflect the impacts of the three gorges dam on the groundwater geochemistry observed at well j21 this separation was supported by the t sne visualization because clusters c1 and c2 were broadly separated although yang et al 2020 delineated the four zones of groundwater geochemistry without using t sne visualization the delineation would have been more obvious if t sne visualization had been used for example yang et al 2020 first determined the clusters that the majority of the samples belonged to and then mapped the locations of the wells and their corresponding clusters based on which zone delineation was made the two steps could be simplified into a single step by examining the zone patterns revealed by the t sne visualization in fig 7 f the samples from c3 c4s1 and c4s2 were not used for zone delineation because they were impacted by anthropogenic actives for example the samples in c3 were from well j10 located at one of the largest pesticide factories in china and the samples were characterized by extremely high concentrations of na and cl due to wastewater infiltration from the factory to the aquifer of the 62 samples in c4s1 15 were from well j25 located in a water supply plant while 10 samples were from well j8 about 300 m away from a cotton mill fig s2 c of the 57 samples in c4s2 40 were from well j9 located near another cotton mill fig s2 d it is interesting that the impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality are unambiguously revealed on the t sne visualization 4 discussion 4 1 running t sne with different perplexity values using different perplexity values can substantially change the t sne visualization patterns wattenberget al 2016 in the original t sne paper van der maaten and hinton 2008 used five datasets to compare the performance of t sne and the size of the datasets ranged from 400 to 10 000 they stated that the performance of sne is fairly robust to changes in the perplexity and typical values are between 5 and 50 our literature review indicates that 30 and 50 are two commonly used perplexity values for datasets with hundreds to thousands of samples table 1 to explore the impacts of perplexity on clustering analyses of groundwater geochemistry t sne was conducted with different perplexity values for all three datasets fig 9 illustrates results from the jianghan plain groundwater dataset while the results from the oslo transect and taiyuan karst water datasets are shown in figs s9 and s10 respectively in the supplementary information file van der maaten and hinton 2008 reported stable t sne results for 5 perp 50 this was true for the oslo transect dataset with 350 samples as well as for the jianghan plain groundwater data with 1 184 samples fig 9 shows that with the perplexity values in the range from 20 to 50 similar patterns were observed in the t sne visualizations for perp 10 local variations within each cluster dominated and too many clusters were returned for perp 300 the samples could not be separated into distinct clusters because perplexity is a priori unknown for most real world problems it must be determined in conjunction with hca a small perplexity value should be assigned when sample size is small for the 14 samples of xmk in the taiyuan karst water dataset as shown in fig s4 perp 1 yielded three groups for perp 1 the three groups started mixing into one based on our experience of applying t sne to the three datasets rather than using the range of 5 perp 50 the range should be n 200 perp n 10 where n is number of samples 4 2 three dimensional t sne visualization t sne can map high dimensional data to any number e g two or three of lower dimensions and a three dimensional t sne visualization may be more useful than a two dimensional t sne visualization for visually determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships we explored this for the oslo transect dataset for which the theoretical number of clusters and cluster memberships are known fig 10 a shows the three dimensional t sne visualization based on a perplexity value of 20 that was used to generate the two dimensional t sne visualization shown in fig 3 a although cluster overlaps are observed in fig 10 a these were simply caused by plotting the three dimensional figure on a two dimensional paper rotating the three dimensional figure shows that the nine clusters for the nine plant materials were well separated in the three dimensional t sne visualization in comparison with the two dimensional visualization shown in fig 3 a the three dimensional visualization in fig 10 a does not add value to cluster analysis because the nine clusters were equally well separated in the two figures after rotating the three dimensional figure this can be explained by examining the kullback leibler divergence the cost function eq 8 minimized during a t sne run the kullback leibler divergence measures discrepancy between the joint probability distributions p and q in high and low dimensional spaces respectively a smaller value of the kullback leibler divergence indicates that p and q are closer to each other fig 10 b shows convergence of the kullback leibler divergence for generating the two and three dimensional t sne visualizations of the oslo transect dataset the figure shows that the kullback leibler divergence converged to a similar value but the two dimensional t sne run converged substantially faster than the three dimensional t sne run this case study for the oslo transect dataset suggested that it was unnecessary to generate the three dimensional t sne visualization it was also the case for the other two datasets considered in this study because their corresponding two dimensional t sne visualizations sufficiently separated the hca clusters three dimensional or higher t sne visualizations may be useful when two dimensional t sne visualizations cannot separate hca clusters and the kullback leibler divergence may be an indicator for when three dimensional t sne visualizations are needed 5 conclusions this study for the first time applied t sne as a graphic approach to assist hca cluster analysis and delineation of spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry based on clustering results the application of hca pca and t sne to the three geochemical datasets leads to the following major conclusions 1 in comparison with pca t sne was a better graphical way to assist hca cluster analysis with respect to determining the number of clusters and cluster memberships the t sne visualization outperformed the pca visualization to separate the clusters determined by hca 2 in comparison with the conventional way of delineating spatial zones based on clustering results t sne is a promising tool for effectively and efficiently delineating spatial zones of groundwater geochemistry because t sne maintains pair wise distances and structures in the high dimensional data space to the extent possible in the low dimensional t sne space 3 hca clustering results may differ from t sne grouping results because the two methods are based on different theories it is recommended to use t sne as a graphic way to support hca cluster analysis not to use t sne alone for cluster analysis because t sne visualization depends substantially on perplexity that is unknown for real world problems 4 although t sne developers recommended constraining perplexity to within 5 50 a substantially smaller perplexity i e 1 was appropriate for this small geochemical dataset with only tens of samples based on our experience we suggest setting perplexity within the range of n 200 n 10 where n is number of samples t sne cannot be used as a standalone algorithm for cluster analysis and can only be used as a graphic approach to assist clustering methods such as hca and k means there remains room to improve t sne for general applications for example measures other than euclidian distance or kernels other than gaussian could be used to estimate similarities between geochemical samples these are warranted in a future study

4582,water inflow into a tunnel is usually estimated by assuming that the flow follows the linear darcy s law however fluid flow in fractured rock aquifers is prone to deviation from darcy s law and gives rise to nonlinear flow phenomena due to significant inertial losses this non darcian effect is seldom considered when evaluating water inflow into the tunnel in a fractured rock aquifer in this study we investigated an analytical method for predicting water inflow into a tunnel considering the non darcian effect a series of numerical simulations for water inflow into a tunnel were conducted with different combinations of parameters where non darcian flow was considered and characterized by the forchheimer s law based on the numerical results and an ingenious parameter integration method a semi empirical model was developed to analytically predict water inflow into a tunnel where the flow is under non darcian flow regime the semi empirical model includes the classic theoretical formula for predicting water inflow and the forchheimer equation for describing non darcian flow in this context the non darcian effect on water inflow into a tunnel can be quantitatively estimated this developed model has a concise expression satisfying dimensional consistency with the parameters having sound physical meanings and it can be successfully reduced to the classic formula under the darcy flow regime the validity of this semi empirical model was confirmed by numerical results showing a high fidelity in predicting water inflow into a tunnel by means of this proposed model the error induced by neglecting non darcian effect was estimated for a large number of real engineering cases which rapidly increased as a power function with the magnitude of water inflow into the tunnel the necessity of considering the non darcian effect when calculating water inflow was thus proven especially for massive tunnel gushing the proposed model and the method used in this study can provide guidance for accurately predicting water inflow into a tunnel under a complex non darcian flow regime keywords fractured rock water inflow tunnel non darcian flow semi empirical equation 1 introduction many engineering activities involve tunnels where water inflow is a challenging issue during the whole process of design construction and operation chen et al 2020 kaufmann and romanov 2020 kong 2011 li et al 2013 nikvar hassani et al 2018 overestimating water inflow into a tunnel leads to an overconservative design of the drainage system zhang et al 2020c while an underestimate would lead to serious geological disasters such as mechanical instability bizjak and petkovsek 2004 zhang et al 2015 and mud and water inrush li et al 2017 as well as secondary destruction of the ecological environment cheng et al 2019a preisig et al 2014 therefore an accurate estimation of water inflow into the tunnel is of great importance for both economic efficiency and engineering safety due to its importance substantial efforts have been devoted to predicting water inflow into a tunnel analytically el tani 2003 park et al 2008 empirically su et al 2017 and numerically chen et al 2020 kaufmann and romanov 2020 goodman et al 1964 first derived a steady state analytical equation for predicting water inflow into a circular tunnel based on which many modified or upgraded models have been developed to consider more complicated conditions for example perrochet 2005 proposed an analytical solution to calculate the transient discharge rate into a tunnel during progressive drilling moon and fernandez 2010 provided analytical methods for estimating groundwater inflow taking into account water table drawdown in a jointed rock mass ying et al 2018 developed a semi analytical equation for water inflow considering the properties of linings on the basis of rock mass quality classification many empirical methods such as site groundwater rating sgr and tunnel inflow classification tic have also been proposed to determine water inflow into tunnels using hydrogeological and engineering geological information nikvar hassani et al 2018 compared with analytical and empirical models the recently developed simulation methods are more flexible and can be applied to calculate water inflow in more complex situations especially for cases with geological structures such as faults and karst caves chen et al 2020 kaufmann and romanov 2020 moon and jeong 2011 despite the flexibility of the simulation method the analytical method cannot be fully replaced by the simulation method this is not only because the simulation method needs good knowledge of the hydrogeological setting perrochet 2005 but also because the prediction of water inflow into a tunnel must be efficient in case of emergency kong 2011 li et al 2013 time consuming simulation modeling is obviously impractical when water inrush accidents occur and a fast estimation of water inflow for treatment decisions needs to be conducted the analytical approach is thus preferred and is indispensable in practical applications especially in the early design stage of the tunnel and in a water inrush emergency farhadian and nikvar hassani 2018 in addition like all analytical methods the analytical models can usually provide us with a deeper understanding of the physical processes some studies have reviewed the analytical models quantifying water inflow into a tunnel farhadian and nikvar hassani 2018 park et al 2008 su et al 2017 tan et al 2018 and a summary of the state of the art based on these studies is provided in table 1 focusing on comparing the different aspects considered in these models according to table 1 a systematic development has been made for analytical models in the literature which involves different medium types homogeneous or heterogeneous porous or fractured media various tunnel structures different tunnel sections linings grouting and flexible water level boundary conditions constant water table or drawdown constant total head or zero water pressure around the tunnel circumference despite all these models the flow regime is rarely considered in the literature as most analytical models assume that the flow follows darcy s law however this is not always the case especially for tunnels in fractured rock aquifers chen et al 2020 quinn et al 2020 zhang 2017 non darcian flow behavior where doubling the pressure gradient does not produce a doubled flow rate has been widely observed in fractured rocks at both laboratory zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2019a zimmerman et al 2004 and field scales chen et al 2015b quinn et al 2011 zhang 2017 this nonlinear flow behavior is ascribed to a nonnegligible inertial effect with increasing flow velocity cardenas et al 2009 zou et al 2015 which is prone to occur in fractured rock due to local fracture roughness liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 how to incorporate this common non darcian effect into the analytical models for water inflow into a tunnel whether this non darcian effect makes a difference for actual tunnel projects all these equations remain open issues the main purpose of this study is to incorporate the non darcian effect into analytical models and estimate this effect on water inflow into tunnels for actual engineering projects to reach this goal we systematically investigated water inflow into the tunnel of a fractured rock aquifer where the flow presents non darcian behavior a series of numerical simulations of water inflow into the tunnel were conducted with different combinations of parameters in the framework of non dacian flow characterized by the forchheimer s law according to these numerical results a semi empirical model for predicting water inflow into the tunnel was developed based on the classic theoretical formula and a non darcian effect factor this semi empirical model was further verified by a new set of numerical simulations and is discussed in terms of its applicability and extension by means of this developed model the possible errors induced by neglecting the non darcian effect in practical situations were evaluated in a series of real engineering cases reported in the literature and a karst tunnel project with detailed engineering geological data 2 methodology 2 1 classic theoretical formula for water inflow into a tunnel the most widely used conceptual model for water inflow into a tunnel is a circular tunnel in a semi infinite homogenous aquifer with a horizontal water table as shown in fig 1 based on this model and darcy s law a classic theoretical formula for water inflow into a tunnel can be developed el tani 2003 kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 1 q 2 π k λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ where q m2 s is the flux flowing into the tunnel per unit tunnel length k m s is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer λ is a dimensionless parameter defined as h r h r 2 1 h m is the water head above the tunnel illustrated in fig 1 and r m is the tunnel radius it should be noted that eq 1 is derived with the tunnel boundary condition of zero water pressure illustrated in fig 1 referring to a situation in which the tunnel drains the aquifer this analytical equation provides a general form for water inflow into the tunnel and has a large field of applicability el tani 2003 kolymbas and wagner 2007 for deep tunnels where h r eq 1 can be further simplified as 2 q 2 π k h ln 2 h r eq 2 is also a widespread model included in industry norms for predicting water inflow into a tunnel and it was derived by goodman et al 1964 using the image well method 2 2 governing equation of non darcian flow in fractured rock for simplicity and convenience of use it is usually assumed that the flow obeys darcy s law with the features illustrated in the inset of fig 1 when calculating the water inflow into the tunnel however this linear flow is only valid for creeping flow dominated by viscous forces which is achieved in idealized geometries and at low flow velocities bear 1972 chaudhary et al 2011 due to the local roughness of rock fractures with increasing water pressure lee et al 2014 zhou et al 2019c non darcian flow behavior with the features illustrated in the inset of fig 1 has been widely observed in fractured rock aquifers chen et al 2020 quinn et al 2011 this nonlinear flow behavior can be described well by a zero intercept quadratic equation known as the forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 moutsopoulos et al 2009 zhou et al 2019b zimmerman et al 2004 3 h 1 k v β g v v where h m and v m s are the water head and velocity vector respectively β 1 m is called the forchheimer coefficient and g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity the first and second terms on the right side of eq 3 describe the energy losses due to viscous and inertial dissipations respectively the forchheimer equation in the form of eq 3 shows excellent performance in characterizing non darcian flow behavior for both porous and fractured media chaudhary et al 2011 chen et al 2015a zeng and grigg 2006 from a practical point of view the forchheimer equation can be applied over the entire range of flow velocities as it adaptively reduces to darcy s law at low velocities if the quadratic term is neglected javadi et al 2014 and it describes the fully developed turbulent regime at high velocities if the linear term is neglected tzelepis et al 2015 although the forchheimer equation was first empirically established based on gas flow experiments through coalbeds by forchheimer 1901 its theoretical background has also been adequately discussed irmay 1958 ruth and ma 1992 2 3 incorporation of non darcian effect into the theoretical formula the linearity of darcy s law makes the transformation relatively easy during the derivation of analytical formulas for water inflow into a tunnel however this situation becomes difficult when the flow becomes non darcian and follows the nonlinear forchheimer s law eq 3 farhadian and nikvar hassani 2018 this nonlinearity would make some formula manipulations during the model derivation difficult or even impossible to avoid this complicated formula derivation we incorporated the non darcian effect into the classic theoretical formula by introducing a non darcian effect factor and calibrating this factor with a series of non darcian flow simulations the form of the analytical model considering the non darcian effect can thus be written as 4 q 2 π k f λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ where f is the non darcian effect factor this strategy highly generalizes the effect of non darcian flow on the water inflow by simply multiplying eq 1 by a factor f even so when the analytic solution considering the non darcian effect is not yet available introducing a modified factor f is practical and effective for estimating the water inflow into the tunnel a similar strategy is also widely used to derive analytical models for complex situations when explicit theoretical analytic expressions are not available heuer 1995 su et al 2017 factor f quantitatively describes the effect of non darcian flow on water inflow into the tunnel where a value larger than 1 indicates that the water inflow is promoted and otherwise it is suppressed as listed in table 1 many variables impact the water inflow into the tunnel and correspondingly determine the value of f here to derive a more general formula the variables concerning the medium permeability k and β and water level h have been chosen to shape the factor f the principle of selecting these variables is that they must be available and have universality and typicality for all tunnel cases the variable selection method in this study is reasonable and is performed without loss of generality as all the water inflows into the tunnel are primarily determined by these two aspects table 1 after selecting the key variables the analytical expression of factor f is expected to be developed by testing the dependence relationships between f and these variables it is worth mentioning that for more complicated situations more variables can be introduced to shape f in the same way adopted in this study 2 4 conceptual numerical model of non darcian flow into a tunnel a conceptual model 3000 m 1000 m involving a tunnel with a 4 m radius was developed as shown in fig 2 note that this is a quasi three dimensional model for non darcian flow simulations as the 10 m distance was stretched in the xoz plane a series of tunnel locations were built in the conceptual model to consider the effect of h the lateral and top boundaries were set with a constant head boundary to form a horizontal water table while the bottom front and rear boundaries of the model were assumed to be impermeable the tunnel wall was set as the seepage boundary satisfying signorini s complementarity condition to make the tunnel drain the aquifer chen et al 2011 these boundary settings are consistent with the assumptions for deriving the classic theoretical formula in section 2 1 the forchheimer equation is incorporated in the continuity equation v 0 of seepage flow to consider the non darcian effect in this context the final governing equations of the non darcian flow simulation can be derived by introducing a dimensionless forchheimer number fo given as 5 k 1 f o h 0 where fo is defined as kβ v g javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 when β 0 fo is zero and eq 5 reduces to the classical governing equation of darcy flow the governing equation eq 5 with the boundary conditions mentioned above was solved with the finite element method the finite element calculation scheme for this numerical simulation was derived and provided in appendix a a first order lagrange interpolation function was adopted for the numerical model and the flow domain was spatially discretized using an 8 node hexahedral element the tunnel boundary was refined with a finer element size 0 1 m to precisely capture the water inflow into the tunnel while the interior of the domain was discretized using a relatively coarse element size 1 0 m as illustrated in the inset of fig 2 the total number of elements was more than 240 000 the validity of the code used to conduct the non darcian flow simulations was also verified by the water flow through a cylinder which has an exact analytical solution as provided in appendix b different combinations of k β h were adopted for the water flow simulations to test the dependence of the non darcian effect factor and further establish the model for predicting water inflow into a tunnel under the non darcian flow regime this combination followed the control variable method i e for each group of numerical simulations one parameter was varied while the other two remained unchanged three cases a b and c of parameters k β h were designed and within each case there were three groups the details are provided in table 2 it should be noted that the parameter combinations for k and β are not arbitrary and are restricted by the 95 prediction bounds proposed by zhou et al 2019b this indicates that for a specific k the value of β should fall within an upper and lower limit and the design of the parameter scheme in table 2 follows this law a detailed introduction to these 95 prediction bounds for the k β combination can be found in zhou et al 2019b 3 results 3 1 dependencies of non darcian effect factor by changing the key parameters the dependencies of the non darcian effect factor f can be hypothesized for each simulation the value of f was calculated backwards using eq 4 with the simulated q the results for case a with three groups of β are present in fig 3 all the values of f are less than 1 indicating that the non darcian effect reduces the water inflow into the tunnel the value of f in each group decreases monotonically with k meaning that for a specific water head and forchheimer coefficient the larger the value of k is the greater the reduction in water inflow into the tunnel compared with the darcy inflow this is ascribed to the fact that a larger k indicates a higher conductivity of the fractured rock and correspondingly results in high flow velocity with significant inertial losses such inertial losses finally contribute to the reduction in water inflow into the tunnel according to the trends of the data points in fig 3 a hyperbolic function was adopted to characterize the dependence of f on k for each group which is given by 6 f k 1 m n k α eq 6 showed good performance in describing the variation in f with k fig 3 with the coefficient of determination r 2 of all three groups close to 1 0 9991 0 9994 the fitted coefficients for the curves in fig 3 are given as follows group 1 with β 5 0 108 m 1 m 1 0074 n 1 023 105 α 1 2957 group 2 with β 5 0 109 m 1 m 1 0091 n 6 274 105 α 1 3255 group 3 with β 5 0 1010 m 1 m 1 0073 n 1 994 106 α 1 2945 it seems that the coefficients m near constant 1 and α near constant 1 305 in eq 6 are irrelevant to β considering that changing the value of β leads to a shift in the curve in fig 3 the coefficient n is thus a function of β this curve shift in fig 3 makes it possible to separate the variables k and β when formularizing f therefore the incorporation of β in eq 6 is required to collapse the data of the three groups in fig 3 case b with varying β provides a clue to this collapse interestingly the dependence of f on β is similar to that on k as shown in fig 4 the increasing reduction in f with β is due to the fact that β describes how easy it is for the flow to develop into the non darcian flow regime zhou et al 2015 zimmerman et al 2004 the larger the value of β is the more likely the non darcian flow resulting in reduced water inflow into the tunnel in the same way a hyperbolic function fits the variation of f with β very well with r 2 0 9985 0 9992 and it is given by 7 f β 1 m n β η the fitted coefficients for the curves in fig 4 are given as follows group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s m 1 0002 n 6 794 10 8 η 0 6545 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s m 1 0072 n 3 793 10 9 η 0 6496 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s m 1 0060 n 1 300 10 10 η 0 6605 similarly coefficients m near constant 1 and η near constant 0 66 in eq 7 are irrelevant to k clearly k has an effect on the coefficient n which is multiplied by βη at this point the dependence of f on parameters k and β is formulated however for cases a and b the water head h is set as constant 200 m therefore the dependence of f on h has to be investigated further to obtain a closed form solution the dependence of f on h was studied based on the numerical simulations of case c as shown in fig 5 f seems insensitive to h as there is only a slight decrease in f as h increases the decrease in f with h is ascribed to the increasing h improving the hydraulic gradient level and thus promoting significant non darcian flow the insensitivity of f to h is partially due to the fact that h cannot vary by orders of magnitude as k and β can in real situations nevertheless a linear relationship between f and h can be clearly observed in fig 5 8 f h a b h where the fitted coefficients of fig 5 are given as follows group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s β 1 0 1010 m 1 a 0 8840 b 0 00030 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s β 8 0 1011 m 1 a 0 8999 b 0 00026 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s β 5 0 1013 m 1 a 0 9257 b 0 00018 the variations in coefficients a and b for different groups are ascribed to the effect of k and β 3 2 semi empirical model establishment the dependence of f on key parameters k β h is investigated individually in section 3 1 and further parameter integration needs to be conducted to collapse all the data in figs 3 5 according to the correlation analysis of the fitted coefficients in eqs 6 8 a new expression of f integrating the three key parameters is proposed 9 f k β h c 1 c 2 h 1 λ k α β η eq 9 was adopted to fit all the data in figs 3 5 by means of the origin software with the levenberg marquardt lm optimization algorithm it is worth mentioning that for complicated situations with many variables the multiple regression analysis method proposed by farhadian and katibeh 2017 can be referenced the determined coefficients of eq 9 are c 1 1 0578 c 2 2 87 10 4 λ 0 2394 α 1 3417 and η 0 6640 this integrated equation can describe the variation in f with k β h well having an r 2 of 0 9987 note that the coefficients determined in section 3 1 are optimized locally for each case whereas the coefficients determined in eq 9 are optimized globally for all the cases as with all empirical equations a shortcoming associated with eq 9 is its inconsistent dimensions to solve this problem dimensional analysis was conducted based on the particular value of the fitted α and η in eq 9 considering that α 1 3417 approaches 4 3 and η 0 6640 approaches 2 3 we can rearrange eq 9 into 10 f k β h c 1 c 2 h 1 λ k 4 3 β g 2 3 note that the acceleration of gravity g in eq 10 is introduced to maintain dimensional consistency the coefficients in eq 10 are further calibrated using the data in figs 3 5 where c 1 1 0608 c 2 2 89 10 4 and λ 1 0259 with r 2 0 9986 the dimensional consistency in the denominator of eq 10 is successfully obtained by the above strategy however overall dimensional inconsistency still exists for eq 10 due to the parameter h in the numerator fortunately in the numerator of eq 10 the second term 2 89 10 4 h is much smaller than the first term 1 0608 therefore we can further simplify eq 10 by omitting c 2 h and setting c 1 1 11 f k β h 1 1 λ k 4 3 β g 2 3 where λ 1 0137 and r 2 0 9979 which is calibrated again using the data in figs 3 5 considering that λ 1 we thus set this coefficient to 1 in the following model development eq 11 with λ 1 is plotted as a function of k and β to show the sensitivity of f fig 6 with the simulated results marked as red solid points increasing either k or β would cause a rapid decrease in f fig 6 which indicates suppressed water inflow into the tunnel compared with the darcy inflow given that both k and β are intrinsic properties of the fractured rock the non darcian effect for water inflow into the tunnel is also mainly determined by these intrinsic properties substituting eq 11 into eq 1 with λ 1 a new semi empirical model for predicting water inflow into the tunnel can be finally developed 12 q 2 π k 1 k 4 3 β g 2 3 λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ this semi empirical model has the advantage of dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic darcy model eq 1 when β 0 as an analytical model for considering the non darcian effect eq 12 contains a very important parameter i e the forchheimer coefficient β as revealed by many studies a higher value of β indicates that the non darcian flow is more significant at the same hydraulic gradient zimmerman et al 2004 zhou et al 2015 according to this developed model a higher value of β indicates a smaller water inflow into the tunnel this is consistent with the fact that the non darcian effect can reduce the water inflow into a tunnel chen et al 2020 the simulated water inflow into a tunnel using the parameter scheme in table 2 was compared with that predicted by eq 12 as plotted in fig 7 a red solid points to synthetically verify the performance of this semi empirical model a series of non darcian flow simulations with new supplementary parameter combinations were also conducted table 3 marked with blue solid points in fig 7a note that all the water inflows in fig 7 are normalized by the darcy inflow calculated by eq 1 and this normalized water inflow is thus equal to the non darcian effect factor f the fitted slope in fig 7a 1 0005 shows that the water inflows predicted by eq 12 agree well with all simulated ones indicating the high fidelity of the proposed model in addition the simulated results with new parameter combinations are illustrated as f in fig 6 blue solid points and they fit well with the surface of the semi empirical equation this fit proves the validity of the developed formula again the developed semi empirical model is established using the non darcian effect factor calculated by eq 11 which removes the effect of h from eq 10 this simplification results in a slight deviation of the value predicted using the semi empirical model from the actual water inflow i e the simulated data as indicated by the horizontally distributed data points in fig 7a note that these horizontally distributed data points refer to the cases with varying h and fixed k and β this deviation can be removed by replacing eqs 11 with 10 when developing the semi empirical model and the predictive ability using this replacement is provided in fig 7b for comparison even so there is no obvious difference in the performance between fig 7a and b we thus recommend the form in eq 12 in practical applications due to its dimensional consistency 4 discussions 4 1 extendibility of the semi empirical model the classic theoretical formula in eq 1 serves as the foundation of the semi empirical model developed in this study therefore the validity of this semi empirical model should also satisfy the assumptions of the classic theoretical formula such as steady state flow a horizontal water table and a circular tunnel however the semi empirical model proposed in this study can be easily extended to other situations based on the transformation form of the classic theoretical formulas in these situations such as transient flow inclined water tables drawdown lined tunnels noncircular tunnels and heterogeneous aquifers el tani 2003 perrochet and dematteis 2007 su et al 2017 ying et al 2018 the method adopted for these extensions is no different from that used in this study another foundation of the developed semi empirical model is the forchheimer equation which characterizes non darcian flow behavior as the forchheimer s law is also suitable for porous media zeng and grigg 2006 sidiropoulou et al 2007 the semi empirical model can be applied to porous aquifers in addition as mentioned in section 2 2 the forchheimer equation applies to the whole flow regime including darcy and turbulent flow therefore correspondingly the semi empirical model can be applied to darcy and turbulent situations as the governing equation the forchheimer s law introduced one more parameter than the darcy s law which requires more information to determine its parameters k β specifically a series of flow tests under different hydraulic gradients are needed for the forchheimer equation eq 3 to conduct curve fitting for deriving k β whereas the darcy equation only needs one flow test to calculate its parameter k fortunately this shortcoming can be made up by some parameterized formulas of β sidiropoulou et al 2007 zhou et al 2019b which can predict β using k without conducting a series of flow tests it is worth mentioning that there are some other forms of the constitutive equation to characterize the nonlinear relationship between hydraulic gradient and flux for non darcian flow such as the cubic polynomial equation nowamooz et al 2009 and the power function zhang and nemcik 2013 however unlike the forchheimer equation the parameters of these equations lack clear physical meanings which greatly hinders the popularization and use of these equations the theoretical part of the semi empirical model results from the classic theoretical formula and the forchheimer s law while the empirical part comes from the integration of key parameters unlike the linear darcy s law the nonlinear forchheimer s law makes the formula manipulations complicated or even impossible which obstructs the derivation of exact explicit and theoretical analytical formulas for water inflow into a tunnel nevertheless from a pragmatic perspective the semi empirical model proposed in this study is accurate enough to predict the water inflow into a tunnel considering the non darcian effect from a theoretical perspective further efforts can be made to derive the exact analytical formula for water inflow into a tunnel by incorporating the forchheimer s law similar to deriving the classic theoretical formula using darcy s law 4 2 error evaluation in real engineering cases the semi empirical model in the form of eq 12 provides a way to quantitatively estimate the effect of non darcian flow on water inflow into the tunnel according to this equation ignoring the non darcian effect would overestimate the water inflow into a tunnel to provide intuitive insight the water inflow into a tunnel in 24 real engineering cases was analyzed to show how important it is to consider the non darcian effect among these tunnel projects the geological engineering conditions of the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels from the jiayan water diversion project are introduced in detail below while the data on the other tunnels were collected from the literature the main information on these tunnels is listed in table 4 including the tunnel radius water level seepage parameters and reference the jiayan water diversion project was designed for water supply irrigation and power generation and is located in guizhou province in southwest china chen et al 2020 this project involves a total of 227 7 km of tunnels where the maochang 15 70 km and shuidaqiao 20 36 km tunnels are the main deeply buried segments with a buried depth of 50 445 m as shown in fig 8 both the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels pass through moderately developed karst formations which are mainly composed of soluble limestone and dolomite and contain small amounts of sandstone mudstone and other insoluble rocks figs 8 and 9 in addition highly pervious geological features including faults red lines in fig 8 and underground rivers cyan lines in fig 8 are well developed in this region considering the abundant groundwater in this area water inrush is one of the major geological problems for the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels it should be noted that compared with the branch tunnel of the shuidaqiao tunnel investigated by chen et al 2020 the main tunnels of the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels analyzed in this study are more deeply buried and are more prone to non darcian flow due to high water heads borehole packer tests along the tunnels indicated that the groundwater flow in this region is in the non darcian flow regime chen et al 2020 as is expected in most karst regions for the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels a series of borehole packer tests were conducted under different injection pressures to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and forchheimer coefficient of these formations detailed information on the packer tests and parameter estimation can be found in chen et al 2020 as a representative the location with the largest water head above the tunnel for each formation was adopted for the water inflow analysis these locations are marked in fig 9 pink lines and recorded in table 4 note that the groundwater table blue lines in fig 9 was derived based on the boreholes marked in fig 9 and geological survey for the other tunnels collected from the literature if only the information of hydraulic conductivity k was reported without the forchheimer coefficient β the universal model proposed by zhou et al 2019b was adopted to determine the value of β this universal model can predict β using k by a power law relationship β wk 3 2 which was established based on the compilation of a large amount of k β data in the literature note that this compilation involves more than 4000 geologic media from both laboratory and field scales and it covers all possible combinations of k β in real problems by means of this universal model the maximum possible value of β for a specific k was determined in each engineering case where the information on β was lacking listed in table 4 similarly only the largest water head above the tunnel was adopted for calculating the water inflow for these tunnels collected from the literature the water inflow into the tunnel was calculated by the proposed semi empirical model using parameters k β h for these 24 real engineering cases to quantitatively evaluate the possible error induced by neglecting the non darcian effect the relative error e is defined as 13 e q darcy q non darcian q non darcian 100 where q darcy and q non darcian are the water inflows calculated by eqs 1 and 12 respectively the e estimated with the corresponding water inflow is illustrated in fig 10 where the maximum relative error is nearly 300 in these 24 real engineering cases the relative error of the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels reported in this study reaches 102 54 orange bars in fig 10 note that the water inflow in fig 10 refers to q non darcian the relative error generally increased with the magnitude of water inflow in these 24 real engineering cases to quantitatively investigate this relationship the variation in e with the water inflow is plotted in fig 11 showing that e depends closely on q via a power function this power function indicates that the error induced by neglecting the non darcian effect increases rapidly with the magnitude of water inflow into the tunnel there is a theoretical basis for this variation as a larger magnitude of water inflow means a greater inertial loss of the flow at the microscale and a correspondingly more significant non darcian effect at the macroscale finally resulting in a larger deviation from the darcy result these evaluation analyses based on the 24 real engineering cases confirm the necessity of considering the non darcian effect when calculating the water inflow into a tunnel especially for tunnels with large water inflows 5 conclusions this paper investigated the prediction of water inflow into tunnels in fractured rock aquifers where the flow is characterized as a non darcian flow regime first a non darcian effect factor was introduced to consider the non darcian effect in the classic theoretical formula for calculating water inflow into the tunnel a series of tunnel gushing simulations were conducted implemented by the finite element method based on the forchheimer constitutive equation based on these simulations the dependence of the non darcian effect factor on key parameters was systematically investigated with the control variate method which was shown to be sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity and forchheimer coefficient by means of an ingenious parameter integration the non darcian effect factor was successfully formulated using key parameters a semi empirical model was subsequently established by using the formulated factor and calibrating its coefficients which can predict water inflow into a tunnel considering the non darcian effect this proposed semi empirical model incorporating the classic theoretical formula and the forchheimer s law has a concise expression following dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic theoretical formula under the darcy flow regime the validity of this proposed semi empirical model was confirmed by the results of non darcian flow simulations according to this semi empirical model the maximum possible error induced by neglecting the non darcian effect was evaluated in 24 real engineering cases this error was found to rapidly increase as a power function with the magnitude of water inflow into a tunnel these engineering case analyses thus proved the necessity of considering the non darcian effect when calculating the water inflow into a tunnel especially for tunnels with large water inflows further efforts should be made to extend this semi empirical model to more complicated hydrogeological conditions credit authorship contribution

of the finite element model and h λ is the adaptive penalized heaviside function used to eliminate the numerical instability and mesh dependence chen et al 2011 for darcy flow fo 0 the conductivity matrix k is a constant and thus these equations can be solved directly however for non darcian flow in this situation k is a variable related to the velocity since fo is dependent on the velocity in this context an iterative method was adopted to solve these equations in this study appendix b the validity of the code used for non darcian flow simulation was verified by the water flow through a cylinder where the exact analytical solution is available for non darcian flow in this simple model the dimensions of this cylinder are shown in fig a1 with a finite element mesh where the hydraulic conductivity and forchheimer coefficient of this cylinder are 1 10 6 m s and 1 0 1012 m 1 respectively the wall around the cylinder was set as an impermeable boundary while the upper and lower surfaces were prescribed with a water head difference h driving the flow from top to bottom non darcian flow simulations were conducted using the developed code with a series of hydraulic gradients j defined as the ratio of the water head difference h to the cylinder length l according to forchheimer eq 3 the average flux q downstream in such a boundary setting can be written analytically as a4 q v a g g 2 4 g β k 2 j 2 β k π r 2 where a is the cross sectional area the average flux was also evaluated directly from the results of the numerical simulations as shown in fig a2 the simulated flux fit very well with the analytical flux under all hydraulic gradients demonstrating the high accuracy of the developed code for non darcian flow simulation 
4582,water inflow into a tunnel is usually estimated by assuming that the flow follows the linear darcy s law however fluid flow in fractured rock aquifers is prone to deviation from darcy s law and gives rise to nonlinear flow phenomena due to significant inertial losses this non darcian effect is seldom considered when evaluating water inflow into the tunnel in a fractured rock aquifer in this study we investigated an analytical method for predicting water inflow into a tunnel considering the non darcian effect a series of numerical simulations for water inflow into a tunnel were conducted with different combinations of parameters where non darcian flow was considered and characterized by the forchheimer s law based on the numerical results and an ingenious parameter integration method a semi empirical model was developed to analytically predict water inflow into a tunnel where the flow is under non darcian flow regime the semi empirical model includes the classic theoretical formula for predicting water inflow and the forchheimer equation for describing non darcian flow in this context the non darcian effect on water inflow into a tunnel can be quantitatively estimated this developed model has a concise expression satisfying dimensional consistency with the parameters having sound physical meanings and it can be successfully reduced to the classic formula under the darcy flow regime the validity of this semi empirical model was confirmed by numerical results showing a high fidelity in predicting water inflow into a tunnel by means of this proposed model the error induced by neglecting non darcian effect was estimated for a large number of real engineering cases which rapidly increased as a power function with the magnitude of water inflow into the tunnel the necessity of considering the non darcian effect when calculating water inflow was thus proven especially for massive tunnel gushing the proposed model and the method used in this study can provide guidance for accurately predicting water inflow into a tunnel under a complex non darcian flow regime keywords fractured rock water inflow tunnel non darcian flow semi empirical equation 1 introduction many engineering activities involve tunnels where water inflow is a challenging issue during the whole process of design construction and operation chen et al 2020 kaufmann and romanov 2020 kong 2011 li et al 2013 nikvar hassani et al 2018 overestimating water inflow into a tunnel leads to an overconservative design of the drainage system zhang et al 2020c while an underestimate would lead to serious geological disasters such as mechanical instability bizjak and petkovsek 2004 zhang et al 2015 and mud and water inrush li et al 2017 as well as secondary destruction of the ecological environment cheng et al 2019a preisig et al 2014 therefore an accurate estimation of water inflow into the tunnel is of great importance for both economic efficiency and engineering safety due to its importance substantial efforts have been devoted to predicting water inflow into a tunnel analytically el tani 2003 park et al 2008 empirically su et al 2017 and numerically chen et al 2020 kaufmann and romanov 2020 goodman et al 1964 first derived a steady state analytical equation for predicting water inflow into a circular tunnel based on which many modified or upgraded models have been developed to consider more complicated conditions for example perrochet 2005 proposed an analytical solution to calculate the transient discharge rate into a tunnel during progressive drilling moon and fernandez 2010 provided analytical methods for estimating groundwater inflow taking into account water table drawdown in a jointed rock mass ying et al 2018 developed a semi analytical equation for water inflow considering the properties of linings on the basis of rock mass quality classification many empirical methods such as site groundwater rating sgr and tunnel inflow classification tic have also been proposed to determine water inflow into tunnels using hydrogeological and engineering geological information nikvar hassani et al 2018 compared with analytical and empirical models the recently developed simulation methods are more flexible and can be applied to calculate water inflow in more complex situations especially for cases with geological structures such as faults and karst caves chen et al 2020 kaufmann and romanov 2020 moon and jeong 2011 despite the flexibility of the simulation method the analytical method cannot be fully replaced by the simulation method this is not only because the simulation method needs good knowledge of the hydrogeological setting perrochet 2005 but also because the prediction of water inflow into a tunnel must be efficient in case of emergency kong 2011 li et al 2013 time consuming simulation modeling is obviously impractical when water inrush accidents occur and a fast estimation of water inflow for treatment decisions needs to be conducted the analytical approach is thus preferred and is indispensable in practical applications especially in the early design stage of the tunnel and in a water inrush emergency farhadian and nikvar hassani 2018 in addition like all analytical methods the analytical models can usually provide us with a deeper understanding of the physical processes some studies have reviewed the analytical models quantifying water inflow into a tunnel farhadian and nikvar hassani 2018 park et al 2008 su et al 2017 tan et al 2018 and a summary of the state of the art based on these studies is provided in table 1 focusing on comparing the different aspects considered in these models according to table 1 a systematic development has been made for analytical models in the literature which involves different medium types homogeneous or heterogeneous porous or fractured media various tunnel structures different tunnel sections linings grouting and flexible water level boundary conditions constant water table or drawdown constant total head or zero water pressure around the tunnel circumference despite all these models the flow regime is rarely considered in the literature as most analytical models assume that the flow follows darcy s law however this is not always the case especially for tunnels in fractured rock aquifers chen et al 2020 quinn et al 2020 zhang 2017 non darcian flow behavior where doubling the pressure gradient does not produce a doubled flow rate has been widely observed in fractured rocks at both laboratory zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2019a zimmerman et al 2004 and field scales chen et al 2015b quinn et al 2011 zhang 2017 this nonlinear flow behavior is ascribed to a nonnegligible inertial effect with increasing flow velocity cardenas et al 2009 zou et al 2015 which is prone to occur in fractured rock due to local fracture roughness liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 how to incorporate this common non darcian effect into the analytical models for water inflow into a tunnel whether this non darcian effect makes a difference for actual tunnel projects all these equations remain open issues the main purpose of this study is to incorporate the non darcian effect into analytical models and estimate this effect on water inflow into tunnels for actual engineering projects to reach this goal we systematically investigated water inflow into the tunnel of a fractured rock aquifer where the flow presents non darcian behavior a series of numerical simulations of water inflow into the tunnel were conducted with different combinations of parameters in the framework of non dacian flow characterized by the forchheimer s law according to these numerical results a semi empirical model for predicting water inflow into the tunnel was developed based on the classic theoretical formula and a non darcian effect factor this semi empirical model was further verified by a new set of numerical simulations and is discussed in terms of its applicability and extension by means of this developed model the possible errors induced by neglecting the non darcian effect in practical situations were evaluated in a series of real engineering cases reported in the literature and a karst tunnel project with detailed engineering geological data 2 methodology 2 1 classic theoretical formula for water inflow into a tunnel the most widely used conceptual model for water inflow into a tunnel is a circular tunnel in a semi infinite homogenous aquifer with a horizontal water table as shown in fig 1 based on this model and darcy s law a classic theoretical formula for water inflow into a tunnel can be developed el tani 2003 kolymbas and wagner 2007 park et al 2008 1 q 2 π k λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ where q m2 s is the flux flowing into the tunnel per unit tunnel length k m s is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer λ is a dimensionless parameter defined as h r h r 2 1 h m is the water head above the tunnel illustrated in fig 1 and r m is the tunnel radius it should be noted that eq 1 is derived with the tunnel boundary condition of zero water pressure illustrated in fig 1 referring to a situation in which the tunnel drains the aquifer this analytical equation provides a general form for water inflow into the tunnel and has a large field of applicability el tani 2003 kolymbas and wagner 2007 for deep tunnels where h r eq 1 can be further simplified as 2 q 2 π k h ln 2 h r eq 2 is also a widespread model included in industry norms for predicting water inflow into a tunnel and it was derived by goodman et al 1964 using the image well method 2 2 governing equation of non darcian flow in fractured rock for simplicity and convenience of use it is usually assumed that the flow obeys darcy s law with the features illustrated in the inset of fig 1 when calculating the water inflow into the tunnel however this linear flow is only valid for creeping flow dominated by viscous forces which is achieved in idealized geometries and at low flow velocities bear 1972 chaudhary et al 2011 due to the local roughness of rock fractures with increasing water pressure lee et al 2014 zhou et al 2019c non darcian flow behavior with the features illustrated in the inset of fig 1 has been widely observed in fractured rock aquifers chen et al 2020 quinn et al 2011 this nonlinear flow behavior can be described well by a zero intercept quadratic equation known as the forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 moutsopoulos et al 2009 zhou et al 2019b zimmerman et al 2004 3 h 1 k v β g v v where h m and v m s are the water head and velocity vector respectively β 1 m is called the forchheimer coefficient and g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity the first and second terms on the right side of eq 3 describe the energy losses due to viscous and inertial dissipations respectively the forchheimer equation in the form of eq 3 shows excellent performance in characterizing non darcian flow behavior for both porous and fractured media chaudhary et al 2011 chen et al 2015a zeng and grigg 2006 from a practical point of view the forchheimer equation can be applied over the entire range of flow velocities as it adaptively reduces to darcy s law at low velocities if the quadratic term is neglected javadi et al 2014 and it describes the fully developed turbulent regime at high velocities if the linear term is neglected tzelepis et al 2015 although the forchheimer equation was first empirically established based on gas flow experiments through coalbeds by forchheimer 1901 its theoretical background has also been adequately discussed irmay 1958 ruth and ma 1992 2 3 incorporation of non darcian effect into the theoretical formula the linearity of darcy s law makes the transformation relatively easy during the derivation of analytical formulas for water inflow into a tunnel however this situation becomes difficult when the flow becomes non darcian and follows the nonlinear forchheimer s law eq 3 farhadian and nikvar hassani 2018 this nonlinearity would make some formula manipulations during the model derivation difficult or even impossible to avoid this complicated formula derivation we incorporated the non darcian effect into the classic theoretical formula by introducing a non darcian effect factor and calibrating this factor with a series of non darcian flow simulations the form of the analytical model considering the non darcian effect can thus be written as 4 q 2 π k f λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ where f is the non darcian effect factor this strategy highly generalizes the effect of non darcian flow on the water inflow by simply multiplying eq 1 by a factor f even so when the analytic solution considering the non darcian effect is not yet available introducing a modified factor f is practical and effective for estimating the water inflow into the tunnel a similar strategy is also widely used to derive analytical models for complex situations when explicit theoretical analytic expressions are not available heuer 1995 su et al 2017 factor f quantitatively describes the effect of non darcian flow on water inflow into the tunnel where a value larger than 1 indicates that the water inflow is promoted and otherwise it is suppressed as listed in table 1 many variables impact the water inflow into the tunnel and correspondingly determine the value of f here to derive a more general formula the variables concerning the medium permeability k and β and water level h have been chosen to shape the factor f the principle of selecting these variables is that they must be available and have universality and typicality for all tunnel cases the variable selection method in this study is reasonable and is performed without loss of generality as all the water inflows into the tunnel are primarily determined by these two aspects table 1 after selecting the key variables the analytical expression of factor f is expected to be developed by testing the dependence relationships between f and these variables it is worth mentioning that for more complicated situations more variables can be introduced to shape f in the same way adopted in this study 2 4 conceptual numerical model of non darcian flow into a tunnel a conceptual model 3000 m 1000 m involving a tunnel with a 4 m radius was developed as shown in fig 2 note that this is a quasi three dimensional model for non darcian flow simulations as the 10 m distance was stretched in the xoz plane a series of tunnel locations were built in the conceptual model to consider the effect of h the lateral and top boundaries were set with a constant head boundary to form a horizontal water table while the bottom front and rear boundaries of the model were assumed to be impermeable the tunnel wall was set as the seepage boundary satisfying signorini s complementarity condition to make the tunnel drain the aquifer chen et al 2011 these boundary settings are consistent with the assumptions for deriving the classic theoretical formula in section 2 1 the forchheimer equation is incorporated in the continuity equation v 0 of seepage flow to consider the non darcian effect in this context the final governing equations of the non darcian flow simulation can be derived by introducing a dimensionless forchheimer number fo given as 5 k 1 f o h 0 where fo is defined as kβ v g javadi et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 when β 0 fo is zero and eq 5 reduces to the classical governing equation of darcy flow the governing equation eq 5 with the boundary conditions mentioned above was solved with the finite element method the finite element calculation scheme for this numerical simulation was derived and provided in appendix a a first order lagrange interpolation function was adopted for the numerical model and the flow domain was spatially discretized using an 8 node hexahedral element the tunnel boundary was refined with a finer element size 0 1 m to precisely capture the water inflow into the tunnel while the interior of the domain was discretized using a relatively coarse element size 1 0 m as illustrated in the inset of fig 2 the total number of elements was more than 240 000 the validity of the code used to conduct the non darcian flow simulations was also verified by the water flow through a cylinder which has an exact analytical solution as provided in appendix b different combinations of k β h were adopted for the water flow simulations to test the dependence of the non darcian effect factor and further establish the model for predicting water inflow into a tunnel under the non darcian flow regime this combination followed the control variable method i e for each group of numerical simulations one parameter was varied while the other two remained unchanged three cases a b and c of parameters k β h were designed and within each case there were three groups the details are provided in table 2 it should be noted that the parameter combinations for k and β are not arbitrary and are restricted by the 95 prediction bounds proposed by zhou et al 2019b this indicates that for a specific k the value of β should fall within an upper and lower limit and the design of the parameter scheme in table 2 follows this law a detailed introduction to these 95 prediction bounds for the k β combination can be found in zhou et al 2019b 3 results 3 1 dependencies of non darcian effect factor by changing the key parameters the dependencies of the non darcian effect factor f can be hypothesized for each simulation the value of f was calculated backwards using eq 4 with the simulated q the results for case a with three groups of β are present in fig 3 all the values of f are less than 1 indicating that the non darcian effect reduces the water inflow into the tunnel the value of f in each group decreases monotonically with k meaning that for a specific water head and forchheimer coefficient the larger the value of k is the greater the reduction in water inflow into the tunnel compared with the darcy inflow this is ascribed to the fact that a larger k indicates a higher conductivity of the fractured rock and correspondingly results in high flow velocity with significant inertial losses such inertial losses finally contribute to the reduction in water inflow into the tunnel according to the trends of the data points in fig 3 a hyperbolic function was adopted to characterize the dependence of f on k for each group which is given by 6 f k 1 m n k α eq 6 showed good performance in describing the variation in f with k fig 3 with the coefficient of determination r 2 of all three groups close to 1 0 9991 0 9994 the fitted coefficients for the curves in fig 3 are given as follows group 1 with β 5 0 108 m 1 m 1 0074 n 1 023 105 α 1 2957 group 2 with β 5 0 109 m 1 m 1 0091 n 6 274 105 α 1 3255 group 3 with β 5 0 1010 m 1 m 1 0073 n 1 994 106 α 1 2945 it seems that the coefficients m near constant 1 and α near constant 1 305 in eq 6 are irrelevant to β considering that changing the value of β leads to a shift in the curve in fig 3 the coefficient n is thus a function of β this curve shift in fig 3 makes it possible to separate the variables k and β when formularizing f therefore the incorporation of β in eq 6 is required to collapse the data of the three groups in fig 3 case b with varying β provides a clue to this collapse interestingly the dependence of f on β is similar to that on k as shown in fig 4 the increasing reduction in f with β is due to the fact that β describes how easy it is for the flow to develop into the non darcian flow regime zhou et al 2015 zimmerman et al 2004 the larger the value of β is the more likely the non darcian flow resulting in reduced water inflow into the tunnel in the same way a hyperbolic function fits the variation of f with β very well with r 2 0 9985 0 9992 and it is given by 7 f β 1 m n β η the fitted coefficients for the curves in fig 4 are given as follows group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s m 1 0002 n 6 794 10 8 η 0 6545 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s m 1 0072 n 3 793 10 9 η 0 6496 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s m 1 0060 n 1 300 10 10 η 0 6605 similarly coefficients m near constant 1 and η near constant 0 66 in eq 7 are irrelevant to k clearly k has an effect on the coefficient n which is multiplied by βη at this point the dependence of f on parameters k and β is formulated however for cases a and b the water head h is set as constant 200 m therefore the dependence of f on h has to be investigated further to obtain a closed form solution the dependence of f on h was studied based on the numerical simulations of case c as shown in fig 5 f seems insensitive to h as there is only a slight decrease in f as h increases the decrease in f with h is ascribed to the increasing h improving the hydraulic gradient level and thus promoting significant non darcian flow the insensitivity of f to h is partially due to the fact that h cannot vary by orders of magnitude as k and β can in real situations nevertheless a linear relationship between f and h can be clearly observed in fig 5 8 f h a b h where the fitted coefficients of fig 5 are given as follows group 1 with k 1 0 10 5 m s β 1 0 1010 m 1 a 0 8840 b 0 00030 group 2 with k 1 0 10 6 m s β 8 0 1011 m 1 a 0 8999 b 0 00026 group 3 with k 1 0 10 7 m s β 5 0 1013 m 1 a 0 9257 b 0 00018 the variations in coefficients a and b for different groups are ascribed to the effect of k and β 3 2 semi empirical model establishment the dependence of f on key parameters k β h is investigated individually in section 3 1 and further parameter integration needs to be conducted to collapse all the data in figs 3 5 according to the correlation analysis of the fitted coefficients in eqs 6 8 a new expression of f integrating the three key parameters is proposed 9 f k β h c 1 c 2 h 1 λ k α β η eq 9 was adopted to fit all the data in figs 3 5 by means of the origin software with the levenberg marquardt lm optimization algorithm it is worth mentioning that for complicated situations with many variables the multiple regression analysis method proposed by farhadian and katibeh 2017 can be referenced the determined coefficients of eq 9 are c 1 1 0578 c 2 2 87 10 4 λ 0 2394 α 1 3417 and η 0 6640 this integrated equation can describe the variation in f with k β h well having an r 2 of 0 9987 note that the coefficients determined in section 3 1 are optimized locally for each case whereas the coefficients determined in eq 9 are optimized globally for all the cases as with all empirical equations a shortcoming associated with eq 9 is its inconsistent dimensions to solve this problem dimensional analysis was conducted based on the particular value of the fitted α and η in eq 9 considering that α 1 3417 approaches 4 3 and η 0 6640 approaches 2 3 we can rearrange eq 9 into 10 f k β h c 1 c 2 h 1 λ k 4 3 β g 2 3 note that the acceleration of gravity g in eq 10 is introduced to maintain dimensional consistency the coefficients in eq 10 are further calibrated using the data in figs 3 5 where c 1 1 0608 c 2 2 89 10 4 and λ 1 0259 with r 2 0 9986 the dimensional consistency in the denominator of eq 10 is successfully obtained by the above strategy however overall dimensional inconsistency still exists for eq 10 due to the parameter h in the numerator fortunately in the numerator of eq 10 the second term 2 89 10 4 h is much smaller than the first term 1 0608 therefore we can further simplify eq 10 by omitting c 2 h and setting c 1 1 11 f k β h 1 1 λ k 4 3 β g 2 3 where λ 1 0137 and r 2 0 9979 which is calibrated again using the data in figs 3 5 considering that λ 1 we thus set this coefficient to 1 in the following model development eq 11 with λ 1 is plotted as a function of k and β to show the sensitivity of f fig 6 with the simulated results marked as red solid points increasing either k or β would cause a rapid decrease in f fig 6 which indicates suppressed water inflow into the tunnel compared with the darcy inflow given that both k and β are intrinsic properties of the fractured rock the non darcian effect for water inflow into the tunnel is also mainly determined by these intrinsic properties substituting eq 11 into eq 1 with λ 1 a new semi empirical model for predicting water inflow into the tunnel can be finally developed 12 q 2 π k 1 k 4 3 β g 2 3 λ 2 1 λ 2 1 h ln λ this semi empirical model has the advantage of dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic darcy model eq 1 when β 0 as an analytical model for considering the non darcian effect eq 12 contains a very important parameter i e the forchheimer coefficient β as revealed by many studies a higher value of β indicates that the non darcian flow is more significant at the same hydraulic gradient zimmerman et al 2004 zhou et al 2015 according to this developed model a higher value of β indicates a smaller water inflow into the tunnel this is consistent with the fact that the non darcian effect can reduce the water inflow into a tunnel chen et al 2020 the simulated water inflow into a tunnel using the parameter scheme in table 2 was compared with that predicted by eq 12 as plotted in fig 7 a red solid points to synthetically verify the performance of this semi empirical model a series of non darcian flow simulations with new supplementary parameter combinations were also conducted table 3 marked with blue solid points in fig 7a note that all the water inflows in fig 7 are normalized by the darcy inflow calculated by eq 1 and this normalized water inflow is thus equal to the non darcian effect factor f the fitted slope in fig 7a 1 0005 shows that the water inflows predicted by eq 12 agree well with all simulated ones indicating the high fidelity of the proposed model in addition the simulated results with new parameter combinations are illustrated as f in fig 6 blue solid points and they fit well with the surface of the semi empirical equation this fit proves the validity of the developed formula again the developed semi empirical model is established using the non darcian effect factor calculated by eq 11 which removes the effect of h from eq 10 this simplification results in a slight deviation of the value predicted using the semi empirical model from the actual water inflow i e the simulated data as indicated by the horizontally distributed data points in fig 7a note that these horizontally distributed data points refer to the cases with varying h and fixed k and β this deviation can be removed by replacing eqs 11 with 10 when developing the semi empirical model and the predictive ability using this replacement is provided in fig 7b for comparison even so there is no obvious difference in the performance between fig 7a and b we thus recommend the form in eq 12 in practical applications due to its dimensional consistency 4 discussions 4 1 extendibility of the semi empirical model the classic theoretical formula in eq 1 serves as the foundation of the semi empirical model developed in this study therefore the validity of this semi empirical model should also satisfy the assumptions of the classic theoretical formula such as steady state flow a horizontal water table and a circular tunnel however the semi empirical model proposed in this study can be easily extended to other situations based on the transformation form of the classic theoretical formulas in these situations such as transient flow inclined water tables drawdown lined tunnels noncircular tunnels and heterogeneous aquifers el tani 2003 perrochet and dematteis 2007 su et al 2017 ying et al 2018 the method adopted for these extensions is no different from that used in this study another foundation of the developed semi empirical model is the forchheimer equation which characterizes non darcian flow behavior as the forchheimer s law is also suitable for porous media zeng and grigg 2006 sidiropoulou et al 2007 the semi empirical model can be applied to porous aquifers in addition as mentioned in section 2 2 the forchheimer equation applies to the whole flow regime including darcy and turbulent flow therefore correspondingly the semi empirical model can be applied to darcy and turbulent situations as the governing equation the forchheimer s law introduced one more parameter than the darcy s law which requires more information to determine its parameters k β specifically a series of flow tests under different hydraulic gradients are needed for the forchheimer equation eq 3 to conduct curve fitting for deriving k β whereas the darcy equation only needs one flow test to calculate its parameter k fortunately this shortcoming can be made up by some parameterized formulas of β sidiropoulou et al 2007 zhou et al 2019b which can predict β using k without conducting a series of flow tests it is worth mentioning that there are some other forms of the constitutive equation to characterize the nonlinear relationship between hydraulic gradient and flux for non darcian flow such as the cubic polynomial equation nowamooz et al 2009 and the power function zhang and nemcik 2013 however unlike the forchheimer equation the parameters of these equations lack clear physical meanings which greatly hinders the popularization and use of these equations the theoretical part of the semi empirical model results from the classic theoretical formula and the forchheimer s law while the empirical part comes from the integration of key parameters unlike the linear darcy s law the nonlinear forchheimer s law makes the formula manipulations complicated or even impossible which obstructs the derivation of exact explicit and theoretical analytical formulas for water inflow into a tunnel nevertheless from a pragmatic perspective the semi empirical model proposed in this study is accurate enough to predict the water inflow into a tunnel considering the non darcian effect from a theoretical perspective further efforts can be made to derive the exact analytical formula for water inflow into a tunnel by incorporating the forchheimer s law similar to deriving the classic theoretical formula using darcy s law 4 2 error evaluation in real engineering cases the semi empirical model in the form of eq 12 provides a way to quantitatively estimate the effect of non darcian flow on water inflow into the tunnel according to this equation ignoring the non darcian effect would overestimate the water inflow into a tunnel to provide intuitive insight the water inflow into a tunnel in 24 real engineering cases was analyzed to show how important it is to consider the non darcian effect among these tunnel projects the geological engineering conditions of the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels from the jiayan water diversion project are introduced in detail below while the data on the other tunnels were collected from the literature the main information on these tunnels is listed in table 4 including the tunnel radius water level seepage parameters and reference the jiayan water diversion project was designed for water supply irrigation and power generation and is located in guizhou province in southwest china chen et al 2020 this project involves a total of 227 7 km of tunnels where the maochang 15 70 km and shuidaqiao 20 36 km tunnels are the main deeply buried segments with a buried depth of 50 445 m as shown in fig 8 both the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels pass through moderately developed karst formations which are mainly composed of soluble limestone and dolomite and contain small amounts of sandstone mudstone and other insoluble rocks figs 8 and 9 in addition highly pervious geological features including faults red lines in fig 8 and underground rivers cyan lines in fig 8 are well developed in this region considering the abundant groundwater in this area water inrush is one of the major geological problems for the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels it should be noted that compared with the branch tunnel of the shuidaqiao tunnel investigated by chen et al 2020 the main tunnels of the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels analyzed in this study are more deeply buried and are more prone to non darcian flow due to high water heads borehole packer tests along the tunnels indicated that the groundwater flow in this region is in the non darcian flow regime chen et al 2020 as is expected in most karst regions for the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels a series of borehole packer tests were conducted under different injection pressures to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and forchheimer coefficient of these formations detailed information on the packer tests and parameter estimation can be found in chen et al 2020 as a representative the location with the largest water head above the tunnel for each formation was adopted for the water inflow analysis these locations are marked in fig 9 pink lines and recorded in table 4 note that the groundwater table blue lines in fig 9 was derived based on the boreholes marked in fig 9 and geological survey for the other tunnels collected from the literature if only the information of hydraulic conductivity k was reported without the forchheimer coefficient β the universal model proposed by zhou et al 2019b was adopted to determine the value of β this universal model can predict β using k by a power law relationship β wk 3 2 which was established based on the compilation of a large amount of k β data in the literature note that this compilation involves more than 4000 geologic media from both laboratory and field scales and it covers all possible combinations of k β in real problems by means of this universal model the maximum possible value of β for a specific k was determined in each engineering case where the information on β was lacking listed in table 4 similarly only the largest water head above the tunnel was adopted for calculating the water inflow for these tunnels collected from the literature the water inflow into the tunnel was calculated by the proposed semi empirical model using parameters k β h for these 24 real engineering cases to quantitatively evaluate the possible error induced by neglecting the non darcian effect the relative error e is defined as 13 e q darcy q non darcian q non darcian 100 where q darcy and q non darcian are the water inflows calculated by eqs 1 and 12 respectively the e estimated with the corresponding water inflow is illustrated in fig 10 where the maximum relative error is nearly 300 in these 24 real engineering cases the relative error of the maochang and shuidaqiao tunnels reported in this study reaches 102 54 orange bars in fig 10 note that the water inflow in fig 10 refers to q non darcian the relative error generally increased with the magnitude of water inflow in these 24 real engineering cases to quantitatively investigate this relationship the variation in e with the water inflow is plotted in fig 11 showing that e depends closely on q via a power function this power function indicates that the error induced by neglecting the non darcian effect increases rapidly with the magnitude of water inflow into the tunnel there is a theoretical basis for this variation as a larger magnitude of water inflow means a greater inertial loss of the flow at the microscale and a correspondingly more significant non darcian effect at the macroscale finally resulting in a larger deviation from the darcy result these evaluation analyses based on the 24 real engineering cases confirm the necessity of considering the non darcian effect when calculating the water inflow into a tunnel especially for tunnels with large water inflows 5 conclusions this paper investigated the prediction of water inflow into tunnels in fractured rock aquifers where the flow is characterized as a non darcian flow regime first a non darcian effect factor was introduced to consider the non darcian effect in the classic theoretical formula for calculating water inflow into the tunnel a series of tunnel gushing simulations were conducted implemented by the finite element method based on the forchheimer constitutive equation based on these simulations the dependence of the non darcian effect factor on key parameters was systematically investigated with the control variate method which was shown to be sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity and forchheimer coefficient by means of an ingenious parameter integration the non darcian effect factor was successfully formulated using key parameters a semi empirical model was subsequently established by using the formulated factor and calibrating its coefficients which can predict water inflow into a tunnel considering the non darcian effect this proposed semi empirical model incorporating the classic theoretical formula and the forchheimer s law has a concise expression following dimensional consistency and can be successfully reduced to the classic theoretical formula under the darcy flow regime the validity of this proposed semi empirical model was confirmed by the results of non darcian flow simulations according to this semi empirical model the maximum possible error induced by neglecting the non darcian effect was evaluated in 24 real engineering cases this error was found to rapidly increase as a power function with the magnitude of water inflow into a tunnel these engineering case analyses thus proved the necessity of considering the non darcian effect when calculating the water inflow into a tunnel especially for tunnels with large water inflows further efforts should be made to extend this semi empirical model to more complicated hydrogeological conditions credit authorship contribution

of the finite element model and h λ is the adaptive penalized heaviside function used to eliminate the numerical instability and mesh dependence chen et al 2011 for darcy flow fo 0 the conductivity matrix k is a constant and thus these equations can be solved directly however for non darcian flow in this situation k is a variable related to the velocity since fo is dependent on the velocity in this context an iterative method was adopted to solve these equations in this study appendix b the validity of the code used for non darcian flow simulation was verified by the water flow through a cylinder where the exact analytical solution is available for non darcian flow in this simple model the dimensions of this cylinder are shown in fig a1 with a finite element mesh where the hydraulic conductivity and forchheimer coefficient of this cylinder are 1 10 6 m s and 1 0 1012 m 1 respectively the wall around the cylinder was set as an impermeable boundary while the upper and lower surfaces were prescribed with a water head difference h driving the flow from top to bottom non darcian flow simulations were conducted using the developed code with a series of hydraulic gradients j defined as the ratio of the water head difference h to the cylinder length l according to forchheimer eq 3 the average flux q downstream in such a boundary setting can be written analytically as a4 q v a g g 2 4 g β k 2 j 2 β k π r 2 where a is the cross sectional area the average flux was also evaluated directly from the results of the numerical simulations as shown in fig a2 the simulated flux fit very well with the analytical flux under all hydraulic gradients demonstrating the high accuracy of the developed code for non darcian flow simulation 
4583,the south to north water diversion middle route project mrp is expected to alleviate the long term groundwater storage gws depletion in north china plain ncp after the beginning of its operation in december 2014 this study aims to investigate the effect of mrp on gws by comparing gws changes before 2003 2014 and after 2015 2018 the mrp operation the analysis was conducted by using groundwater level data from 617 wells in ncp and then evaluated against satellite based water storage data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its follow on missions on average in ncp a decreasing trend of 19 1 5 1 mm yr was seen in gws based on well observations during 2003 2014 but a recovery trend of 1 8 0 7 mm yr was found during 2015 2018 the gws recovery was most prominent in subregions where groundwater over utilization had occurred in ncp grace exhibited the capacity to detect the regional gws depletion during 2003 2014 but difficult to distinguish the sub regional gws recovery during 2015 2018 the potential causes for gws recovery were found to be complicated not only caused by the reduction of groundwater pumping as accelerated by mrp diverted water but also the increasing precipitation recharge of aquifers and the enhanced management of groundwater system the findings highlight that gws in ncp has started a gradual transition from unsustainable depletion to sub regional recovery as benefit from the mrp water diversion keywords groundwater recovery groundwater depletion grace south to north water diversion north china plain 1 introduction water resources in china are unevenly distributed as evidenced by a sharp south to north down gradient in precipitation from 2000 to 200 mm yr about half of the population and two thirds of farmlands are located in northern china where the water resources are only one fifths of the national totals liu et al 2001 liu and xia 2004 the north china plain ncp fig 1 a which has an areal size of 140 000 km2 350 million population and 10 of china s grain yield depends heavily on groundwater gw for human water supply liu et al 2008 zheng et al 2010 ncp can be divided into two major subregions according to the quaternary hydrogeological features cao et al 2013 foster et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 the piedmont plain pp 54 000 km2 west bordering by the taihang mountain and the east central plain ecp 86 000 km2 east reaching the bohai gulf fig 1a water supply in pp is mainly from the shallow unconfined aquifers while ecp s water supply is from the deep confined aquifers as its shallow gw is brackish kendy et

beijing and tianjin due to intensive domestic and industrial uses and the agriculture dominated areas near shijiazhuang and hengshui fig 1a deng et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 numerous cones of depression see fig s1 in the supplementary material can be found near these cities with a maximum depth of 62 m in the unconfined aquifers and 110 m in the confined ones shang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zheng et al 2010 to optimize water resources allocation and mitigate the groundwater crisis famiglietti 2014 chinese government constructed the world s largest water diversion project the south to north water diversion project to transfer water from the southern china via the western middle and eastern routes liu and zheng 2002 the middle route project mrp fig 1a was designed to transfer 9 5 km3 yr of water from the danjiangkou reservoir in the hanjiang river basin to ncp since its operation in december 2014 mrp has delivered a total of 23 9 km3 2 3 3 6 4 8 6 3 and 6 9 km3 yr in 2015 to 2019 respectively to ncp about 24 8 and 20 0 of the diverted mrp water were allocated to beijing and tianjin and the rest to other twelve cities fig 1a and see table s1 in the supplementary material the water has been used for compensating environmental flow replenishing reservoirs recharging aquifers and replacing urban gw pumping he et al 2019 lei et al 2018 rogers et al 2020 about 12 000 private wells were shut down along the mrp conveyance line particularly at hengshui cangzhou xingtai and handan with a shutdown rate close to 100 gao et al 2018 gw pumping has reduced considerably in those cities and for the entire ncp by 1 3 km3 yr during 2015 2017 fig 1a and see table s2 even with the successful commencement of mrp one issue still under debate is whether mrp operation has already contributed to the recovery of gws in ncp lei et al 2018 rogers et al 2020 yao et al 2019 most of the previous studies used regional gw modelling to demonstrate that mrp operation can increase soil moisture evapotranspiration and gw recharge e g shao et al 2013 2019 shu et al 2012 ye et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 2020a zou et al 2016 beijing and tianjin were identified with gws recovery from modelling rogers et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zou et al 2016 but in other parts of ncp the recovery remains elusive for instance gws recovery in shijiazhuang was modelled by shao et al 2013 and zou et al 2016 while shu et al 2012 and ye et al 2014 concluded that mrp can only alleviate gws depletion without meaningful recovery although these previous modelling studies provided some divergent insights about the effect of mrp on gws most of them were not constrained by well observation and hence with considerable amounts of uncertainty long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b this study represents a first attempt to use the observed records of monthly gw levels from 617 wells during 2003 2018 to analyse the spatiotemporal gws depletion and recovery in ncp two study periods before 2003 2014 and after 2015 2018 the mrp operation are identified hereafter referred to as p1 and p2 respectively for separate analyses potential causes for the changes of gws trend in sub regional distribution and magnitude are explored by using precipitation mrp water diversion gw pumping data gws estimates from well observation were compared to the corresponding monthly estimates from grace and grace follow on grace fo data over ncp and four defined sub regions in contrast to previous studies that using grace data to investigate the gws depletion in ncp our work is based on the large amounts of long term observed gw level data covering most of the entire ncp and the focus here is on detecting the sub regional gws recovery and potential causes after the mrp operation 2 data and methodology 2 1 gws estimation from well observation the monthly gw level measurements from 617 wells 559 unconfined and 58 confined during 2003 2018 were obtained from the chinese gw management authority and the gw yearbook icgem 2018 the spatial distribution of the unconfined wells in ncp is more uniform than the confined wells that are available only near hengshui and xingtai see the ncp data networks in fig 1b fig 1c plots the 2003 2018 monthly time series of gw levels in 617 wells each well follows a strict quality control that it has 70 of coverage during the study period given the spatial non uniformity in well distribution the thiessen polygon approach was used to determine the area weight of each well in estimating the regional mean gw level it was observed that the mean gw levels in the unconfined and confined wells have declined by 0 3 and 0 9 m yr during p1 and followed by a mild recovery of 0 1 and 0 2 m yr during p2 respectively fig 1c gws change was calculated by multiplying the area weighted gw level changes by the specific yield for the unconfined wells or the storage coefficient for the confined wells zhang et al 2009 the ranges of specific yield and storage coefficient in ncp are 0 025 0 290 and 0 0004 0 0045 respectively which were also used in cao et al 2013 and huang et al 2015 more details on the thiessen polygons for wells and the spatial distributions of specific yield and storage coefficient in ncp are given respectively in figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material 2 2 gws estimation from grace data the version 2 of grace jan 2003 jun 2017 and grace fo jun 2018 dec 2018 rl06 mascon solution processed by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl was used to estimate monthly total water storage tws changes landerer et al 2020 wiese et al 2018 the jpl mascon solution used the regional concentration function to constrain mass variation which is expressed in terms of the globally equal area 3 3 spherical caps watkins et al 2015 though this solution provides tws data in a spatial sampling of 0 5 0 5 resolution the value of each grid cell in the same cap is identical to reduce the leakage errors introduced by the mascon basis function a set of scale factors with the 0 5 0 5 resolution derived from the community land model clm version 4 0 were used to calibrate grace tws estimate wiese et al 2016 more information on the data processing and leakage error reduction of the jpl mascon solution can be found in watkins et al 2015 and wiese et al 2016 respectively grace data contained a total of 18 months of data gaps during 2003 2017 and another 11 month gap july 2017 may 2018 between grace and grace fo to fill these gaps the approach of a seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl cleveland et al 1990 was applied to decompose the tws time series into three components representing seasonal trend and residual signals respectively the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial fritsch and carlson 1980 which has the advantage of eliminating over and under shot in interpolation was used to fill the data gaps in the time series of three components three time series were then added back to reconstruct the tws time series without data gaps applying these procedures to each grid cells provides the spatio temporally continuous records of grace tws data for the analysis in this study a schematic on the processing of grace tws data in one grid cell is given in fig s4 the monthly in situ soil moisture storage sms data with the monitoring depth of 0 75 m were collected from 104 sites maintained by the china meteorological administration fig 1b similar to the processing of gw level data the thiessen polygon approach was used to determine the area weight of each site for estimating the regional mean sms change fig s5 shows the spatial distribution of thiessen polygons based on 104 sms sites since the observed sms data are only available during 2003 2013 and with some data gaps in winter seasons due to frozen soils the sms data taken from four global land data assimilation system gldas models i e community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic noah and mosaic rodell et al 2004 were used as an alternative to estimate sms change the soil depths in the four gldas models are 3 433 m clm 3 5 m mosaic 2 0 noah and 1 9 m vic respectively four gldas models perform simulation at the spatial resolution of 1 1 rodell et al 2004 to be consistent with the resolution of grace tws the simulated data of four gldas models are resampled to 0 5 0 5 fig 2 plots the comparison of monthly time series of regional mean sms between in situ observation and four gldas model simulations in ncp during 2003 2013 for the consistency with the observed soil depth only the gldas sms data for the upper 0 75 m were used as shown in fig 2 the clm sms is selected for subsequent analysis because it has the highest correlation coefficient r 0 67 and smallest root mean square error rmse 9 3 mm with the observed sms among gldas models due to the lack of the observational data of snow water equivalent swe and canopy water storage cws changes in ncp the data of swe and cws simulated by clm were used in subsequent analysis tws is the summation of individual components including swe cws sms gws and surface water storage rodell et al 2018 changes of surface water storage in lakes wetlands reservoirs and rivers are considered negligible in ncp given that the large sized surface water bodies are rare and 40 of river channels are perennial dry in ncp regions wang et al 2018 gong et al 2018 an independent estimation of the monthly gws changes during 2003 2018 was derived by subtracting the sum of clm simulated swe cws and sms from grace tws annual trends of gws estimates from well observations and grace data decomposition during p1 and p2 are determined by using the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 with the confidence level of 95 2 3 precipitation mrp water diversion and gw pumping data the monthly precipitation p data during 2003 2018 were obtained from the gridded 0 5 product from the china meteorological administration which was produced from the interpolation of 2472 rain gauges records in china zhao and zhu 2015 annual mrp diverted water qd data during p2 and gw pumping qp data at each city fig 1a during p1 and p2 were collected from the official water resources bulletins annually published by chinese government bwa 2018 twa 2018 hbwcd 2018 hnwcd 2018 hrwcc 2018 the detailed data of qd and qp were listed respectively in tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 sub regional gws recovery from well observation fig 3 plots the gws trends during p1 and p2 at each of the 559 unconfined fig 3a b and 58 confined fig 3f g wells to precisely identify the wells with gws recovery the difference in gws trends of each period is plotted in fig 3c and h the difference in mean annual p of two periods and the mean annual qd allocated to each city during p2 are plotted in fig 3d and e respectively in the following paragraphs we evaluate the spatial pattern of gws changes throughout the ncp first and then identify 6 zones to analyse the response of sub regional gws to p and qd changes separately for the 559 unconfined wells in ncp fig 3a gws showed a decreasing trend during p1 in 376 67 wells with 304 54 statistically significant while the rest 183 wells showed an increasing trend with only 62 significant during p2 fig 3b however gws showed a decreasing trend in only 271 48 wells with 132 statistically significant while the rest 288 52 wells showed an increasing trend with 180 statistically significant for the 58 confined wells fig 3f gws during p1 showed a decreasing trend in 51 88 wells with 44 significant while the rest 7 wells showed an increasing trend with 5 significant during p2 fig 3g however gws showed a decreasing trend in only 21 36 wells with 7 significant while the rest 37 64 wells showed an increasing trend with 11 significant these statistics show that the number of wells observing an increasing gws trend during p2 was significantly more than that during p1 indicating the emergence of gws recovery in ncp for the zone 1 in fig 3c gws in most of the 87 unconfined wells near beijing showed significant recovery 30 mm yr in trend i e p2 relative to p1 likely attributed to both 8 47 5 mm yr increase of p fig 3d and 0 6 km3 yr decrease of qp in p2 table s2 mean qd during p2 was estimated at 1 1 km3 yr based on that qd 4 2 km3 yr for ncp and its allocation ratio to beijing is 24 8 table s1 there was also evidence of the increasing use 0 05 km3 yr of recycled water and the managed aquifer recharge 0 1 km3 yr in beijing bwa 2018 rogers et al 2020 as noted by he et al 2019 gw levels in parts of beijing rose by 9 m and 11 m respectively in the unconfined and confined aquifers during 2014 2017 long et al 2020 stated that the mean absolute depth of gw level in the beijing plain had decreased by 3 m during 2014 2019 our estimates agree well with these findings in that gws in beijing has started to recover as benefit from the increased recharge related to p surplus and the decreased qp after mrp operation he et al 2019 long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b for the zone 2 near tianjin where p was increased by 24 1 mm yr 4 7 during p2 fig 3d weak gws trends of 10 mm yr were observed for both periods fig 3a b this zone received 0 8 km3 yr of qd 20 0 of the total 4 2 km3 yr the second largest next to beijing in terms of mrp water received shown in table s1 and mean qp after mrp operation was decreased by 0 174 km3 yr table s2 most of qd received near tianjin were used to replace qp from the confined aquifers shang et al 2016 deng et al 2018 explaining the lack of notable trends in the unconfined wells in this zone fig 3b the maximum confined gw depth at the cones of depression was decreased from 99 1 m in 2014 to 93 3 m in 2018 twa 2018 similar to tianjin several unconfined gws near tangshan zone 3 in fig 3c showed higher depletion during p2 30 mm yr fig 3b mainly reflecting the decreasing p 11 8 mm yr fig 3d since mean qp was decreased slightly by 0 2 km3 yr from 2009 to 2015 same as tianjin table s2 the zone 4 located near shijiazhuang xingtai and handan showed marked gws recovery in the unconfined wells during p2 40 mm yr fig 3b shijiazhuang has the deepest cone of depression in the unconfined aquifers in ncp with the maximum depth over 60 m fig s1 this area received 0 5 km3 yr of qd the third largest next to beijing and tianjin also a 22 4 mm yr increase in p during p2 fig 3d e due to these two favourable factors an alleviated gws depletion trend was observed during p2 in shijiazhuang consistent with the shu et al 2012 and ye et al 2014 who found that the decreasing gws trend cannot be completely reversed by qd in heavily irrigated areas xingtai and handan are the key areas for implementing the shutdown of private wells shang et al 2016 in two cities qp was reduced by 50 table s2 while only 0 1 km3 yr of qd were received fig 3e these cities are also among the subregions with the deepest cone of depression in unconfined aquifers in ncp fig s1 the aquifers here are mainly recharged by the lateral inflow from west bordering taihang mountain rather than recharge from p kendy et al 2004 cao et al 2013 which explains that a few wells near the mountains observed the increasing gws trends fig 3b d for the deeper confined wells in zone 5 fig 3h the largest cone of depression over ncp with the maximum depth of 100 m occurred near hengshui fig s1 the confined gws in this zone was depleted significantly during p1 with the rate of 3 mm yr interestingly although the mean annual p was decreased by 14 2 mm yr fig 3d and only received 0 1 km3 yr of qd during p2 fig 3e gws in the confined wells showed a significant increasing trend 4 mm yr fig 3g h since qd is too small to cause substantial reduction in qp table s2 and p was decreased during p2 fig 3d the significant gws recovery in the confined wells can mainly be attributed to the implementation of management measures such as the shutdown of most private wells to curtail qp in hengshui and cangzhou as reported by shang et al 2016 for other confined wells located in xingtai where less regulatory measures were implemented gws trend only reflects the trend of p fig 3d h the zone 6 fig 3c e located in the shandong province is not belonging to the water receiving area of mrp however this zone received the diverted water from the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project yao et al 2019 which began its operation in november 2013 by 2019 it has received 4 0 km3 yr of diverted water and hence qp was reduced in this zone yao et al 2019 the mean p during p2 was decreased by 34 2 mm yr in the southwest part and increased by 37 8 mm yr in the northeast part fig 3d overall in consistency with the spatial patterns that the unconfined wells in the north eastern zone 6 with the milder gws trends than those in the south western part fig 3b determining the effect of the eastern route project is beyond the scope of current study so no much explanation is available here 3 2 grace estimation of sub regional gws recovery as an independent estimate fig 4 plots the spatial distributions of the trends of grace estimated tws and gws as well as the sum of clm simulated swe cws and sms during p1 and p2 on average the trend magnitude in the sum of swe cws and sms 1 2 mm yr fig 4e f only accounts for 5 of tws trend 26 1 mm yr fig 4a b in ncp high consistency between tws and gws trends can be observed grid to grid correlation r 0 93 fig 4a d for both periods indicating the dominant role of gws on tws the finding is consistent with most previous studies related to tws component decomposition in ncp e g feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 a decreasing trend of gws 24 7 mm yr was found over ncp during p1 fig 4c smaller than previous estimate of 32 0 mm yr 2003 2013 by huang et al 2015 but larger than 22 0 mm yr 2003 2010 by feng et al 2013 17 1 mm yr 2005 2013 by gong et al 2018 and 17 0 mm yr 2004 2016 by zhao et al 2019 the discrepancy is to a large extent due to different study periods grace data and processing methods used the spatial patterns agree well with that of well observations fig 3a vs fig 4c also similar with rodell et al 2018 fig 1 showing significant gws depletion in ncp during p2 grace estimated gws showed a mild recovery in regions near beijing fig 4d although the estimated trend of gws recovery is small 1 0 mm yr the spatial location corresponds well to that of well observed gws recovery shown in fig 3b we note that the scale of gws recovery is smaller than the spatial resolution of grace data 300 km 300 km 100 000 km2 watkins et al 2015 making the interpretation of grace estimates rather difficult longuevergne et al 2013 save et al 2016 yeh et al 2006 nevertheless the grace derived spatial pattern of gws trend provides a reference to divide the ncp into four sub regions as shown in fig 4 subregions a 35 500 km2 b 47 900 km2 c 24 400 km2 and d 32 200 km2 the boundaries of each subregion are determined jointly by the spatial patterns of gws changes detected by grace and well observations as well as the boundaries of cities that received qd within ncp such partition is actually difficult to achieve if only analysing the spatial pattern of gws changes observed by in situ wells as shown in fig 3 for further investigation the quantitative statistics of the estimated gws trends from in situ wells and grace data in each subregion are summarized in table 1 the details will be discussed in the next section 3 3 quantitative analysis of sub regional gws recovery fig 5 a plots the monthly gws changes from wells and grace in ncp during 2003 2018 gws estimated from wells showed a decreasing trend of 19 1 5 1 mm yr while grace estimate showed a 24 7 8 0 mm yr decrease during p1 table 1 during p2 however gws estimate from wells showed an increasing trend of 1 8 0 7 mm yr while grace estimate indicated a decrease of 16 6 4 7 mm yr r and rmse between two estimates are 0 88 and 62 5 mm respectively fig 5a the large rmse is due to the small seasonal amplitude of grace gws versus well observations mainly caused by that 1 sub regional grace data are contaminated by the signal leakage and amplitude damping effects feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 2 the over estimated specific yield storage coefficient is used in converting gw level to gws during p1 and p2 gws trend in the unconfined wells is 16 4 3 6 and 1 4 0 5 mm yr respectively significantly larger than that in the confined wells of 2 6 1 3 and 0 4 0 1 mm yr indicating the predominant role of unconfined aquifers in ncp in gws depletion and recovery table 1 given that the magnitude of specific yields 0 025 0 290 used is 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than the storage coefficient 0 0004 0 0045 in ncp fig 5b compares the monthly gws estimates from wells and grace in pp and ecp during 2003 2018 for pp and ecp r rmse between two gws estimates are 0 92 72 3 mm and 0 69 117 0 mm respectively the increase in rmse relative to that in ncp 62 5 mm is likely associated with the accuracy of grace data decreasing with the size of study area gws trends during p1 and p2 from well observations were 34 3 4 7 and 4 9 1 3 mm yr for pp and 2 0 1 5 and 3 6 1 1 mm yr for ecp whereas that estimated from grace were 22 5 6 9 and 18 2 6 8 mm yr for pp and 25 0 5 9 and 15 3 4 4 mm yr for ecp table 1 well observations show that gws variability in pp is considerably larger than that in ecp but grace may have difficulty to distinguish the respective signals in two subregions even with the use of the scale factors to reduce leakage errors the gws recovery signals in pp may be offset by the leakage of gws depletion signals from ecp and surrounding areas outside ncp fig 3d similarly some signals from pp may interfere grace detection of gws trend in ecp huang et al 2015 fig 5c compares the 2003 2018 monthly gws estimates from wells and grace in four subregions with the corresponding r rmse between them 0 73 78 9 mm 0 85 79 2 mm 0 90 80 6 mm and 0 65 166 5 mm in subregions a b c and d respectively the largest gws depletion trend during p1 estimated from wells 28 4 4 4 mm yr or grace 29 5 7 9 mm yr occurred in subregion c the gws trend estimated from grace 16 1 5 8 mm yr in subregion a is close to that from well observations 15 8 2 6 mm yr while grace 22 3 5 8 mm yr tends to overestimate the gws depletion trend in subregion b relative to well observations 13 9 3 2 mm yr table 1 grace estimated a large gws depletion trend 26 6 6 8 mm yr in subregion d where well observations estimated a lack of trend 2 8 0 6 mm yr the inconsistent or even opposite gws trends from well observations and grace estimates further illustrate that the leakage errors may still present to interfere the grace estimates of gws depletion in four subregions during p2 gws in subregions a and d showed an increasing trend of 7 7 1 8 and 11 2 2 3 mm yr respectively from well observations but those estimated from grace were 1 2 0 7 and 17 0 5 7 mm yr respectively for subregions b and c gws trends from well observations were 5 4 1 1 and 7 8 2 1 mm yr respectively whereas that estimated from grace were 11 4 4 3 and 26 2 7 4 mm yr table 1 this is interesting because grace detected the small trend of gws recovery in subregion a but was unable to detect the large trend of gws recovery in subregion d the main reason for this is that grace has the potential to detect the signal within a smaller area if the mass change is highly concentrated and with a sufficiently large magnitude longuevergne et al 2013 existing studies have successfully applied grace data to detect reservoir water impoundment ice melting and groundwater depletion in areas as small as 400 km2 e g chen et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2011 wang et al 2011 yi et al 2017 according to the well observations shown in fig 3b the gws recovery in ncp is likewise highly concentrated in subregion a i e beijing which is intrinsically similar to the reservoir water impoundment but occurring below the land surface hence it is reasonable to anticipate that grace may have the potential to detect the sub regional gws recovery in ncp but not yet able to estimate the magnitude accurately due to the signal leakage 3 4 uncertainty estimation the monthly errors of gws estimation from well observations shown as the pink envelopes in fig 5 were quantified by assuming a 20 uncertainty of the specific yield and storage coefficient by referring to the studies of huang et al 2015 and pan et al 2017 the errors of grace gws shown as green envelopes in fig 5 were calculated by propagating the errors of grace tws and clm simulated sms swe and cws the error of grace tws was derived by considering the calibration error as provided in grace jpl mascon solution watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2018 the leakage errors were not considered herein because the scale factors were used for calibrate grace tws prior to the uncertainty estimation this may underestimate the error of tws if the scale factors used cannot eliminate the leakage errors completely clm does not provide the error estimation for the simulated variables hence the errors of sms swe and cws was calculated as one standard deviation of the simulations from four gldas models pan et al 2017 table 2 summarizes the estimated monthly mean errors of tws and its components in ncp pp ecp and four subregions as seen the errors of in situ observed gws range 13 1 19 8 mm month in ncp and its subregions gws in ecp has the highest error implying a highly uneven changes of gws within subregion the errors of grace gws range 31 3 39 1 mm month dominated by grace tws errors 30 2 37 7 mm month and followed by the errors of three clm simulated water storage components 8 1 12 0 mm month by comparison the error of gws estimated by grace data is about two times larger than that estimated by well observations table 2 this hints that the in situ gw measurements by in situ wells will be indispensable for monitoring gws recovery in ncp 4 concluding remarks this study addresses the important science question that whether mrp has contributed to gws recovery in ncp since its mrp operation in december 2014 to this end long term gw level data from 617 monitoring wells 559 unconfined and 58 confined wells in ncp were used to analyse the spatiotemporal variations of gws before and after the mrp operation i e the p1 period of 2003 2014 and p2 period of 2015 2018 the satellite measured tws data from grace and grace fo were also used in conjunction with model simulations to estimate gws in ncp and four sub regions providing an independent validation against the well based observational gws estimates particularly on the sub regional spatial patterns the main causes for observed sub regional gws depletion p1 and recovery p2 were investigated through the analyses of precipitation p pumping qp and mrp diverted water qd data at each of 14 cities along the mrp conveyance route for the entire ncp gws estimate from well observations showed a 19 1 5 1 mm yr of decreasing trend during p1 compared to that from grace of 24 7 8 0 mm yr however gws estimate from wells showed a 1 8 0 7 mm yr of increasing trend during p2 in contrast to the estimate from grace of 16 6 4 7 mm yr sub regional gws recovery in ncp can be observed from well data in water receiving cities along the mrp conveyance route also in consistency with the received mrp water and pumping reduction data in each city gws depletion of 34 3 4 7 mm yr during p1 and recovery of 4 9 1 3 mm yr during p2 occur mainly in the unconfined aquifers of pp which are considerably larger than 2 0 1 5 and 3 6 1 1 mm yr in ecp yet grace is difficult to distinguish the respective signals in pp and ecp due to signal leakage the following specific findings at the sub regional scales can be summarized from this study 1 for the total 617 wells 67 88 of the unconfined confined wells had decreasing trends during p1 while the numbers decreasing to only 48 36 during p2 indicating gws recovery occurred in both unconfined and confined gws in ncp after mrp operation 2 significant gws recovery 30 mm yr was observed in most of the 87 wells all unconfined near beijing attributed to both 8 of increase in p and 0 6 km3 yr decrease in qp due to received mrp qd 1 1 km3 yr 22 4 of total qd diverted to ncp during p2 3 significant gws recovery 20 mm yr was observed in 25 unconfined wells at the agricultural regions near shijiazhuang xingtai and handan attributed to the decreasing qp increasing p and likely the resulting increase in lateral inflow recharge from west bordering taihang mountain 4 gws recovery in the confined aquifers 4 mm yr was found in hengshui due specifically to the 20 decrease in qp as the result of recent policy enforcement of well shutdown since qd was as small as 0 1 km3 yr and p was decreased by 13 5 grace indeed has the potential to locate gws depletion and recovery hotspots at the sub regional scales of ncp smaller than the spatial resolution 100 000 km2 but with considerable leakage errors interfering the accuracy of estimated variability and trend magnitude this study highlights that gws in ncp has started a gradual transition from depletion to recovery in the major water receiving areas of the mrp water diversion but it remains to be observed and investigated whether the trend will be reversed again under future more frequent drought occurrence credit authorship contribution statement chong zhang

4583,the south to north water diversion middle route project mrp is expected to alleviate the long term groundwater storage gws depletion in north china plain ncp after the beginning of its operation in december 2014 this study aims to investigate the effect of mrp on gws by comparing gws changes before 2003 2014 and after 2015 2018 the mrp operation the analysis was conducted by using groundwater level data from 617 wells in ncp and then evaluated against satellite based water storage data from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its follow on missions on average in ncp a decreasing trend of 19 1 5 1 mm yr was seen in gws based on well observations during 2003 2014 but a recovery trend of 1 8 0 7 mm yr was found during 2015 2018 the gws recovery was most prominent in subregions where groundwater over utilization had occurred in ncp grace exhibited the capacity to detect the regional gws depletion during 2003 2014 but difficult to distinguish the sub regional gws recovery during 2015 2018 the potential causes for gws recovery were found to be complicated not only caused by the reduction of groundwater pumping as accelerated by mrp diverted water but also the increasing precipitation recharge of aquifers and the enhanced management of groundwater system the findings highlight that gws in ncp has started a gradual transition from unsustainable depletion to sub regional recovery as benefit from the mrp water diversion keywords groundwater recovery groundwater depletion grace south to north water diversion north china plain 1 introduction water resources in china are unevenly distributed as evidenced by a sharp south to north down gradient in precipitation from 2000 to 200 mm yr about half of the population and two thirds of farmlands are located in northern china where the water resources are only one fifths of the national totals liu et al 2001 liu and xia 2004 the north china plain ncp fig 1 a which has an areal size of 140 000 km2 350 million population and 10 of china s grain yield depends heavily on groundwater gw for human water supply liu et al 2008 zheng et al 2010 ncp can be divided into two major subregions according to the quaternary hydrogeological features cao et al 2013 foster et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 the piedmont plain pp 54 000 km2 west bordering by the taihang mountain and the east central plain ecp 86 000 km2 east reaching the bohai gulf fig 1a water supply in pp is mainly from the shallow unconfined aquifers while ecp s water supply is from the deep confined aquifers as its shallow gw is brackish kendy et al 2004 zheng et al 2010 gw pumping provides 70 of irrigation and 60 of total water supply in ncp liu and xia 2004 unsustainable over exploitation of gw since 1970 s has resulted in a significant gw decline at 0 5 2 0 m yr gong et al 2018 wang et al 2018 recent estimates of gw storage gws depletion from well observations or gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite measurements ranged between 32 0 17 0 mm yr i e 4 5 2 4 km3 yr e g feng et al 2013 2018 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 xu et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 gws depletion is particularly severe near beijing and tianjin due to intensive domestic and industrial uses and the agriculture dominated areas near shijiazhuang and hengshui fig 1a deng et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 numerous cones of depression see fig s1 in the supplementary material can be found near these cities with a maximum depth of 62 m in the unconfined aquifers and 110 m in the confined ones shang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zheng et al 2010 to optimize water resources allocation and mitigate the groundwater crisis famiglietti 2014 chinese government constructed the world s largest water diversion project the south to north water diversion project to transfer water from the southern china via the western middle and eastern routes liu and zheng 2002 the middle route project mrp fig 1a was designed to transfer 9 5 km3 yr of water from the danjiangkou reservoir in the hanjiang river basin to ncp since its operation in december 2014 mrp has delivered a total of 23 9 km3 2 3 3 6 4 8 6 3 and 6 9 km3 yr in 2015 to 2019 respectively to ncp about 24 8 and 20 0 of the diverted mrp water were allocated to beijing and tianjin and the rest to other twelve cities fig 1a and see table s1 in the supplementary material the water has been used for compensating environmental flow replenishing reservoirs recharging aquifers and replacing urban gw pumping he et al 2019 lei et al 2018 rogers et al 2020 about 12 000 private wells were shut down along the mrp conveyance line particularly at hengshui cangzhou xingtai and handan with a shutdown rate close to 100 gao et al 2018 gw pumping has reduced considerably in those cities and for the entire ncp by 1 3 km3 yr during 2015 2017 fig 1a and see table s2 even with the successful commencement of mrp one issue still under debate is whether mrp operation has already contributed to the recovery of gws in ncp lei et al 2018 rogers et al 2020 yao et al 2019 most of the previous studies used regional gw modelling to demonstrate that mrp operation can increase soil moisture evapotranspiration and gw recharge e g shao et al 2013 2019 shu et al 2012 ye et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 2020a zou et al 2016 beijing and tianjin were identified with gws recovery from modelling rogers et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zou et al 2016 but in other parts of ncp the recovery remains elusive for instance gws recovery in shijiazhuang was modelled by shao et al 2013 and zou et al 2016 while shu et al 2012 and ye et al 2014 concluded that mrp can only alleviate gws depletion without meaningful recovery although these previous modelling studies provided some divergent insights about the effect of mrp on gws most of them were not constrained by well observation and hence with considerable amounts of uncertainty long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b this study represents a first attempt to use the observed records of monthly gw levels from 617 wells during 2003 2018 to analyse the spatiotemporal gws depletion and recovery in ncp two study periods before 2003 2014 and after 2015 2018 the mrp operation are identified hereafter referred to as p1 and p2 respectively for separate analyses potential causes for the changes of gws trend in sub regional distribution and magnitude are explored by using precipitation mrp water diversion gw pumping data gws estimates from well observation were compared to the corresponding monthly estimates from grace and grace follow on grace fo data over ncp and four defined sub regions in contrast to previous studies that using grace data to investigate the gws depletion in ncp our work is based on the large amounts of long term observed gw level data covering most of the entire ncp and the focus here is on detecting the sub regional gws recovery and potential causes after the mrp operation 2 data and methodology 2 1 gws estimation from well observation the monthly gw level measurements from 617 wells 559 unconfined and 58 confined during 2003 2018 were obtained from the chinese gw management authority and the gw yearbook icgem 2018 the spatial distribution of the unconfined wells in ncp is more uniform than the confined wells that are available only near hengshui and xingtai see the ncp data networks in fig 1b fig 1c plots the 2003 2018 monthly time series of gw levels in 617 wells each well follows a strict quality control that it has 70 of coverage during the study period given the spatial non uniformity in well distribution the thiessen polygon approach was used to determine the area weight of each well in estimating the regional mean gw level it was observed that the mean gw levels in the unconfined and confined wells have declined by 0 3 and 0 9 m yr during p1 and followed by a mild recovery of 0 1 and 0 2 m yr during p2 respectively fig 1c gws change was calculated by multiplying the area weighted gw level changes by the specific yield for the unconfined wells or the storage coefficient for the confined wells zhang et al 2009 the ranges of specific yield and storage coefficient in ncp are 0 025 0 290 and 0 0004 0 0045 respectively which were also used in cao et al 2013 and huang et al 2015 more details on the thiessen polygons for wells and the spatial distributions of specific yield and storage coefficient in ncp are given respectively in figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary material 2 2 gws estimation from grace data the version 2 of grace jan 2003 jun 2017 and grace fo jun 2018 dec 2018 rl06 mascon solution processed by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl was used to estimate monthly total water storage tws changes landerer et al 2020 wiese et al 2018 the jpl mascon solution used the regional concentration function to constrain mass variation which is expressed in terms of the globally equal area 3 3 spherical caps watkins et al 2015 though this solution provides tws data in a spatial sampling of 0 5 0 5 resolution the value of each grid cell in the same cap is identical to reduce the leakage errors introduced by the mascon basis function a set of scale factors with the 0 5 0 5 resolution derived from the community land model clm version 4 0 were used to calibrate grace tws estimate wiese et al 2016 more information on the data processing and leakage error reduction of the jpl mascon solution can be found in watkins et al 2015 and wiese et al 2016 respectively grace data contained a total of 18 months of data gaps during 2003 2017 and another 11 month gap july 2017 may 2018 between grace and grace fo to fill these gaps the approach of a seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl cleveland et al 1990 was applied to decompose the tws time series into three components representing seasonal trend and residual signals respectively the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial fritsch and carlson 1980 which has the advantage of eliminating over and under shot in interpolation was used to fill the data gaps in the time series of three components three time series were then added back to reconstruct the tws time series without data gaps applying these procedures to each grid cells provides the spatio temporally continuous records of grace tws data for the analysis in this study a schematic on the processing of grace tws data in one grid cell is given in fig s4 the monthly in situ soil moisture storage sms data with the monitoring depth of 0 75 m were collected from 104 sites maintained by the china meteorological administration fig 1b similar to the processing of gw level data the thiessen polygon approach was used to determine the area weight of each site for estimating the regional mean sms change fig s5 shows the spatial distribution of thiessen polygons based on 104 sms sites since the observed sms data are only available during 2003 2013 and with some data gaps in winter seasons due to frozen soils the sms data taken from four global land data assimilation system gldas models i e community land model clm variable infiltration capacity vic noah and mosaic rodell et al 2004 were used as an alternative to estimate sms change the soil depths in the four gldas models are 3 433 m clm 3 5 m mosaic 2 0 noah and 1 9 m vic respectively four gldas models perform simulation at the spatial resolution of 1 1 rodell et al 2004 to be consistent with the resolution of grace tws the simulated data of four gldas models are resampled to 0 5 0 5 fig 2 plots the comparison of monthly time series of regional mean sms between in situ observation and four gldas model simulations in ncp during 2003 2013 for the consistency with the observed soil depth only the gldas sms data for the upper 0 75 m were used as shown in fig 2 the clm sms is selected for subsequent analysis because it has the highest correlation coefficient r 0 67 and smallest root mean square error rmse 9 3 mm with the observed sms among gldas models due to the lack of the observational data of snow water equivalent swe and canopy water storage cws changes in ncp the data of swe and cws simulated by clm were used in subsequent analysis tws is the summation of individual components including swe cws sms gws and surface water storage rodell et al 2018 changes of surface water storage in lakes wetlands reservoirs and rivers are considered negligible in ncp given that the large sized surface water bodies are rare and 40 of river channels are perennial dry in ncp regions wang et al 2018 gong et al 2018 an independent estimation of the monthly gws changes during 2003 2018 was derived by subtracting the sum of clm simulated swe cws and sms from grace tws annual trends of gws estimates from well observations and grace data decomposition during p1 and p2 are determined by using the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 with the confidence level of 95 2 3 precipitation mrp water diversion and gw pumping data the monthly precipitation p data during 2003 2018 were obtained from the gridded 0 5 product from the china meteorological administration which was produced from the interpolation of 2472 rain gauges records in china zhao and zhu 2015 annual mrp diverted water qd data during p2 and gw pumping qp data at each city fig 1a during p1 and p2 were collected from the official water resources bulletins annually published by chinese government bwa 2018 twa 2018 hbwcd 2018 hnwcd 2018 hrwcc 2018 the detailed data of qd and qp were listed respectively in tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 sub regional gws recovery from well observation fig 3 plots the gws trends during p1 and p2 at each of the 559 unconfined fig 3a b and 58 confined fig 3f g wells to precisely identify the wells with gws recovery the difference in gws trends of each period is plotted in fig 3c and h the difference in mean annual p of two periods and the mean annual qd allocated to each city during p2 are plotted in fig 3d and e respectively in the following paragraphs we evaluate the spatial pattern of gws changes throughout the ncp first and then identify 6 zones to analyse the response of sub regional gws to p and qd changes separately for the 559 unconfined wells in ncp fig 3a gws showed a decreasing trend during p1 in 376 67 wells with 304 54 statistically significant while the rest 183 wells showed an increasing trend with only 62 significant during p2 fig 3b however gws showed a decreasing trend in only 271 48 wells with 132 statistically significant while the rest 288 52 wells showed an increasing trend with 180 statistically significant for the 58 confined wells fig 3f gws during p1 showed a decreasing trend in 51 88 wells with 44 significant while the rest 7 wells showed an increasing trend with 5 significant during p2 fig 3g however gws showed a decreasing trend in only 21 36 wells with 7 significant while the rest 37 64 wells showed an increasing trend with 11 significant these statistics show that the number of wells observing an increasing gws trend during p2 was significantly more than that during p1 indicating the emergence of gws recovery in ncp for the zone 1 in fig 3c gws in most of the 87 unconfined wells near beijing showed significant recovery 30 mm yr in trend i e p2 relative to p1 likely attributed to both 8 47 5 mm yr increase of p fig 3d and 0 6 km3 yr decrease of qp in p2 table s2 mean qd during p2 was estimated at 1 1 km3 yr based on that qd 4 2 km3 yr for ncp and its allocation ratio to beijing is 24 8 table s1 there was also evidence of the increasing use 0 05 km3 yr of recycled water and the managed aquifer recharge 0 1 km3 yr in beijing bwa 2018 rogers et al 2020 as noted by he et al 2019 gw levels in parts of beijing rose by 9 m and 11 m respectively in the unconfined and confined aquifers during 2014 2017 long et al 2020 stated that the mean absolute depth of gw level in the beijing plain had decreased by 3 m during 2014 2019 our estimates agree well with these findings in that gws in beijing has started to recover as benefit from the increased recharge related to p surplus and the decreased qp after mrp operation he et al 2019 long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b for the zone 2 near tianjin where p was increased by 24 1 mm yr 4 7 during p2 fig 3d weak gws trends of 10 mm yr were observed for both periods fig 3a b this zone received 0 8 km3 yr of qd 20 0 of the total 4 2 km3 yr the second largest next to beijing in terms of mrp water received shown in table s1 and mean qp after mrp operation was decreased by 0 174 km3 yr table s2 most of qd received near tianjin were used to replace qp from the confined aquifers shang et al 2016 deng et al 2018 explaining the lack of notable trends in the unconfined wells in this zone fig 3b the maximum confined gw depth at the cones of depression was decreased from 99 1 m in 2014 to 93 3 m in 2018 twa 2018 similar to tianjin several unconfined gws near tangshan zone 3 in fig 3c showed higher depletion during p2 30 mm yr fig 3b mainly reflecting the decreasing p 11 8 mm yr fig 3d since mean qp was decreased slightly by 0 2 km3 yr from 2009 to 2015 same as tianjin table s2 the zone 4 located near shijiazhuang xingtai and handan showed marked gws recovery in the unconfined wells during p2 40 mm yr fig 3b shijiazhuang has the deepest cone of depression in the unconfined aquifers in ncp with the maximum depth over 60 m fig s1 this area received 0 5 km3 yr of qd the third largest next to beijing and tianjin also a 22 4 mm yr increase in p during p2 fig 3d e due to these two favourable factors an alleviated gws depletion trend was observed during p2 in shijiazhuang consistent with the shu et al 2012 and ye et al 2014 who found that the decreasing gws trend cannot be completely reversed by qd in heavily irrigated areas xingtai and handan are the key areas for implementing the shutdown of private wells shang et al 2016 in two cities qp was reduced by 50 table s2 while only 0 1 km3 yr of qd were received fig 3e these cities are also among the subregions with the deepest cone of depression in unconfined aquifers in ncp fig s1 the aquifers here are mainly recharged by the lateral inflow from west bordering taihang mountain rather than recharge from p kendy et al 2004 cao et al 2013 which explains that a few wells near the mountains observed the increasing gws trends fig 3b d for the deeper confined wells in zone 5 fig 3h the largest cone of depression over ncp with the maximum depth of 100 m occurred near hengshui fig s1 the confined gws in this zone was depleted significantly during p1 with the rate of 3 mm yr interestingly although the mean annual p was decreased by 14 2 mm yr fig 3d and only received 0 1 km3 yr of qd during p2 fig 3e gws in the confined wells showed a significant increasing trend 4 mm yr fig 3g h since qd is too small to cause substantial reduction in qp table s2 and p was decreased during p2 fig 3d the significant gws recovery in the confined wells can mainly be attributed to the implementation of management measures such as the shutdown of most private wells to curtail qp in hengshui and cangzhou as reported by shang et al 2016 for other confined wells located in xingtai where less regulatory measures were implemented gws trend only reflects the trend of p fig 3d h the zone 6 fig 3c e located in the shandong province is not belonging to the water receiving area of mrp however this zone received the diverted water from the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project yao et al 2019 which began its operation in november 2013 by 2019 it has received 4 0 km3 yr of diverted water and hence qp was reduced in this zone yao et al 2019 the mean p during p2 was decreased by 34 2 mm yr in the southwest part and increased by 37 8 mm yr in the northeast part fig 3d overall in consistency with the spatial patterns that the unconfined wells in the north eastern zone 6 with the milder gws trends than those in the south western part fig 3b determining the effect of the eastern route project is beyond the scope of current study so no much explanation is available here 3 2 grace estimation of sub regional gws recovery as an independent estimate fig 4 plots the spatial distributions of the trends of grace estimated tws and gws as well as the sum of clm simulated swe cws and sms during p1 and p2 on average the trend magnitude in the sum of swe cws and sms 1 2 mm yr fig 4e f only accounts for 5 of tws trend 26 1 mm yr fig 4a b in ncp high consistency between tws and gws trends can be observed grid to grid correlation r 0 93 fig 4a d for both periods indicating the dominant role of gws on tws the finding is consistent with most previous studies related to tws component decomposition in ncp e g feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 a decreasing trend of gws 24 7 mm yr was found over ncp during p1 fig 4c smaller than previous estimate of 32 0 mm yr 2003 2013 by huang et al 2015 but larger than 22 0 mm yr 2003 2010 by feng et al 2013 17 1 mm yr 2005 2013 by gong et al 2018 and 17 0 mm yr 2004 2016 by zhao et al 2019 the discrepancy is to a large extent due to different study periods grace data and processing methods used the spatial patterns agree well with that of well observations fig 3a vs fig 4c also similar with rodell et al 2018 fig 1 showing significant gws depletion in ncp during p2 grace estimated gws showed a mild recovery in regions near beijing fig 4d although the estimated trend of gws recovery is small 1 0 mm yr the spatial location corresponds well to that of well observed gws recovery shown in fig 3b we note that the scale of gws recovery is smaller than the spatial resolution of grace data 300 km 300 km 100 000 km2 watkins et al 2015 making the interpretation of grace estimates rather difficult longuevergne et al 2013 save et al 2016 yeh et al 2006 nevertheless the grace derived spatial pattern of gws trend provides a reference to divide the ncp into four sub regions as shown in fig 4 subregions a 35 500 km2 b 47 900 km2 c 24 400 km2 and d 32 200 km2 the boundaries of each subregion are determined jointly by the spatial patterns of gws changes detected by grace and well observations as well as the boundaries of cities that received qd within ncp such partition is actually difficult to achieve if only analysing the spatial pattern of gws changes observed by in situ wells as shown in fig 3 for further investigation the quantitative statistics of the estimated gws trends from in situ wells and grace data in each subregion are summarized in table 1 the details will be discussed in the next section 3 3 quantitative analysis of sub regional gws recovery fig 5 a plots the monthly gws changes from wells and grace in ncp during 2003 2018 gws estimated from wells showed a decreasing trend of 19 1 5 1 mm yr while grace estimate showed a 24 7 8 0 mm yr decrease during p1 table 1 during p2 however gws estimate from wells showed an increasing trend of 1 8 0 7 mm yr while grace estimate indicated a decrease of 16 6 4 7 mm yr r and rmse between two estimates are 0 88 and 62 5 mm respectively fig 5a the large rmse is due to the small seasonal amplitude of grace gws versus well observations mainly caused by that 1 sub regional grace data are contaminated by the signal leakage and amplitude damping effects feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 2 the over estimated specific yield storage coefficient is used in converting gw level to gws during p1 and p2 gws trend in the unconfined wells is 16 4 3 6 and 1 4 0 5 mm yr respectively significantly larger than that in the confined wells of 2 6 1 3 and 0 4 0 1 mm yr indicating the predominant role of unconfined aquifers in ncp in gws depletion and recovery table 1 given that the magnitude of specific yields 0 025 0 290 used is 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than the storage coefficient 0 0004 0 0045 in ncp fig 5b compares the monthly gws estimates from wells and grace in pp and ecp during 2003 2018 for pp and ecp r rmse between two gws estimates are 0 92 72 3 mm and 0 69 117 0 mm respectively the increase in rmse relative to that in ncp 62 5 mm is likely associated with the accuracy of grace data decreasing with the size of study area gws trends during p1 and p2 from well observations were 34 3 4 7 and 4 9 1 3 mm yr for pp and 2 0 1 5 and 3 6 1 1 mm yr for ecp whereas that estimated from grace were 22 5 6 9 and 18 2 6 8 mm yr for pp and 25 0 5 9 and 15 3 4 4 mm yr for ecp table 1 well observations show that gws variability in pp is considerably larger than that in ecp but grace may have difficulty to distinguish the respective signals in two subregions even with the use of the scale factors to reduce leakage errors the gws recovery signals in pp may be offset by the leakage of gws depletion signals from ecp and surrounding areas outside ncp fig 3d similarly some signals from pp may interfere grace detection of gws trend in ecp huang et al 2015 fig 5c compares the 2003 2018 monthly gws estimates from wells and grace in four subregions with the corresponding r rmse between them 0 73 78 9 mm 0 85 79 2 mm 0 90 80 6 mm and 0 65 166 5 mm in subregions a b c and d respectively the largest gws depletion trend during p1 estimated from wells 28 4 4 4 mm yr or grace 29 5 7 9 mm yr occurred in subregion c the gws trend estimated from grace 16 1 5 8 mm yr in subregion a is close to that from well observations 15 8 2 6 mm yr while grace 22 3 5 8 mm yr tends to overestimate the gws depletion trend in subregion b relative to well observations 13 9 3 2 mm yr table 1 grace estimated a large gws depletion trend 26 6 6 8 mm yr in subregion d where well observations estimated a lack of trend 2 8 0 6 mm yr the inconsistent or even opposite gws trends from well observations and grace estimates further illustrate that the leakage errors may still present to interfere the grace estimates of gws depletion in four subregions during p2 gws in subregions a and d showed an increasing trend of 7 7 1 8 and 11 2 2 3 mm yr respectively from well observations but those estimated from grace were 1 2 0 7 and 17 0 5 7 mm yr respectively for subregions b and c gws trends from well observations were 5 4 1 1 and 7 8 2 1 mm yr respectively whereas that estimated from grace were 11 4 4 3 and 26 2 7 4 mm yr table 1 this is interesting because grace detected the small trend of gws recovery in subregion a but was unable to detect the large trend of gws recovery in subregion d the main reason for this is that grace has the potential to detect the signal within a smaller area if the mass change is highly concentrated and with a sufficiently large magnitude longuevergne et al 2013 existing studies have successfully applied grace data to detect reservoir water impoundment ice melting and groundwater depletion in areas as small as 400 km2 e g chen et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2011 wang et al 2011 yi et al 2017 according to the well observations shown in fig 3b the gws recovery in ncp is likewise highly concentrated in subregion a i e beijing which is intrinsically similar to the reservoir water impoundment but occurring below the land surface hence it is reasonable to anticipate that grace may have the potential to detect the sub regional gws recovery in ncp but not yet able to estimate the magnitude accurately due to the signal leakage 3 4 uncertainty estimation the monthly errors of gws estimation from well observations shown as the pink envelopes in fig 5 were quantified by assuming a 20 uncertainty of the specific yield and storage coefficient by referring to the studies of huang et al 2015 and pan et al 2017 the errors of grace gws shown as green envelopes in fig 5 were calculated by propagating the errors of grace tws and clm simulated sms swe and cws the error of grace tws was derived by considering the calibration error as provided in grace jpl mascon solution watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2018 the leakage errors were not considered herein because the scale factors were used for calibrate grace tws prior to the uncertainty estimation this may underestimate the error of tws if the scale factors used cannot eliminate the leakage errors completely clm does not provide the error estimation for the simulated variables hence the errors of sms swe and cws was calculated as one standard deviation of the simulations from four gldas models pan et al 2017 table 2 summarizes the estimated monthly mean errors of tws and its components in ncp pp ecp and four subregions as seen the errors of in situ observed gws range 13 1 19 8 mm month in ncp and its subregions gws in ecp has the highest error implying a highly uneven changes of gws within subregion the errors of grace gws range 31 3 39 1 mm month dominated by grace tws errors 30 2 37 7 mm month and followed by the errors of three clm simulated water storage components 8 1 12 0 mm month by comparison the error of gws estimated by grace data is about two times larger than that estimated by well observations table 2 this hints that the in situ gw measurements by in situ wells will be indispensable for monitoring gws recovery in ncp 4 concluding remarks this study addresses the important science question that whether mrp has contributed to gws recovery in ncp since its mrp operation in december 2014 to this end long term gw level data from 617 monitoring wells 559 unconfined and 58 confined wells in ncp were used to analyse the spatiotemporal variations of gws before and after the mrp operation i e the p1 period of 2003 2014 and p2 period of 2015 2018 the satellite measured tws data from grace and grace fo were also used in conjunction with model simulations to estimate gws in ncp and four sub regions providing an independent validation against the well based observational gws estimates particularly on the sub regional spatial patterns the main causes for observed sub regional gws depletion p1 and recovery p2 were investigated through the analyses of precipitation p pumping qp and mrp diverted water qd data at each of 14 cities along the mrp conveyance route for the entire ncp gws estimate from well observations showed a 19 1 5 1 mm yr of decreasing trend during p1 compared to that from grace of 24 7 8 0 mm yr however gws estimate from wells showed a 1 8 0 7 mm yr of increasing trend during p2 in contrast to the estimate from grace of 16 6 4 7 mm yr sub regional gws recovery in ncp can be observed from well data in water receiving cities along the mrp conveyance route also in consistency with the received mrp water and pumping reduction data in each city gws depletion of 34 3 4 7 mm yr during p1 and recovery of 4 9 1 3 mm yr during p2 occur mainly in the unconfined aquifers of pp which are considerably larger than 2 0 1 5 and 3 6 1 1 mm yr in ecp yet grace is difficult to distinguish the respective signals in pp and ecp due to signal leakage the following specific findings at the sub regional scales can be summarized from this study 1 for the total 617 wells 67 88 of the unconfined confined wells had decreasing trends during p1 while the numbers decreasing to only 48 36 during p2 indicating gws recovery occurred in both unconfined and confined gws in ncp after mrp operation 2 significant gws recovery 30 mm yr was observed in most of the 87 wells all unconfined near beijing attributed to both 8 of increase in p and 0 6 km3 yr decrease in qp due to received mrp qd 1 1 km3 yr 22 4 of total qd diverted to ncp during p2 3 significant gws recovery 20 mm yr was observed in 25 unconfined wells at the agricultural regions near shijiazhuang xingtai and handan attributed to the decreasing qp increasing p and likely the resulting increase in lateral inflow recharge from west bordering taihang mountain 4 gws recovery in the confined aquifers 4 mm yr was found in hengshui due specifically to the 20 decrease in qp as the result of recent policy enforcement of well shutdown since qd was as small as 0 1 km3 yr and p was decreased by 13 5 grace indeed has the potential to locate gws depletion and recovery hotspots at the sub regional scales of ncp smaller than the spatial resolution 100 000 km2 but with considerable leakage errors interfering the accuracy of estimated variability and trend magnitude this study highlights that gws in ncp has started a gradual transition from depletion to recovery in the major water receiving areas of the mrp water diversion but it remains to be observed and investigated whether the trend will be reversed again under future more frequent drought occurrence credit authorship contribution statement chong zhang

4584,this paper focuses on laboratory experiments designed to investigate the influence of dynamic shaking on water level fluctuations in boreholes completed in unconsolidated sediments a large flume filled with natural sandy sediments was subjected to horizontal dynamic loading at different frequencies 0 5 15 hz and accelerations 0 1 g 0 15 g 0 25 g and 0 5 g generated by a shaking table thus the change in characteristics of the water and saturated sediments were investigated i e how water levels and hydraulic properties change with time are of significant interest a range of different of water level changes following oscillating pore pressure for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flowing conditions were observed oscillation step rise step rise with oscillation and step drop with oscillation similar to those observed in the field after earthquakes we found that water level declines occur when the imposed frequency is less than 2 hz while the magnitude of acceleration shows weak correlation with the water level change when it is less than 0 5 g sinusoidal wave propagation reduces hydraulic conductivity first sharply stabilizes and is then followed by a constant value with a slight increase heterogeneous consolidation mechanical resonance compaction dilation and re packing of the grain structure may constitute physically plausible mechanisms for water level fluctuations and hydraulic parameter adjustment laboratory experiments can therefore provide an insight and a quantitative process oriented approach to better understand groundwater level response to

earthquakes cooper et al 1965 liu et al 1989 quility and roeloffs 1997 roeloffs 1998 chia et al 2001 brodsky et al 2003 kano and yanagidani 2006 wang 2007 gulley et al 2013 shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 groundwater level changes following earthquakes can be subcategorized into three major types by field observations oscillations step like changes and sustained changes cooper et al 1965 roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 shi et al 2013 shi 2015 in the context with the chi chi earthquake in taiwan and multiple earthquakes in new zealand changes in groundwater levels have very prominently been recorded because of the large number of monitoring wells in particular shallow wells completed in unconsolidated sedimentary deposits during the chi chi earthquake observation wells in the confined aquifer of the choushui river sedimentary fan located at large distances from the main fault showed a co seismic stepwise rise wang et al 2001 2004 cox et al 2012 of the 161 wells monitored in new zealand groundwater level records in gravel aquifers showed in total 203 water level changes with 122 increases and 81 decreases while nine wells showed no response to any of the 9 earthquakes weaver et al 2019 static and dynamic stress or strain generated by an earthquake can both trigger groundwater level fluctuations in monitoring wells the basic physics describing the effect of dynamic stress comprises three different patterns poroelastic deformation and fluid flow permanent deformation and liquefaction manga and wang 2015 several models have been proposed to explain water level changes on the basis of the above deformation patterns i e elastic strain models wakita 1975 ge and stover 2000 igarashi and wakita 1991 jónsson et al 2003 hsu and vucetic 2004 shi et al 2013 undrained consolidated or liquefaction models roeloffs 1998 wang and chia 2008 cooper model cooper et al 1965 bubble nucleation models crews and cooper 2014a 2014b enhanced permeability models matsumoto et al 2003 matsumoto and roeloffs 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 wang et al 2016 for instance cooper et al 1965 proposed a model to quantitatively describe the co seismic oscillation of well water level in an one dimensional homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer kipp 1985 improved the model equation allowing for well structure and the effect of water momentum liu et al 1989 and lin 2007 characterized the seismic parameters groundwater level data and the frequency domain using the fourier transform method and found that the amplitude magnification ratio is smaller than the cooper theoretical curve and peaked at a certain period the modified frequency dependent response curve of the groundwater level in a well to dynamic stress in an aquifer can be determined the previous studies may explain the mechanism that leads to the observed fluid level oscillations in groundwater wells however they remain unsupported by field experiments primarily due to the inherent complexity of the natural system this complexity manifests that there are multiple influencing factors involved such as magnitude of earthquakes distance from epicenter to groundwater well depths of aquifer aquifer thickness aquifer material confined or unconfined aquifer hydrologic properties transmissivity storage coefficient and borehole and well geometry these factors might make the experiment more complex and hinder our ability to extract meaningful results although laboratory experiments are not a direct approach to studying field scale mechanisms they still could provide an opportunity to explore it by controlling various settings such as boundary conditions in addition laboratory experiments enable identification of the primary mechanisms responsible for water level change in wells several previous laboratory experiments were performed to understand the relationship between changes in dynamic stress and permeability which aims to provide evidence for a better interpretation on the groundwater level response to earthquakes i e high transmissivity favors large water level amplitudes applying the oscillatory stress ranges between 0 05 and 75 hz pore pressure axial displacement or axial stress to rocks and cores the results show both increases and decreases in permeability with only a minutes of recovery time response type shows both transient and permanent and the data also indicates that clogging unclogging of fractures is responsible for the transient effective permeability shmonov et al 1999 roberts 2005 liu and manga 2009 elkhoury et al 2011 in their experiment crews and cooper 2014a and crews and cooper 2014b subjected a consolidated sandstone core to small amplitude dynamic stress generating water level changes without directly affecting hydraulic conductivity some experiments on liquefaction of saturated sands had been conducted applying pulsating loading in a triaxial setting or by using a centrifuge without a monitoring well the results indicate that void ratio confining pressure and magnitude of cycle stress or amplitude of strain are together control resistance to liquefaction seed and lee 1966 dobry 1989 dief 2000 however the near field hydrological response to earthquakes in monitoring wells at shallow depths and in unconsolidated materials is still much less well studied manga and wang 2015 there are few reports on the results of lab experiments simulating water level changes in shallow wells in unconsolidated materials caused by earthquakes in this paper we present experimental results from a shaking table where we explore the influence of dynamic loading on fluid level fluctuations that arise in an unconsolidated sand sample this is a novel large 1 m laboratory approach on how do time varying shaking change fluid levels which are measured by high precision sensors in a number of monitoring wells of different scenarios we systematically vary dynamic shaking by imposing different sine waves of shaking patterns at a range of amplitudes and frequency measuring the pressure head in the sediments in order to examine the fluid level response of the system our data collecting system can acquire pore pressure and water level information in real time and with sufficient accuracy then we could discuss laboratory observations in much more detail than field types of well responses 2 experimental methodology 2 1 experimental apparatus our experiment focuses on a simplified model of a porous medium with monitoring wells recharge and discharge devices and data collection system during the passage of a sine wave the aquifer was simplified to a sand layer of uniform silica sands of grain sizes ranging between 1 5 10 4 m and 3 0 10 4 m and a thickness of 0 80 m the sand layer was placed in a test cell of dimensions 2 60 1 00 1 30 m3 above the sand layer was a clay layer of 0 50 m thick to represent the confined conditions three observation boreholes no 1 2 and 3 with radii of 0 025 m were installed in the sand layer as fully penetrating wells so that water could enter the boreholes across the entire thickness of the sand layer the influent tank and outlet tank were kept at a constant head condition in every experiment in order to significantly minimize the boundary effects two thin layers of granular rubber sleeves with small holes were placed at the box wall sand layer boundary fig 1 and fig s1 to reproduce the effect of an earthquake the container was shaken at a predesigned frequency and amplitude by a shaking table the table will move at a certain displacement as the sine wave is being translated the frequency ranges from 0 5 to 15 hz and the horizontal peak acceleration is from 0 1 g to 0 5 g the table size was 3 00 3 00 m maximum load was 16 000 kg maximum displacement of table is 0 20 m in the x horizontal direction and 0 15 m in the z horizontal direction a schematic illustration of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental scenarios and data collection a host of hydrogeological changes are produced by seismic waves and these phenomena remain poorly understood even conceptually let alone quantitatively they are influenced by many factors the most important one is the complexity of seismic waves which comprise multiple frequencies and which are composed of multiple simple harmonics their propagation in aquifers is not yet predictable therefore based on the principle from simple to complex the simplest wave form a sine wave was firstly considered in this experimental study the shaking table vibrates only in a single horizontal direction x or z direction 24 scenarios were designed for the experimental series including hydrostatic and seepage flowing conditions table 1 the behavior of the system depends on the period and acceleration of sine wave applied to it therefore the experimental data such as piezometric head pore pressure water level in wells and acceleration would be measured and recorded eighteen pore pressure monitoring holes which were set at one side of the seepage simulation box in a three row by six column array and connected to external pressure monitoring tubes the depths of the three rows are 0 20 m 0 40 m and 0 60 m below the aquitard aquifer interface the space between the inlet and outlet tank was split into five vertical sections among the six column pressure holes section 1 5 the pore pressure sensors were placed at 0 20 m depth intervals close to the screen of each well comprising in a total nine sensors the technical information on sensors used in experiment is shown in table s1 three accelerometers of type boyuan 941b with a resolution of 5 10 6 m s2 were also placed at 0 20 m depth intervals close to the screen of well no 2 and two other accelerometers were located on the top of the experimental flume and on the shaking table itself fig 1 water levels were recorded in every well by pressure transducers of type solinist levelogger 5 with an accuracy of 2 5 10 3 m at a rate of 8 recordings per second while pore pressure sensors of type hrct hc 25 with an accuracy of 0 04 kpa were placed in the sand layer recording at a sampling rate of 256 samples s table s1 2 3 experimental procedures our experiments were carried out in the earthquake simulation lab at the institute of disaster prevention of china every experiment comprised three stages the preparatory stage shaking stage and hydraulic conductivity measurement stage we monitored the response of the water saturated sandy unconsolidated layer covered on top by a clay layer loaded by lead weights to represent overburden load the experimental apparatus was allowed to equilibrate for 24 h before the experiment in order to check whether the piezometric level was higher than the top of the sand layer and the clay layer was penetrated the sand layer was seemed as one well sealed confined aquifer due to the water level above the interface stay constant and the clay layer was not damaged once the entire system was ready and the piezometric levels reached steady state we activated the shaking table with stochastic waves with low shaking accelerations to make the sands densification further after that the aquifer system was kept static for 24 h we started the first type of experiment with the recharge and discharge valves switched off to ascertain hydrostatic conditions the data recording duration of each test lasted approximately two hours during which time the water level returned to steady state conditions we then turned on the valves and carried out a darcy flow experiment to assess hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer we changed drainage conditions after a given run throughout the second type of test a constant hydraulic gradient between inflow and outflow tank was imposed this is described as drained condition discharge and piezometric levels were measured continuously throughout the shaking all scenarios with different frequencies accelerations and duration of 35 s are shown in table 1 the inlet and outlet were closed during the shaking interval in scenarios 1 5 and 18 24 and then re opened afterward while the inlet and outlet were always kept open under the flow condition scenario 6 17 two types of flow regimes were defined saturated conditions with no head difference between inlet and outlet tank i e no flow in x direction and saturated conditions with head difference i e flow in x direction whether under the hydrostatic or flow drained conditions at least one of the two tanks influent and outlet is not filled with water while pressure head in two sides are greater than the height of sand layer figs 1 and 2 the hydrostatic scenarios means between undrained and drained condition not strictly undrained conditions while the other ones mean drained condition 3 results 3 1 water level variations in wells three types of water level responses have been observed in the twenty four scenarios of dynamic shaking experiments oscillation step like changes step rise with oscillation and step drop with oscillation oscillation gradual changes table 2 fig 3 we recorded that water level oscillations were the most common responses following the shaking in all three wells and step like changes with oscillation represented the second most common changes that is oscillations accompanied by other responses these phenomena are similar to the shapes of co seismic water level changes recognized in field studies shi 2015 under hydrostatic conditions changes in water level observed during twelve shaking tests mainly showed oscillation rise while for horizontal flow conditions in addition to oscillations water level fluctuations also exhibited two other types oscillation and step like changes fig s2 fig 4 shows the observed water level changes varying with the frequency and inputting peak horizontal acceleration of a sine wave with initially hydrostatic condition there was a significant decline rather than rise in water level fluctuation at low shaking accelerations a 0 1 g with the acceleration increasing to 0 15 g the amplitude of the response water level rises rapidly for even larger imposed accelerations 0 25 g and 0 5 g no larger decrease or increase in water level change was observed the maximum magnitude of water level variation in all three wells occurred when f was set at 10 hz and a at 0 15 g we also found that when the shaking was set to low frequencies 0 5 hz 1 hz and 2 hz a decline of the water level was the most common type of response fig 4 for even larger imposed frequencies 5 hz 10 hz 15 hz it was observed that water level in wells mainly increased from the experiment results we can therefore identify three behaviors the variation of water level for horizontal flow conditions is lower than that for hydrostatic conditions there is no obvious correlation between the amplitude of water level and the magnitude of inputting acceleration when acceleration is lower than 0 5 g however connectivity between the aquifer and the two tanks has a significant effect on the magnitude of water level change the frequencies play an important role in determining resultant type of water level fluctuation 3 2 variations in pore fluid pressure oscillations step like changes step rise with oscillation and step drop with oscillation oscillation gradual changes in pore pressure were recorded as a category of water level each curve of pore pressure change was accompanied by oscillations pore pressure had similar shapes independent of the type of the hydraulic regime and the amplitude ranged between 0 01 and 2 33 kpa 0 02 and 0 29 kpa the spectra of the water level and pore pressure shown in fig 5 well no 2 as an example exhibits double or multiple frequency peaks that could be interpreted as the result of a mechanical resonance when applying a load of 0 5 hz the pore pressure spectrum exhibited two peaks with the first at 0 5 hz and the second at 1 hz the water level spectra exhibited four peaks at 0 5 hz 1 hz 2 hz and 4 hz a system that oscillates naturally at 0 5 hz can be expected to have lower resonances at 1 hz 2 hz 4 hz and 8 hz in addition there are no significant depth dependent variations in pore pressure during shaking fig 6 this may illustrate that pore pressure accumulation and dissipation are relatively uniform in this small scale rectangular box 3 3 changes in hydraulic conductivity although enhanced permeability and permeability reduction hypothesis have been proposed to explain field observations roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 wang et al 2016 direct measurement of permeability change of an aquifer during an earthquake is not available here we chose five sections at three different depths to investigate the hydraulic conductivity k changes of the unconsolidated sediments figs 1 and 2 mean k was calculated based on darcy s law using the measured pressure heads and discharge data after each shaking test table s2 our data indicate that in the four sections hydraulic conductivity first decreased to 35 m d section 2 32 m d section 3 30 m d section 4 and 29 m d section 5 then it kept steady and increased the general trend of k slightly decreased after all the shaking experiments with the mean initial and final hydraulic conductivity of the confined sand layer is 41 m d and 39 m d while in section 1 k first stayed constant then increased with the initial and final value of the confined sand layer is 39 m d and 46 m d fig 7 the values of k are ranked as follows sections 1 to 5 in the initial stage changing to a unidirectional decreased from sections 1 to 5 by the end of the experiment fig 7 4 discussion to fully understand groundwater level fluctuation phenomena induced by shaking in unconsolidated sediments and to illustrate the behavioral regimes observed in a laboratory flume it is necessary to further quantitatively describe some of the experimental results such as the characteristics of perturbations water level and pore pressure responses as well as changes in fluid flux and deformation of the sediments controlling factors for the mechanical deformation of sediments would be identified we finally will explain the mechanisms for water level and pore pressure changes hydraulic parameter evolution and the transition from one stage to another 4 1 understanding the changes in hydraulic parameters at equilibrium initial values of the hydraulic parameters porosity n hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficient s can be defined for the saturated granular sedimentary material the average initial k is 41 m d before the shaking test after each shaking test we conducted a flow experiment and calculated k by darcy s law we performed a darcy flow experiment after the shaking of each scenario while we did not conduct contrast darcy flow experiment before next shaking scenarios our model can be conceptualized as a series of driven damped coupled harmonic oscillators in three dimensions with anisotropy in the stress strain relationship arising from the vertical degree of freedom associated with boreholes oscillations shaking a confined aquifer will redistribute pressure simply by mounding up water in some areas while displacing it from others and it potentially produces co seismic water level rise and fall reynolds number were less than 1 hydraulic gradients were correctly estimated based on the difference between measured piezometric heads at the wall of the model box boundary and the variation of water levels in the three boreholes in the flow domain we found that head gradients differ by about 10 2 and the trend tends to be the same table s2 and fig s3 there is a chance that fast and preferential flow occurred during the experiment with the result that k and porosity potentially large for example at the interface between the sand and clay layer still since the deformation of the sedimentary layer not necessarily generates additional higher conductivity flow paths parallel to the head gradient and because of the rearrangement of the loose sands this effect might be of minor relevance we assumed that the influence of wall flow effects could be neglected and that the estimated k typically represents the real general trend of change over an area each establishment of equilibrium after the imposed oscillations corresponds respectively to different hydraulic conductivity readjustment while local heterogeneities may still be present changes in hydraulic conductivity of the sands layer can be categorized into two stages the first 11 scenarios and the last 13 tests fig 7 and table 3 in the first stage with dynamic loadings of different frequencies and accelerations were imposed on the system which could redistribute particles and enhance consolidation of the aquifer the original equilibrium would be altered and the other equilibrium state would be reached furthermore hydraulic conductivity first decreased to a stable value in the second stage a series of shaking experiments lead to mechanical deformation when the sediments finally reached equilibrium during these shaking processes the medium grains were further rearranged in the whole cell experimental results show hydraulic conductivity to increase returning later to a stable value and not increase to the initial value we can therefore identify two types of behavior for the confined saturated sedimentary material observed for both stages change in k of the granular sediments reflects the process of compaction of the loose to a compacted sediment at the end of the first 11 shaking tests after that it was subjected to further shaking tests so the motions of the medium not cease totally under the condition of the imposed oscillations which broke the mechanical balance between particles the particles moved relative to each other creating new pores and opening new pathways with the effect that k increased to a value however it didn t return to the pre shaking level and the final k was lower than the original one in addition a change in flow rate and turbidity resulting from the suspended fines were observed indicating that the pores of the sand layer were unclogged due to shaking and have lots of fine particles that were washed out during the experiments surprisingly the change in k observed in section 1 was an exception fig 7 during the first stage k did not change while during the second stage k increased to a constant value that change in k of section 1 differ from other sections shows that local heterogeneities may be present over a lab scale area after all the shaking tests the final k was measured at about 39 m d the experimental results show that shaking causes compaction of the saturated sand layer sustained change in permeability had been often linked to a variation in effective porosity as a result of the perturbations next we analyzed the parameters at the final equilibrium state with respect to the relationships among the three k n and s here we employed an empirical relationship between the change in porosity and permeability to estimate and illustrate the magnitude a change in porosity resulting from the shaking dynamics for well sorted unconsolidated granular porous media the correlation between permeability and porosity is often expressed by kozeny carman equation carman 1956 costa 2006 1 k n 3 5 s 0 2 1 n 2 2 k k ρ g μ the storage coefficient may also change during the experiment which was calculated by bear 2013 3 s ρ g α n β where for spheres with diameter d0 s0 6 d0 n is porosity k is hydraulic conductivity ρ is the density of fluid g is acceleration of gravity µ is the viscosity of fluid α represents the compressibility of the porous sedimentary material and β is the fluid compressibility here the fluid is water with fluid density compressibility and viscosity being ρ 1 0 103 kg m3 β 4 6 10 10 m2 n and μ 10 3 pa s respectively with the acceleration of gravity is 9 8 m2 s the granular phase is quartz grains we further assumed that grains of an average diameter d0 2 5 10 4 m fig 8 shows the evolution of porosity at each section and average porosity at given layers following shaking the initial and final porosity are 0 40 and 0 39 respectively the overall variation of porosity is consistent with the evolution of the hydraulic conductivity of the sections and layers at different depths a co seismic decrease in porosity occurred at the time of the first few experiments scenarios 1 7 only minor changes were observed in scenarios 8 11 of the first stage a co seismic increase in porosity was observed in scenarios 12 15 of the second stage porosity stayed constant in scenarios 16 24 with a final value of 0 39 still less than the pre seismic one the evolution of the storage coefficient is coincides with the trend of change in k and n with a very small total change table 3 as apparent from the deformation distribution diagram assessed after the experiments along the flow direction from sections 1 to 5 the compaction deformation is mainly distributed in the two sides of layered sediments pore pressure sensors position was 0 04 m to 0 10 m higher than before the experiment in the area close to the outlet an indication of sediments expanded slightly table 4 fig 9 this interpretation assists in understanding of the development of hydraulic conductivity in space and time following the shaking experiments i e the initial decrease in hydraulic conductivity followed by a phase of constant hydraulic conductivity and a final increase recalling the process of our experiments unperturbed loose sediments undergo compression and dilation induced by sine wave propagation in an experimental cell subjected to accelerations between 0 1 g and 0 5 g the intergranular stress is progressively transferred to the interstitial pore water which alternately raises lowers and oscillates the pore fluid pressure through contraction and expansion of the intergranular pore space during the first stage of the tests the sediments compact or consolidate after the first few tests the framework of the grains tends to compact with a resultant decrease in hydraulic conductivity porosity and storage coefficient in the field studies co seismic reduction in permeability was observed as a result of remobilization and transport of suspended fines eventually clogging up pathways and fractures shi et al 2018 yan et al 2016 such a process requires a high level of shaking energy vucetic 1994 e g shear induced consolidation rutter et al 2016 wang et al 2001 or liquefaction wang 2007 in fact when consolidated or compacted sediments are cyclically sheared beyond a critical threshold pore volume changes microfracture and preferential flow pathways may be generated leading to an increase in porosity and hydraulic conductivity and decreased pore pressure previous experiments of pore unclogging elkhoury et al 2011 liu and manga 2009 and earthquake induced turbidity increase of discharging groundwater prior and lohmann 2003 led to the hypothesis of permeability enhancement via colloidal dislodgement our results are believed to support the mechanism of creating new pore volume pore unclogging and colloidal dislodgement considering that the unconsolidated sediment in the experimental box is composed of permeable loose sands the first several shakings inevitably can be expected to lead to the decreases in the volume of the porous material and the pore space i e consolidation in contrast shear deformation of densely compacted sedimentary material can be visualized as grains to roll over each other thereby creating new pore space the increase in volume of the sedimentary layers is known as dilatancy in addition the magnitude of change in fluid level and hydraulic parameters partly depends on the flow regime i e hydrostatic and flow condition our experimental results can find their equivalent in field during diagenesis of sedimentary materials a loose unconsolidated sedimentary column is first compacted in alluvial fans of different types of materials i e granular sand and gravel as well as fines composed of clay minerals and silt eventually forming aquifers and aquitards initially the sedimentary column is loosely compacted at this stage permeability of the aquifer can be defined by some initial value after several small earthquakes the aquifer becomes more compacted and decreases in permeability less frequent but higher intensity earthquakes can possibly lead to an increase in permeability following the above process model this process depends on multiple influencing factors difficult to identify and quantify at this stage the findings changes in hydraulic conductivity of our experiment may however still explain the effects and phenomena observed at field scale hence the driving mechanism for changes in hydraulic parameters can be explained by the mechanical deformation and compaction of unconsolidated heterogeneous sediments followed by the redistribution pressure dilation and re packing of the grain structure a future experiment could investigate smaller scale cross hole hydraulic conductivity in two or three directions before and after shaking to further assess how it changes moreover if possible this experiment should be repeated in a block of consolidated rock with uncased boreholes for piezometric observations 4 2 potential mechanism of changes in water level as noted earlier changes in water level frequently act like sustained increase or decrease step like changes and oscillations following earthquakes while their potential mechanisms have been the subject of controversy in large part because there are so many key factors that influence observations and a low number of high quality data available for distinguishing between results in this study we try to explain the origins of water level fluctuation in wells curve shape and magnitude of water level change of an experimental unconsolidated confined aquifer model following sinusoidal dynamic loadings pore pressure data recorded by the sensors were categorized according to their types and shapes pore pressures and water levels appear to behave analogously for hydrostatic and flow conditions different only with respect to their amplitudes for the hydrostatic conditions the type of water level change could be described by oscillation decline 3 times and oscillation rise 9 times while the two types rise and decline were equal in numbers for flow conditions now we first make clear why the shape of the water level change varied with different scenarios even for the same well for a monitoring well we consider the following three factors the characteristics of disturbance waves acceleration frequency the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments and the flow regime i e drained or undrained condition for hydrostatic experiments scenarios 2 5 and scenarios 21 24 and flow experiments scenarios 10 11 and 15 17 when the granular porous material was sheared by a horizontal sinusoidal wave action at frequencies larger than 2 hz the number of loading cycles was 175 5 hz 350 10 hz and 525 15 hz grains tend to compact with a decrease in the pore volume and an increase in pore pressure the accumulated pore pressure will tend to dissipate in the direction of the borehole with a consequential increase in the water level whether there is a persistent increase or step like change in water level depends on the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic diffusivity along the path of pore pressure diffusion to the monitoring well for high accumulation rates in pore pressure the hydraulic conductivity diffusivity in monitoring well direction is small and the pore pressure dissipation rate is large this type of constellation results in a sudden increase in water level i e the step like rise in the water level in the field undrained consolidation of saturated sediments had been observed to lead to the step like changes in water levels wang et al 2001 manga et al 2003 wang and chia 2008 in contrast for hydraulic conductivity diffusivity and therefore pore pressure dissipation rates being large a gradual and sustained increase in water levels can be observed in scenario 18 20 sinusoidal waves with frequencies of less than 2 hz were imposed on hydrostatic conditions the number of loading cycles were 17 5 0 5 hz 35 1 hz and 70 2 hz respectively displacement of the shaking table to either side is significantly greater than that caused by other frequencies 5 hz 10 hz and 15 hz the shaking is believed to force sediment grains to roll over each other and to trigger an expansion of the grain structure and therefore an increase in pore volume reducing pore pressure with a consequential decrease in water level however for flow scenarios 6 7 12 13 14 shaking caused water level fluctuations of different amplitude of decline when sine wave with frequency less than 2 hz in the above scenarios 6 7 12 13 14 water level in wells declined indicating that the sediments had undergone shaking induced dilatancy with shear stress driving particle rearrangement followed by an increase in pore volume for flow scenarios as the water moved energy is also being dissipated rapidly which governed by the permeability of the sands and the pore geometry with viscosity of the fluid being constant this contributes to shaking energy attenuation we may explain the amplitude of water level changes for experiments with hydrostatic conditions being larger than those with flow conditions here we also use v c to calculate the strain of sediments induced by dynamic loading where v is the amplitude of the particle velocity and c is the wave propagation speed for a wave with frequency f using v a0 2πf where a0 is the amplitude of acceleration the seismic strain amplitude is a0 2πfc manga et al 2012 strain amplitudes ranged between 10 4 to 10 3 in most of the cases while the amplitude were 8 84 10 5 and 9 63 10 5 in scenario 5 and 11 with a shaking frequency of 15 hz for both experiments table 5 shear induced dilation and consolidated in saturated unconsolidated deposits lead to the observed step like change in water level when strain exceeded about 10 4 for undrained conditions wang et al 2001 manga et al 2003 wang and chia 2008 manga and wang 2015 coincidentally we found in our experiments that pore pressure changed when the cyclic shear strain amplitude was approximately 10 4 we performed hypothesis testing using a significance level of 5 the relationship between frequency acceleration recordings porosity hydraulic conductivity strain amplitude and water level change was evaluated for both for both hydrostatic condition and flow condition hypothesis tests results show that the change in water level under hydrostatic conditions is significantly correlated with pore pressure hydraulic conductivity and porosity changes while water level changes under flow conditions is significantly correlated with frequency pore pressure change and strain amplitude see hypothesis testing results in table s3 under hydrostatic conditions the correlation coefficient between the change in water level and pore pressure was the strongest r2 0 92 with the relationship between hydraulic conductivity r2 0 71 and porosity r2 0 68 came second fig 10 for flow conditions strong correlation was observed between water level and pore pressure changes r2 0 75 and between water level change and strain amplitude r2 0 77 then between water level change and frequency r2 0 41 the sand layer in the experimental set up was observed to deform following the impact by the sinusoidal shaking in contrast to our laboratory experiment the fluctuating pressure in an aquifer cannot be directly measured at field scale the strong correlation between pore pressure and the water level change and there is a distinction between amplitude of water levels and pore pressure it is unlikely to be the result of coincidence we therefore explored the reason for the difference between the amplitude of water level in wells and pore fluid pressure for our lab observations cooper et al 1965 proposed an amplification ratio a of water level oscillation to pressure head fluctuation during earthquakes 4 a 1 ω r w 2 2 t k e i α w ω 2 h e g 2 ω r w 2 2 t ker α w 2 1 2 in which ω is the angular frequency of the seismic wave r w is the radius of the well t is the transmissivity of the aquifer s is the storage coefficient of the aquifer g is the acceleration due to gravity h e h 0 3 8 d is the effective height of the water column in the well and h 0 is the height of water column in the casing ker α w and kei α w are kelvin functions the real and imaginary parts of k 0 α w i 1 2 respectively which is the zeroth order modified bessel function of the second kind and α w r w ω s t 1 2 we calculated the amplification factor a of cooper s solution and the observed amplification factor a using the water level and pore pressure data from our experiment the procedure of the calculation of a is as follows first water level and pore pressure data were converted using the fast fourier transform fft producing a series of frequency spectra by extracting their peak values we obtained the actual amplification factor a ρgx0 p0 5 tables s4 and s5 for each scenario the theoretical amplification factors a of well no 2 are less than 1 0 which indicates that the observation wells have no amplification effect on pressure head fluctuation fig 11 shows a strong dependence of the frequency on amplification ratio which implies that it is much easier to magnify the magnitude of pore pressure change at lower frequencies 0 5 hz 1 hz and 2 hz than at higher ones 5 hz 10 hz and 15 hz our results are consistent with the knowledge obtained from field research for pressure disturbances with very short periods less than 0 5 s the water level in the well does not respond rapidly enough to keep up with the pressure disturbance in the aquifer and the well acts as a low pass filter tending not to respond a 0 hsieh et al 1987 the sinusoidal shaking was with a range of period from 0 067 to 2 s 15 hz to 0 5 hz in our experiments therefore all the theoretical factors turn out to be a 1 next we calculated the actual amplification ratio for an observation well and a given wave period the amplification factor a should only show one single value based on the theoretical analytical solution of cooper et al 1965 however the change in pressure head of the whole aquifer in eq 5 is replaced by the value of the middle point of the well in the process of calculation actually the amplitude of pressure head varies at different depths of sand layer three pressure head fluctuations at each depth near the observation well no 2 were monitored during each shaking based on cooper s assumption and the amplification factor definition the actual amplification factor a showed three values for each test after comparing the two factors tables s4 and s5 fig 11 we found that a were larger than 1 0 in 13 of the 24 scenarios for all experiments with different frequencies 0 5 hz to 15 hz the a and a differ considerably with respect to their magnitude especially for flow conditions scenarios 6 to 18 the difference between the two is much larger we can consider that cooper s formula is not applicable if an aquifer is not in perfectly undrained hydrostatic conditions in our experimental set up we cannot ascertain is not under undrained conditions after each shaking disturbance the valve is opened for hydrostatic condition or always keep opening for flow conditions to adjust the pore pressure this explains why a evaluated for our experiments does not meet to the theoretical cooper criteria in addition computation results show that the closer the measuring location to the sands clay interface the larger a a8 the theoretical amplification factor a represents an average value across the depth or the penetration of an observation well while the actual amplification factor also depends on location of the specific pore pressure sensor this implies that the evaluated amplification is also influenced by the depth of the measuring location within the experimental sand layer thus we understand that burial depth of the sensor the thickness of the aquifer well completion i e partially penetrating well fully penetrating and flow regime hydrostatic flow conditions also influence the determination of the amplification factor a the relative importance of each of these factors shall be investigated in the context of future experiments in sum drained and undrained conditions affect largely the accumulation and dissipation of pore pressure during shaking perturbances together with the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters the flow regime influences the pattern of temporal change in pore pressure and water level to a large degree a water level decline is observed in all scenarios of frequencies less than 2 hz with a good frequency dependence in other words it depends on the horizontal displacement of the shaking table and loading cycles whether water level declines are being observed for water level oscillations in wells caused by mechanical resonance in this experiment it is favor of the points that oscillations trigged by resonant coupling of flow between the well and the aquifer when the seismic waves arrive cooper et al 1965 liu et al 1989 kano and yanagidani 2006 wang et al 2009 we observed that water level in wells does not fully reflect the change in pore pressure due to the above amplification effect 5 conclusions in our study we investigated the mechanisms and general physical processes associated with the impact of mechanical periodic loading on a confined saturated granular porous medium at laboratory scale periodic sinusoidal perturbances induces measurable mechanical deformation of the sand layer the deformation leads to changes in pore pressure and the change in pore pressure affects in a hydromechanical recoupled process the deformation in turn pore pressure gradient induces water flow into and out of the observation boreholes recorded in a change in water levels the hydraulic responses to the periodic disturbance at lab scale covered a spectrum of different types of water level fluctuations pore pressure changes hydraulic parameter changes and mechanical deformation suggesting shear induced compaction consolidation and dilation processes in the confined saturated unconsolidated sandy sediments we found that the observed water level changes following dynamic shakings vary with temporal and spatial changes in pore pressure patterns and aquifer flow regime as well as the hydraulic properties flow hydrostatic conditions hydraulic conductivity diffusion between the location of pore pressure sensors and the observation borehole of the sand layer pore pressure accumulation and following hydraulic diffusional flow mainly depend on the period of disturbance number of loading cycles accumulation rate of pore pressure and flow regime dissipation rate of pore pressure because the sand and clay layer are deformed with the deformation being nonuniform and irreversible compaction dilatation or consolidation can be observed resulting in porosity and permeability changes irreversible mechanical deformation of the unconsolidated sediments induced by dynamic shakings is likely to be the main mechanism of water level changes rather than a change in hydraulic parameters the change in hydraulic parameters of the sand layer is an accompanying phenomenon enhancing or dampening the amplitude of water level change as well as the shape of water level patterns there are likely to be multiple mechanisms responsible for the various observed changes in hydraulic responses these are deformation heterogeneous consolidation mechanical resonance permanent deformation dilation redistribution of pressure and re packing of the grain structure at different stages several limitations of our experiments are necessary to state here we cannot repeat each test with the same initial conditions to accurately evaluate the role of changes in shaking frequency and acceleration because of the irreversible deformation of the sand clay layers we also did not check whether the initial status of hydraulic properties was the same as the results of the last experiments the experiment did not allow the strict adherence to hydrostatic and flow conditions because flow and hydrostatic shaking experiments were conducted alternately the impact of a sine wave perturbance in the experiment and real seismic waves on an aquifer is quite different in the experiment we neglected some factors such as boundary effects and the interference between the three wells that might be of importance to the experimental results there are some uncertainties in a small scale flume experiment with respect to assessment of hydraulic conductivity and the estimation of porosity the assumption of the validity of darcy s law and the empirical cozeny carmen relationship in future studies we plan to conduct lab scale pumping slug and tracer experiments before and after shaking to assess the above three important hydraulic parameters we shall also try to include scenarios that model the process of the shaking induces leaks in the confining clay layer credit

filled with natural sandy sediments was subjected to horizontal dynamic loading at different frequencies 0 5 15 hz and accelerations 0 1 g 0 15 g 0 25 g and 0 5 g generated by a shaking table thus the change in characteristics of the water and saturated sediments were investigated i e how water levels and hydraulic properties change with time are of significant interest a range of different of water level changes following oscillating pore pressure for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flowing conditions were observed oscillation step rise step rise with oscillation and step drop with oscillation similar to those observed in the field after earthquakes we found that water level declines occur when the imposed frequency is less than 2 hz while the magnitude of acceleration shows weak correlation with the water level change when it is less than 0 5 g sinusoidal wave propagation reduces hydraulic conductivity first sharply stabilizes and is then followed by a constant value with a slight increase heterogeneous consolidation mechanical resonance compaction dilation and re packing of the grain structure may constitute physically plausible mechanisms for water level fluctuations and hydraulic parameter adjustment laboratory experiments can therefore provide an insight and a quantitative process oriented approach to better understand groundwater level response to

earthquakes cooper et al 1965 liu et al 1989 quility and roeloffs 1997 roeloffs 1998 chia et al 2001 brodsky et al 2003 kano and yanagidani 2006 wang 2007 gulley et al 2013 shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 groundwater level changes following earthquakes can be subcategorized into three major types by field observations oscillations step like changes and sustained changes cooper et al 1965 roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 shi et al 2013 shi 2015 in the context with the chi chi earthquake in taiwan and multiple earthquakes in new zealand changes in groundwater levels have very prominently been recorded because of the large number of monitoring wells in particular shallow wells completed in unconsolidated sedimentary deposits during the chi chi earthquake observation wells in the confined aquifer of the choushui river sedimentary fan located at large distances from the main fault showed a co seismic stepwise rise wang et al 2001 2004 cox et al 2012 of the 161 wells monitored in new zealand groundwater level records in gravel aquifers showed in total 203 water level changes with 122 increases and 81 decreases while nine wells showed no response to any of the 9 earthquakes weaver et al 2019 static and dynamic stress or strain generated by an earthquake can both trigger groundwater level fluctuations in monitoring wells the basic physics describing the effect of dynamic stress comprises three different patterns poroelastic deformation and fluid flow permanent deformation and liquefaction manga and wang 2015 several models have been proposed to explain water level changes on the basis of the above deformation patterns i e elastic strain models wakita 1975 ge and stover 2000 igarashi and wakita 1991 jónsson et al 2003 hsu and vucetic 2004 shi et al 2013 undrained consolidated or liquefaction models roeloffs 1998 wang and chia 2008 cooper model cooper et al 1965 bubble nucleation models crews and cooper 2014a 2014b enhanced permeability models matsumoto et al 2003 matsumoto and roeloffs 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 wang et al 2016 for instance cooper et al 1965 proposed a model to quantitatively describe the co seismic oscillation of well water level in an one dimensional homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer kipp 1985 improved the model equation allowing for well structure and the effect of water momentum liu et al 1989 and lin 2007 characterized the seismic parameters groundwater level data and the frequency domain using the fourier transform method and found that the amplitude magnification ratio is smaller than the cooper theoretical curve and peaked at a certain period the modified frequency dependent response curve of the groundwater level in a well to dynamic stress in an aquifer can be determined the previous studies may explain the mechanism that leads to the observed fluid level oscillations in groundwater wells however they remain unsupported by field experiments primarily due to the inherent complexity of the natural system this complexity manifests that there are multiple influencing factors involved such as magnitude of earthquakes distance from epicenter to groundwater well depths of aquifer aquifer thickness aquifer material confined or unconfined aquifer hydrologic properties transmissivity storage coefficient and borehole and well geometry these factors might make the experiment more complex and hinder our ability to extract meaningful results although laboratory experiments are not a direct approach to studying field scale mechanisms they still could provide an opportunity to explore it by controlling various settings such as boundary conditions in addition laboratory experiments enable identification of the primary mechanisms responsible for water level change in wells several previous laboratory experiments were performed to understand the relationship between changes in dynamic stress and permeability which aims to provide evidence for a better interpretation on the groundwater level response to earthquakes i e high transmissivity favors large water level amplitudes applying the oscillatory stress ranges between 0 05 and 75 hz pore pressure axial displacement or axial stress to rocks and cores the results show both increases and decreases in permeability with only a minutes of recovery time response type shows both transient and permanent and the data also indicates that clogging unclogging of fractures is responsible for the transient effective permeability shmonov et al 1999 roberts 2005 liu and manga 2009 elkhoury et al 2011 in their experiment crews and cooper 2014a and crews and cooper 2014b subjected a consolidated sandstone core to small amplitude dynamic stress generating water level changes without directly affecting hydraulic conductivity some experiments on liquefaction of saturated sands had been conducted applying pulsating loading in a triaxial setting or by using a centrifuge without a monitoring well the results indicate that void ratio confining pressure and magnitude of cycle stress or amplitude of strain are together control resistance to liquefaction seed and lee 1966 dobry 1989 dief 2000 however the near field hydrological response to earthquakes in monitoring wells at shallow depths and in unconsolidated materials is still much less well studied manga and wang 2015 there are few reports on the results of lab experiments simulating water level changes in shallow wells in unconsolidated materials caused by earthquakes in this paper we present experimental results from a shaking table where we explore the influence of dynamic loading on fluid level fluctuations that arise in an unconsolidated sand sample this is a novel large 1 m laboratory approach on how do time varying shaking change fluid levels which are measured by high precision sensors in a number of monitoring wells of different scenarios we systematically vary dynamic shaking by imposing different sine waves of shaking patterns at a range of amplitudes and frequency measuring the pressure head in the sediments in order to examine the fluid level response of the system our data collecting system can acquire pore pressure and water level information in real time and with sufficient accuracy then we could discuss laboratory observations in much more detail than field types of well responses 2 experimental methodology 2 1 experimental apparatus our experiment focuses on a simplified model of a porous medium with monitoring wells recharge and discharge devices and data collection system during the passage of a sine wave the aquifer was simplified to a sand layer of uniform silica sands of grain sizes ranging between 1 5 10 4 m and 3 0 10 4 m and a thickness of 0 80 m the sand layer was placed in a test cell of dimensions 2 60 1 00 1 30 m3 above the sand layer was a clay layer of 0 50 m thick to represent the confined conditions three observation boreholes no 1 2 and 3 with radii of 0 025 m were installed in the sand layer as fully penetrating wells so that water could enter the boreholes across the entire thickness of the sand layer the influent tank and outlet tank were kept at a constant head condition in every experiment in order to significantly minimize the boundary effects two thin layers of granular rubber sleeves with small holes were placed at the box wall sand layer boundary fig 1 and fig s1 to reproduce the effect of an earthquake the container was shaken at a predesigned frequency and amplitude by a shaking table the table will move at a certain displacement as the sine wave is being translated the frequency ranges from 0 5 to 15 hz and the horizontal peak acceleration is from 0 1 g to 0 5 g the table size was 3 00 3 00 m maximum load was 16 000 kg maximum displacement of table is 0 20 m in the x horizontal direction and 0 15 m in the z horizontal direction a schematic illustration of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental scenarios and data collection a host of hydrogeological changes are produced by seismic waves and these phenomena remain poorly understood even conceptually let alone quantitatively they are influenced by many factors the most important one is the complexity of seismic waves which comprise multiple frequencies and which are composed of multiple simple harmonics their propagation in aquifers is not yet predictable therefore based on the principle from simple to complex the simplest wave form a sine wave was firstly considered in this experimental study the shaking table vibrates only in a single horizontal direction x or z direction 24 scenarios were designed for the experimental series including hydrostatic and seepage flowing conditions table 1 the behavior of the system depends on the period and acceleration of sine wave applied to it therefore the experimental data such as piezometric head pore pressure water level in wells and acceleration would be measured and recorded eighteen pore pressure monitoring holes which were set at one side of the seepage simulation box in a three row by six column array and connected to external pressure monitoring tubes the depths of the three rows are 0 20 m 0 40 m and 0 60 m below the aquitard aquifer interface the space between the inlet and outlet tank was split into five vertical sections among the six column pressure holes section 1 5 the pore pressure sensors were placed at 0 20 m depth intervals close to the screen of each well comprising in a total nine sensors the technical information on sensors used in experiment is shown in table s1 three accelerometers of type boyuan 941b with a resolution of 5 10 6 m s2 were also placed at 0 20 m depth intervals close to the screen of well no 2 and two other accelerometers were located on the top of the experimental flume and on the shaking table itself fig 1 water levels were recorded in every well by pressure transducers of type solinist levelogger 5 with an accuracy of 2 5 10 3 m at a rate of 8 recordings per second while pore pressure sensors of type hrct hc 25 with an accuracy of 0 04 kpa were placed in the sand layer recording at a sampling rate of 256 samples s table s1 2 3 experimental procedures our experiments were carried out in the earthquake simulation lab at the institute of disaster prevention of china every experiment comprised three stages the preparatory stage shaking stage and hydraulic conductivity measurement stage we monitored the response of the water saturated sandy unconsolidated layer covered on top by a clay layer loaded by lead weights to represent overburden load the experimental apparatus was allowed to equilibrate for 24 h before the experiment in order to check whether the piezometric level was higher than the top of the sand layer and the clay layer was penetrated the sand layer was seemed as one well sealed confined aquifer due to the water level above the interface stay constant and the clay layer was not damaged once the entire system was ready and the piezometric levels reached steady state we activated the shaking table with stochastic waves with low shaking accelerations to make the sands densification further after that the aquifer system was kept static for 24 h we started the first type of experiment with the recharge and discharge valves switched off to ascertain hydrostatic conditions the data recording duration of each test lasted approximately two hours during which time the water level returned to steady state conditions we then turned on the valves and carried out a darcy flow experiment to assess hydraulic conductivity of the sand layer we changed drainage conditions after a given run throughout the second type of test a constant hydraulic gradient between inflow and outflow tank was imposed this is described as drained condition discharge and piezometric levels were measured continuously throughout the shaking all scenarios with different frequencies accelerations and duration of 35 s are shown in table 1 the inlet and outlet were closed during the shaking interval in scenarios 1 5 and 18 24 and then re opened afterward while the inlet and outlet were always kept open under the flow condition scenario 6 17 two types of flow regimes were defined saturated conditions with no head difference between inlet and outlet tank i e no flow in x direction and saturated conditions with head difference i e flow in x direction whether under the hydrostatic or flow drained conditions at least one of the two tanks influent and outlet is not filled with water while pressure head in two sides are greater than the height of sand layer figs 1 and 2 the hydrostatic scenarios means between undrained and drained condition not strictly undrained conditions while the other ones mean drained condition 3 results 3 1 water level variations in wells three types of water level responses have been observed in the twenty four scenarios of dynamic shaking experiments oscillation step like changes step rise with oscillation and step drop with oscillation oscillation gradual changes table 2 fig 3 we recorded that water level oscillations were the most common responses following the shaking in all three wells and step like changes with oscillation represented the second most common changes that is oscillations accompanied by other responses these phenomena are similar to the shapes of co seismic water level changes recognized in field studies shi 2015 under hydrostatic conditions changes in water level observed during twelve shaking tests mainly showed oscillation rise while for horizontal flow conditions in addition to oscillations water level fluctuations also exhibited two other types oscillation and step like changes fig s2 fig 4 shows the observed water level changes varying with the frequency and inputting peak horizontal acceleration of a sine wave with initially hydrostatic condition there was a significant decline rather than rise in water level fluctuation at low shaking accelerations a 0 1 g with the acceleration increasing to 0 15 g the amplitude of the response water level rises rapidly for even larger imposed accelerations 0 25 g and 0 5 g no larger decrease or increase in water level change was observed the maximum magnitude of water level variation in all three wells occurred when f was set at 10 hz and a at 0 15 g we also found that when the shaking was set to low frequencies 0 5 hz 1 hz and 2 hz a decline of the water level was the most common type of response fig 4 for even larger imposed frequencies 5 hz 10 hz 15 hz it was observed that water level in wells mainly increased from the experiment results we can therefore identify three behaviors the variation of water level for horizontal flow conditions is lower than that for hydrostatic conditions there is no obvious correlation between the amplitude of water level and the magnitude of inputting acceleration when acceleration is lower than 0 5 g however connectivity between the aquifer and the two tanks has a significant effect on the magnitude of water level change the frequencies play an important role in determining resultant type of water level fluctuation 3 2 variations in pore fluid pressure oscillations step like changes step rise with oscillation and step drop with oscillation oscillation gradual changes in pore pressure were recorded as a category of water level each curve of pore pressure change was accompanied by oscillations pore pressure had similar shapes independent of the type of the hydraulic regime and the amplitude ranged between 0 01 and 2 33 kpa 0 02 and 0 29 kpa the spectra of the water level and pore pressure shown in fig 5 well no 2 as an example exhibits double or multiple frequency peaks that could be interpreted as the result of a mechanical resonance when applying a load of 0 5 hz the pore pressure spectrum exhibited two peaks with the first at 0 5 hz and the second at 1 hz the water level spectra exhibited four peaks at 0 5 hz 1 hz 2 hz and 4 hz a system that oscillates naturally at 0 5 hz can be expected to have lower resonances at 1 hz 2 hz 4 hz and 8 hz in addition there are no significant depth dependent variations in pore pressure during shaking fig 6 this may illustrate that pore pressure accumulation and dissipation are relatively uniform in this small scale rectangular box 3 3 changes in hydraulic conductivity although enhanced permeability and permeability reduction hypothesis have been proposed to explain field observations roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 wang et al 2016 direct measurement of permeability change of an aquifer during an earthquake is not available here we chose five sections at three different depths to investigate the hydraulic conductivity k changes of the unconsolidated sediments figs 1 and 2 mean k was calculated based on darcy s law using the measured pressure heads and discharge data after each shaking test table s2 our data indicate that in the four sections hydraulic conductivity first decreased to 35 m d section 2 32 m d section 3 30 m d section 4 and 29 m d section 5 then it kept steady and increased the general trend of k slightly decreased after all the shaking experiments with the mean initial and final hydraulic conductivity of the confined sand layer is 41 m d and 39 m d while in section 1 k first stayed constant then increased with the initial and final value of the confined sand layer is 39 m d and 46 m d fig 7 the values of k are ranked as follows sections 1 to 5 in the initial stage changing to a unidirectional decreased from sections 1 to 5 by the end of the experiment fig 7 4 discussion to fully understand groundwater level fluctuation phenomena induced by shaking in unconsolidated sediments and to illustrate the behavioral regimes observed in a laboratory flume it is necessary to further quantitatively describe some of the experimental results such as the characteristics of perturbations water level and pore pressure responses as well as changes in fluid flux and deformation of the sediments controlling factors for the mechanical deformation of sediments would be identified we finally will explain the mechanisms for water level and pore pressure changes hydraulic parameter evolution and the transition from one stage to another 4 1 understanding the changes in hydraulic parameters at equilibrium initial values of the hydraulic parameters porosity n hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficient s can be defined for the saturated granular sedimentary material the average initial k is 41 m d before the shaking test after each shaking test we conducted a flow experiment and calculated k by darcy s law we performed a darcy flow experiment after the shaking of each scenario while we did not conduct contrast darcy flow experiment before next shaking scenarios our model can be conceptualized as a series of driven damped coupled harmonic oscillators in three dimensions with anisotropy in the stress strain relationship arising from the vertical degree of freedom associated with boreholes oscillations shaking a confined aquifer will redistribute pressure simply by mounding up water in some areas while displacing it from others and it potentially produces co seismic water level rise and fall reynolds number were less than 1 hydraulic gradients were correctly estimated based on the difference between measured piezometric heads at the wall of the model box boundary and the variation of water levels in the three boreholes in the flow domain we found that head gradients differ by about 10 2 and the trend tends to be the same table s2 and fig s3 there is a chance that fast and preferential flow occurred during the experiment with the result that k and porosity potentially large for example at the interface between the sand and clay layer still since the deformation of the sedimentary layer not necessarily generates additional higher conductivity flow paths parallel to the head gradient and because of the rearrangement of the loose sands this effect might be of minor relevance we assumed that the influence of wall flow effects could be neglected and that the estimated k typically represents the real general trend of change over an area each establishment of equilibrium after the imposed oscillations corresponds respectively to different hydraulic conductivity readjustment while local heterogeneities may still be present changes in hydraulic conductivity of the sands layer can be categorized into two stages the first 11 scenarios and the last 13 tests fig 7 and table 3 in the first stage with dynamic loadings of different frequencies and accelerations were imposed on the system which could redistribute particles and enhance consolidation of the aquifer the original equilibrium would be altered and the other equilibrium state would be reached furthermore hydraulic conductivity first decreased to a stable value in the second stage a series of shaking experiments lead to mechanical deformation when the sediments finally reached equilibrium during these shaking processes the medium grains were further rearranged in the whole cell experimental results show hydraulic conductivity to increase returning later to a stable value and not increase to the initial value we can therefore identify two types of behavior for the confined saturated sedimentary material observed for both stages change in k of the granular sediments reflects the process of compaction of the loose to a compacted sediment at the end of the first 11 shaking tests after that it was subjected to further shaking tests so the motions of the medium not cease totally under the condition of the imposed oscillations which broke the mechanical balance between particles the particles moved relative to each other creating new pores and opening new pathways with the effect that k increased to a value however it didn t return to the pre shaking level and the final k was lower than the original one in addition a change in flow rate and turbidity resulting from the suspended fines were observed indicating that the pores of the sand layer were unclogged due to shaking and have lots of fine particles that were washed out during the experiments surprisingly the change in k observed in section 1 was an exception fig 7 during the first stage k did not change while during the second stage k increased to a constant value that change in k of section 1 differ from other sections shows that local heterogeneities may be present over a lab scale area after all the shaking tests the final k was measured at about 39 m d the experimental results show that shaking causes compaction of the saturated sand layer sustained change in permeability had been often linked to a variation in effective porosity as a result of the perturbations next we analyzed the parameters at the final equilibrium state with respect to the relationships among the three k n and s here we employed an empirical relationship between the change in porosity and permeability to estimate and illustrate the magnitude a change in porosity resulting from the shaking dynamics for well sorted unconsolidated granular porous media the correlation between permeability and porosity is often expressed by kozeny

with the acceleration of gravity is 9 8 m2 s the granular phase is quartz grains we further assumed that grains of an average diameter d0 2 5 10 4 m fig 8 shows the evolution of porosity at each section and average porosity at given layers following shaking the initial and final porosity are 0 40 and 0 39 respectively the overall variation of porosity is consistent with the evolution of the hydraulic conductivity of the sections and layers at different depths a co seismic decrease in porosity occurred at the time of the first few experiments scenarios 1 7 only minor changes were observed in scenarios 8 11 of the first stage a co seismic increase in porosity was observed in scenarios 12 15 of the second stage porosity stayed constant in scenarios 16 24 with a final value of 0 39 still less than the pre seismic one the evolution of the storage coefficient is coincides with the trend of change in k and n with a very small total change table 3 as apparent from the deformation distribution diagram assessed after the experiments along the flow direction from sections 1 to 5 the compaction deformation is mainly distributed in the two sides of layered sediments pore pressure sensors position was 0 04 m to 0 10 m higher than before the experiment in the area close to the outlet an indication of sediments expanded slightly table 4 fig 9 this interpretation assists in understanding of the development of hydraulic conductivity in space and time following the shaking experiments i e the initial decrease in hydraulic conductivity followed by a phase of constant hydraulic conductivity and a final increase recalling the process of our experiments unperturbed loose sediments undergo compression and dilation induced by sine wave propagation in an experimental cell subjected to accelerations between 0 1 g and 0 5 g the intergranular stress is progressively transferred to the interstitial pore water which alternately raises lowers and oscillates the pore fluid pressure through contraction and expansion of the intergranular pore space during the first stage of the tests the sediments compact or consolidate after the first few tests the framework of the grains tends to compact with a resultant decrease in hydraulic conductivity porosity and storage coefficient in the field studies co seismic reduction in permeability was observed as a result of remobilization and transport of suspended fines eventually clogging up pathways and fractures shi et al 2018 yan et al 2016 such a process requires a high level of shaking energy vucetic 1994 e g shear induced consolidation rutter et al 2016 wang et al 2001 or liquefaction wang 2007 in fact when consolidated or compacted sediments are cyclically sheared beyond a critical threshold pore volume changes microfracture and preferential flow pathways may be generated leading to an increase in porosity and hydraulic conductivity and decreased pore pressure previous experiments of pore unclogging elkhoury et al 2011 liu and manga 2009 and earthquake induced turbidity increase of discharging groundwater prior and lohmann 2003 led to the hypothesis of permeability enhancement via colloidal dislodgement our results are believed to support the mechanism of creating new pore volume pore unclogging and colloidal dislodgement considering that the unconsolidated sediment in the experimental box is composed of permeable loose sands the first several shakings inevitably can be expected to lead to the decreases in the volume of the porous material and the pore space i e consolidation in contrast shear deformation of densely compacted sedimentary material can be visualized as grains to roll over each other thereby creating new pore space the increase in volume of the sedimentary layers is known as dilatancy in addition the magnitude of change in fluid level and hydraulic parameters partly depends on the flow regime i e hydrostatic and flow condition our experimental results can find their equivalent in field during diagenesis of sedimentary materials a loose unconsolidated sedimentary column is first compacted in alluvial fans of different types of materials i e granular sand and gravel as well as fines composed of clay minerals and silt eventually forming aquifers and aquitards initially the sedimentary column is loosely compacted at this stage permeability of the aquifer can be defined by some initial value after several small earthquakes the aquifer becomes more compacted and decreases in permeability less frequent but higher intensity earthquakes can possibly lead to an increase in permeability following the above process model this process depends on multiple influencing factors difficult to identify and quantify at this stage the findings changes in hydraulic conductivity of our experiment may however still explain the effects and phenomena observed at field scale hence the driving mechanism for changes in hydraulic parameters can be explained by the mechanical deformation and compaction of unconsolidated heterogeneous sediments followed by the redistribution pressure dilation and re packing of the grain structure a future experiment could investigate smaller scale cross hole hydraulic conductivity in two or three directions before and after shaking to further assess how it changes moreover if possible this experiment should be repeated in a block of consolidated rock with uncased boreholes for piezometric observations 4 2 potential mechanism of changes in water level as noted earlier changes in water level frequently act like sustained increase or decrease step like changes and oscillations following earthquakes while their potential mechanisms have been the subject of controversy in large part because there are so many key factors that influence observations and a low number of high quality data available for distinguishing between results in this study we try to explain the origins of water level fluctuation in wells curve shape and magnitude of water level change of an experimental unconsolidated confined aquifer model following sinusoidal dynamic loadings pore pressure data recorded by the sensors were categorized according to their types and shapes pore pressures and water levels appear to behave analogously for hydrostatic and flow conditions different only with respect to their amplitudes for the hydrostatic conditions the type of water level change could be described by oscillation decline 3 times and oscillation rise 9 times while the two types rise and decline were equal in numbers for flow conditions now we first make clear why the shape of the water level change varied with different scenarios even for the same well for a monitoring well we consider the following three factors the characteristics of disturbance waves acceleration frequency the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments and the flow regime i e drained or undrained condition for hydrostatic experiments scenarios 2 5 and scenarios 21 24 and flow experiments scenarios 10 11 and 15 17 when the granular porous material was sheared by a horizontal sinusoidal wave action at frequencies larger than 2 hz the number of loading cycles was 175 5 hz 350 10 hz and 525 15 hz grains tend to compact with a decrease in the pore volume and an increase in pore pressure the accumulated pore pressure will tend to dissipate in the direction of the borehole with a consequential increase in the water level whether there is a persistent increase or step like change in water level depends on the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic diffusivity along the path of pore pressure diffusion to the monitoring well for high accumulation rates in pore pressure the hydraulic conductivity diffusivity in monitoring well direction is small and the pore pressure dissipation rate is large this type of constellation results in a sudden increase in water level i e the step like rise in the water level in the field undrained consolidation of saturated sediments had been observed to lead to the step like changes in water levels wang et al 2001 manga et al 2003 wang and chia 2008 in contrast for hydraulic conductivity diffusivity and therefore pore pressure dissipation rates being large a gradual and sustained increase in water levels can be observed in scenario 18 20 sinusoidal waves with frequencies of less than 2 hz were imposed on hydrostatic conditions the number of loading cycles were 17 5 0 5 hz 35 1 hz and 70 2 hz respectively displacement of the shaking table to either side is significantly greater than that caused by other frequencies 5 hz 10 hz and 15 hz the shaking is believed to force sediment grains to roll over each other and to trigger an expansion of the grain structure and therefore an increase in pore volume reducing pore pressure with a consequential decrease in water level however for flow scenarios 6 7 12 13 14 shaking caused water level fluctuations of different amplitude of decline when sine wave with frequency less than 2 hz in the above scenarios 6 7 12 13 14 water level in wells declined indicating that the sediments had undergone shaking induced dilatancy with shear stress driving particle rearrangement followed by an increase in pore volume for flow scenarios as the water moved energy is also being dissipated rapidly which governed by the permeability of the sands and the pore geometry with viscosity of the fluid being constant this contributes to shaking energy attenuation we may explain the amplitude of water level changes for experiments with hydrostatic conditions being larger than those with flow conditions here we also use v c to calculate the strain of sediments induced by dynamic loading where v is the amplitude of the particle velocity and c is the wave propagation speed for a wave with frequency f using v a0 2πf where a0 is the amplitude of acceleration the seismic strain amplitude is a0 2πfc manga et al 2012 strain amplitudes ranged between 10 4 to 10 3 in most of the cases while the amplitude were 8 84 10 5 and 9 63 10 5 in scenario 5 and 11 with a shaking frequency of 15 hz for both experiments table 5 shear induced dilation and consolidated in saturated unconsolidated deposits lead to the observed step like change in water level when strain exceeded about 10 4 for undrained conditions wang et al 2001 manga et al 2003 wang and chia 2008 manga and wang 2015 coincidentally we found in our experiments that pore pressure changed when the cyclic shear strain amplitude was approximately 10 4 we performed hypothesis testing using a significance level of 5 the relationship between frequency acceleration recordings porosity hydraulic conductivity strain amplitude and water level change was evaluated for both for both hydrostatic condition and flow condition hypothesis tests results show that the change in water level under hydrostatic conditions is significantly correlated with pore pressure hydraulic conductivity and porosity changes while water level changes under flow conditions is significantly correlated with frequency pore pressure change and strain amplitude see hypothesis testing results in table s3 under hydrostatic conditions the correlation coefficient between the change in water level and pore pressure was the strongest r2 0 92 with the relationship between hydraulic conductivity r2 0 71 and porosity r2 0 68 came second fig 10 for flow conditions strong correlation was observed between water level and pore pressure changes r2 0 75 and between water level change and strain amplitude r2 0 77 then between water level change and frequency r2 0 41 the sand layer in the experimental set up was observed to deform following the impact by the sinusoidal shaking in contrast to our laboratory experiment the fluctuating pressure in an aquifer cannot be directly measured at field scale the strong correlation between pore pressure and the water level change and there is a distinction between amplitude of water levels and pore pressure it is unlikely to be the result of coincidence we therefore explored the reason for the difference between the amplitude of water level in wells and pore fluid pressure for our lab observations cooper et al 1965 proposed an amplification ratio a of water level oscillation to pressure head fluctuation during

obtained the actual amplification factor a ρgx0 p0 5 tables s4 and s5 for each scenario the theoretical amplification factors a of well no 2 are less than 1 0 which indicates that the observation wells have no amplification effect on pressure head fluctuation fig 11 shows a strong dependence of the frequency on amplification ratio which implies that it is much easier to magnify the magnitude of pore pressure change at lower frequencies 0 5 hz 1 hz and 2 hz than at higher ones 5 hz 10 hz and 15 hz our results are consistent with the knowledge obtained from field research for pressure disturbances with very short periods less than 0 5 s the water level in the well does not respond rapidly enough to keep up with the pressure disturbance in the aquifer and the well acts as a low pass filter tending not to respond a 0 hsieh et al 1987 the sinusoidal shaking was with a range of period from 0 067 to 2 s 15 hz to 0 5 hz in our experiments therefore all the theoretical factors turn out to be a 1 next we calculated the actual amplification ratio for an observation well and a given wave period the amplification factor a should only show one single value based on the theoretical analytical solution of cooper et al 1965 however the change in pressure head of the whole aquifer in eq 5 is replaced by the value of the middle point of the well in the process of calculation actually the amplitude of pressure head varies at different depths of sand layer three pressure head fluctuations at each depth near the observation well no 2 were monitored during each shaking based on cooper s assumption and the amplification factor definition the actual amplification factor a showed three values for each test after comparing the two factors tables s4 and s5 fig 11 we found that a were larger than 1 0 in 13 of the 24 scenarios for all experiments with different frequencies 0 5 hz to 15 hz the a and a differ considerably with respect to their magnitude especially for flow conditions scenarios 6 to 18 the difference between the two is much larger we can consider that cooper s formula is not applicable if an aquifer is not in perfectly undrained hydrostatic conditions in our experimental set up we cannot ascertain is not under undrained conditions after each shaking disturbance the valve is opened for hydrostatic condition or always keep opening for flow conditions to adjust the pore pressure this explains why a evaluated for our experiments does not meet to the theoretical cooper criteria in addition computation results show that the closer the measuring location to the sands clay interface the larger a a8 the theoretical amplification factor a represents an average value across the depth or the penetration of an observation well while the actual amplification factor also depends on location of the specific pore pressure sensor this implies that the evaluated amplification is also influenced by the depth of the measuring location within the experimental sand layer thus we understand that burial depth of the sensor the thickness of the aquifer well completion i e partially penetrating well fully penetrating and flow regime hydrostatic flow conditions also influence the determination of the amplification factor a the relative importance of each of these factors shall be investigated in the context of future experiments in sum drained and undrained conditions affect largely the accumulation and dissipation of pore pressure during shaking perturbances together with the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters the flow regime influences the pattern of temporal change in pore pressure and water level to a large degree a water level decline is observed in all scenarios of frequencies less than 2 hz with a good frequency dependence in other words it depends on the horizontal displacement of the shaking table and loading cycles whether water level declines are being observed for water level oscillations in wells caused by mechanical resonance in this experiment it is favor of the points that oscillations trigged by resonant coupling of flow between the well and the aquifer when the seismic waves arrive cooper et al 1965 liu et al 1989 kano and yanagidani 2006 wang et al 2009 we observed that water level in wells does not fully reflect the change in pore pressure due to the above amplification effect 5 conclusions in our study we investigated the mechanisms and general physical processes associated with the impact of mechanical periodic loading on a confined saturated granular porous medium at laboratory scale periodic sinusoidal perturbances induces measurable mechanical deformation of the sand layer the deformation leads to changes in pore pressure and the change in pore pressure affects in a hydromechanical recoupled process the deformation in turn pore pressure gradient induces water flow into and out of the observation boreholes recorded in a change in water levels the hydraulic responses to the periodic disturbance at lab scale covered a spectrum of different types of water level fluctuations pore pressure changes hydraulic parameter changes and mechanical deformation suggesting shear induced compaction consolidation and dilation processes in the confined saturated unconsolidated sandy sediments we found that the observed water level changes following dynamic shakings vary with temporal and spatial changes in pore pressure patterns and aquifer flow regime as well as the hydraulic properties flow hydrostatic conditions hydraulic conductivity diffusion between the location of pore pressure sensors and the observation borehole of the sand layer pore pressure accumulation and following hydraulic diffusional flow mainly depend on the period of disturbance number of loading cycles accumulation rate of pore pressure and flow regime dissipation rate of pore pressure because the sand and clay layer are deformed with the deformation being nonuniform and irreversible compaction dilatation or consolidation can be observed resulting in porosity and permeability changes irreversible mechanical deformation of the unconsolidated sediments induced by dynamic shakings is likely to be the main mechanism of water level changes rather than a change in hydraulic parameters the change in hydraulic parameters of the sand layer is an accompanying phenomenon enhancing or dampening the amplitude of water level change as well as the shape of water level patterns there are likely to be multiple mechanisms responsible for the various observed changes in hydraulic responses these are deformation heterogeneous consolidation mechanical resonance permanent deformation dilation redistribution of pressure and re packing of the grain structure at different stages several limitations of our experiments are necessary to state here we cannot repeat each test with the same initial conditions to accurately evaluate the role of changes in shaking frequency and acceleration because of the irreversible deformation of the sand clay layers we also did not check whether the initial status of hydraulic properties was the same as the results of the last experiments the experiment did not allow the strict adherence to hydrostatic and flow conditions because flow and hydrostatic shaking experiments were conducted alternately the impact of a sine wave perturbance in the experiment and real seismic waves on an aquifer is quite different in the experiment we neglected some factors such as boundary effects and the interference between the three wells that might be of importance to the experimental results there are some uncertainties in a small scale flume experiment with respect to assessment of hydraulic conductivity and the estimation of porosity the assumption of the validity of darcy s law and the empirical cozeny carmen relationship in future studies we plan to conduct lab scale pumping slug and tracer experiments before and after shaking to assess the above three important hydraulic parameters we shall also try to include scenarios that model the process of the shaking induces leaks in the confining clay layer credit
