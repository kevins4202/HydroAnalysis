4235,the rainfall anomaly index rai is revisited herein as an alternative to the standardized precipitation index spi taking into account different time scales and the probability of zero precipitation as in the spi procedure to evaluate the performance of the modified rai that stands as a simplified standardized precipitation index sspi both indices were computed for 45 stations distributed across diverse climates of iran the resulted time series and frequency distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes were statistically compared the results show a very strong association between the two indices at all stations and time scales particularly at longer time scales the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient r computed between the two indices depicts large r values across iran particularly over northern and western iran where precipitation is distributed more regularly throughout the year the spatial distribution of the shapiro wilks s w normality test computed for all studied stations and time scales show values larger than 0 96 in northern and western iran and lower values ranging from 0 82 to 0 96 for a few stations scattered in eastern central and southern iran this indicated that both indices have a closer distribution to the standard normal distribution in northern and western iran where precipitation is less skewed however sspi shows a lower s w test than the spi for some stations scattered over central eastern iran which is an indication of its higher deviation from the normal distribution the comparison of the frequency distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes also reveals a very strong association between the two indices as indicated by very high values of contingency coefficient and cramér s v statistic for all time scales at the studied stations sspi is simpler in calculation than the spi and permits for missing data and large numbers of zero values in the data records which is very common in arid and hyper arid climates thus sspi is preferred over spi when the length of data records is short or contains a large number of zero values for which spi is incomputable or unreliable keywords drought probability of zero precipitation probability density function spi rai sspi iran 1 introduction several drought indices are proposed for drought monitoring from which the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are generally accepted and widely used all over the world the australian drought watch system uses the decile index gibbs and maher 1967 as the meteorological drought index it is a rank based drought index with a relatively simple calculation procedure and fewer assumptions than the pdsi hayes et al 2011 requiring only precipitation as the input undoubtedly the spi is the most robust and effective widely used drought index that enjoys several advantages over many indices introduced in the literature vicente serrano 2006 hayes et al 1999 discussed the advantages and disadvantages of spi in characterizing drought events according to hayes et al 1999 spi requires only precipitation that is available with a much finer spatial and temporal coverage across the land areas of the globe for calculating spi the most suited probability distribution function pdf is first fitted to the precipitation time series aggregated at different timescales and then the resulted cumulative probability distribution cdf is normalized to obtain the index value the spi can be temporally and spatially comparable if a uniform calculation process is implemented otherwise comparing the spi values will not be easy if different probability distribution functions are used for different locations this makes the spi not affected by geographical or topographical differences hayes et al 1999 lana et al 2001 the world meteorological organization hayes et al 2011 wmo 2006 has recommended the spi as a generally accepted index for drought monitoring and characterization in all climatic regions of the world being based upon the probability of precipitation values accumulated over different time scales ranging from 1 to 72 months edwards and mckee 1997 spi is suitable to identify all types of droughts namely the meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts however according to guttman 1994 and guttman 1999 the practical range of spi time scales is 1 to 24 month if one notes that around 50 60 years of data is required for a confidential spi computation therefore unless 80 100 years of data is available the sample size is too small and the statistical confidence of the probability estimates on the tails of the distribution becomes very weak for time scales beyond 24 month svoboda et al 2012 guttman 1998 has recommended the spi as the primary drought index due to its simpler computation procedure and spatially consistent invariant in its interpretation and probabilistic so that it can be used in risk and decision analysis due to its advantages mentioned above spi was extensively used for drought analysis and characterization in different areas around the globe including the u s a hayes et al 1999 europe lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 south africa rouault and richard 2003 hungary domonkos 2003 italy bonaccorso et al 2003 east africa ntale and gan 2003 greece tsakiris and vangelis 2004 and korea min et al 2003 however according to hayes et al 1999 the spi has three potential disadvantages a the assumption of finding a suitable theoretical probability distribution to fit the raw precipitation is largely dependent on the quantity and reliability of the data used to fit the distribution guttman 1999 quiring 2009 b equal value of spi at two different locations does not necessarily imply an equal water deficit at the locations wu et al 2007 indicating that the spi is not capable of distinguishing drought prone regions from other areas c when applying the spi at short time scales in regions with highly seasonal precipitation misleadingly large positive or negative spi values may result particularly in arid and semi arid regions having many months with zero precipitation wu et al 2007 the spi is also based on the assumption of fitting precipitation data to a given pdf lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 wu et al 2007 which is valid when long term data records are available that is not always the case in arid and hyper arid climates particularly in the seasons with many zero precipitation values thus resulting in less reliable spi values at shorter time scales by proposing a non parametric normalization procedure for spi computation farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 attempted to overcome such a conceptual drawback raible et al 2017 the proposed approach is a rank based method that simply transforms the plotting positions to the standard normal distribution farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 to directly describes any sample at hand independent of its properties and without requiring testing for the goodness of fit tijdeman et al 2020 as another disadvantage spi also does not assumes temporal stationarity over the period for which it is calculated therefore its robustness in drought characterization under a changing climate is not clear seneviratne et al 2012 like the decile index gibbs and maher 1967 the rainfall anomaly index rai developed by van rooy 1965 incorporates a ranking procedure to assign magnitudes to positive and negative precipitation anomalies keyantash and dracup 2002 utilizing a normalization procedure more simpler than that used in spi computation olukayode oladipo 1985 found insignificant differences between rai and the more complicated drought indices like pdsi in nebraska state usa likewise keyantash and dracup 2002 found a very strong association between rai and spi time series in two climate divisions of oregon state usa loukas et al 2003 also found rai and spi time series highly comparable in greece more recently hänsel et al 2016 evaluated the suitability of a modified version of rai as an alternative to spi in assessing future precipitation conditions in central europe and found it highly correlated with spi as stated by hänsel et al 2016 rai offers a higher degree of transparency and tractability and has a lower degree of sophistication than the spi concerning the evaluation criteria for drought indices proposed by keyantash and dracup 2002 it is also computationally less demanding than spi but with comparable performance as reported by the aforementioned studies the aforementioned studies have evaluated the performance of rai in small homogenous areas with humid to moderate climates where precipitation is less skewed compared to arid and hyper arid climates characterized by periods with a high probability of zero precipitation pzp however although loukas et al 2003 have already tested rai in a few greek stations with temperate climate where zero precipitation values during summer month are common there is no information regarding the performance of rai in arid and hyper arid climates where precipitation is highly skewed and zero precipitation values dominated its lengthy warm dry period raziei 2021 therefore this study proposes some modifications to rai and evaluates its performance in diverse climates of iran that includes arid and hyper arid climates the proposed modifications make the index a better tool for drought monitoring in arid and hyper arid climates of the world where precipitation data is either short incomplete or contains very high pzp raziei 2021 with which computing spi is impossible or unreliable the modified rai is expected to serve as a simplified standardized precipitation index sspi as it is very simple in computation and requires less statistical assumptions and computational demands while resulting in values highly comparable with spi values it is particularly superior over spi for application in arid and hyper arid climates particularly at shorter time scales when the existence of very high pzp makes computing spi impossible or unreliable 2 materials and methods 2 1 data fig 1 illustrates the spatial distribution of 45 iranian first order synoptic stations used in this study the stations were selected based on the availability of data records with no missing values for a period as long as possible these criteria made the selected stations denser in western and northwestern iran and scattered in central eastern iran where hosted large inhabitant areas including several deserts of iran see fig 1 the selected stations monitored by the iranian meteorological organization irimo have complete data records from 1971 to 2018 with an acceptable distribution across diverse climate types of iran defined by raziei 2017 based on the köppen geiger climate classification system the selected stations contain an adequate number of representative stations for each of the five main precipitation sub regions of iran characterized by different monthly precipitation variability raziei 2018 and dry wet periods raziei et al 2011 2013 raziei et al 2010 the monthly precipitation records of the selected stations downloaded from the irimo website at http www irimet net possessed a few missing values only in two of the stations that were estimated by establishing a linear regression between the station with missing values and their neighboring stations adopting the rationale simple linear imputation process in this study is reasonable since the percentage of missing values requiring imputation is tiny however utilizing non linear machine learning methods including the support vector machines and artificial neural network algorithms is preferable when data have more missing values richman et al 2009 2 2 spi computation the spi is calculated by fitting a probability distribution function to the frequency distribution of precipitation data aggregated at any desired time scale in other words computing spi begins with determining a probability density function that best describes the aggregated precipitation time series at a given time scale then the determined cumulative probability of the observed precipitation values is converted to a standard normal distribution to obtain the spi values edwards and mckee 1997 in the present study spi is computed by fitting a gamma pdf to precipitation aggregated at all the time scales considered although raziei 2021 has identified the pearson type iii distribution as the most appropriate distribution function in fitting precipitation aggregated at all considered time scales throughout iran the gamma pdf was intentionally used herein because it is extensively used in iran as it is the default pdf of many codes available for spi computation raziei 2021 nonetheless raziei 2021 showed that gamma best fitted monthly precipitation over most parts of iran and identified it as one of the pdfs with the lowest goodness of fit rejection rate for all considered time scales for the present study besides the monthly precipitation series of each calendar month as the representative of one month time scale time series of longer precipitation aggregations of 3 6 9 12 and 24 months were also constructed for computing spi at 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales the longer than 1 month aggregations are averages of the monthly values in the aggregation duration ending in each of the 12 calendar months of the year the shorter time scales 1 3 and 6 month are usually used for monitoring meteorological and agricultural droughts and the longer ones 9 12 and 24 month are useful for monitoring hydrological droughts edwards and mckee 1997 that includes groundwater and surface water van lanen and peters 2000 2 3 rai computation similar to the decile index gibbs and maher 1967 rai developed by van rooy 1965 is a rank based drought index that incorporates a ranking procedure to assign magnitudes to positive and negative precipitation anomalies keyantash and dracup 2002 the rai index is computed as below 1 r a i 3 p i p e p in eq 1 p i is the sequence of measured precipitation at the time i p is average precipitation e is average of 10 extrema and 3 is the prefix used to limits the lower and upper bounds of the anomalies this standardization follows the unity based feature scaling aksoy and haralick 2001 khansalari et al 2018 to asymmetrically distribute the original anomalies between the predefined limits 3 and 3 for positive anomalies i e p i p greater than 0 the prefix is positive i e 3 and e is the average of the 10 highest precipitation values on record for negative anomalies i e p i p 0 the prefix is negative i e 3 and the average of 10 lowest measurements are used keyantash and dracup 2002 however calculating e from the ten largest smallest precipitation values appear arbitrary van rooy 1965 chose 10 because he thought the average of 10 extremes could represent the mean conditions of an extremely dry year or extremely wet year shen et al 2006 the index values are judged against a 9 member classification scheme as in table 1 left column ranging from extremely wet rai 3 to extremely dry rai 3 this classification which is similar to that used by gibbs and maher 1967 to partition precipitation values between ten deciles is equally applicable to various lengths of drought including flash droughts meteorological drought deep soil moisture drought and hydrological drought defined with rai computed at different time scales as demonstrated by keyantash and dracup 2002 loukas et al 2003 and hänsel et al 2016 eq 1 performs well in humid to moderate climates of the world where monthly precipitation distributed relatively regularly throughout the year and the associated distribution is less skewed for example keyantash and dracup 2002 examined the performance of rai in two climate divisions of oregon state usa characterized by moist to moderate climates denoted as köppen csb climate type and found a very high correlation coefficient between spi and rai computed at 1 month time scale similarly loukas et al 2003 have evaluated the performance of rai in the mediterranean climates of greece that are classified as csa csb or cfb köppen climate types however despite that summer is dry and precipitation occurrence in some of their studied stations is less likely in that season they found an excellent agreement between rai and other drought indices in depicting drought and wet periods likewise hänsel et al 2016 have assessed the performance of rai in central europe characterized by köppen cfb climate type however eq 1 does not perform well in most parts of iran that are characterized by bsk bsh bwh and bwk climate types raziei 2017 as shown in fig 1 in such areas the june september period is totally dry with a very low chance of precipitation raziei 2021 hence a very large proportion of monthly and seasonal aggregated precipitation time series is zero that often results in zero mean and median as the climate norm of the region raziei 2021 in cases when pzp is 40 very likely p p and e become zero and thus computing rai becomes impossible this suggests taking into account the pzp of the dry months as the climate norm of the region for rai computation therefore as in the spi computation procedure it is desirable to consider time scales and pzps of the dry months in rai computation to consider the aforementioned issues in rai computation a few modifications outlined below are proposed 1 aggregate monthly precipitation data to any desire time scale as in the spi procedure 2 compute the skewness of the aggregated monthly precipitation for a given time scale ended at each calendar month 3 reduce the skewness of the aggregated monthly precipitation series using the cube root transformation if its skewness is greater than 0 5 and the cube transformation x3 if it is less than 0 5 4 compute the anomalies of the transformed precipitation time series δ for the aggregated transformed precipitation by subtracting p i from p i e p i p where p i is ith transformed precipitation value and p is the median of the transformed series 5 for each time scale ended at each 12 calendar month rank the transformed data p remove duplicate values and then compute the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the data 6 set the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ranked transformed data as the average of the bottom 5 precipitation records p b and the average of top 5 precipitation records p t respectively similarly consider the 50th percentile as the median p of the data the logic behind using p b and p t the 5th and 95th percentiles as the threshold is that if 100 years of data records are used then p t is the mean of the 5 largest and p b is the mean of the 5 smallest values of the data records shen et al 2006 using the lowest and highest percentiles will give more realistic results particularly when the time series p is notably shorter than the ones van rooy 1965 used in his analysis hänsel et al 2016 using the 5th and 95th percentiles in eq 2 as p b and p t respectively causes the index values to exceed 3 and 3 limits instead if the minimum and maximum of the data are used in eq 2 the index will reach 3 0 when p reaches p b and will reach 3 0 when p reaches p t and thus the index values are confined between 3 and 3 therefore the original equation is slightly modified to confine the index between 3 and 3 when using the 5th and 95th percentiles as p b and p t using a set of modifications described above the modified rai hereafter called sspi can be computed as below for a certain month i 2 sspi 3 p i p p t p p i p p t p p i p p max p if δ i 0 a n d p z p 40 3 p i p p b p p i p p b p p i p p min p if δ i 0 a n d p z p 40 3 p i p max p 0 if max p 0 a n d p z p 40 3 p i p ε 0 if max p 0 a n d p z p 40 in eq 2 δ i is the anomaly value of the transformed observation i computed as δ i p i p since precipitation aggregated at various timescales are highly skewed in most of the studied stations the median p is used instead of the arithmetic mean of the precipitation time series p hänsel et al 2016 using the median is particularly more efficient than the mean of the data in dealing with precipitation time series of arid and hyper arid climates where a majority proportion of precipitation records are zero raziei 2021 in this modification the pzp also makes a major role the first and second relations of eq 2 are exactly those of the original equation of van rooy 1965 that can be applied to the months and time scales with pzp 40 when an adequate number of non zero precipitation records is available for computing the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the data since the first part of these equations that uses the 5th and 95th percentiles to standardize the data does not bound the data between 3 and 3 the second part is added to standardize the data with its minimum and maximum then subtract its result from the earlier part and adding the results to the original standardization in the first part of the relation to limit the outcome between 3 and 3 the proposed rescaling limits the sspi values between the spi range and obtains similar values and class frequencies as those of the spi hänsel et al 2016 have set the scaling factor of eqs 1 to 1 7 to limit the index values between the range of spi values assuming that it is an arbitrary value that can be adjusted to obtain rai values in the range of any drought index with which rai is comparing here the third and fourth relations of eq 2 are proposed to address the large proportion of zero values in arid and hyper arid climates of the world that hinders computing sspi with the first and second relations since most likely the median of the data is zero for summer months in such cases when the maximum of the non zero precipitation records denoted by max p is a positive integer max p greater than 0 the sspi is computed using the third relation for example when pzp 40 and max p is a positive integer the third relation assigns 3 0 to that value as the maximum sspi and smaller positive sspi to all other non zero precipitation values smaller than max p however the third relation fails when all the time series are zero i e pzp 100 and thus p 0 in such cases instead of max p an arbitrarily small positive quantity denoted by ε is used in the denominator of the fourth relation to avoid division by zero the flowchart of the sspi computation procedure is illustrated in fig 2 with a numerical example given in table 2 table 2 shows the procedure of computing a 1 month time scale sspi for january and august in zabol station as the representatives of the wet and dry months of the station here only 25 years of data 1971 1995 is used to limit the size of the table as shown the computed skewness of the precipitation time series of january is 1 65 that signals a highly skewed distribution since the skewness is positive and greater than 0 5 the time series was cube root transformed which reduced the skewness to zero which is an indication of the symmetrical distribution of the transformed series the transformed series is then used to compute the anomalies by subtracting each value from the long term mean of the transformed time series after that the transformed data is ranked and the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the transformed data are computed and used in the first and second relations of eq 2 to compute sspi as detailed above in step 6 as is seen the skewness of both anomaly and sspi time series for january are 0 0 and 0 12 respectively implying that their distributions are quasi symmetrical the right hand part of the table shows how the sspi is computed for august when almost all the time series is zero except for the seventh record that equals 0 3 mm as is seen the skewness of august is 4 69 and the cube root transformation was not able to reduce it anymore since most of the august precipitation time series is zero pzp 40 and the maximum of the transformed series max p is 0 7 the third relation was used for computing sspi this relation designates zero sspi to all zero precipitation values subtracting zero from zero and the maximum positive sspi to the single non zero precipitation record note that when all the records are zero the fourth relation is used for computing the sspi it should also be noted that it is impossible to compute spi for such a time series sspi is a standardized index that accounts for the pzp and the median of precipitation records and results in values that are highly comparable to spi values in all climatic areas of iran as described in the next sections to have comparable frequencies of spi and sspi values in different classes the classification system of hänsel et al 2016 shown in the middle column of table 1 has been adopted this classification system is a modification of the original classifications of van rooy 1965 and mckee et al 1993 2 4 comparing sspi with spi the performance of sspi in different climate regions of iran was evaluated against the spi time series computed with both parametric and non parametric hereafter spinp approaches however for the sake of brevity the comparison made between sspi and spinp was presented only for two example stations of babolsar located along the caspian sea in the north and zabol in southeast iran where sspi showed the highest and the lowest agreement with spi respectively babolsar climate type is cfa raziei 2017 which resembles the climates of the stations used by keyantash and dracup 2002 loukas et al 2003 and hänsel et al 2016 while zabol station is considered as the representative of the hyper arid climate of iran with a climate type of bwh raziei 2017 the later station has a long dry period with very high pzps sspi was primarily compared with spi through pearson correlation coefficient r and spearman s rank correlation coefficient computed between the time series of sspi and spi indices computed at different time scales however due to the existence of a strong linear relationship between the indices at all studied stations and time scales spearman s rank correlation coefficient approaches to 1 0 at most of the studied stations particularly for time scales larger than 3 month therefore for assessing the degree of agreement between the indices the pearson correlation coefficient was rather used since it shows a wider range of values over the stations that favors illustrating the inter stations variation of correlation coefficient to assess the spatial variation of the r values over iran characterized by different köppen geiger climate types raziei 2017 the computed r values for the studied stations distributed across iran were mapped for all considered time scales the consistency between the sspi and spi indices was also illustrated by comparing the time variability and pdf of the indices as well as the scatterplots of precipitation vs the indices values for the two example stations of babolsar and zabol see fig 1 because spi values fit a typical normal distribution to define the number of standard deviations by which a normally distributed random variable deviates from its long term mean guenang and kamga 2014 it is expected that the spi values fall within one standard deviation in approximately 68 of the time within two standard deviations 95 of the time and within three standard deviations 99 of the time hayes et al 1999 this feature enables spi to represent both wetter and drier periods in the same way meaning that an spi value 1 0 and 2 occurs 16 and two to three times in 100 years respectively while an spi of less than 3 0 occurs once in approximately 200 years hayes et al 1999 accordingly since it is expected that the final spi values follow a standard normal distribution it is reasonable to test whether the spi values computed for a given station and time scale meet this assumption for this purpose the s w test shapiro and wilk 1965 stephens 1974 was also used to examine whether the spi values calculated through the equiprobability transformation wu et al 2007 are normally distributed the s w test is based on the assumption that the spi values should be normally distributed μ 0 σ 1 and independently sampled however the s w test is strongest against short tailed platykurtic and skewed distributions and weakest against symmetric moderately long tailed leptokurtic distributions and also has issues with ties and extreme values royston 1992 1993 therefore the s w test used here is based on a method proposed by wu et al 2007 who used it in conjunction with two more criteria to guarantee that the examined series is normally distributed this approach was also used by naresh kumar et al 2009 to test the suitability of spi values in arid regions with substantial zero precipitation values based on these criteria the distribution of the examined indices is non normal when it s s w test and the associated p value is 0 96 and 0 10 respectively and the absolute value of the index median is greater than 0 05 otherwise the distribution is normal naresh kumar et al 2009 stagge et al 2015 wu et al 2007 when these three criteria are met simultaneously the normality assumption of the distribution is rejected more recently stagge et al 2015 and svensson et al 2017 have also used this test to evaluate the performance of different candidate distribution functions for spi computation over europe and the uk respectively as stated above for application of the s w test it is assumed that the data are independently sampled thus to examine the assumption of whether the spi and sspi values are independently sampled the autocorrelation of the indices time series of each station and time scale ended at each calendar month was computed the result showed no significant autocorrelation for lags greater than 1 in any station and time scale indicating that the indices values relative to all time scales and stations are independently sampled in addition the skewness and kurtosis of the indices time series were also computed for all considered stations and time scales to provide more insights on how far they are from normality the normal quantile quantile plots q q plot were also provided for the two example stations to illustrate the closeness of their computed indices to the standard normal distribution moreover the frequencies of spi and sspi classes defined based on the nine anomaly classes shown in table 1 were cross tabulated to examine if they are comparable in partitioning the time series into different classes the chi square statistic of the contingency table established between the two indices and the associated p value was used to determine if the relationship between the variables is significant at the 0 95 confidence level while the contingency coefficient cc and the cramér s v statistic cramer 1946 computed with the chi square statistic were used to measure their degree of association the cc and cramér s v statistic cramer 1946 defined in eqs 3 and 4 respectively are chi squared based measures of association that define whether the two nominal variables or data sets are independent or dependent of each other the values of these measures range between 0 and 1 where 0 indicating no association between the row and column variables of a contingency table and values close to 1 indicating a high degree of association between the variables 3 c c x 2 n x 2 4 v x 2 n m i n r 1 c 1 in eqs 3 and 4 n is the number of observations of sspi spi time series classified between the classes r and c are the numbers of rows and columns of the contingency table established between the indices frequency of cross classification and x 2 is the chi square statistic that measures the statistical relationship between the variables in the cross classification table besides as an illustrative example the histograms of the frequency distribution of the sspi and spi values between the classes are illustrated for the two example stations 3 results 3 1 comparing time variability of the indices fig 3 shows the time variability of spi and sspi time series at babolsar station in the north of iran computed at 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales within the period 1971 2017 as it is seen sspi strongly co vary with spi spinp at all time scales particularly at longer ones the r between the two indices is higher than 0 98 for 1 and 3 month time scales and higher than 0 99 for the rest of the time scales this strong association between the two indices indicates that sspi well represents the time variability and magnitudes of spi at babolsar station that has a cfa climate type raziei 2017 similarly fig 4 shows the time behavior of the indices for zabol station in the southeast of iran that has a bwh climate type raziei 2017 as it is evident there is also a strong agreement between the three indices in zabol station where it s very long dry period leads very high pzps in shorter time precipitation aggregations the r between the indices is 0 78 0 84 and 0 92 for 1 3 and 6 month time scales which is noticeably lower than those computed for babolsar station at the same time scales the observed lower correlation for these time scales at zabol station is partly because spi assigned positive values close to 1 0 to zero precipitation records of the dry months as the probability of zero precipitation while sspi assigned them zero values as the climate norm of the station see fig 4 a careful looking at fig 4 also suggests that spinp even assigned much higher positive values to zero precipitation records at the 1 month time scale as an indication of moderately to very wet conditions as another discrepancy sspi also detected more severe drought conditions than spi and spinp at the shorter time scales nonetheless the r between the two indices in zabol station is higher than 0 99 at longer time scales suggesting a very strong association between the two indices as observed for babolsar this is because the pzp of the time series decreases when the time scale exceeds 6 month there observed a linear relationship between spi spinp and sspi time series at the studied stations and time scales suggesting that they are consistent in representing dry and wet events at all considered time scales and calendar months particularly for the wet months as an example fig 5a f illustrates the scatter plots of spi spinp and sspi time series relative to 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales at babolsar station in the north of iran as depicted there is a strong linear relationship between spi spinp and sspi time series at all the time scales sspi shows a similar relationship with both spi and spinp which is slightly stronger with spi mostly because spinp assigns spi values 1 5 to zero summer precipitation values the scatter plots of the individual months revealed a much stronger linear relationship between sspi and spi spinp for the wet months and a weaker relationship for the drier months not shown likewise fig 5g l depicts the scatter plots of sspi and spi spinp for zabol station at the border with afghanistan as is seen there observed a linear relationship between the indices at all the time scales but with a more dispersed cloud of points around the 1 1 line for the shorter time scales and a more compacted cloud of points for the longer time scales of 9 12 and 24 months the observed dispersion of the cloud of points at the shorter time scales is related to the poor relationship between sspi and spi spinp values relative to drier months when both spi and spinp assign positive spi values to zero precipitation records as an example at the 1 month time scale there observed three cases of zero precipitation for which spi assigned an spi value 1 5 and spinp assigned values between 1 5 and 2 0 but sspi exactly assigned them zero values likewise at the 3 month time scale there observed two cases of zero precipitation for which both spi and spinp assigned an spi value between 1 0 and 2 0 whereas sspi exactly assigned them zero values due to the existence of a higher number of zero precipitation values in the precipitation series of dry months the relationship between sspi and spi spinp turned to curve linear fig 6 illustrates the scatter plots of monthly indices values and precipitation values for babolsar station in the north of iran with the r values noted in the upper left of each graph as it is shown there is a linear trend between the variables the indices and precipitation at all individual months sspi also shows a very strong correlation with precipitation and highly co varies with spi and spinp at all months particularly at wetter months however this relationship weakens at lower index values for the drier months indicating a slightly different response of the indices to more severe droughts this means that there is not a completely linear relationship between the indices at drier months since it turned into a curve linear model at the lower and to some extent at the higher index values which are more profound in february march june july august and november at babolsar station the reason that the model turns into a curve linear shape at the lower index values is that the spi tends to show lower values than sspi for smaller precipitation values however fig 6 suggests an extremely high agreement between the indices values at the central part of the data values for most of the months the correlation coefficient between sspi and spi r1 is greater than 0 97 suggesting a very strong association between the indices a similar pattern is observed for the zabol station fig 7 but with large differences between sspi and spi values from may to november which is because spi assigns a high probability of zero precipitation almost 0 5 to zero or negligible precipitation values in the arid and hyper arid climates thus in locations with distinct dry seasons spi fails to evaluate the drought condition especially at short time scales wu et al 2007 when zero precipitation is the climate norm therefore when pzp is very high the equiprobability transformation of precipitation distributions might not be achieved and the resulting spi time series will not be normally distributed blain 2012 this issue is depicted in the scatter plots of june to august for zabol station when the spi assigns very large positive values to zero and negligible precipitation smaller than 2 millimeters while sspi assigns zero values to such precipitation values this indicates that sspi presents the most realistic result since the climate norm of the dry season of such locations is almost zero this can be conceived much better if one notes that precipitation values smaller than 5 millimeters are not effective at all in the presence of very high summer evapotranspiration in dry climates despite the observed discrepancies between the two indices at zabol station particularly for the dry months r is greater than 0 97 from november to april indicating a very high agreement between spi and sspi however there observed no correlation between the two indices from july to september when the pzp is approximately 100 as discussed above the lower r values of these months are mostly related to the unrealistic spi values assigned to zero precipitation values according to fig 7 while sspi correctly assigns zero sspi values to zero precipitation records of june to october the spi unrealistically assigns values close to 1 0 to such precipitation values the observed perfect linear relationship between the sspi and precipitation values in these months reveals the mechanism of the third and fourth relationships of eq 2 in linearly rescaling precipitation values between zero and 3 0 in the dry season when pzp exceeds 40 in such cases i e when all or the majority of the time series are zero the third and fourth relationships of eq 2 consider zero precipitation as the climate norm and permit computing sspi even in the presence of missing data differently it is impossible to compute spi when there are missing data or an insufficient number of no zero precipitation records in the time series to fit a distribution function in such cases spi assigns the probability of zero precipitation which is almost close to 1 0 to all zero precipitation records of the dry months and identifies them as the moderately wet condition which is absolutely a false alarm fig 7 also shows that spi assigns much higher index values to the lower precipitation of the wetter months than does the sspi which means that spi underestimates the magnitudes of the negative precipitation anomalies of the wetter months of the arid and hyper arid climates comparing the response of spinp to precipitation records of july to september at zabol station it is clear that spinp performs better than spi in characterizing the infrequent non zero precipitation records as is shown when no correlation coefficient was found between spi and sspi at zabol station for months july to september r1 there observed a prefect correlation between spinp and sspi denoted by r2 fig 8 illustrates how the computed r between spi and sspi varies across diverse climates of iran at 1 month time scale r is higher than 0 9 over the coastal areas of the caspian sea and most of the stations over the mountainous areas of western and northern iran that are characterized with either bsk csa csb cfa or dsa climate types however it is between 0 74 and 0 9 in southern and southeastern iran that is dominated by bwh and bwk climate types raziei 2017 by comparing the maps one can notice that r generally increases all over the country by increasing the time scale particularly at the 3 month time scale in south of iran for the longer time scales a relatively uniform distribution of r values higher than 0 96 is observed implying a very high consistency between the two indices across the country fig 9a f depicts the pdf of the spi spinp and sspi time series at babolsar station computed for different time scales as it is seen the pdf of sspi and spi spinp time series follow each other reasonably well at all the time scales similarly fig 9g l compares the pdf of sspi and spi spinp time series at zabol station for different time scales fig 9g l however shows considerable discrepancies between the pdf of the indices at 1 3 and 6 month time scales which is related to different responses of the indices to very large pzps of the station fig 9g l suggests that the spi and spinp are relatively lower bounded at shorter time scales which is common in regions with low seasonal precipitation totals where precipitation is highly seasonal and heavily skewed in such areas spi behaves very similar to the percent of normal index in representing precipitation anomalies at shorter time scales and therefore fails in identifying drought occurrences because of non normally distributed spi values wu et al 2007 as exemplified in figs 3 and 4 moreover because of high pzps in such stations the spi and spinp tend to have their maximum frequencies at spi value around 1 0 because of assigning the probability of zero values to zero precipitation while sspi maximized exactly at zero value fig 9g l additionally there observed noticeable differences between spi and spinp at zabol station for shorter time scales particularly at the 1 month time scale where spinp assigns much higher positive values to summer season zero precipitation than the spi see fig 4 the pdfs of the individual summer months showed much narrower bounds of spi values for shorter time scales at zabol station nonetheless there is a high consistency between the pdfs of the indices at 9 12 and 24 month time scales for which the pzp is close to zero raziei 2021 fig 10 shows the spatial variation of the s w test computed for the spi time series of different time scales across iran as is illustrated for the majority of the stations the s w test is greater than 0 96 for all considered time scales particularly those stations distributed across northern and western iran this implies that the spi time series of all considered time scales are normally distributed in most of the studied stations except for spi 1 and spi 3 for which a few stations scattered over the southeastern part of the country show lower s w test values fig 11 also shows a relatively similar pattern of s w test values for sspi time series all over the country particularly at longer time scales comparing figs 10 and 11 it is evident that the sspi shows a higher s w test value for a higher number of stations at the 1 month time scale particularly over northern and western iran indicating that it performs much better than spi at this time scale all over the country differently at the 3 month time scale spi shows higher values than sspi in southern and eastern iran however by increasing the time scale the s w test increases at all the studied stations and the test values exceed 0 96 at most of the stations particularly in the northern and western parts of the country there are also some sporadic stations in central southern and eastern iran with the s w test lower than 0 96 at longer time scales by comparing s w test values of sspi and spi time series it is concluded that both spi and sspi time series are asymmetrically distributed at most of the stations and time scales nonetheless the s w test value of spi is higher at a few stations particularly at shorter time scales which is related to the better normalization procedure used in spi computation despite its failure in passing the normality tests at many stations as additional measures required for deciding whether the indices come from a normal distribution the skewness and kurtosis of spi and sspi series relative to all time scales and stations distributed across the country were computed and presented in tables 3 and 4 as is seen in table 3 at most of the stations the skewness of both spi and sspi in parenthesis relative to all the time scales are comparable and fall within the range of 0 5 and 0 5 however in almost all of the stations the skewness of sspi is much lower than that of spi at all the time scales and in most cases it is close to zero this difference is particularly more noticeable at tabass station in central eastern iran specifically for 12 and 24 month time scales table 4 also presents the kurtosis of the indices series for all the time scales and stations considered this table also revealed that at most of the stations the kurtosis of both spi and sspi indices confined between 3 particularly for larger time scales indicating that the indices are approximately normally distributed at most of the stations the kurtosis of the sspi is noticeably lower than that of the spi which is an indication that the tails of the sspi series are lighter than those of the spi index nonetheless the computed kurtosis of spi time series relative to 1 and 3 month time scales is larger than 3 for most of the stations whereas it is smaller than 3 for sspi suggesting that the sspi series are closer to a normal distribution than the spi series fig 12 illustrates the q q plots of spi and sspi time series relative to 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales at the two example stations the q q plots of babolsar station left hand columns suggest that both spi and sspi indices plausibly come from a normal distribution since the data points fall about the straight line this is particularly more plausible for the spi series however it seems that the extreme sspi values slightly violated this assumption the q q plots of zabol right hand columns also show relatively similar patterns for longer time scales however for the shorter time scales of 1 3 and 6 month time scales the points do not fall along the straight line which is attributed to the effects of the higher number of zero precipitation values at these time scales that distort the time series distribution from the normal distribution the distortion from the normal distribution at zabol station is more remarkable for the sspi series where spi also shows the same response at 1 3 and 6 month time scales as well as the 24 month time scale 3 2 comparing the within class frequencies of the indices the frequency of the indices categorized within the nine wetness and dryness classes of table 1 middle column are shown in figs 13 and 14 for the two example stations as it is seen the frequency distribution of both indices are highly comparable and have a relatively symmetrical distribution at babolsar in the north of iran in all considered time scales the spi tends to show slightly higher number of events in the near normal nn slightly dry sd and slightly wet sw classes and fewer events in the extremely wet ew and extremely dry ed classes a similar pattern is observed for zabol at the border with afghanistan but with remarkable differences between the indices frequencies at different classes fig 14 demonstrates that the frequency of the nn class of sspi is higher than that of spi for 1 and 3 month time scales at zabol station the lower frequency of nn class for the spi is because spi falsely categorizes the summer months zero total precipitation as md class that in turn reduced the frequency of the nn class moreover as mentioned before in such a climate the pdf of spi is narrow which results in lower frequencies of extreme classes in favor of increasing the frequencies of slightly and moderately wet and dry conditions this characteristic of spi decreases the frequencies of vd ed vw and ed classes at the expense of increasing the frequencies of sd md sw and mw classes thus leading to remarkable differences between the two indices regarding the frequencies of the classes although the same classification scheme of table 1 is used to classify the values of both indices it is not expected that both indices confine well within the defined class limits therefore the observed differences between the frequency distribution of the indices classes dose not point to the inefficiency of either spi or sspi if one notes that the considered indices use different standardization as well as classification approaches to classify the index values between the classes despite the observed differences between the indices regarding the distribution of their values within the classes the contingency coefficient and the cramér s v maps shown in figs 15 and 16 show very high values all over the country suggesting a very high degree of association between the two indices the spatial variation of contingency coefficient across iran demonstrates very high values cc 0 9 over the northern part of the country at shorter time scales of 1 and 3 month and lower values ranging between 0 78 and 0 88 over the central southern and eastern iran considering that cc is the pearson s correlation coefficient commonly used in comparing nominal values it suggests a very high agreement between the two indices regarding the distribution of the values between classes even in southern iran based on fig 15 the cc value increases with increasing the time scale accordingly at longer time scales the cc values exceed 0 9 at most of the stations distributed over the country indicating a much better correspondence between the two indices in classifying the indices values fig 16 also shows a very similar pattern in the spatial distribution of cramér s v statistic across iran as another measure of association between the indices regarding the frequencies of wet and dry categories the higher values of the cramér s v statistic is also observed in northern and western parts of iran and lower ones in the centeral eastern and southern parts the maps of figures 15 and 16 have more uniform patterns of higher values at longer time scales while a dipole pattern is observed at shorter time scales 4 discussion the comparison of sspi with spi and spinp at the studied stations indicates a strong agreement between the three indices at most of the stations that increases by increasing the time scale the three indices congruently have captured the widespread historical droughts of 1985 86 1998 99 2000 2001 2007 08 and 2010 11 each of which struck most or some parts of the country with varying severity and duration as implied by the correlation coefficient greater than 0 98 all over the country the sspi fairly explains more than 95 of the time variability of spi and spinp at almost all locations however there observed some discrepancies between the three indices at shorter time scales particularly in arid and hyper arid climates where the dry summer season is very long and the pzp is larger than 50 as demonstrated in the result section this discrepancy is mostly due to the inefficiency of spi and spinp in characterizing the dry months precipitation anomalies at stations with very large pzp or when the time series is mostly zero in such cases spi assigned positive values close to 1 0 to zero precipitation records of the dry months as the probability of zero precipitation in cases when most of the time series is zero and the non zero precipitation values are not adequate to fit a pdf to the data spi assigns 1 0 to all data records including the non zero precipitation records this means that the computed spi values corresponding to such precipitation time series will never fall below 0 and thus creating the illogical situation that all periods with no detectable precipitation are wetter than is typical for the region stagge et al 2015 raziei 2021 has examined the center of mass of the zero distribution proposed by stagge et al 2015 as an alternative to the historical maximum likelihood of zero precipitation that is commonly used in spi calculation and found that the spi values produced using the mean probability of multiple zeros based upon the weibull plotting position function better maintain the statistical interpretability of the computed spi he proved that the method proposed by stagge et al 2015 performs much better than the historical maximum likelihood of zero precipitation values in computing spi in dry climates of iran where zero precipitation is the typical climate condition of the summer months spinp performs much worse than spi in arid and hyper arid climates because it specified much higher positive values to zero precipitation records of the dry months this means that both spi and spinp represent the zero precipitation anomalies of the summer season of arid climate as the moderately wet or very wet condition which is a false alarm this misrepresentation makes both spi and spnp unsuitable for computing spi at short time scales especially in arid and hyper arid climates characterized by very high pzp raziei 2021 nevertheless a much higher agreement was found between sspi and spinp in representing the anomalies of the dry months precipitation particularly at 1 month time scale which is related to the fact that spi sets aside a positive value 0 5 to both zero and none zero precipitation values while both spinp and sspi preserve the magnitudes of the none zero precipitation by allocating relatively similar positive index values to them this indicates that when most of the time series is zero which is very common in the arid climate spi allocates a fairly low spi value to non zero precipitation values though spinp better represents none zero precipitation anomalies of the dry month of the arid and hyper arid climates than spi however its performance is worse than spi in representing the zero precipitation as it sets them much higher positive values than does the spi tijdeman et al 2020 also found that any standardized index derived from non parametric methods including the kernel density estimation vidal et al 2010 has a large uncertainty bound and the spread and magnitude of the minimum values of the resulting index do not resemble those expected from a probabilistic index these shortcomings imply that the spinp has no advantage over spi for computing the index at short time scales in arid and hyper arid climates more specifically if one notes that zero precipitation is the climate norm of the dry summer months of the arid and hyper arid climates spinp provides an extremely unrealistic result as it incorrectly sets apart zero precipitation as the moderately wet condition when computing spi at short time scales considering that the accuracy and reliability of spi calculation depend on the length of the sample at hand this result suggests that in arid and hyper arid climates the spi values computed with the limited number of non zero precipitation remained after excluding zero values is substantially uncertain hu et al 2015 wu et al 2007 in such a situation the application of sspi performs much better results in characterizing aggregated precipitation at shorter time scales as demonstrated in the result section sspi has detected more severe drought and wet conditions than spi and spinp which can be partly due to the different scales and transformations used for standardizing the indices values or to the better performance of sspi in detecting the extreme conditions this issue needs further examination and it is desirable to be explored in other areas of the world to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of sspi against spi 5 conclusion this research introduces the sspi index that takes into account different time scales and pzp as in the procedure for calculating the spi index the spi and sspi were then computed for 45 stations distributed over diverse climates of iran and the resulted time series were statistically compared the results show a very strong association between the two indices at all considered stations and time scales particularly at longer ones the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient computed between the two indices depicts large r values across iran particularly over northern and western iran where precipitation is more regularly distributed throughout the year it is also observed that sspi well mimics the time behavior of spi time series at all climatic areas of iran more specifically at longer time scales comparing pdfs of sspi and spi at two example stations revealed a comparable agreement between the two indices both being relatively normally distributed at all considered time scales based on the s w test skewness kurtosis and q q plots the spatial distribution of the s w test computed for all stations and time scales show s w test values larger than 0 96 at most of the stations over northern and western iran and lower values in eastern central and southern iran indicating that both indices are more normally distributed in the former areas where precipitation is less skewed however sspi shows a lower s w test than the spi at some stations distributed over south and east of iran which is an indication of its higher deviation from the normal distribution than the spi by comparing the frequency distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes a strong relation between the two indices are seen this is indicated by very high values of contingency coefficient and cramér s v statistic at all the stations and time scales considered in general a very strong correspondence between sspi and spi is observed regarding the time variability and distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes nonetheless the advantages of sspi against the spi are its simpler calculation procedure and its ability in allowing for missing data which is very important for regions where weather data are often incomplete it also permits computing the index when a large number of or all of the data records are zero values which is a common feature of arid and hyper arid climates this introduces sspi as the better index applicable to dry climates where often it is difficult to fit a distribution function to the few non zero precipitation values for computing spi or when computed is less reliable although olukayode oladipo 1985 keyantash and dracup 2002 and loukas et al 2003 have already confirmed the suitability of rai or a modified version of it hänsel et al 2016 as an alternative to spi it is expected that sspi performs much better than spi in most parts of the world particularly in the arid and hyper arid climates the sspi is particularly a superior index for applications in arid and hyper arid climates where a very large proportion of precipitation values is zero or the length of data records is too short to fit a distribution to the inadequate non zero precipitation

4235,the rainfall anomaly index rai is revisited herein as an alternative to the standardized precipitation index spi taking into account different time scales and the probability of zero precipitation as in the spi procedure to evaluate the performance of the modified rai that stands as a simplified standardized precipitation index sspi both indices were computed for 45 stations distributed across diverse climates of iran the resulted time series and frequency distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes were statistically compared the results show a very strong association between the two indices at all stations and time scales particularly at longer time scales the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient r computed between the two indices depicts large r values across iran particularly over northern and western iran where precipitation is distributed more regularly throughout the year the spatial distribution of the shapiro wilks s w normality test computed for all studied stations and time scales show values larger than 0 96 in northern and western iran and lower values ranging from 0 82 to 0 96 for a few stations scattered in eastern central and southern iran this indicated that both indices have a closer distribution to the standard normal distribution in northern and western iran where precipitation is less skewed however sspi shows a lower s w test than the spi for some stations scattered over central eastern iran which is an indication of its higher deviation from the normal distribution the comparison of the frequency distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes also reveals a very strong association between the two indices as indicated by very high values of contingency coefficient and cramér s v statistic for all time scales at the studied stations sspi is simpler in calculation than the spi and permits for missing data and large numbers of zero values in the data records which is very common in arid and hyper arid climates thus sspi is preferred over spi when the length of data records is short or contains a large number of zero values for which spi is incomputable or unreliable keywords drought probability of zero precipitation probability density function spi rai sspi iran 1 introduction several drought indices are proposed for drought monitoring from which the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are generally accepted and widely used all over the world the australian drought watch system uses the decile index gibbs and maher 1967 as the meteorological drought index it is a rank based drought index with a relatively simple calculation procedure and fewer assumptions than the pdsi hayes et al 2011 requiring only precipitation as the input undoubtedly the spi is the most robust and effective widely used drought index that enjoys several advantages over many indices introduced in the literature vicente serrano 2006 hayes et al 1999 discussed the advantages and disadvantages of spi in characterizing drought events according to hayes et al 1999 spi requires only precipitation that is available with a much finer spatial and temporal coverage across the land areas of the globe for calculating spi the most suited probability distribution function pdf is first fitted to the precipitation time series aggregated at different timescales and then the resulted cumulative probability distribution cdf is normalized to obtain the index value the spi can be temporally and spatially comparable if a uniform calculation process is implemented otherwise comparing the spi values will not be easy if different probability distribution functions are used for different locations this makes the spi not affected by geographical or topographical differences hayes et al 1999 lana et al 2001 the world meteorological organization hayes et al 2011 wmo 2006 has recommended the spi as a generally accepted index for drought monitoring and characterization in all climatic regions of the world being based upon the probability of precipitation values accumulated over different time scales ranging from 1 to 72 months edwards and mckee 1997 spi is suitable to identify all types of droughts namely the meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts however according to guttman 1994 and guttman 1999 the practical range of spi time scales is 1 to 24 month if one notes that around 50 60 years of data is required for a confidential spi computation therefore unless 80 100 years of data is available the sample size is too small and the statistical confidence of the probability estimates on the tails of the distribution becomes very weak for time scales beyond 24 month svoboda et al 2012 guttman 1998 has recommended the spi as the primary drought index due to its simpler computation procedure and spatially consistent invariant in its interpretation and probabilistic so that it can be used in risk and decision analysis due to its advantages mentioned above spi was extensively used for drought analysis and characterization in different areas around the globe including the u s a hayes et al 1999 europe lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 south africa rouault and richard 2003 hungary domonkos 2003 italy bonaccorso et al 2003 east africa ntale and gan 2003 greece tsakiris and vangelis 2004 and korea min et al 2003 however according to hayes et al 1999 the spi has three potential disadvantages a the assumption of finding a suitable theoretical probability distribution to fit the raw precipitation is largely dependent on the quantity and reliability of the data used to fit the distribution guttman 1999 quiring 2009 b equal value of spi at two different locations does not necessarily imply an equal water deficit at the locations wu et al 2007 indicating that the spi is not capable of distinguishing drought prone regions from other areas c when applying the spi at short time scales in regions with highly seasonal precipitation misleadingly large positive or negative spi values may result particularly in arid and semi arid regions having many months with zero precipitation wu et al 2007 the spi is also based on the assumption of fitting precipitation data to a given pdf lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 wu et al 2007 which is valid when long term data records are available that is not always the case in arid and hyper arid climates particularly in the seasons with many zero precipitation values thus resulting in less reliable spi values at shorter time scales by proposing a non parametric normalization procedure for spi computation farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 attempted to overcome such a conceptual drawback raible et al 2017 the proposed approach is a rank based method that simply transforms the plotting positions to the standard normal distribution farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 to directly describes any sample at hand independent of its properties and without requiring testing for the goodness of fit tijdeman et al 2020 as another disadvantage spi also does not assumes temporal stationarity over the period for which it is calculated therefore its robustness in drought characterization under a changing climate is not clear seneviratne et al 2012 like the decile index gibbs and maher 1967 the rainfall anomaly index rai developed by van rooy 1965 incorporates a ranking procedure to assign magnitudes to positive and negative precipitation anomalies keyantash and dracup 2002 utilizing a normalization procedure more simpler than that used in spi computation olukayode oladipo 1985 found insignificant differences between rai and the more complicated drought indices like pdsi in nebraska state usa likewise keyantash and dracup 2002 found a very strong association between rai and spi time series in two climate divisions of oregon state usa loukas et al 2003 also found rai and spi time series highly comparable in greece more recently hänsel et al 2016 evaluated the suitability of a modified version of rai as an alternative to spi in assessing future precipitation conditions in central europe and found it highly correlated with spi as stated by hänsel et al 2016 rai offers a higher degree of transparency and tractability and has a lower degree of sophistication than the spi concerning the evaluation criteria for drought indices proposed by keyantash and dracup 2002 it is also computationally less demanding than spi but with comparable performance as reported by the aforementioned studies the aforementioned studies have evaluated the performance of rai in small homogenous areas with humid to moderate climates where precipitation is less skewed compared to arid and hyper arid climates characterized by periods with a high probability of zero precipitation pzp however although loukas et al 2003 have already tested rai in a few greek stations with temperate climate where zero precipitation values during summer month are common there is no information regarding the performance of rai in arid and hyper arid climates where precipitation is highly skewed and zero precipitation values dominated its lengthy warm dry period raziei 2021 therefore this study proposes some modifications to rai and evaluates its performance in diverse climates of iran that includes arid and hyper arid climates the proposed modifications make the index a better tool for drought monitoring in arid and hyper arid climates of the world where precipitation data is either short incomplete or contains very high pzp raziei 2021 with which computing spi is impossible or unreliable the modified rai is expected to serve as a simplified standardized precipitation index sspi as it is very simple in computation and requires less statistical assumptions and computational demands while resulting in values highly comparable with spi values it is particularly superior over spi for application in arid and hyper arid climates particularly at shorter time scales when the existence of very high pzp makes computing spi impossible or unreliable 2 materials and methods 2 1 data fig 1 illustrates the spatial distribution of 45 iranian first order synoptic stations used in this study the stations were selected based on the availability of data records with no missing values for a period as long as possible these criteria made the selected stations denser in western and northwestern iran and scattered in central eastern iran where hosted large inhabitant areas including several deserts of iran see fig 1 the selected stations monitored by the iranian meteorological organization irimo have complete data records from 1971 to 2018 with an acceptable distribution across diverse climate types of iran defined by raziei 2017 based on the köppen geiger climate classification system the selected stations contain an adequate number of representative stations for each of the five main precipitation sub regions of iran characterized by different monthly precipitation variability raziei 2018 and dry wet periods raziei et al 2011 2013 raziei et al 2010 the monthly precipitation records of the selected stations downloaded from the irimo website at http www irimet net possessed a few missing values only in two of the stations that were estimated by establishing a linear regression between the station with missing values and their neighboring stations adopting the rationale simple linear imputation process in this study is reasonable since the percentage of missing values requiring imputation is tiny however utilizing non linear machine learning methods including the support vector machines and artificial neural network algorithms is preferable when data have more missing values richman et al 2009 2 2 spi computation the spi is calculated by fitting a probability distribution function to the frequency distribution of precipitation data aggregated at any desired time scale in other words computing spi begins with determining a probability density function that best describes the aggregated precipitation time series at a given time scale then the determined cumulative probability of the observed precipitation values is converted to a standard normal distribution to obtain the spi values edwards and mckee 1997 in the present study spi is computed by fitting a gamma pdf to precipitation aggregated at all the time scales considered although raziei 2021 has identified the pearson type iii distribution as the most appropriate distribution function in fitting precipitation aggregated at all considered time scales throughout iran the gamma pdf was intentionally used herein because it is extensively used in iran as it is the default pdf of many codes available for spi computation raziei 2021 nonetheless raziei 2021 showed that gamma best fitted monthly precipitation over most parts of iran and identified it as one of the pdfs with the lowest goodness of fit rejection rate for all considered time scales for the present study besides the monthly precipitation series of each calendar month as the representative of one month time scale time series of longer precipitation aggregations of 3 6 9 12 and 24 months were also constructed for computing spi at 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales the longer than 1 month aggregations are averages of the monthly values in the aggregation duration ending in each of the 12 calendar months of the year the shorter time scales 1 3 and 6 month are usually used for monitoring meteorological and agricultural droughts and the longer ones 9 12 and 24 month are useful for monitoring hydrological droughts edwards and mckee 1997 that includes groundwater and surface water van lanen and peters 2000 2 3 rai computation similar to the decile index gibbs and maher 1967 rai developed by van rooy 1965 is a rank based drought index that incorporates a ranking procedure to assign magnitudes to positive and negative precipitation anomalies keyantash and dracup 2002 the rai index is computed as below 1 r a i 3 p i p e p in eq 1 p i is the sequence of measured precipitation at the time i p is average precipitation e is average of 10 extrema and 3 is the prefix used to limits the lower and upper bounds of the anomalies this standardization follows the unity based feature scaling aksoy and haralick 2001 khansalari et al 2018 to asymmetrically distribute the original anomalies between the predefined limits 3 and 3 for positive anomalies i e p i p greater than 0 the prefix is positive i e 3 and e is the average of the 10 highest precipitation values on record for negative anomalies i e p i p 0 the prefix is negative i e 3 and the average of 10 lowest measurements are used keyantash and dracup 2002 however calculating e from the ten largest smallest precipitation values appear arbitrary van rooy 1965 chose 10 because he thought the average of 10 extremes could represent the mean conditions of an extremely dry year or extremely wet year shen et al 2006 the index values are judged against a 9 member classification scheme as in table 1 left column ranging from extremely wet rai 3 to extremely dry rai 3 this classification which is similar to that used by gibbs and maher 1967 to partition precipitation values between ten deciles is equally applicable to various lengths of drought including flash droughts meteorological drought deep soil moisture drought and hydrological drought defined with rai computed at different time scales as demonstrated by keyantash and dracup 2002 loukas et al 2003 and hänsel et al 2016 eq 1 performs well in humid to moderate climates of the world where monthly precipitation distributed relatively regularly throughout the year and the associated distribution is less skewed for example keyantash and dracup 2002 examined the performance of rai in two climate divisions of oregon state usa characterized by moist to moderate climates denoted as köppen csb climate type and found a very high correlation coefficient between spi and rai computed at 1 month time scale similarly loukas et al 2003 have evaluated the performance of rai in the mediterranean climates of greece that are classified as csa csb or cfb köppen climate types however despite that summer is dry and precipitation occurrence in some of their studied stations is less likely in that season they found an excellent agreement between rai and other drought indices in depicting drought and wet periods likewise hänsel et al 2016 have assessed the performance of rai in central europe characterized by köppen cfb climate type however eq 1 does not perform well in most parts of iran that are characterized by bsk bsh bwh and bwk climate types raziei 2017 as shown in fig 1 in such areas the june september period is totally dry with a very low chance of precipitation raziei 2021 hence a very large proportion of monthly and seasonal aggregated precipitation time series is zero that often results in zero mean and median as the climate norm of the region raziei 2021 in cases when pzp is 40 very likely p p and e become zero and thus computing rai becomes impossible this suggests taking into account the pzp of the dry months as the climate norm of the region for rai computation therefore as in the spi computation procedure it is desirable to consider time scales and pzps of the dry months in rai computation to consider the aforementioned issues in rai computation a few modifications outlined below are proposed 1 aggregate monthly precipitation data to any desire time scale as in the spi procedure 2 compute the skewness of the aggregated monthly precipitation for a given time scale ended at each calendar month 3 reduce the skewness of the aggregated monthly precipitation series using the cube root transformation if its skewness is greater than 0 5 and the cube transformation x3 if it is less than 0 5 4 compute the anomalies of the transformed precipitation time series δ for the aggregated transformed precipitation by subtracting p i from p i e p i p where p i is ith transformed precipitation value and p is the median of the transformed series 5 for each time scale ended at each 12 calendar month rank the transformed data p remove duplicate values and then compute the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the data 6 set the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ranked transformed data as the average of the bottom 5 precipitation records p b and the average of top 5 precipitation records p t respectively similarly consider the 50th percentile as the median p of the data the logic behind using p b and p t the 5th and 95th percentiles as the threshold is that if 100 years of data records are used then p t is the mean of the 5 largest and p b is the mean of the 5 smallest values of the data records shen et al 2006 using the lowest and highest percentiles will give more realistic results particularly when the time series p is notably shorter than the ones van rooy 1965 used in his analysis hänsel et al 2016 using the 5th and 95th percentiles in eq 2 as p b and p t respectively causes the index values to exceed 3 and 3 limits instead if the minimum and maximum of the data are used in eq 2 the index will reach 3 0 when p reaches p b and will reach 3 0 when p reaches p t and thus the index values are confined between 3 and 3 therefore the original equation is slightly modified to confine the index between 3 and 3 when using the 5th and 95th percentiles as p b and p t using a set of modifications described above the modified rai hereafter called sspi can be computed as below for a certain month i 2 sspi 3 p i p p t p p i p p t p p i p p max p if δ i 0 a n d p z p 40 3 p i p p b p p i p p b p p i p p min p if δ i 0 a n d p z p 40 3 p i p max p 0 if max p 0 a n d p z p 40 3 p i p ε 0 if max p 0 a n d p z p 40 in eq 2 δ i is the anomaly value of the transformed observation i computed as δ i p i p since precipitation aggregated at various timescales are highly skewed in most of the studied stations the median p is used instead of the arithmetic mean of the precipitation time series p hänsel et al 2016 using the median is particularly more efficient than the mean of the data in dealing with precipitation time series of arid and hyper arid climates where a majority proportion of precipitation records are zero raziei 2021 in this modification the pzp also makes a major role the first and second relations of eq 2 are exactly those of the original equation of van rooy 1965 that can be applied to the months and time scales with pzp 40 when an adequate number of non zero precipitation records is available for computing the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the data since the first part of these equations that uses the 5th and 95th percentiles to standardize the data does not bound the data between 3 and 3 the second part is added to standardize the data with its minimum and maximum then subtract its result from the earlier part and adding the results to the original standardization in the first part of the relation to limit the outcome between 3 and 3 the proposed rescaling limits the sspi values between the spi range and obtains similar values and class frequencies as those of the spi hänsel et al 2016 have set the scaling factor of eqs 1 to 1 7 to limit the index values between the range of spi values assuming that it is an arbitrary value that can be adjusted to obtain rai values in the range of any drought index with which rai is comparing here the third and fourth relations of eq 2 are proposed to address the large proportion of zero values in arid and hyper arid climates of the world that hinders computing sspi with the first and second relations since most likely the median of the data is zero for summer months in such cases when the maximum of the non zero precipitation records denoted by max p is a positive integer max p greater than 0 the sspi is computed using the third relation for example when pzp 40 and max p is a positive integer the third relation assigns 3 0 to that value as the maximum sspi and smaller positive sspi to all other non zero precipitation values smaller than max p however the third relation fails when all the time series are zero i e pzp 100 and thus p 0 in such cases instead of max p an arbitrarily small positive quantity denoted by ε is used in the denominator of the fourth relation to avoid division by zero the flowchart of the sspi computation procedure is illustrated in fig 2 with a numerical example given in table 2 table 2 shows the procedure of computing a 1 month time scale sspi for january and august in zabol station as the representatives of the wet and dry months of the station here only 25 years of data 1971 1995 is used to limit the size of the table as shown the computed skewness of the precipitation time series of january is 1 65 that signals a highly skewed distribution since the skewness is positive and greater than 0 5 the time series was cube root transformed which reduced the skewness to zero which is an indication of the symmetrical distribution of the transformed series the transformed series is then used to compute the anomalies by subtracting each value from the long term mean of the transformed time series after that the transformed data is ranked and the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the transformed data are computed and used in the first and second relations of eq 2 to compute sspi as detailed above in step 6 as is seen the skewness of both anomaly and sspi time series for january are 0 0 and 0 12 respectively implying that their distributions are quasi symmetrical the right hand part of the table shows how the sspi is computed for august when almost all the time series is zero except for the seventh record that equals 0 3 mm as is seen the skewness of august is 4 69 and the cube root transformation was not able to reduce it anymore since most of the august precipitation time series is zero pzp 40 and the maximum of the transformed series max p is 0 7 the third relation was used for computing sspi this relation designates zero sspi to all zero precipitation values subtracting zero from zero and the maximum positive sspi to the single non zero precipitation record note that when all the records are zero the fourth relation is used for computing the sspi it should also be noted that it is impossible to compute spi for such a time series sspi is a standardized index that accounts for the pzp and the median of precipitation records and results in values that are highly comparable to spi values in all climatic areas of iran as described in the next sections to have comparable frequencies of spi and sspi values in different classes the classification system of hänsel et al 2016 shown in the middle column of table 1 has been adopted this classification system is a modification of the original classifications of van rooy 1965 and mckee et al 1993 2 4 comparing sspi with spi the performance of sspi in different climate regions of iran was evaluated against the spi time series computed with both parametric and non parametric hereafter spinp approaches however for the sake of brevity the comparison made between sspi and spinp was presented only for two example stations of babolsar located along the caspian sea in the north and zabol in southeast iran where sspi showed the highest and the lowest agreement with spi respectively babolsar climate type is cfa raziei 2017 which resembles the climates of the stations used by keyantash and dracup 2002 loukas et al 2003 and hänsel et al 2016 while zabol station is considered as the representative of the hyper arid climate of iran with a climate type of bwh raziei 2017 the later station has a long dry period with very high pzps sspi was primarily compared with spi through pearson correlation coefficient r and spearman s rank correlation coefficient computed between the time series of sspi and spi indices computed at different time scales however due to the existence of a strong linear relationship between the indices at all studied stations and time scales spearman s rank correlation coefficient approaches to 1 0 at most of the studied stations particularly for time scales larger than 3 month therefore for assessing the degree of agreement between the indices the pearson correlation coefficient was rather used since it shows a wider range of values over the stations that favors illustrating the inter stations variation of correlation coefficient to assess the spatial variation of the r values over iran characterized by different köppen geiger climate types raziei 2017 the computed r values for the studied stations distributed across iran were mapped for all considered time scales the consistency between the sspi and spi indices was also illustrated by comparing the time variability and pdf of the indices as well as the scatterplots of precipitation vs the indices values for the two example stations of babolsar and zabol see fig 1 because spi values fit a typical normal distribution to define the number of standard deviations by which a normally distributed random variable deviates from its long term mean guenang and kamga 2014 it is expected that the spi values fall within one standard deviation in approximately 68 of the time within two standard deviations 95 of the time and within three standard deviations 99 of the time hayes et al 1999 this feature enables spi to represent both wetter and drier periods in the same way meaning that an spi value 1 0 and 2 occurs 16 and two to three times in 100 years respectively while an spi of less than 3 0 occurs once in approximately 200 years hayes et al 1999 accordingly since it is expected that the final spi values follow a standard normal distribution it is reasonable to test whether the spi values computed for a given station and time scale meet this assumption for this purpose the s w test shapiro and wilk 1965 stephens 1974 was also used to examine whether the spi values calculated through the equiprobability transformation wu et al 2007 are normally distributed the s w test is based on the assumption that the spi values should be normally distributed μ 0 σ 1 and independently sampled however the s w test is strongest against short tailed platykurtic and skewed distributions and weakest against symmetric moderately long tailed leptokurtic distributions and also has issues with ties and extreme values royston 1992 1993 therefore the s w test used here is based on a method proposed by wu et al 2007 who used it in conjunction with two more criteria to guarantee that the examined series is normally distributed this approach was also used by naresh kumar et al 2009 to test the suitability of spi values in arid regions with substantial zero precipitation values based on these criteria the distribution of the examined indices is non normal when it s s w test and the associated p value is 0 96 and 0 10 respectively and the absolute value of the index median is greater than 0 05 otherwise the distribution is normal naresh kumar et al 2009 stagge et al 2015 wu et al 2007 when these three criteria are met simultaneously the normality assumption of the distribution is rejected more recently stagge et al 2015 and svensson et al 2017 have also used this test to evaluate the performance of different candidate distribution functions for spi computation over europe and the uk respectively as stated above for application of the s w test it is assumed that the data are independently sampled thus to examine the assumption of whether the spi and sspi values are independently sampled the autocorrelation of the indices time series of each station and time scale ended at each calendar month was computed the result showed no significant autocorrelation for lags greater than 1 in any station and time scale indicating that the indices values relative to all time scales and stations are independently sampled in addition the skewness and kurtosis of the indices time series were also computed for all considered stations and time scales to provide more insights on how far they are from normality the normal quantile quantile plots q q plot were also provided for the two example stations to illustrate the closeness of their computed indices to the standard normal distribution moreover the frequencies of spi and sspi classes defined based on the nine anomaly classes shown in table 1 were cross tabulated to examine if they are comparable in partitioning the time series into different classes the chi square statistic of the contingency table established between the two indices and the associated p value was used to determine if the relationship between the variables is significant at the 0 95 confidence level while the contingency coefficient cc and the cramér s v statistic cramer 1946 computed with the chi square statistic were used to measure their degree of association the cc and cramér s v statistic cramer 1946 defined in eqs 3 and 4 respectively are chi squared based measures of association that define whether the two nominal variables or data sets are independent or dependent of each other the values of these measures range between 0 and 1 where 0 indicating no association between the row and column variables of a contingency table and values close to 1 indicating a high degree of association between the variables 3 c c x 2 n x 2 4 v x 2 n m i n r 1 c 1 in eqs 3 and 4 n is the number of observations of sspi spi time series classified between the classes r and c are the numbers of rows and columns of the contingency table established between the indices frequency of cross classification and x 2 is the chi square statistic that measures the statistical relationship between the variables in the cross classification table besides as an illustrative example the histograms of the frequency distribution of the sspi and spi values between the classes are illustrated for the two example stations 3 results 3 1 comparing time variability of the indices fig 3 shows the time variability of spi and sspi time series at babolsar station in the north of iran computed at 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales within the period 1971 2017 as it is seen sspi strongly co vary with spi spinp at all time scales particularly at longer ones the r between the two indices is higher than 0 98 for 1 and 3 month time scales and higher than 0 99 for the rest of the time scales this strong association between the two indices indicates that sspi well represents the time variability and magnitudes of spi at babolsar station that has a cfa climate type raziei 2017 similarly fig 4 shows the time behavior of the indices for zabol station in the southeast of iran that has a bwh climate type raziei 2017 as it is evident there is also a strong agreement between the three indices in zabol station where it s very long dry period leads very high pzps in shorter time precipitation aggregations the r between the indices is 0 78 0 84 and 0 92 for 1 3 and 6 month time scales which is noticeably lower than those computed for babolsar station at the same time scales the observed lower correlation for these time scales at zabol station is partly because spi assigned positive values close to 1 0 to zero precipitation records of the dry months as the probability of zero precipitation while sspi assigned them zero values as the climate norm of the station see fig 4 a careful looking at fig 4 also suggests that spinp even assigned much higher positive values to zero precipitation records at the 1 month time scale as an indication of moderately to very wet conditions as another discrepancy sspi also detected more severe drought conditions than spi and spinp at the shorter time scales nonetheless the r between the two indices in zabol station is higher than 0 99 at longer time scales suggesting a very strong association between the two indices as observed for babolsar this is because the pzp of the time series decreases when the time scale exceeds 6 month there observed a linear relationship between spi spinp and sspi time series at the studied stations and time scales suggesting that they are consistent in representing dry and wet events at all considered time scales and calendar months particularly for the wet months as an example fig 5a f illustrates the scatter plots of spi spinp and sspi time series relative to 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales at babolsar station in the north of iran as depicted there is a strong linear relationship between spi spinp and sspi time series at all the time scales sspi shows a similar relationship with both spi and spinp which is slightly stronger with spi mostly because spinp assigns spi values 1 5 to zero summer precipitation values the scatter plots of the individual months revealed a much stronger linear relationship between sspi and spi spinp for the wet months and a weaker relationship for the drier months not shown likewise fig 5g l depicts the scatter plots of sspi and spi spinp for zabol station at the border with afghanistan as is seen there observed a linear relationship between the indices at all the time scales but with a more dispersed cloud of points around the 1 1 line for the shorter time scales and a more compacted cloud of points for the longer time scales of 9 12 and 24 months the observed dispersion of the cloud of points at the shorter time scales is related to the poor relationship between sspi and spi spinp values relative to drier months when both spi and spinp assign positive spi values to zero precipitation records as an example at the 1 month time scale there observed three cases of zero precipitation for which spi assigned an spi value 1 5 and spinp assigned values between 1 5 and 2 0 but sspi exactly assigned them zero values likewise at the 3 month time scale there observed two cases of zero precipitation for which both spi and spinp assigned an spi value between 1 0 and 2 0 whereas sspi exactly assigned them zero values due to the existence of a higher number of zero precipitation values in the precipitation series of dry months the relationship between sspi and spi spinp turned to curve linear fig 6 illustrates the scatter plots of monthly indices values and precipitation values for babolsar station in the north of iran with the r values noted in the upper left of each graph as it is shown there is a linear trend between the variables the indices and precipitation at all individual months sspi also shows a very strong correlation with precipitation and highly co varies with spi and spinp at all months particularly at wetter months however this relationship weakens at lower index values for the drier months indicating a slightly different response of the indices to more severe droughts this means that there is not a completely linear relationship between the indices at drier months since it turned into a curve linear model at the lower and to some extent at the higher index values which are more profound in february march june july august and november at babolsar station the reason that the model turns into a curve linear shape at the lower index values is that the spi tends to show lower values than sspi for smaller precipitation values however fig 6 suggests an extremely high agreement between the indices values at the central part of the data values for most of the months the correlation coefficient between sspi and spi r1 is greater than 0 97 suggesting a very strong association between the indices a similar pattern is observed for the zabol station fig 7 but with large differences between sspi and spi values from may to november which is because spi assigns a high probability of zero precipitation almost 0 5 to zero or negligible precipitation values in the arid and hyper arid climates thus in locations with distinct dry seasons spi fails to evaluate the drought condition especially at short time scales wu et al 2007 when zero precipitation is the climate norm therefore when pzp is very high the equiprobability transformation of precipitation distributions might not be achieved and the resulting spi time series will not be normally distributed blain 2012 this issue is depicted in the scatter plots of june to august for zabol station when the spi assigns very large positive values to zero and negligible precipitation smaller than 2 millimeters while sspi assigns zero values to such precipitation values this indicates that sspi presents the most realistic result since the climate norm of the dry season of such locations is almost zero this can be conceived much better if one notes that precipitation values smaller than 5 millimeters are not effective at all in the presence of very high summer evapotranspiration in dry climates despite the observed discrepancies between the two indices at zabol station particularly for the dry months r is greater than 0 97 from november to april indicating a very high agreement between spi and sspi however there observed no correlation between the two indices from july to september when the pzp is approximately 100 as discussed above the lower r values of these months are mostly related to the unrealistic spi values assigned to zero precipitation values according to fig 7 while sspi correctly assigns zero sspi values to zero precipitation records of june to october the spi unrealistically assigns values close to 1 0 to such precipitation values the observed perfect linear relationship between the sspi and precipitation values in these months reveals the mechanism of the third and fourth relationships of eq 2 in linearly rescaling precipitation values between zero and 3 0 in the dry season when pzp exceeds 40 in such cases i e when all or the majority of the time series are zero the third and fourth relationships of eq 2 consider zero precipitation as the climate norm and permit computing sspi even in the presence of missing data differently it is impossible to compute spi when there are missing data or an insufficient number of no zero precipitation records in the time series to fit a distribution function in such cases spi assigns the probability of zero precipitation which is almost close to 1 0 to all zero precipitation records of the dry months and identifies them as the moderately wet condition which is absolutely a false alarm fig 7 also shows that spi assigns much higher index values to the lower precipitation of the wetter months than does the sspi which means that spi underestimates the magnitudes of the negative precipitation anomalies of the wetter months of the arid and hyper arid climates comparing the response of spinp to precipitation records of july to september at zabol station it is clear that spinp performs better than spi in characterizing the infrequent non zero precipitation records as is shown when no correlation coefficient was found between spi and sspi at zabol station for months july to september r1 there observed a prefect correlation between spinp and sspi denoted by r2 fig 8 illustrates how the computed r between spi and sspi varies across diverse climates of iran at 1 month time scale r is higher than 0 9 over the coastal areas of the caspian sea and most of the stations over the mountainous areas of western and northern iran that are characterized with either bsk csa csb cfa or dsa climate types however it is between 0 74 and 0 9 in southern and southeastern iran that is dominated by bwh and bwk climate types raziei 2017 by comparing the maps one can notice that r generally increases all over the country by increasing the time scale particularly at the 3 month time scale in south of iran for the longer time scales a relatively uniform distribution of r values higher than 0 96 is observed implying a very high consistency between the two indices across the country fig 9a f depicts the pdf of the spi spinp and sspi time series at babolsar station computed for different time scales as it is seen the pdf of sspi and spi spinp time series follow each other reasonably well at all the time scales similarly fig 9g l compares the pdf of sspi and spi spinp time series at zabol station for different time scales fig 9g l however shows considerable discrepancies between the pdf of the indices at 1 3 and 6 month time scales which is related to different responses of the indices to very large pzps of the station fig 9g l suggests that the spi and spinp are relatively lower bounded at shorter time scales which is common in regions with low seasonal precipitation totals where precipitation is highly seasonal and heavily skewed in such areas spi behaves very similar to the percent of normal index in representing precipitation anomalies at shorter time scales and therefore fails in identifying drought occurrences because of non normally distributed spi values wu et al 2007 as exemplified in figs 3 and 4 moreover because of high pzps in such stations the spi and spinp tend to have their maximum frequencies at spi value around 1 0 because of assigning the probability of zero values to zero precipitation while sspi maximized exactly at zero value fig 9g l additionally there observed noticeable differences between spi and spinp at zabol station for shorter time scales particularly at the 1 month time scale where spinp assigns much higher positive values to summer season zero precipitation than the spi see fig 4 the pdfs of the individual summer months showed much narrower bounds of spi values for shorter time scales at zabol station nonetheless there is a high consistency between the pdfs of the indices at 9 12 and 24 month time scales for which the pzp is close to zero raziei 2021 fig 10 shows the spatial variation of the s w test computed for the spi time series of different time scales across iran as is illustrated for the majority of the stations the s w test is greater than 0 96 for all considered time scales particularly those stations distributed across northern and western iran this implies that the spi time series of all considered time scales are normally distributed in most of the studied stations except for spi 1 and spi 3 for which a few stations scattered over the southeastern part of the country show lower s w test values fig 11 also shows a relatively similar pattern of s w test values for sspi time series all over the country particularly at longer time scales comparing figs 10 and 11 it is evident that the sspi shows a higher s w test value for a higher number of stations at the 1 month time scale particularly over northern and western iran indicating that it performs much better than spi at this time scale all over the country differently at the 3 month time scale spi shows higher values than sspi in southern and eastern iran however by increasing the time scale the s w test increases at all the studied stations and the test values exceed 0 96 at most of the stations particularly in the northern and western parts of the country there are also some sporadic stations in central southern and eastern iran with the s w test lower than 0 96 at longer time scales by comparing s w test values of sspi and spi time series it is concluded that both spi and sspi time series are asymmetrically distributed at most of the stations and time scales nonetheless the s w test value of spi is higher at a few stations particularly at shorter time scales which is related to the better normalization procedure used in spi computation despite its failure in passing the normality tests at many stations as additional measures required for deciding whether the indices come from a normal distribution the skewness and kurtosis of spi and sspi series relative to all time scales and stations distributed across the country were computed and presented in tables 3 and 4 as is seen in table 3 at most of the stations the skewness of both spi and sspi in parenthesis relative to all the time scales are comparable and fall within the range of 0 5 and 0 5 however in almost all of the stations the skewness of sspi is much lower than that of spi at all the time scales and in most cases it is close to zero this difference is particularly more noticeable at tabass station in central eastern iran specifically for 12 and 24 month time scales table 4 also presents the kurtosis of the indices series for all the time scales and stations considered this table also revealed that at most of the stations the kurtosis of both spi and sspi indices confined between 3 particularly for larger time scales indicating that the indices are approximately normally distributed at most of the stations the kurtosis of the sspi is noticeably lower than that of the spi which is an indication that the tails of the sspi series are lighter than those of the spi index nonetheless the computed kurtosis of spi time series relative to 1 and 3 month time scales is larger than 3 for most of the stations whereas it is smaller than 3 for sspi suggesting that the sspi series are closer to a normal distribution than the spi series fig 12 illustrates the q q plots of spi and sspi time series relative to 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month time scales at the two example stations the q q plots of babolsar station left hand columns suggest that both spi and sspi indices plausibly come from a normal distribution since the data points fall about the straight line this is particularly more plausible for the spi series however it seems that the extreme sspi values slightly violated this assumption the q q plots of zabol right hand columns also show relatively similar patterns for longer time scales however for the shorter time scales of 1 3 and 6 month time scales the points do not fall along the straight line which is attributed to the effects of the higher number of zero precipitation values at these time scales that distort the time series distribution from the normal distribution the distortion from the normal distribution at zabol station is more remarkable for the sspi series where spi also shows the same response at 1 3 and 6 month time scales as well as the 24 month time scale 3 2 comparing the within class frequencies of the indices the frequency of the indices categorized within the nine wetness and dryness classes of table 1 middle column are shown in figs 13 and 14 for the two example stations as it is seen the frequency distribution of both indices are highly comparable and have a relatively symmetrical distribution at babolsar in the north of iran in all considered time scales the spi tends to show slightly higher number of events in the near normal nn slightly dry sd and slightly wet sw classes and fewer events in the extremely wet ew and extremely dry ed classes a similar pattern is observed for zabol at the border with afghanistan but with remarkable differences between the indices frequencies at different classes fig 14 demonstrates that the frequency of the nn class of sspi is higher than that of spi for 1 and 3 month time scales at zabol station the lower frequency of nn class for the spi is because spi falsely categorizes the summer months zero total precipitation as md class that in turn reduced the frequency of the nn class moreover as mentioned before in such a climate the pdf of spi is narrow which results in lower frequencies of extreme classes in favor of increasing the frequencies of slightly and moderately wet and dry conditions this characteristic of spi decreases the frequencies of vd ed vw and ed classes at the expense of increasing the frequencies of sd md sw and mw classes thus leading to remarkable differences between the two indices regarding the frequencies of the classes although the same classification scheme of table 1 is used to classify the values of both indices it is not expected that both indices confine well within the defined class limits therefore the observed differences between the frequency distribution of the indices classes dose not point to the inefficiency of either spi or sspi if one notes that the considered indices use different standardization as well as classification approaches to classify the index values between the classes despite the observed differences between the indices regarding the distribution of their values within the classes the contingency coefficient and the cramér s v maps shown in figs 15 and 16 show very high values all over the country suggesting a very high degree of association between the two indices the spatial variation of contingency coefficient across iran demonstrates very high values cc 0 9 over the northern part of the country at shorter time scales of 1 and 3 month and lower values ranging between 0 78 and 0 88 over the central southern and eastern iran considering that cc is the pearson s correlation coefficient commonly used in comparing nominal values it suggests a very high agreement between the two indices regarding the distribution of the values between classes even in southern iran based on fig 15 the cc value increases with increasing the time scale accordingly at longer time scales the cc values exceed 0 9 at most of the stations distributed over the country indicating a much better correspondence between the two indices in classifying the indices values fig 16 also shows a very similar pattern in the spatial distribution of cramér s v statistic across iran as another measure of association between the indices regarding the frequencies of wet and dry categories the higher values of the cramér s v statistic is also observed in northern and western parts of iran and lower ones in the centeral eastern and southern parts the maps of figures 15 and 16 have more uniform patterns of higher values at longer time scales while a dipole pattern is observed at shorter time scales 4 discussion the comparison of sspi with spi and spinp at the studied stations indicates a strong agreement between the three indices at most of the stations that increases by increasing the time scale the three indices congruently have captured the widespread historical droughts of 1985 86 1998 99 2000 2001 2007 08 and 2010 11 each of which struck most or some parts of the country with varying severity and duration as implied by the correlation coefficient greater than 0 98 all over the country the sspi fairly explains more than 95 of the time variability of spi and spinp at almost all locations however there observed some discrepancies between the three indices at shorter time scales particularly in arid and hyper arid climates where the dry summer season is very long and the pzp is larger than 50 as demonstrated in the result section this discrepancy is mostly due to the inefficiency of spi and spinp in characterizing the dry months precipitation anomalies at stations with very large pzp or when the time series is mostly zero in such cases spi assigned positive values close to 1 0 to zero precipitation records of the dry months as the probability of zero precipitation in cases when most of the time series is zero and the non zero precipitation values are not adequate to fit a pdf to the data spi assigns 1 0 to all data records including the non zero precipitation records this means that the computed spi values corresponding to such precipitation time series will never fall below 0 and thus creating the illogical situation that all periods with no detectable precipitation are wetter than is typical for the region stagge et al 2015 raziei 2021 has examined the center of mass of the zero distribution proposed by stagge et al 2015 as an alternative to the historical maximum likelihood of zero precipitation that is commonly used in spi calculation and found that the spi values produced using the mean probability of multiple zeros based upon the weibull plotting position function better maintain the statistical interpretability of the computed spi he proved that the method proposed by stagge et al 2015 performs much better than the historical maximum likelihood of zero precipitation values in computing spi in dry climates of iran where zero precipitation is the typical climate condition of the summer months spinp performs much worse than spi in arid and hyper arid climates because it specified much higher positive values to zero precipitation records of the dry months this means that both spi and spinp represent the zero precipitation anomalies of the summer season of arid climate as the moderately wet or very wet condition which is a false alarm this misrepresentation makes both spi and spnp unsuitable for computing spi at short time scales especially in arid and hyper arid climates characterized by very high pzp raziei 2021 nevertheless a much higher agreement was found between sspi and spinp in representing the anomalies of the dry months precipitation particularly at 1 month time scale which is related to the fact that spi sets aside a positive value 0 5 to both zero and none zero precipitation values while both spinp and sspi preserve the magnitudes of the none zero precipitation by allocating relatively similar positive index values to them this indicates that when most of the time series is zero which is very common in the arid climate spi allocates a fairly low spi value to non zero precipitation values though spinp better represents none zero precipitation anomalies of the dry month of the arid and hyper arid climates than spi however its performance is worse than spi in representing the zero precipitation as it sets them much higher positive values than does the spi tijdeman et al 2020 also found that any standardized index derived from non parametric methods including the kernel density estimation vidal et al 2010 has a large uncertainty bound and the spread and magnitude of the minimum values of the resulting index do not resemble those expected from a probabilistic index these shortcomings imply that the spinp has no advantage over spi for computing the index at short time scales in arid and hyper arid climates more specifically if one notes that zero precipitation is the climate norm of the dry summer months of the arid and hyper arid climates spinp provides an extremely unrealistic result as it incorrectly sets apart zero precipitation as the moderately wet condition when computing spi at short time scales considering that the accuracy and reliability of spi calculation depend on the length of the sample at hand this result suggests that in arid and hyper arid climates the spi values computed with the limited number of non zero precipitation remained after excluding zero values is substantially uncertain hu et al 2015 wu et al 2007 in such a situation the application of sspi performs much better results in characterizing aggregated precipitation at shorter time scales as demonstrated in the result section sspi has detected more severe drought and wet conditions than spi and spinp which can be partly due to the different scales and transformations used for standardizing the indices values or to the better performance of sspi in detecting the extreme conditions this issue needs further examination and it is desirable to be explored in other areas of the world to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of sspi against spi 5 conclusion this research introduces the sspi index that takes into account different time scales and pzp as in the procedure for calculating the spi index the spi and sspi were then computed for 45 stations distributed over diverse climates of iran and the resulted time series were statistically compared the results show a very strong association between the two indices at all considered stations and time scales particularly at longer ones the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient computed between the two indices depicts large r values across iran particularly over northern and western iran where precipitation is more regularly distributed throughout the year it is also observed that sspi well mimics the time behavior of spi time series at all climatic areas of iran more specifically at longer time scales comparing pdfs of sspi and spi at two example stations revealed a comparable agreement between the two indices both being relatively normally distributed at all considered time scales based on the s w test skewness kurtosis and q q plots the spatial distribution of the s w test computed for all stations and time scales show s w test values larger than 0 96 at most of the stations over northern and western iran and lower values in eastern central and southern iran indicating that both indices are more normally distributed in the former areas where precipitation is less skewed however sspi shows a lower s w test than the spi at some stations distributed over south and east of iran which is an indication of its higher deviation from the normal distribution than the spi by comparing the frequency distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes a strong relation between the two indices are seen this is indicated by very high values of contingency coefficient and cramér s v statistic at all the stations and time scales considered in general a very strong correspondence between sspi and spi is observed regarding the time variability and distribution of the indices values between different dry wet classes nonetheless the advantages of sspi against the spi are its simpler calculation procedure and its ability in allowing for missing data which is very important for regions where weather data are often incomplete it also permits computing the index when a large number of or all of the data records are zero values which is a common feature of arid and hyper arid climates this introduces sspi as the better index applicable to dry climates where often it is difficult to fit a distribution function to the few non zero precipitation values for computing spi or when computed is less reliable although olukayode oladipo 1985 keyantash and dracup 2002 and loukas et al 2003 have already confirmed the suitability of rai or a modified version of it hänsel et al 2016 as an alternative to spi it is expected that sspi performs much better than spi in most parts of the world particularly in the arid and hyper arid climates the sspi is particularly a superior index for applications in arid and hyper arid climates where a very large proportion of precipitation values is zero or the length of data records is too short to fit a distribution to the inadequate non zero precipitation values following the auspicious results obtained in this study evaluating the performance of sspi in other arid and hyper arid areas of the world is strongly recommended credit authorship contribution

4236,commonly used hydraulic models that describe the water retention and transport properties of variably saturated soils mainly account for the capillary component of matric potential but ignore the adsorption component experimental evidence suggests that soil hydraulic conductivity may be underestimated by several orders of magnitude in the low saturation range for models ignoring the adsorbed film flow thus this paper introduces a fractal method to characterise the effects of capillary and adsorption components of matric potential on soil hydraulic properties considering a simplified pore water transport process furthermore the concept of specific thickness for the adsorbed film was defined to describe the adsorption and adsorption capacity of the soil based on these a complete hydraulic model including the soil water retention curve swrc and relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc was derived to describe the water retention and transport properties of the soil in the entire matric head range the performance of the proposed model was then evaluated using 13 sets of test data from clean sand to bentonite showing that it can capture the characteristics of water retention and transport properties well the model parameters calibrated from the swrc dataset could predict rhcc over the entire suction range without introducing any additional parameters additionally the influences of the model parameters on soil hydraulic behaviours are also discussed in the paper it was found that the pore size distribution of the soils mainly controlled the transport characteristics of capillary water but had a slight influence on the hydraulic properties of adsorbed water which was dominated by the type and content of minerals and specific surface area

generally characterised by soil water retention curve swrc and relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc these hydraulic properties play a crucial role in estimating the shear strength and volume deformation of unsaturated soil alonso et al 1990 sheng 2011 developing hydrogels to remediate soil abedi koupai et al 2008 brax et al 2017 evaluating the field capacity and root water uptake in agricultural fields brady and weil 2002 and interpreting the hydrological process of the vadose zone hopmans and van genuchten 2005 accurate measurement of swrc and hrcc for unsaturated soil in the entire suction range remains challenging as an alternate method various models swrc and rhcc have been proposed to predict the hydraulic properties within soil pore spaces commonly used conceptual models can be classified as parametric models assouline and or 2013 brooks and corey 1966 campbell 1974 luckner et al 1989 tani 1982 van genuchten 1980 and pore size distribution psd based models brutsaert 1966 chen et al 2020b fredlund and xing 1994 kosugi 1996 xu et al 2013 in these methods matric suction and hydraulic conductivity are expressed as a function of effective saturation which normalises water content and ignores the influence of residual water moreover capillary force related to the molecular tension between the water molecules has been considered as the only contributor to the matric potential these swrc models and their derived rhcc models can effectively explain soil hydraulic properties within the capillary regime and have produced considerable deviations in the adsorption dominated range as noted by many researchers chen and chen 2020c goss and madliger 2007 ross et al 1991 toledo et al 1990 this shortcoming may be attributed to the omission of adsorption components thus underestimating soil hydraulic capacity at low saturation or high suction tuller and or 2001 due to these limitations adsorptive force derived from the interaction between the water molecules and charged soil matrix was introduced to describe soil hydraulic properties at low saturation or high matric suction a feasible method is based on thermodynamics and considering the flow process of pore water to establish the hydraulic model over the complete matric suction range haghverdi et al 2020a b iden et al 2021a b lebeau and konrad 2010 tuller et al 1999 lu 2016 tuller and or 2001 based on thermodynamics tuller and or 2001 employed an angular pore space to describe soil water interaction in the entire matric suction range their model reflected three stages of wetting phase transport in different suction ranges capillary flow dominated stage annular flow transition stage and film flow dominated stage despite the scientific success the application of their model has been limited due to the complexity of the function similarly lebeau and konrad 2010 used capillary water in a cylindrical capillary and adsorptive film on the surface of solid particles to describe the hydraulic process of soil from full saturation to near drying another method adopted has been to expand the existing hydraulic model by employing empirical piecewise functions to reflect the hydraulic properties at low saturations peters and durner 2008 zhang 2011 peters 2013 rudiyanto et al 2015 for example peters and dunner 2008 combined the hydraulic model of a capillary region with an empirical power function of the adsorption range by a weight coefficient to expand the vg model their parametric models fitted well with the experimental data while the connection with the empirical function indicated no physical basis for its model parameters note that parameters calibrated from the swrc data set for existing hydraulic constitutive models predict rhcc in the full suction range unless additional parameters are introduced peters and durner 2008 lebeau and konrad 2010 rudiyanto et al 2015 both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that soil hydraulic properties are closely related to psd arya and paris 1981 hwang and powers 2003 li et al 2016 cuisinier and laloui 2004 simms and yanful 2004 determining the psd function is essential to establish a physically dependent hydraulic model different distribution characteristic functions such as gaussian distribution xu and torres verdín 2013 gamma distribution tuller and or 2001 lognormal distribution kosugi 1994 and fractal scale law yu and cheng 2002 have been suggested to represent the psd of a porous media due to its simplicity and applicability the fractal scale law has been widely used to describe the distribution of particle size pore size pore tortuosity and surface roughness of the porous media with different textures chen et al 2020a ghanbarian and hunt 2017 hunt 2005 hunt et al 2013 khoshghalb et al 2015 russell 2010 russell and buzzi 2012 yang et al 2014 in particular based on the assumption that the distribution of pore size can be discribed by fractal theory khoshghalb et al 2015 derived a volume change dependent water retention model for deformable unsaturated soil ghanbariana behzad and hunt 2017 proposed a hydraulic model based on fractal scale law and precolation theory describing soil hydraulic properties at low saturation compared to the traditional model suggested by hunt 2005 their model was found to be superior but continued to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity of soil in the low saturation range although fractal scale law is significantly convenient in establishing swrc and rhcc models in the capillary dominated regime establishing a constitutive model of soil hydraulic properties over the entire suction range remains challenging in this study a fractal method was introduced to describe the effects of the capillary and adsorption components of matric potential on soil hydraulic properties by considering a simplified pore water transport process based on experimental observations the transport process of pore water was divided into two main stages 1 pore water was transported in soils at high or intermediate saturations in the entire cross section of the smaller pores filled with water as well as through continuous water film adsorbed on the surface of the pores 2 pore water was transported only through the continuous water film stretched on the surface of the pores or particles in the dry range furthermore the concept of specific thickness for the adsorbed film was defined to describe the adsorption strength and adsorption capacity of soils meanwhile the pore system was assumed to be a tortuous capillary bundle whose size distribution followed a fractal scale law a physically dependent hydraulic model including swrc and rhcc models was subsequently derived to predict hydraulic properties from saturation to near dryness parameters calibrated from the swrc dataset can predict rhcc over the entire suction range without introducing any additional parameters finally the performance of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing the experimental data model parameters were also discussed 2 mechanisms for soil water retention soil holds water by reducing its matric potential lu 2016 which is derived from the change in free energy due to the interaction between soil and water iwata 2020 two main soil water interactions are known to change the free energy capillarity and adsorption lu and zhang 2019 capillarity occurs at the curved water air interface formed by molecular tension between the water molecules as shown in fig 1 zhang and lu 2018 this intermolecular tension is integrated into the surface tension over the curved water air interface the existence of surface tension and pressure difference on both sides of the water air interface causes capillarity physical mechanisms for capillarity have usually been quantitatively analysed using yang laplace equation lu and likos 2004 accordingly interface e g the surface tension of the liquid phase and bending degree of the water air interface or air water solid contact angle and soil properties e g soil particle gradation or psd are intrinsically related to capillarity this intrinsic relation can be expressed as follows lu and likos 2004 1 h 2 σ cos θ r ρ g where h and r represent the matric head of capillarity and pore size respectively σ ρ g and θ represent the surface tension of pore water bulk water density acceleration of gravity and air water solid contact angle respectively for capillary water in the soil changes in contact angle surface tension gravity acceleration and water density can be ignored and regarded as constants therefore pore size r is the main influencing factor of capillarity in soil in addition eq 1 shows that pore water retained by capillarity prefers to occupy small pores with a specific matric suction head with the increase in matric suction capillarity disappears and adsorption dominates soil water holding capacity as shown in fig 1 at a molecular scale the physical mechanism of adsorption is the interaction between water molecules and charged soil matrix many types of soil water interactions contribute to adsorption and the main three acting on matric suction less than 106 kpa are introduced here i e osmosis multilayer adsorption and surface hydration as illustrated in fig 1 osmosis is caused by the solvation force produced by the difference in ion concentration between the soil matrix surface and solution osmosis forces ions in the soil matrix to diffuse into the solution and reach equilibrium with the ion concentration of the solution this adsorption mechanism is similar to that of the ion electrostatic component in the disjoining pressure πe langmuir 1938 israelachvili 2011 which can be expressed as 2 π e ω ε 0 ε 2 π k b t ez 2 1 ω 2 where ω represents the film thickness on the surface of soil particles or pore surface ε and ε 0 represent the relative permittivity of the liquid phase and permittivity of free space respectively k b t z and e represent the boltzmann constant kelvin temperature valence change and electron charge respectively as shown in fig 1 multilayer adsorption was dominated by van der waals forces which allowed water molecules to be adsorbed on the surface of the soil matrix with water molecules close to the surface of the soil matrix van der waals potential decreased to a minimum and then gradually increased and the free energy of the liquid phase decreased therefore the multilayer adsorption component of the adsorption potential was restricted by the distance between the water molecules and solid matrix generally multilayer adsorption is quantified by the molecular component of the disjoining pressure πm derjaguin et al 1987 as follows 3 π m ω a h 6 π ω 3 where a h and ω represent the hamaker constant and film thickness on the surface of the soil particles or pore surface in the higher matric suction range soil water interaction is called the surface hydration component of adsorption which refers to the hydrogen bond formed by the positive charge of the hydroxyl group on the surface of the soil matrix and negative charge of the water dipole as demonstrated in fig 1 surface hydration typically occurs on the surface of expansive clay minerals exchangeable cations on the surface of clay minerals interact with water molecules to hydrate them strongly in summary these intermolecular forces underlying the different adsorption components are the attraction forces between the water molecules and soil matrix at a micro scale the adsorption potential of different components is related to the distance between the molecules and soil matrix from a macro perspective it is inversely proportional to the thickness of the adsorbed water film as shown in eqs 2 and 3 however eqs 2 and 3 can only describe the intrinsic relationship between soil adsorption strength and matric potential but cannot reflect the adsorption capacity of soil more specifically disjoining pressure can only reflect the impact of soil mineral species on soil adsorption but not specific surface area and hydrophilic mineral content therefore to characterise the adsorption capacity of unsaturated porous media it is necessary to define the amount of water adsorbed per unit pore or soil particle volume θ in general the thickness of the adsorbed water film ranges from a micron to nanometre thus volume θ of the adsorbed water per unit pore volume can be approximately expressed as 4 θ v a v ω s v ω ω where v a and v represent the volumes of the adsorbed water and pore respectively ω s and ω represent the film thickness on the surface of the soil particles or pore surface surface area of the soil particles and specific surface area respectively the specific surface area can be specified as follows 5 ω λ 1 r where λ represents the shape factor and λ 3 for sphere λ 2 for cylindrical tube and r represents the pore radius the following equation can be obtained by combining eqs 4 and 5 as follows 6 θ λ ω r λ δ where δ is defined as the specific thickness of the adsorbed water which is the ratio of the thickness of the adsorbed water film to the radius of the pores or soil particles although yang laplace equation is not suitable for describing the relationship between the thickness of the adsorbed water film and suction the corresponding conceptual pore radius r can always be found at a given matric suction π that is π c r where r is defined as the suction characteristic radius in addition eqs 2 and 3 show that in double logarithmic coordinate system the adsorption component of matric suction is linearly related to the thickness of the adsorbed film therefore the relationship between suction characteristic radius and water film thickness can be expressed as follows 7 ln ω ln r furthermore the following relation is assumed to be satisfied 8 ln δ ln ω r ln r r finally the specific thickness can be characterised by pore size r and suction characteristic radius r as follows 9 δ β r r α where α 0 α 1 and β 0 β 1 are the model parameters that represent the adsorption strength and capacity of soils respectively more specifically α is related to the mineral species of the soil and a higher value of α indicates a higher valence of ions in soil minerals β is controlled by the mineral content and specific surface area of the soil α larger β indicates that soil contains more hydrophilic minerals and or has a larger specific surface area parameters α and β that affect soil adsorption strength and adsorption capacity will be further discussed in section analysis of model features and discussion 3 model establishment as discussed in the section mechanisms for soil water retention soil water interaction involves capillarity and adsorption which retain capillary and adsorbed water respectively capillarity starts with saturation and gradually reduces water retention as the saturation decreases or matric suction increases subsequently soil water is predominantly retained by adsorption at lower saturation note that these two components of soil water play roles in different matric suction ranges and are independent of each other lu 2016 the retention and migration of soil water are not only related to the configuration of pore water but also to the psd of the soil tuller et al 1999 tuller and or 2001 mathematical descriptions of psds have been researched and developed such as gaussian distribution xu and torres verdín 2013 gamma distribution tuller and or 2001 lognormal distribution kosugi 1994 and fractal scale law yu and cheng 2002 note that the first three provide empirical descriptions based on mercury intrusion method to obtain psd experimental data which are phenomenological fractal distribution is based on the statistical self similarity of pore size and is widely used to study the hydraulic characteristics of porous media yu and chen 2002 cihan et al 2009 guarracino et al 2014 this paper based on the statistical self similarity characteristic of pore size conceptualises soil pores as assemblies of tortuous capillary tubes with fractal psd with sizes ranging from the minimum radius r min to the maximum radius r max to simplify the proposed hydraulic model the hysteresis and double porosity are ignored according to the fractal scaling law the number of pores with pore sizes greater than r can be expressed as follows tyler and wheatcraft 1990 yu and chen 2002 guarracino et al 2014 10 n ε r r r max d f where ε d f and r max represent the measurement scale fractal dimension of the pore area and maximum pore radius of the soil respectively therefore the total number of pores n t can be determined as n t r min r max d f using eq 10 using yang laplace equation capillary water in larger pores was preferentially removed with the increase in matric suction while smaller pores were filled with pore water as illustrated in fig 2 although capillary water in larger pores was removed the pores were not immediately dried because of the stretching of the adsorbed water film on the pore or particles surface therefore for unsaturated soil a critical pore radius r c existed such that soil water in pores with radius r r c was dominated by capillarity number of pores is r min r max d f rc r max d f using eq 10 and otherwise was controlled by adsorption number of pores is rc r max d f using eq 10 see state ii of fig 2 3 1 swrc model pore water configurations in the dry and wet stages corresponding to different suction ranges are shown in fig 3 combining eq 9 and pore water geometry shown in fig 3 the volume of capillary water v cw and adsorbed water v aw in a single pore can be specified as follows 11 v cw π τ l 0 r 2 2 β r c α r 2 α β 2 r c 2 α r 2 2 α 12 v aw π τ l 0 2 β r c α r 2 α β 2 r c 2 α r 2 2 α where τ l 0 l t is the tortuous length of the pores and l 0 is the representative length of the pore along the hydraulic gradient direction τ is the tortuosity of the pores which is a function of pore size and can be expressed as 13 τ l 0 2 r d t 1 where d t is the tortuosity fractal dimension and is subject to 1 d t 2 note that d t 1 indicates that pores are straight and d t 2 indicates a highly tortuous pore that fills the entire plane wheatcraft and tyler 1988 the establishment of soil water retention model requires accumulating water volume based on the number of pores occupied during the wet phase because psd is assumed to be continued the number of pores with a given radius r r dr can be obtained by differential eq 10 as follows 14 d n r d f r max d f r d f 1 d r where negative sign indicates that the number of pores decreases as their sizes increase therefore according to the definition of saturation and combining eqs 11 13 and 14 the relationship between capillary water saturation s e cw and critical pore radius r c can be expressed as follows 15 s e cw r c r min r c v cw d n r r min r max v t d n r r c η r min η r max η r min η 2 β η η α r c η r min η α r c α r max η r min η β 2 η η 2 α r c η r min η 2 α r c 2 α r max η r min η where v t πr 2 l t is the volume of a single pore η d t d f 1 is the fractal factor and ranges from 0 to 2 inserting eq 1 into eq 15 yields the capillary components of swrc as follows 16 s e cw h h η h max η h min η h max η 2 β η η α h η h max η α h α h min η h max η β 2 η η 2 α h η h max η 2 α h 2 α h min η h max η where h 2σcosθ ρgr c is the matric head h max 2σcosθ ρgr min and h min 2σcosθ ρgr max are the maximum and minimum matric heads for capillarity respectively it should be noted that for pores with matric head h max capillarity disappears and pore water is captured by adsorption with matric head characterised by suction characteristic radius r similarly for the adsorbed water combined with eqs 1 9 12 and 14 swrc can be derived as follows 17 s e aw h 2 β η η α h α h min η α h max η α h min η h max η β 2 η η 2 α h 2 α h min η 2 α h max η 2 α h min η h max η therefore swrc over the entire matric suction head range can be specified as follows 18 s e h 1 h h min s e cw s e aw h min h h max s e aw h h max 3 2 rhcc model according to the water movement mechanism mentioned in the previous section water was transported in moderately wet soil in the entire cross section of smaller pores filled with water as well as continuous water film adsorbed on the surface of larger pores see state ii in fig 2 in the dry range as the nonwetting phase occupied the central part of the pores soil water moved only through the continuous water film adsorbed on the surface of the pores or particles see state iii in fig 2 3 2 1 hydraulic conductivity in a saturated state to develop the hydraulic conductivity model let us assume that the movement of pore water in the soil can be considered as a poiseuille flow and neglect the interfacial drag as well as body force from the hagen poiseuille equation bousfield and karles 2004 the volumetric flow rate of a single pore q p is as follows 19 q p r π r 4 8 μ δ p l t where δp and μ represent the hydraulic pressure drop and viscosity of pore water respectively therefore the total volume flow rate of soils q s t can be calculated by combining eqs 13 14 and 19 as follows 20 q s t r min r max q p r d n r π 8 μ δ p l 0 d t d f r max d f 2 d t 1 η 2 r max η 2 r min η 2 where η d t d f 1 is the fractal factor which ranges from 0 to 2 in addition the total volume flow rate of the soils on the macro scale can also be specified by darcy s law as follows 21 q s t k s δ p l 0 a where k s and a represent the hydraulic conductivity of soil in a saturated state and total area of the pores in the soil cross section respectively inserting eq 20 into eq 21 yields 22 k s π 8 μ 1 a l 0 d t 1 d f r max d f 2 d t 1 η 2 r max η 2 r min η 2 eq 22 shows that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of porous media depends on psd characterised by d f especially the maximum pore size r max tortuosity d t of the pores size a and l 0 of the sample and fluid viscosity μ of the wet phase 3 2 2 relative hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated state for capillary flow q cw can be calculated by combining eqs 13 14 and 19 as follows 23 q u cw r min r c q p r d n r π 8 μ δ p l 0 d t d f r max d f 2 d t 1 η 2 r c η 2 r min η 2 for annular film flow the volume flow rate of a single pore q aw is as follows 24 q aw v p ω a aw where a aw 1 1 δ 2 πr 2 is the cross sectional area of the adsorbed film flow v p represents the average velocity of the film flow which can be obtained by solving the simplified navier stokes equation or and tuller 2000 as follows 25 v p ω ω 2 3 μ δ p l t it should be noted that for the sake of simplicity only thick adsorption water film more than dozens of layers of water molecules is considered here and thinner water film with viscosity elevated by long term or short term interfacial forces are ignored mcbride and baveye 1995 combining eqs 9 13 14 24 and 25 results in 26 q u a w r min r max q aw d n r π 3 μ δ p d f r max d f l 0 d t 2 1 d t 2 β 3 r 3 α r max η 3 α 2 r min η 3 α 2 η 3 α 2 β 4 r 4 α r max η 4 α 2 r min η 4 α 2 η 4 α 2 based on buckingham darcy s law buckingham 1907 the volume flow rate of unsaturated flow q u ɷ can also be expressed as follows 27 q u ϖ k s k r ϖ δ p l 0 a where k r ϖ is the relative hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated flow and ϖ represents cw and aw for capillary and adsorptive flows respectively the relative hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated flow over the entire suction range can be obtained by combining eqs 1 22 23 26 and 27 as follows 28 k r cw h η 2 h max η 2 h min η 2 h max η 2 16 β 3 η 2

dependence of rhcc model eq 29 for film flow simplified as k r aw g h 3 α g 16 β 3 η 2 h min 3 α η 2 h max 3 α η 2 3 η 2 3 α h min η 2 h max η 2 by omitting the second term is similar to the empirical formula given by peters 2013 as k r aw g h ξ g w h a ξ where ha is related to the air entry value and w and ξ represent the fitting parameters without physical meaning as capillarity and adsorption are not directly dependent on each other lu 2016 in this study the complex coupling behaviour between these two soil water components was neglected therefore for unsaturated soil rhcc in the entire matric suction range can be written as follows 30 k r h 1 h h min k r cw k r aw h min h h max k r aw h h max the proposed rhcc model included five parameters fractal factor η adsorption strength α adsorption capacity β maximum matric head h max of capillarity and minimum matric head h min of the soil which were consistent with the parameters of the proposed swrc model therefore we can determine the parameters of rhcc eq 30 by calibrating the swrc model eq 18 based on the water retention datasets in addition relative hydraulic conductivity can also be expressed as a function of saturation by combining eqs 30 and 18 thus the new model can simulate the spatial variation of relative hydraulic conductivity saturation and matric head fig 4 shows the schematic relationship of k r s e h in a three dimensional space with η 0 55 α 0 038 β 0 029 h max 10000 cm and h min 8 cm 4 model validation and discussion 4 1 datasets in the published datasets 13 experimental datasets from different soils were selected to evaluate the proposed model within the entire matric head range the experimental data comprised shonai dune sand mehta et al 1994 danish sandy soil l3 and arizona silty soil 14 jensen et al 2015 ottawa sand willson et al 2012 pachapa loam and adelanto loam jackson et al 1965 georgia kaolinite likos and lu 2003 seochang sandy clay oh et al 2012 sandy loam and clay loam pachepsky et al 1984 berlin sand peters 2013 poderlee sand nemes et al 2001 and tohaku loam and masa loamy sand fujimaki and inoue 2003 among them seven data sets were only used to evaluate the swrc model while others were used to examine the compatibility of the proposed swrc and rhcc models with identical model parameters these data for soils with different textures and sources were selected because the saturation range covers both moderately wet and dry ranges when measuring swrc and rhcc of the soil 4 2 evaluation of swrc model the performance of the proposed swrc model was evaluated using seven sets of test data from clean sand to bentonite among these datasets the ranges of the matrix heads for six datasets were greater than 105 cm which provided a basis for evaluating the swrc model within the entire matric head range model parameters obtained by fitting the test data are listed in table 1 the proposed swrc model was also compared with the vg and kosugi models root mean square error rmse was employed to evaluate the performance of each model which can be specified as follows 31 rmse 1 n i 1 n s e i pre s e i mea 2 where s e i mea and s e i pre are the ith measured and predicted values respectively and n is the number of test values the calculated rmses for different models are mentioned in table 2 fig 5 a1 a3 shows the comparison between the fitted swrcs and test data for three sandy soils with different clay contents as shown the fitted swrc is in good agreement with the experimental data for shonai dune sand clay content accounted for 5 6 by gravimetric the water retention capacity of capillarity ranged from 0 to 70 cm as shown in fig 5 a1 for matric head 70 cm capillarity disappeared while adsorption completely controlled the water retention characteristics of the soil under equilibrium conditions fig 5 a2 a3 shows somewhat similar features for danish sandy soil l3 clay content accounted for 22 4 by gravimetric and ottawa sand clean sand respectively comparison between the swrcs of these three sandy soils shows that the capillary regime of danish sandy soil l3 approximately 0 2 105 cm was significantly larger than that of shonai dune sand 0 70 cm and ottawa sand 0 80 cm this was mainly due to the high clay content of danish sandy soil l3 resulting in a smaller average pore radius and higher proportion of small pores as formulated in the young laplace equation a smaller average pore size of the soil represents a larger range of capillary regime moreover the clay sized soil had a larger specific surface area and higher hydrophilic mineral content which made the adsorption capacity of danish sandy soil l3 greater than that of the other two types of sandy soils as shown in fig 5 a1 a3 fig 5 b1 shows the comparison of the fitted swrc for shonai dune sand with the vg and kosugi models as shown the model proposed in this paper can better predict the water retention characteristics of unsaturated soil within the entire matric head range as capillarity is considered to be the only contributor to water potential and water retention capacity of adsorption is ignored vg and kosugi models described the capillarity dominated range well but underestimated the water holding capacity of shonai dune sand in the high matric head range approximately 102 105 cm for shonai dune sand rmses in the entire matric head range all h of the proposed vg and kosugi models were 0 032 0 041 and 0 055 respectively in the higher matric head range h 105 cm rmses were 0 007 0 019 and 0 043 for these three sandy soils respectively the rmse of the proposed model was significantly smaller than that of the vg and kosugi models especially in the high matric head range fig 5 b2 and b3 show similar features for shonai dune sand yu and li 2001 suggested that r min r max or h min h max could be considered as a criterion to judge whether a porous medium can be characterized by fractal theory according to this criterion the h min h max of danish sandy soil l3 is 0 00025 the soil can thus be regarded as a fractal media however shonai dune sand and ottawa sand cannot be regarded as fractal media interestingly the proposed model still well describes the water retention characteristics of these two soils in fact if the adsorbed water is ignored the proposed swrc model can be reduced to the well known bc model brooks and corey 1966 which is not constrained by the soil type this means that the swrc model proposed in this paper may be transformed into a more generalized model in this case η may no longer represent the fractal factor but be transformed into a more complex parameter however if the swrc data of soil is available the parameter can be obtained by fitting the swrc data just like the bc model fig 6 shows the performance of the proposed swrc model in two silty soils clay or clay sized particles were the main components compared to fig 5 the adsorption capacity of sandy soil was found to be smaller than that of the silty soil because of the content of hydrophilic minerals and the specific surface area of silty soil was found to be larger than that of the sandy soil in addition as silty soil composed of smaller particles had a smaller average pore size its capillary regime was larger than that of the sandy soil as formulated in the young laplace equation the range of water retention by capillarity was not only related to the psd but also to the total pore volume therefore a different capillary regime for the same kind of soil with different stress histories will be found however adsorption was not affected by the psd of the soil which was mainly related to the mineral content mineral species and specific surface area of the soil for clayed soils a small but non negligible transition from capillary dominated to adsorption dominated regions was found from a few thousands to 106 cm matric head range where the change in soil water content mainly reflected changes in the adsorbed water content as shown in fig 7 because the clay mineral content of georgia kaolinite 98 clay mineral was significantly higher than that of seochang sandy clay 14 clay mineral the capillary regime of the former was larger than that of the latter as shown in fig 7 a1 and a2 the capillary regime of georgia kaolinite was approximately 0 2 105 cm and that of seochang sandy clay was approximately 0 9 104 cm compared to fig 5 the adsorbed water content of clayed soils was significantly higher than that of the sandy soils which implied that the hydrophilic mineral content and specific surface area of clay soils were significantly larger than those of the sandy soils fig 7 b shows the comparison between the three models proposed vg and kosugi models as shown the proposed model better described the water retention characteristics of clayed soils in the full matric suction range while the vg and kosugi models underestimated the soil water retention capacity in the high matric suction range table 2 shows the rmses obtained by the three models fitting different soil test data for all soils the fitting results showed that the rmse of the proposed model was significantly smaller than that of the vg and kosugi models both in the full all h and high 1 105 cm matric head ranges which indicated that swrc model proposed in this study can simulate water retention characteristics more accurately 4 3 validation for the complete hydraulic model the characteristics of the proposed model were validated with the datasets of seven soils varying from loam to sand to examine the compatibility of the proposed hydraulic model with identical model parameters model parameters were calibrated using the swrc test data and then used to predict the rhcc of the soil fig 8 illustrates the features of the complete hydraulic model for the sandy loam dataset it can be seen that the trajectory of swrc is in good agreement with the dataset in the entire matric head range from 1 to 106 cm for sandy loam an important intersection point can be found at a matric head of 4 104 cm which divided soil water retention characteristics into capillary and adsorption regimes the dominant region of capillarity began at saturation and adsorption as an auxiliary force exhibited little effect on the water holding and water conducting properties of the soil with the increase in suction the effects of capillarity on soil water retention gradually weakened and completely disappeared at a matric head of 105 cm in the later stage adsorption dominated the hydraulic properties of the soil model parameters obtained from fitting the swrc data were subsequently used to predict the rhcc of the soil as shown in fig 8 b the dataset of relative hydraulic conductivity for sandy loam was well predicted by the proposed rhcc model considering the effect of adsorption on water transport the proposed model could simulate the upward bending phenomenon of rhcc at a matric head of 104 cm however the conventional rhcc model e g vg m and kosugi m models underestimated the relative hydraulic conductivity in the high matric head range because of the neglect of adsorption fig 9 shows similar features for clay loam for berlin fig 10 and poderlee sands fig 11 one obvious difference from silty soil i e sandy loam and clay loam was that the adsorbed water content of these two kinds of sandy soils was significantly small and the capillarity dominated region was also relatively limited as discussed in the previous section this dissimilarity was mainly due to the larger average pore radius and lower hydrophilic mineral content of the sandy soil as shown in fig 10 a the adsorptive and capillary components of swrc for berlin sand crossed over at a matric head of 100 cm which separated swrc into adsorptive and capillary regimes as shown the proposed swrc model well described the water retention characteristics of berlin sand and the predicted trajectory of rhcc was also consistent with the trend of the test data in the entire matric head range figs 12 14 show the performance of the complete hydraulic model for the datasets of three soils masa loamy sand adelanto loam and tohaku loam as shown in fig 12 model parameters calculated from the swcc data of masa loamy sand were subsequently used to predict its hrcc where relative hydraulic conductivity was a function of saturation the characteristics of this relationship were well captured by the new model in both moderate wet and dry regions as illustrated in fig 12 b for saturations 0 1 the contribution of capillarity towards water transport was neglected and adsorption dominated the water transport characteristics in the soil with the increase in saturation although the relative hydraulic conductivity of the adsorbed components gradually increased to 4 10 4 completely saturated state the contribution of adsorption towards soil water transport was significantly smaller than that of capillarity as shown in fig 12 b it can be seen that if the influence of adsorption film flow on soil water transport is ignored the water conductivity of soil in the low saturation range will be greatly underestimated figs 13 and 14 show similar features for adelanto loam and tohaku loam datasets respectively overall these examples show that the new physical dependent hydraulic model of unsaturated soil with the aid of a simplified pore water configuration can effectively explain the hydraulic law of soil in the entire matric head range 4 4 comparison with other models below the performances of the new vg b van genuchten 1980 and k m models lebeau and konrad 2010 in predicting soil hydraulic properties are compared and analysed over the entire matric head range vg b and k m models can be specified as follows vg b model 32a k r h 1 α h n 2 1 α h n m 1 α h n 2 m 32b k r s e s e 2 1 1 s e 1 m 1 2 n where α n and m represent the fitted parameters k m model 33a k r h q ln h h m σ 1 2 q ln h h m σ σ 2 33b k r s e s e 1 2 q q 1 s e σ 2 where q x x 2 π 1 2 exp x 2 2 d x h m is related to the matric head corresponding to the median pore radius and σ is the standard deviation of the normal logarithm distribution as shown in fig 15 a scatter diagram was employed to present the visual comparison between the predicted and experimental data for each model to analyse and display the measurement and prediction data as completely as possible double logarithmic coordinate system was used in the scatterplots and the measured relative hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 was set as a line to divide the whole region into the capillary and adsorption dominated regions as shown vg b and k m models captured the hydraulic characteristics of the capillary region well while significantly underestimating the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in low saturation area because of the omission of adsorption component a notable improvement was observed when the model proposed in this study was used which employed a simplified pore water configuration to consider both capillary and adsorbed water components such visual presentation can be transformed into quantitative analysis by employing root mean square natural logarithm transformed error rmsle which is an indicator of the overall average residual between the measured and predicted data rmsle is calculated as follows 34 rmsle 1 n i 1 n log k r i pre log k r i mea 2 where n is the number of test values and k r i pre and k r i mea are the predicted and measured relative hydraulic conductivities of the unsaturated soil respectively table 3 summarises the rmsles of different models for each dataset of relative hydraulic conductivity as shown the complete hydraulic model proposed in this paper was the best for all datasets involved in the evaluation the average rmsle was 0 336 1 182 and 1 058 for the proposed vg b and k m models this significant difference indicated that omitting the adsorbed component obstructs the accurate prediction of the hydraulic properties of soils especially in the high matric head range or low saturation range 4 5 analysis of the model features and discussion the complete hydraulic model proposed in this paper contains five parameters η α β h max and h min all having specific geometrical or physical meaning and perform their respective functions independently figs 16 18 show the different impacts of various parameters on soil hydraulic properties fig 16 a and b shows the responses of relative hydraulic conductivity k r matric head h curve rmc and saturation s e curve rsc to the variation of fractal factor η an important parameter determining the psd of soils as shown in fig 16 a fractal factor η or psd only affected the retention and hydraulic properties of capillary water but had little effect on adsorbed water which was consistent with the inference of lu 2016 it is interesting to note that this conclusion did not appear to be consistent with that illustrated in fig 16 b which shows that η significantly influenced the hydraulic conductivity of adsorbed water components however saturation s e shown in fig 16 b was the sum of adsorbed water and capillary water components thus the influence of fractal factor η on k r s e curve of the adsorbed component mainly reflected the influence of η or psd on the water content of the capillary water component if the water content of the adsorbed water component is normalised as the abscissa alone it will again prove that psd slightly influences the hydraulic conductivity of the adsorbed water component in addition as shown in fig 16 a the larger the fractal factor η the smaller the absolute value of rmc slope within the capillarity region a larger fractal factor η means that the total volume of the smaller pores accounted for a larger proportion of the total volume of the pores in the soil therefore it is more difficult for the soil to dehumidify or have a smaller hydraulic conductivity under a given matric head which was consistent with the physical phenomenon described by the yang laplace equation at the same saturation a larger η value resulted in a smaller critical pore radius and the corresponding larger matric suction resulted in a smaller hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 16 b generally fractal factor η controls soil water retention and transport properties mainly by affecting the psd of the soil fig 17 a and b depicts the effects of parameter α on rmc and rsc respectively as shown α controlled the adsorption strength of rmc and rsc while had little effect on the adsorption capacity of the soil more specifically α controlled the slope of rmc and rsc in the higher matric head range or at lower saturations within the adsorption region but had little effect on the total amount of adsorbed water its physical mechanism may be related to the types of hydrophilic minerals present in the soil the smaller the α with a higher valence of the ions contained in the mineral of soils which increased the adsorption strength of the soil the smaller the absolute value of the slope of rmc and rsc within the range of adsorption mechanism alternatively it is evident from fig 17 that α is only slightly correlated with the hydraulic properties of the capillary component the effects of parameter β which is related to soil adsorption capacity on soil hydraulic properties are plotted in fig 18 the adsorption capacity of soil is defined here as the total amount of adsorbed water when soil is fully saturated it can be seen from fig 18 that parameter β controlled the adsorption capacity of the soil and the greater the value of β the stronger the adsorption capacity a higher value of β indicates that the soil may have a larger specific surface area and or more hydrophilic mineral content in addition the adsorption components of rmc and rsc corresponding to different β values were found to be almost parallel to each other with the trajectories of capillary components almost coincident this implied that β had little effect on the adsorption strength and transport properties of the capillary component according to the above analysis of the model characteristics each model parameter performed its expected function independently with no coupling between each other thus ensuring the uniqueness of the optimal parameter combination yu and li 2001 proposed that fractal dimension d f can be estimated according to porosity ϕ and the ratio r min rmax in porous media that is d f 2 lnϕ ln r min r max the water retention characteristics of capillary components can thus be predicted however parameters α and β were difficult to measure or estimate through conventional geotechnical tests because they are related to the mineral species mineral content and specific surface area of soil more specifically the water retention characteristics of adsorption components are affected by the content and valence of ions in the soil and the specific surface area of the soil zhang and lu 2018 it is very challenging to connect the physicochemical coupling behavior with its influencing factors through mathematical methods as an alternative method these model parameters can be determined by the characteristics of swrc in the adsorption dominated range for example the adsorption strength α is the slope of swrc within the range of matric suction dominated by adsorption and the adsorption capacity β determines the intercept of swrc adsorption components and the degree of saturation s e coordinate axis the proposed model also suffers some limitations firstly the hysteresis effects of hydraulic properties cannot be described by the proposed model because the non uniformity of soil pores is not considered russell and buzzi russell and buzzi 2012 focused on the hysteresis effects of soil water retention based on fractal theory and achieved good results on the other hand the connectivity of soil pores is not considered in the capillary system as well in this regard hunt hunt 2001 attempted to model the connectivity of soil pores if these limitations are to be removed completely the micro scale geometric structure of the soil pores must be available it is worth to be noted that with the development of imaging technology pore structure can be approximately measured and computed by x ray tomography wildenschild et al 2002 this method was used by dong and blunt 2009 to measure the psd pore shape factor and throat size of berea and fontainebleau sandstones if the real structural image of the pores is available it should be evidently closer to the natural state of the pores than the capillary system 5 conclusions a complete hydraulic model including swrc and rhcc was formulated to predict the hydraulic properties of soils from complete saturation to near dryness the derivation of a physically dependent model is based on the assumption that soil pores can be replaced by a bundle of tortuous capillaries with a simplified water configuration and the size and tortuosity of the pores obey the fractal scale law based on the experimental evidence that the adsorption component of matric potential significantly impacted soil hydraulic properties at low saturation the hydraulic process was partitioned into capillary and adsorption regions to describe the effects of different matric potential components on soil hydraulic behaviours the proposed fractal swrc model contained five parameters η α β h max and h min all having specific geometrical or physical meaning these parameters were identical to those of the derived rhcc model so that the model parameters can be calculated from the swrc data and subsequently used to predict the hydraulic conductivity of the soil the complete hydraulic model was validated using the swrc and rhcc data of the soils with different textures from clean sand to bentonite indicating that it can reasonably predict water retention and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil over the entire suction range moreover compared to the other two well known models the proposed model exhibited significant advantages especially in the adsorption region by analysing the influence of model parameters on soil water conductivity it was found that the psd of the soils mainly controlled the transport characteristics of capillary water while having a slight influence on the hydraulic properties of adsorbed water which proved the inference made by lu 2016 the hydraulic properties of adsorbed water were mainly dominated by the type and content of minerals in the soils and specific surface area of the soil the method presented in this paper provides a framework for studying the hydraulic properties of unsaturated porous media in the full suction range it can be a starting point for studying other physical phenomena that require hydraulic models such as solute transport root water uptake and geological reactions in porous media credit authorship contribution statement ke chen conceptualization

4236,commonly used hydraulic models that describe the water retention and transport properties of variably saturated soils mainly account for the capillary component of matric potential but ignore the adsorption component experimental evidence suggests that soil hydraulic conductivity may be underestimated by several orders of magnitude in the low saturation range for models ignoring the adsorbed film flow thus this paper introduces a fractal method to characterise the effects of capillary and adsorption components of matric potential on soil hydraulic properties considering a simplified pore water transport process furthermore the concept of specific thickness for the adsorbed film was defined to describe the adsorption and adsorption capacity of the soil based on these a complete hydraulic model including the soil water retention curve swrc and relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc was derived to describe the water retention and transport properties of the soil in the entire matric head range the performance of the proposed model was then evaluated using 13 sets of test data from clean sand to bentonite showing that it can capture the characteristics of water retention and transport properties well the model parameters calibrated from the swrc dataset could predict rhcc over the entire suction range without introducing any additional parameters additionally the influences of the model parameters on soil hydraulic behaviours are also discussed in the paper it was found that the pore size distribution of the soils mainly controlled the transport characteristics of capillary water but had a slight influence on the hydraulic properties of adsorbed water which was dominated by the type and content of minerals and specific surface area

generally characterised by soil water retention curve swrc and relative hydraulic conductivity curve rhcc these hydraulic properties play a crucial role in estimating the shear strength and volume deformation of unsaturated soil alonso et al 1990 sheng 2011 developing hydrogels to remediate soil abedi koupai et al 2008 brax et al 2017 evaluating the field capacity and root water uptake in agricultural fields brady and weil 2002 and interpreting the hydrological process of the vadose zone hopmans and van genuchten 2005 accurate measurement of swrc and hrcc for unsaturated soil in the entire suction range remains challenging as an alternate method various models swrc and rhcc have been proposed to predict the hydraulic properties within soil pore spaces commonly used conceptual models can be classified as parametric models assouline and or 2013 brooks and corey 1966 campbell 1974 luckner et al 1989 tani 1982 van genuchten 1980 and pore size distribution psd based models brutsaert 1966 chen et al 2020b fredlund and xing 1994 kosugi 1996 xu et al 2013 in these methods matric suction and hydraulic conductivity are expressed as a function of effective saturation which normalises water content and ignores the influence of residual water moreover capillary force related to the molecular tension between the water molecules has been considered as the only contributor to the matric potential these swrc models and their derived rhcc models can effectively explain soil hydraulic properties within the capillary regime and have produced considerable deviations in the adsorption dominated range as noted by many researchers chen and chen 2020c goss and madliger 2007 ross et al 1991 toledo et al 1990 this shortcoming may be attributed to the omission of adsorption components thus underestimating soil hydraulic capacity at low saturation or high suction tuller and or 2001 due to these limitations adsorptive force derived from the interaction between the water molecules and charged soil matrix was introduced to describe soil hydraulic properties at low saturation or high matric suction a feasible method is based on thermodynamics and considering the flow process of pore water to establish the hydraulic model over the complete matric suction range haghverdi et al 2020a b iden et al 2021a b lebeau and konrad 2010 tuller et al 1999 lu 2016 tuller and or 2001 based on thermodynamics tuller and or 2001 employed an angular pore space to describe soil water interaction in the entire matric suction range their model reflected three stages of wetting phase transport in different suction ranges capillary flow dominated stage annular flow transition stage and film flow dominated stage despite the scientific success the application of their model has been limited due to the complexity of the function similarly lebeau and konrad 2010 used capillary water in a cylindrical capillary and adsorptive film on the surface of solid particles to describe the hydraulic process of soil from full saturation to near drying another method adopted has been to expand the existing hydraulic model by employing empirical piecewise functions to reflect the hydraulic properties at low saturations peters and durner 2008 zhang 2011 peters 2013 rudiyanto et al 2015 for example peters and dunner 2008 combined the hydraulic model of a capillary region with an empirical power function of the adsorption range by a weight coefficient to expand the vg model their parametric models fitted well with the experimental data while the connection with the empirical function indicated no physical basis for its model parameters note that parameters calibrated from the swrc data set for existing hydraulic constitutive models predict rhcc in the full suction range unless additional parameters are introduced peters and durner 2008 lebeau and konrad 2010 rudiyanto et al 2015 both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that soil hydraulic properties are closely related to psd arya and paris 1981 hwang and powers 2003 li et al 2016 cuisinier and laloui 2004 simms and yanful 2004 determining the psd function is essential to establish a physically dependent hydraulic model different distribution characteristic functions such as gaussian distribution xu and torres verdín 2013 gamma distribution tuller and or 2001 lognormal distribution kosugi 1994 and fractal scale law yu and cheng 2002 have been suggested to represent the psd of a porous media due to its simplicity and applicability the fractal scale law has been widely used to describe the distribution of particle size pore size pore tortuosity and surface roughness of the porous media with different textures chen et al 2020a ghanbarian and hunt 2017 hunt 2005 hunt et al 2013 khoshghalb et al 2015 russell 2010 russell and buzzi 2012 yang et al 2014 in particular based on the assumption that the distribution of pore size can be discribed by fractal theory khoshghalb et al 2015 derived a volume change dependent water retention model for deformable unsaturated soil ghanbariana behzad and hunt 2017 proposed a hydraulic model based on fractal scale law and precolation theory describing soil hydraulic properties at low saturation compared to the traditional model suggested by hunt 2005 their model was found to be superior but continued to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity of soil in the low saturation range although fractal scale law is significantly convenient in establishing swrc and rhcc models in the capillary dominated regime establishing a constitutive model of soil hydraulic properties over the entire suction range remains challenging in this study a fractal method was introduced to describe the effects of the capillary and adsorption components of matric potential on soil hydraulic properties by considering a simplified pore water transport process based on experimental observations the transport process of pore water was divided into two main stages 1 pore water was transported in soils at high or intermediate saturations in the entire cross section of the smaller pores filled with water as well as through continuous water film adsorbed on the surface of the pores 2 pore water was transported only through the continuous water film stretched on the surface of the pores or particles in the dry range furthermore the concept of specific thickness for the adsorbed film was defined to describe the adsorption strength and adsorption capacity of soils meanwhile the pore system was assumed to be a tortuous capillary bundle whose size distribution followed a fractal scale law a physically dependent hydraulic model including swrc and rhcc models was subsequently derived to predict hydraulic properties from saturation to near dryness parameters calibrated from the swrc dataset can predict rhcc over the entire suction range without introducing any additional parameters finally the performance of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing the experimental data model parameters were also discussed 2 mechanisms for soil water retention soil holds water by reducing its matric potential lu 2016 which is derived from the change in free energy due to the interaction between soil and water iwata 2020 two main soil water interactions are known to change the free energy capillarity and adsorption lu and zhang 2019 capillarity occurs at the curved water air interface formed by molecular tension between the water molecules as shown in fig 1 zhang and lu 2018 this intermolecular tension is integrated into the surface tension over the curved water air interface the existence of surface tension and pressure difference on both sides of the water air interface causes capillarity physical mechanisms for capillarity have usually been quantitatively analysed using yang laplace equation lu and likos 2004 accordingly interface e g the surface tension of the liquid phase and bending degree of the water air interface or air water solid contact angle and soil properties e g soil particle gradation or psd are intrinsically related to capillarity this intrinsic relation can be expressed as follows lu and likos 2004 1 h 2 σ cos θ r ρ g where h and r represent the matric head of capillarity and pore size respectively σ ρ g and θ represent the surface tension of pore water bulk water density acceleration of gravity and air water solid contact angle respectively for capillary water in the soil changes in contact angle surface tension gravity acceleration and water density can be ignored and regarded as constants therefore pore size r is the main influencing factor of capillarity in soil in addition eq 1 shows that pore water retained by capillarity prefers to occupy small pores with a specific matric suction head with the increase in matric suction capillarity disappears and adsorption dominates soil water holding capacity as shown in fig 1 at a molecular scale the physical mechanism of adsorption is the interaction between water molecules and charged soil matrix many types of soil water interactions contribute to adsorption and the main three acting on matric suction less than 106 kpa are introduced here i e osmosis multilayer adsorption and surface hydration as illustrated in fig 1 osmosis is caused by the solvation force produced by the difference in ion concentration between the soil matrix surface and solution osmosis forces ions in the soil matrix to diffuse into the solution and reach equilibrium with the ion concentration of the solution this adsorption mechanism is similar to that of the ion electrostatic component in the disjoining pressure πe langmuir 1938 israelachvili 2011 which can be expressed as 2 π e ω ε 0 ε 2 π k b t ez 2 1 ω 2 where ω represents the film thickness on the surface of soil particles or pore surface ε and ε 0 represent the relative permittivity of the liquid phase and permittivity of free space respectively k b t z and e represent the boltzmann constant kelvin temperature valence change and electron charge respectively as shown in fig 1 multilayer adsorption was dominated by van der waals forces which allowed water molecules to be adsorbed on the surface of the soil matrix with water molecules close to the surface of the soil matrix van der waals potential decreased to a minimum and then gradually increased and the free energy of the liquid phase decreased therefore the multilayer adsorption component of the adsorption potential was restricted by the distance between the water molecules and solid matrix generally multilayer adsorption is quantified by the molecular component of the disjoining pressure πm derjaguin et al 1987 as follows 3 π m ω a h 6 π ω 3 where a h and ω represent the hamaker constant and film thickness on the surface of the soil particles or pore surface in the higher matric suction range soil water interaction is called the surface hydration component of adsorption which refers to the hydrogen bond formed by the positive charge of the hydroxyl group on the surface of the soil matrix and negative charge of the water dipole as demonstrated in fig 1 surface hydration typically occurs on the surface of expansive clay minerals exchangeable cations on the surface of clay minerals interact with water molecules to hydrate them strongly in summary these intermolecular forces underlying the different adsorption components are the attraction forces between the water molecules and soil matrix at a micro scale the adsorption potential of different components is related to the distance between the molecules and soil matrix from a macro perspective it is inversely proportional to the thickness of the adsorbed water film as shown in eqs 2 and 3 however eqs 2 and 3 can only describe the intrinsic relationship between soil adsorption strength and matric potential but cannot reflect the adsorption capacity of soil more specifically disjoining pressure can only reflect the impact of soil mineral species on soil adsorption but not specific surface area and hydrophilic mineral content therefore to characterise the adsorption capacity of unsaturated porous media it is necessary to define the amount of water adsorbed per unit pore or soil particle volume θ in general the thickness of the adsorbed water film ranges from a micron to nanometre thus volume θ of the adsorbed water per unit pore volume can be approximately expressed as 4 θ v a v ω s v ω ω where v a and v represent the volumes of the adsorbed water and pore respectively ω s and ω represent the film thickness on the surface of the soil particles or pore surface surface area of the soil particles and specific surface area respectively the specific surface area can be specified as follows 5 ω λ 1 r where λ represents the shape factor and λ 3 for sphere λ 2 for cylindrical tube and r represents the pore radius the following equation can be obtained by combining eqs 4 and 5 as follows 6 θ λ ω r λ δ where δ is defined as the specific thickness of the adsorbed water which is the ratio of the thickness of the adsorbed water film to the radius of the pores or soil particles although yang laplace equation is not suitable for describing the relationship between the thickness of the adsorbed water film and suction the corresponding conceptual pore radius r can always be found at a given matric suction π that is π c r where r is defined as the suction characteristic radius in addition eqs 2 and 3 show that in double logarithmic coordinate system the adsorption component of matric suction is linearly related to the thickness of the adsorbed film therefore the relationship between suction characteristic radius and water film thickness can be expressed as follows 7 ln ω ln r furthermore the following relation is assumed to be satisfied 8 ln δ ln ω r ln r r finally the specific thickness can be characterised by pore size r and suction characteristic radius r as follows 9 δ β r r α where α 0 α 1 and β 0 β 1 are the model parameters that represent the adsorption strength and capacity of soils respectively more specifically α is related to the mineral species of the soil and a higher value of α indicates a higher valence of ions in soil minerals β is controlled by the mineral content and specific surface area of the soil α larger β indicates that soil contains more hydrophilic minerals and or has a larger specific surface area parameters α and β that affect soil adsorption strength and adsorption capacity will be further discussed in section analysis of model features and discussion 3 model establishment as discussed in the section mechanisms for soil water retention soil water interaction involves capillarity and adsorption which retain capillary and adsorbed water respectively capillarity starts with saturation and gradually reduces water retention as the saturation decreases or matric suction increases subsequently soil water is predominantly retained by adsorption at lower saturation note that these two components of soil water play roles in different matric suction ranges and are independent of each other lu 2016 the retention and migration of soil water are not only related to the configuration of pore water but also to the psd of the soil tuller et al 1999 tuller and or 2001 mathematical descriptions of psds have been researched and developed such as gaussian distribution xu and torres verdín 2013 gamma distribution tuller and or 2001 lognormal distribution kosugi 1994 and fractal scale law yu and cheng 2002 note that the first three provide empirical descriptions based on mercury intrusion method to obtain psd experimental data which are phenomenological fractal distribution is based on the statistical self similarity of pore size and is widely used to study the hydraulic characteristics of porous media yu and chen 2002 cihan et al 2009 guarracino et al 2014 this paper based on the statistical self similarity characteristic of pore size conceptualises soil pores as assemblies of tortuous capillary tubes with fractal psd with sizes ranging from the minimum radius r min to the maximum radius r max to simplify the proposed hydraulic model the hysteresis and double porosity are ignored according to the fractal scaling law the number of pores with pore sizes greater than r can be expressed as follows tyler and wheatcraft 1990 yu and chen 2002 guarracino et al 2014 10 n ε r r r max d f where ε d f and r max represent the measurement scale fractal dimension of the pore area and maximum pore radius of the soil respectively therefore the total number of pores n t can be determined as n t r min r max d f using eq 10 using yang laplace equation capillary water in larger pores was preferentially removed with the increase in matric suction while smaller pores were filled with pore water as illustrated in fig 2 although capillary water in larger pores was removed the pores were not immediately dried because of the stretching of the adsorbed water film on the pore or particles surface therefore for unsaturated soil a critical pore radius r c existed such that soil water in pores with radius r r c was dominated by capillarity number of pores is r min r max d f rc r max d f using eq 10 and otherwise was controlled by adsorption number of pores is rc r max d f using eq 10 see state ii of fig 2 3 1 swrc model pore water configurations in the dry and wet stages corresponding to different suction ranges are shown in fig 3 combining eq 9 and pore water geometry shown in fig 3 the volume of capillary water v cw and adsorbed water v aw in a single pore can be specified as follows 11 v cw π τ l 0 r 2 2 β r c α r 2 α β 2 r c 2 α r 2 2 α 12 v aw π τ l 0 2 β r c α r 2 α β 2 r c 2 α r 2 2 α where τ l 0 l t is the tortuous length of the pores and l 0 is the representative length of the pore along the hydraulic gradient direction τ is the tortuosity of the pores which is a function of pore size and can be expressed as 13 τ l 0 2 r d t 1 where d t is the tortuosity fractal dimension and is subject to 1 d t 2 note that d t 1 indicates that pores are straight and d t 2 indicates a highly tortuous pore that fills the entire plane wheatcraft and tyler 1988 the establishment of soil water retention model requires accumulating water volume based on the number of pores occupied during the wet phase because psd is assumed to be continued the number of pores with a given radius r r dr can be obtained by differential eq 10 as follows 14 d n r d f r max d f r d f 1 d r where negative sign indicates that the number of pores decreases as their sizes increase therefore according to the definition of saturation and combining eqs 11 13 and 14 the relationship between capillary water saturation s e cw and critical pore radius r c can be expressed as follows 15 s e cw r c r min r c v cw d n r r min r max v t d n r r c η r min η r max η r min η 2 β η η α r c η r min η α r c α r max η r min η β 2 η η 2 α r c η r min η 2 α r c 2 α r max η r min η where v t πr 2 l t is the volume of a single pore η d t d f 1 is the fractal factor and ranges from 0 to 2 inserting eq 1 into eq 15 yields the capillary components of swrc as follows 16 s e cw h h η h max η h min η h max η 2 β η η α h η h max η α h α h min η h max η β 2 η η 2 α h η h max η 2 α h 2 α h min η h max η where h 2σcosθ ρgr c is the matric head h max 2σcosθ ρgr min and h min 2σcosθ ρgr max are the maximum and minimum matric heads for capillarity respectively it should be noted that for pores with matric head h max capillarity disappears and pore water is captured by adsorption with matric head characterised by suction characteristic radius r similarly for the adsorbed water combined with eqs 1 9 12 and 14 swrc can be derived as follows 17 s e aw h 2 β η η α h α h min η α h max η α h min η h max η β 2 η η 2 α h 2 α h min η 2 α h max η 2 α h min η h max η therefore swrc over the entire matric suction head range can be specified as follows 18 s e h 1 h h min s e cw s e aw h min h h max s e aw h h max 3 2 rhcc model according to the water movement mechanism mentioned in the previous section water was transported in moderately wet soil in the entire cross section of smaller pores filled with water as well as continuous water film adsorbed on the surface of larger pores see state ii in fig 2 in the dry range as the nonwetting phase occupied the central part of the pores soil water moved only through the continuous water film adsorbed on the surface of the pores or particles see state iii in fig 2 3 2 1 hydraulic conductivity in a saturated state to develop the hydraulic conductivity model let us assume that the movement of pore water in the soil can be considered as a poiseuille flow and neglect the interfacial drag as well as body force from the hagen poiseuille equation bousfield and karles 2004 the volumetric flow rate of a single pore q p is as follows 19 q p r π r 4 8 μ δ p l t where δp and μ represent the hydraulic pressure drop and viscosity of pore water respectively therefore the total volume flow rate of soils q s t can be calculated by combining eqs 13 14 and 19 as follows 20 q s t r min r max q p r d n r π 8 μ δ p l 0 d t d f r max d f 2 d t 1 η 2 r max η 2 r min η 2 where η d t d f 1 is the fractal factor which ranges from 0 to 2 in addition the total volume flow rate of the soils on the macro scale can also be specified by darcy s law as follows 21 q s t k s δ p l 0 a where k s and a represent the hydraulic conductivity of soil in a saturated state and total area of the pores in the soil cross section respectively inserting eq 20 into eq 21 yields 22 k s π 8 μ 1 a l 0 d t 1 d f r max d f 2 d t 1 η 2 r max η 2 r min η 2 eq 22 shows that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of porous media depends on psd characterised by d f especially the maximum pore size r max tortuosity d t of the pores size a and l 0 of the sample and fluid viscosity μ of the wet phase 3 2 2 relative hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated state for capillary flow q cw can be calculated by combining eqs 13 14 and 19 as follows 23 q u cw r min r c q p r d n r π 8 μ δ p l 0 d t d f r max d f 2 d t 1 η 2 r c η 2 r min η 2 for annular film flow the volume flow rate of a single pore q aw is as follows 24 q aw v p ω a aw where a aw 1 1 δ 2 πr 2 is the cross sectional area of the adsorbed film flow v p represents the average velocity of the film flow which can be obtained by solving the simplified navier stokes equation or and tuller 2000 as follows 25 v p ω ω 2 3 μ δ p l t it should be noted that for the sake of simplicity only thick adsorption water film more than dozens of layers of water molecules is considered here and thinner water film with viscosity elevated by long term or short term interfacial forces are ignored mcbride and baveye 1995 combining eqs 9 13 14 24 and 25 results in 26 q u a w r min r max q aw d n r π 3 μ δ p d f r max d f l 0 d t 2 1 d t 2 β 3 r 3 α r max η 3 α 2 r min η 3 α 2 η 3 α 2 β 4 r 4 α r max η 4 α 2 r min η 4 α 2 η 4 α 2 based on buckingham darcy s law buckingham 1907 the volume flow rate of unsaturated flow q u ɷ can also be expressed as follows 27 q u ϖ k s k r ϖ δ p l 0 a where k r ϖ is the relative hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated flow and ϖ represents cw and aw for capillary and adsorptive flows respectively the relative hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated flow over the entire suction range can be obtained by combining eqs 1 22 23 26 and 27 as follows 28 k r cw h η 2 h max η 2 h min η 2 h max η 2 16 β 3 η 2

dependence of rhcc model eq 29 for film flow simplified as k r aw g h 3 α g 16 β 3 η 2 h min 3 α η 2 h max 3 α η 2 3 η 2 3 α h min η 2 h max η 2 by omitting the second term is similar to the empirical formula given by peters 2013 as k r aw g h ξ g w h a ξ where ha is related to the air entry value and w and ξ represent the fitting parameters without physical meaning as capillarity and adsorption are not directly dependent on each other lu 2016 in this study the complex coupling behaviour between these two soil water components was neglected therefore for unsaturated soil rhcc in the entire matric suction range can be written as follows 30 k r h 1 h h min k r cw k r aw h min h h max k r aw h h max the proposed rhcc model included five parameters fractal factor η adsorption strength α adsorption capacity β maximum matric head h max of capillarity and minimum matric head h min of the soil which were consistent with the parameters of the proposed swrc model therefore we can determine the parameters of rhcc eq 30 by calibrating the swrc model eq 18 based on the water retention datasets in addition relative hydraulic conductivity can also be expressed as a function of saturation by combining eqs 30 and 18 thus the new model can simulate the spatial variation of relative hydraulic conductivity saturation and matric head fig 4 shows the schematic relationship of k r s e h in a three dimensional space with η 0 55 α 0 038 β 0 029 h max 10000 cm and h min 8 cm 4 model validation and discussion 4 1 datasets in the published datasets 13 experimental datasets from different soils were selected to evaluate the proposed model within the entire matric head range the experimental data comprised shonai dune sand mehta et al 1994 danish sandy soil l3 and arizona silty soil 14 jensen et al 2015 ottawa sand willson et al 2012 pachapa loam and adelanto loam jackson et al 1965 georgia kaolinite likos and lu 2003 seochang sandy clay oh et al 2012 sandy loam and clay loam pachepsky et al 1984 berlin sand peters 2013 poderlee sand nemes et al 2001 and tohaku loam and masa loamy sand fujimaki and inoue 2003 among them seven data sets were only used to evaluate the swrc model while others were used to examine the compatibility of the proposed swrc and rhcc models with identical model parameters these data for soils with different textures and sources were selected because the saturation range covers both moderately wet and dry ranges when measuring swrc and rhcc of the soil 4 2 evaluation of swrc model the performance of the proposed swrc model was evaluated using seven sets of test data from clean sand to bentonite among these datasets the ranges of the matrix heads for six datasets were greater than 105 cm which provided a basis for evaluating the swrc model within the entire matric head range model parameters obtained by fitting the test data are listed in table 1 the proposed swrc model was also compared with the vg and kosugi models root mean square error rmse was employed to evaluate the performance of each model which can be specified as follows 31 rmse 1 n i 1 n s e i pre s e i mea 2 where s e i mea and s e i pre are the ith measured and predicted values respectively and n is the number of test values the calculated rmses for different models are mentioned in table 2 fig 5 a1 a3 shows the comparison between the fitted swrcs and test data for three sandy soils with different clay contents as shown the fitted swrc is in good agreement with the experimental data for shonai dune sand clay content accounted for 5 6 by gravimetric the water retention capacity of capillarity ranged from 0 to 70 cm as shown in fig 5 a1 for matric head 70 cm capillarity disappeared while adsorption completely controlled the water retention characteristics of the soil under equilibrium conditions fig 5 a2 a3 shows somewhat similar features for danish sandy soil l3 clay content accounted for 22 4 by gravimetric and ottawa sand clean sand respectively comparison between the swrcs of these three sandy soils shows that the capillary regime of danish sandy soil l3 approximately 0 2 105 cm was significantly larger than that of shonai dune sand 0 70 cm and ottawa sand 0 80 cm this was mainly due to the high clay content of danish sandy soil l3 resulting in a smaller average pore radius and higher proportion of small pores as formulated in the young laplace equation a smaller average pore size of the soil represents a larger range of capillary regime moreover the clay sized soil had a larger specific surface area and higher hydrophilic mineral content which made the adsorption capacity of danish sandy soil l3 greater than that of the other two types of sandy soils as shown in fig 5 a1 a3 fig 5 b1 shows the comparison of the fitted swrc for shonai dune sand with the vg and kosugi models as shown the model proposed in this paper can better predict the water retention characteristics of unsaturated soil within the entire matric head range as capillarity is considered to be the only contributor to water potential and water retention capacity of adsorption is ignored vg and kosugi models described the capillarity dominated range well but underestimated the water holding capacity of shonai dune sand in the high matric head range approximately 102 105 cm for shonai dune sand rmses in the entire matric head range all h of the proposed vg and kosugi models were 0 032 0 041 and 0 055 respectively in the higher matric head range h 105 cm rmses were 0 007 0 019 and 0 043 for these three sandy soils respectively the rmse of the proposed model was significantly smaller than that of the vg and kosugi models especially in the high matric head range fig 5 b2 and b3 show similar features for shonai dune sand yu and li 2001 suggested that r min r max or h min h max could be considered as a criterion to judge whether a porous medium can be characterized by fractal theory according to this criterion the h min h max of danish sandy soil l3 is 0 00025 the soil can thus be regarded as a fractal media however shonai dune sand and ottawa sand cannot be regarded as fractal media interestingly the proposed model still well describes the water retention characteristics of these two soils in fact if the adsorbed water is ignored the proposed swrc model can be reduced to the well known bc model brooks and corey 1966 which is not constrained by the soil type this means that the swrc model proposed in this paper may be transformed into a more generalized model in this case η may no longer represent the fractal factor but be transformed into a more complex parameter however if the swrc data of soil is available the parameter can be obtained by fitting the swrc data just like the bc model fig 6 shows the performance of the proposed swrc model in two silty soils clay or clay sized particles were the main components compared to fig 5 the adsorption capacity of sandy soil was found to be smaller than that of the silty soil because of the content of hydrophilic minerals and the specific surface area of silty soil was found to be larger than that of the sandy soil in addition as silty soil composed of smaller particles had a smaller average pore size its capillary regime was larger than that of the sandy soil as formulated in the young laplace equation the range of water retention by capillarity was not only related to the psd but also to the total pore volume therefore a different capillary regime for the same kind of soil with different stress histories will be found however adsorption was not affected by the psd of the soil which was mainly related to the mineral content mineral species and specific surface area of the soil for clayed soils a small but non negligible transition from capillary dominated to adsorption dominated regions was found from a few thousands to 106 cm matric head range where the change in soil water content mainly reflected changes in the adsorbed water content as shown in fig 7 because the clay mineral content of georgia kaolinite 98 clay mineral was significantly higher than that of seochang sandy clay 14 clay mineral the capillary regime of the former was larger than that of the latter as shown in fig 7 a1 and a2 the capillary regime of georgia kaolinite was approximately 0 2 105 cm and that of seochang sandy clay was approximately 0 9 104 cm compared to fig 5 the adsorbed water content of clayed soils was significantly higher than that of the sandy soils which implied that the hydrophilic mineral content and specific surface area of clay soils were significantly larger than those of the sandy soils fig 7 b shows the comparison between the three models proposed vg and kosugi models as shown the proposed model better described the water retention characteristics of clayed soils in the full matric suction range while the vg and kosugi models underestimated the soil water retention capacity in the high matric suction range table 2 shows the rmses obtained by the three models fitting different soil test data for all soils the fitting results showed that the rmse of the proposed model was significantly smaller than that of the vg and kosugi models both in the full all h and high 1 105 cm matric head ranges which indicated that swrc model proposed in this study can simulate water retention characteristics more accurately 4 3 validation for the complete hydraulic model the characteristics of the proposed model were validated with the datasets of seven soils varying from loam to sand to examine the compatibility of the proposed hydraulic model with identical model parameters model parameters were calibrated using the swrc test data and then used to predict the rhcc of the soil fig 8 illustrates the features of the complete hydraulic model for the sandy loam dataset it can be seen that the trajectory of swrc is in good agreement with the dataset in the entire matric head range from 1 to 106 cm for sandy loam an important intersection point can be found at a matric head of 4 104 cm which divided soil water retention characteristics into capillary and adsorption regimes the dominant region of capillarity began at saturation and adsorption as an auxiliary force exhibited little effect on the water holding and water conducting properties of the soil with the increase in suction the effects of capillarity on soil water retention gradually weakened and completely disappeared at a matric head of 105 cm in the later stage adsorption dominated the hydraulic properties of the soil model parameters obtained from fitting the swrc data were subsequently used to predict the rhcc of the soil as shown in fig 8 b the dataset of relative hydraulic conductivity for sandy loam was well predicted by the proposed rhcc model considering the effect of adsorption on water transport the proposed model could simulate the upward bending phenomenon of rhcc at a matric head of 104 cm however the conventional rhcc model e g vg m and kosugi m models underestimated the relative hydraulic conductivity in the high matric head range because of the neglect of adsorption fig 9 shows similar features for clay loam for berlin fig 10 and poderlee sands fig 11 one obvious difference from silty soil i e sandy loam and clay loam was that the adsorbed water content of these two kinds of sandy soils was significantly small and the capillarity dominated region was also relatively limited as discussed in the previous section this dissimilarity was mainly due to the larger average pore radius and lower hydrophilic mineral content of the sandy soil as shown in fig 10 a the adsorptive and capillary components of swrc for berlin sand crossed over at a matric head of 100 cm which separated swrc into adsorptive and capillary regimes as shown the proposed swrc model well described the water retention characteristics of berlin sand and the predicted trajectory of rhcc was also consistent with the trend of the test data in the entire matric head range figs 12 14 show the performance of the complete hydraulic model for the datasets of three soils masa loamy sand adelanto loam and tohaku loam as shown in fig 12 model parameters calculated from the swcc data of masa loamy sand were subsequently used to predict its hrcc where relative hydraulic conductivity was a function of saturation the characteristics of this relationship were well captured by the new model in both moderate wet and dry regions as illustrated in fig 12 b for saturations 0 1 the contribution of capillarity towards water transport was neglected and adsorption dominated the water transport characteristics in the soil with the increase in saturation although the relative hydraulic conductivity of the adsorbed components gradually increased to 4 10 4 completely saturated state the contribution of adsorption towards soil water transport was significantly smaller than that of capillarity as shown in fig 12 b it can be seen that if the influence of adsorption film flow on soil water transport is ignored the water conductivity of soil in the low saturation range will be greatly underestimated figs 13 and 14 show similar features for adelanto loam and tohaku loam datasets respectively overall these examples show that the new physical dependent hydraulic model of unsaturated soil with the aid of a simplified pore water configuration can effectively explain the hydraulic law of soil in the entire matric head range 4 4 comparison with other models below the performances of the new vg b van genuchten 1980 and k m models lebeau and konrad 2010 in predicting soil hydraulic properties are compared and analysed over the entire matric head range vg b and k m models can be specified as follows vg b model 32a k r h 1 α h n 2 1 α h n m 1 α h n 2 m 32b k r s e s e 2 1 1 s e 1 m 1 2 n where α n and m represent the fitted parameters k m model 33a k r h q ln h h m σ 1 2 q ln h h m σ σ 2 33b k r s e s e 1 2 q q 1 s e σ 2 where q x x 2 π 1 2 exp x 2 2 d x h m is related to the matric head corresponding to the median pore radius and σ is the standard deviation of the normal logarithm distribution as shown in fig 15 a scatter diagram was employed to present the visual comparison between the predicted and experimental data for each model to analyse and display the measurement and prediction data as completely as possible double logarithmic coordinate system was used in the scatterplots and the measured relative hydraulic conductivity of 10 5 was set as a line to divide the whole region into the capillary and adsorption dominated regions as shown vg b and k m models captured the hydraulic characteristics of the capillary region well while significantly underestimating the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in low saturation area because of the omission of adsorption component a notable improvement was observed when the model proposed in this study was used which employed a simplified pore water configuration to consider both capillary and adsorbed water components such visual presentation can be transformed into quantitative analysis by employing root mean square natural logarithm transformed error rmsle which is an indicator of the overall average residual between the measured and predicted data rmsle is calculated as follows 34 rmsle 1 n i 1 n log k r i pre log k r i mea 2 where n is the number of test values and k r i pre and k r i mea are the predicted and measured relative hydraulic conductivities of the unsaturated soil respectively table 3 summarises the rmsles of different models for each dataset of relative hydraulic conductivity as shown the complete hydraulic model proposed in this paper was the best for all datasets involved in the evaluation the average rmsle was 0 336 1 182 and 1 058 for the proposed vg b and k m models this significant difference indicated that omitting the adsorbed component obstructs the accurate prediction of the hydraulic properties of soils especially in the high matric head range or low saturation range 4 5 analysis of the model features and discussion the complete hydraulic model proposed in this paper contains five parameters η α β h max and h min all having specific geometrical or physical meaning and perform their respective functions independently figs 16 18 show the different impacts of various parameters on soil hydraulic properties fig 16 a and b shows the responses of relative hydraulic conductivity k r matric head h curve rmc and saturation s e curve rsc to the variation of fractal factor η an important parameter determining the psd of soils as shown in fig 16 a fractal factor η or psd only affected the retention and hydraulic properties of capillary water but had little effect on adsorbed water which was consistent with the inference of lu 2016 it is interesting to note that this conclusion did not appear to be consistent with that illustrated in fig 16 b which shows that η significantly influenced the hydraulic conductivity of adsorbed water components however saturation s e shown in fig 16 b was the sum of adsorbed water and capillary water components thus the influence of fractal factor η on k r s e curve of the adsorbed component mainly reflected the influence of η or psd on the water content of the capillary water component if the water content of the adsorbed water component is normalised as the abscissa alone it will again prove that psd slightly influences the hydraulic conductivity of the adsorbed water component in addition as shown in fig 16 a the larger the fractal factor η the smaller the absolute value of rmc slope within the capillarity region a larger fractal factor η means that the total volume of the smaller pores accounted for a larger proportion of the total volume of the pores in the soil therefore it is more difficult for the soil to dehumidify or have a smaller hydraulic conductivity under a given matric head which was consistent with the physical phenomenon described by the yang laplace equation at the same saturation a larger η value resulted in a smaller critical pore radius and the corresponding larger matric suction resulted in a smaller hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 16 b generally fractal factor η controls soil water retention and transport properties mainly by affecting the psd of the soil fig 17 a and b depicts the effects of parameter α on rmc and rsc respectively as shown α controlled the adsorption strength of rmc and rsc while had little effect on the adsorption capacity of the soil more specifically α controlled the slope of rmc and rsc in the higher matric head range or at lower saturations within the adsorption region but had little effect on the total amount of adsorbed water its physical mechanism may be related to the types of hydrophilic minerals present in the soil the smaller the α with a higher valence of the ions contained in the mineral of soils which increased the adsorption strength of the soil the smaller the absolute value of the slope of rmc and rsc within the range of adsorption mechanism alternatively it is evident from fig 17 that α is only slightly correlated with the hydraulic properties of the capillary component the effects of parameter β which is related to soil adsorption capacity on soil hydraulic properties are plotted in fig 18 the adsorption capacity of soil is defined here as the total amount of adsorbed water when soil is fully saturated it can be seen from fig 18 that parameter β controlled the adsorption capacity of the soil and the greater the value of β the stronger the adsorption capacity a higher value of β indicates that the soil may have a larger specific surface area and or more hydrophilic mineral content in addition the adsorption components of rmc and rsc corresponding to different β values were found to be almost parallel to each other with the trajectories of capillary components almost coincident this implied that β had little effect on the adsorption strength and transport properties of the capillary component according to the above analysis of the model characteristics each model parameter performed its expected function independently with no coupling between each other thus ensuring the uniqueness of the optimal parameter combination yu and li 2001 proposed that fractal dimension d f can be estimated according to porosity ϕ and the ratio r min rmax in porous media that is d f 2 lnϕ ln r min r max the water retention characteristics of capillary components can thus be predicted however parameters α and β were difficult to measure or estimate through conventional geotechnical tests because they are related to the mineral species mineral content and specific surface area of soil more specifically the water retention characteristics of adsorption components are affected by the content and valence of ions in the soil and the specific surface area of the soil zhang and lu 2018 it is very challenging to connect the physicochemical coupling behavior with its influencing factors through mathematical methods as an alternative method these model parameters can be determined by the characteristics of swrc in the adsorption dominated range for example the adsorption strength α is the slope of swrc within the range of matric suction dominated by adsorption and the adsorption capacity β determines the intercept of swrc adsorption components and the degree of saturation s e coordinate axis the proposed model also suffers some limitations firstly the hysteresis effects of hydraulic properties cannot be described by the proposed model because the non uniformity of soil pores is not considered russell and buzzi russell and buzzi 2012 focused on the hysteresis effects of soil water retention based on fractal theory and achieved good results on the other hand the connectivity of soil pores is not considered in the capillary system as well in this regard hunt hunt 2001 attempted to model the connectivity of soil pores if these limitations are to be removed completely the micro scale geometric structure of the soil pores must be available it is worth to be noted that with the development of imaging technology pore structure can be approximately measured and computed by x ray tomography wildenschild et al 2002 this method was used by dong and blunt 2009 to measure the psd pore shape factor and throat size of berea and fontainebleau sandstones if the real structural image of the pores is available it should be evidently closer to the natural state of the pores than the capillary system 5 conclusions a complete hydraulic model including swrc and rhcc was formulated to predict the hydraulic properties of soils from complete saturation to near dryness the derivation of a physically dependent model is based on the assumption that soil pores can be replaced by a bundle of tortuous capillaries with a simplified water configuration and the size and tortuosity of the pores obey the fractal scale law based on the experimental evidence that the adsorption component of matric potential significantly impacted soil hydraulic properties at low saturation the hydraulic process was partitioned into capillary and adsorption regions to describe the effects of different matric potential components on soil hydraulic behaviours the proposed fractal swrc model contained five parameters η α β h max and h min all having specific geometrical or physical meaning these parameters were identical to those of the derived rhcc model so that the model parameters can be calculated from the swrc data and subsequently used to predict the hydraulic conductivity of the soil the complete hydraulic model was validated using the swrc and rhcc data of the soils with different textures from clean sand to bentonite indicating that it can reasonably predict water retention and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soil over the entire suction range moreover compared to the other two well known models the proposed model exhibited significant advantages especially in the adsorption region by analysing the influence of model parameters on soil water conductivity it was found that the psd of the soils mainly controlled the transport characteristics of capillary water while having a slight influence on the hydraulic properties of adsorbed water which proved the inference made by lu 2016 the hydraulic properties of adsorbed water were mainly dominated by the type and content of minerals in the soils and specific surface area of the soil the method presented in this paper provides a framework for studying the hydraulic properties of unsaturated porous media in the full suction range it can be a starting point for studying other physical phenomena that require hydraulic models such as solute transport root water uptake and geological reactions in porous media credit authorship contribution statement ke chen conceptualization

4237,to predict future hydrological cycling in permafrost dominated regions requires consideration of complex hydrological interactions that involve cryospheric states and fluxes and hence thermodynamics this challenges many hydrological models particularly those applied in the arctic this study presents the implementation and validation of set of algorithms representing permafrost and frozen ground dynamics coupled into a physically based modular cold regions hydrological model at two tundra sites in northern yukon territory canada hydrological processes represented in the model include evapotranspiration soil moisture dynamics flow through organic and mineral terrain ground freeze thaw infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils snowpack energy balance and the accumulation wind redistribution sublimation and canopy interception of snow the model was able to successfully represent observed ground surface temperature ground thaw and snow accumulation at the two sites without calibration a sensitivity analysis of simulated ground thaw revealed that the soil properties of the upper organic layer dominated the model response however its performance was robust for a range of realistic physical parameters different modelling decisions were assessed by removing the physically based algorithms for snowpack dynamics and ground surface temperature and replacing them with empirical approaches results demonstrate that more physically based approaches should be pursued to reduce uncertainties in poorly monitored environments finally the model was driven by three climate warming scenarios to assess the sensitivity of snow redistribution and ablation processes and ground thaw to warming temperatures this showed great sensitivity of snow regime and soil thaw to warming even in the cold continental climate of the northwestern canadian arctic the results are pertinent to transportation infrastructure and water management in this remote cold sparsely gauged region where traditional approaches to hydrological prediction are not possible keywords permafrost hydrology arctic cold regions hydrological modelling model uncertainty 1 introduction the warming arctic is undergoing several environmental changes such as shrub expansion and densification lantz et al 2013 myers smith et al 2018 sturm et al 2001 permafrost thaw payette 2004 and declines in terrestrial water storage suzuki et al 2018 permafrost thaw has been shown to be critical for hydrological connectivity supra and super permafrost groundwater exchange hydraulic conductivity and subsurface runoff and storage walvoord and kurylyk 2016 carbon dioxide and methane release herndon 2018 knoblauch et al 2018 changes in landscape liljedahl et al 2016 myers smith et al 2008 and infrastructure such as building foundations and roadbed stability therefore a better understanding of and ability to predict permafrost thaw and its hydrological consequences are needed in the context of climate and vegetation change simulating the ground freeze and thaw regime represents a great challenge as it is the result of complex interactions between processes representing the energy and mass exchanges amongst atmosphere land snowpack and subsurface kane et al 1991 park et al 2015 woo 2012 yamazaki 2001 zhao et al 1997 numerical methods representing the heat transfer equation including heat conduction latent heat and convective heat exchange coupled with subsurface flow have been shown to properly simulate ground freeze and thaw using detailed ground information and forcing data kurylyk and watanabe 2013 models like the advance terrestrial simulator ats atchley et al 2015 jan et al 2020 jan et al 2018 painter et al 2016 sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 and geotop endrizzi et al 2014 have been extensively tested demonstrating their ability to represent the hydrological and thermal regime of the arctic however their main disadvantage is that they are data intensive and computationally expensive which may preclude their implementation in regions of the arctic that are not heavily monitored or when needed to be applied at large scales for hydrological applications conversely there are simplified empirical representations for the active layer thickness based on empirical equations e g degree day which have been used for hydrological modelling in cold regions kane et al 1997 schramm et al 2007 zhang et al 2000 the main disadvantage of these approaches is that they are not reliable under conditions different from which they were developed sivapalan 2003 limiting their implementation in remote and ungauged or poorly gauged regions and for climate change impact studies for which more physically based approaches should be pursued instead pomeroy et al 2013 therefore models of more intermediate complexities that can reliably represent ground freeze and thaw among other critical arctic and subarctic processes and can be relatively easily implemented in hydrological models are needed to allow multiple model realizations and assess model uncertainty and sensitivity in the context of models of intermediate complexity stefan s equation juminikis 1977 p 205 is a commonly used and relatively simple one directional model that estimates ground freeze and thaw in homogeneous soils which considers the latent heat of fusion and neglects the soil volumetric heat capacity and convective heat exchange modified versions of stefan s equation have been developed to be implemented in multilayered soils fox 1992 hayashi et al 2007 woo et al 2004 yi et al 2006 another modified version of stefan s equation developed by xie and gough 2013 referred as the xg algorithm differs from previous approaches as it does not require averaging of soil parameters for multilayered soils and is independent of the number and thickness of soil layers algorithms based on stefan s equation require ground surface temperature estimation as the upper boundary condition measuring this variable is not common and even if it is measured at a point spatially distributed estimations are required for hydrological models simulation of ground surface temperature has been typically approached by implementing a ratio between ground surface temperature to air temperature referred as the n factor woo 2012 p 56 which is commonly assumed to be constant main issues associated to the use of the n factor are its empirical basis and that it varies spatially klene et al 2001 and temporally woo et al 2007 williams et al 2015 presented a novel approach to estimate ground surface temperature based on air temperature net radiation and ground thaw depth referred as the radiative conductive convective rcc approach the rcc approach showed good performance at three research basins in northern canada and it proved to have a superior performance over the empirical n factor both the xg algorithm and the rcc approach were incorporated in the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 and they are part of the arctic hydrology model ahm developed by krogh et al 2017 using crhm and applied by krogh and pomeroy 2019 krogh and pomeroy 2018 to investigate historical and future hydrological changes in an arctic basin under transient climate and vegetation this study investigates the incorporation of the xg algorithm and rcc approach into the crhm ahm using detailed ground observations and demonstrates why more physically based models of intermediate complexity should be pursued instead of empirical approaches particularly in cold remote and poorly monitored regions as a secondary goal the sensitivity of the model to changes in the soil thermal properties and porosity is also examined for model transferability and climate change studies finally three warming air temperature scenarios are assessed to investigate the vulnerability of this region to projected changes in air temperature to pursue these goals the model is applied at a site scale to two well instrumented tundra research sites in northern yukon territory canada for which measurements of soil temperature ground surface temperature snowpack and meteorological variables are available 2 study sites and data the two sites selected for this study in northern yukon territory canada fig 1 are rio roca 66 50 1 0 n 136 20 0 0 w and windy pass 65 4 0 8 n 138 14 46 1 w these sites were selected as they represent the sparsely wooded tundra drainage basins of the region have good access from the only road in northern yukon the dempster highway are relatively sheltered from wind and bridge the gap between existing weather stations along the dempster highway corridor the elevation at windy pass is 1 030 m a s l in a terrain with a mild slope estimated at 5 and surrounded by shrubs moss and scattered spruce the soil profile at windy pass is characterized by an upper partially decomposed organic layer 23 cm thick followed by a denser organic matter layer 15 cm thick underlain by mineral soil fig 2 a the elevation at rio roca is 660 m a s l with a ground surface slope estimated at 4 is surrounded by scattered shrubs and spruce and with moss lichen and grass on the ground the soil profile at rio roca is characterized by an upper partially decomposed organic layer 18 cm thick followed by a denser and organic matter layer of at least 63 cm thickness at which point continuous ice rich permafrost was reached and further subsoil investigations were not possible fig 2b according to the brown et al 2002 permafrost classification shown in fig 1 both sites are underlain by continuous permafrost with low ice content 10 however we found that that was not case for the rio roca site fig 2b both stations were equipped with sensors to measure the following variables precipitation air temperature relative humidity incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation wind direction and speed snow depth soil heat flux soil moisture and temperature four depths ground surface temperature and snow temperature the sensors models manufacturers and height depths are detailed in table 1 the data was recorded using a cr1000 datalogger from campbell scientific canada ltd and the frequency of measurements was every 30 min for all variables except for soil moisture and temperature which were measured every 6 h 2 1 observed hydrometeorological conditions 2 1 1 rio roca continuous records are available from september 2014 until june 2016 when this site was damaged by a bear therefore only one ground thaw season 2015 and two winter seasons 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 are available fig 3 a presents mean monthly precipitation and mean daily temperature for the observed period precipitation was corrected for the effect of wind undercatch typically found for snowfall in cold windy and dry environments goodison et al 1998 using the empirical relationship between wind speed and undercatch developed by smith 2008 mean annual precipitation was 439 mm for which the maximum monthly precipitation occurred in august at 111 mm mean summer precipitation june to august was 205 mm or 47 of the mean annual precipitation whereas winter precipitation october to april accounted for 165 mm or 38 of the mean annual precipitation mean annual air temperature at rio roca was 4 1 c and the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures were 25 5 and 36 3 c respectively with an average 0 c season of 150 days from april 25 to september 22 wind speed was relatively mild with most events below 4 m s 1 however some isolated event reached up top 10 m s 1 fig 3b presents mean daily soil temperature at four depths showing the duration of ground thawing and freezing seasons table a1 note that ground temperature at all depths go well below 0 c supporting the presence of continuous permafrost as shown by the brown et al 2002 classification shown in fig 1 2 1 2 windy pass continuous weather and soil data is available from september 2014 to june 2017 including two summers 2015 and 2016 and three winters 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 fig 3c presents mean monthly precipitation and mean daily air temperature precipitation was also corrected for the effect of wind undercatch using the expression from smith 2008 corrected mean annual precipitation was 407 mm slightly drier than rio roca with a maximum in august at 104 mm and a total summer precipitation of 243 mm or 60 of the mean annual precipitation winter precipitation october to april was 107 mm or 26 of the mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature was 4 4 c colder than rio roca and the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures were 25 0 and 42 1 c respectively with an average 0 c season of 148 days from april 28 to september 23 winds were relatively mild and typically below 2 m s 1 but reached up to 8 m s 1 fig 3d presents mean daily soil temperature at four depths showing the duration of the thawing season which was shorter in 2015 than in 2016 table a2 presents a summary with the initiation duration and end of ground thawing and freezing for the two water years in general the deeper into the ground the longer the thawing season is at windy pass which is the opposite of the colder rio roca site 3 hydrological model site scale application the arctic hydrology model ahm krogh et al 2017 developed using the cold regions hydrological model platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2016 was used to simulate surface and subsurface mass and energy interactions at windy pass and rio roca the crhm ahm model is a physically based and semi distributed hydrological model that uses hydrological response units to compute the energy and mass balance when run at a site scale as in this application the model is composed of a single hydrological response unit that represent the scale of the site where hydrological and atmospheric observations are taken and thus it lacks a streamflow routing routine hydrological processes represented in this application include snow albedo decay precipitation phase sublimation evaporation from canopy intercepted snowfall rainfall snowpack mass and energy balance snow redistribution and sublimation by wind ground freeze and thaw evaporation and transpiration surface and subsurface flow and storage runoff detention flow through organic terrain and snowpack and infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils a brief description with the key characteristics of each module representing the hydrological processes are presented in table a3 however a more detailed description can be found in krogh et al 2017 for a basin scale application most algorithms used to represent these hydrological processes have a strong physical basis allowing confidence in the model and parameter transferability between sites with similar conditions the crhm ahm requires hourly input forcing data consisting of precipitation air temperature relative humidity wind speed and shortwave irradiance longwave irradiance was estimated in the model using the method presented by sicart et al 2006 as a fine scale implementation of the crhm ahm model to fairly flat sites this application did not allow horizontal inputs of liquid water fluxes such as surface and subsurface flow though water can flow out and blowing snow can also be transferred horizontally through wind redistribution the majority of the parameters used in this study are presented and discussed by krogh et al 2017 which were taken from detailed process studies in the region or in places with similar hydrological conditions however parameters describing local characteristics such as elevation aspect slope vegetation and soil profile are specific to each site and derived from local measurements the interactions between subsurface physical processes within crhm ahm are shown in the fig 4 of krogh et al 2017 which is the same model structure as used here to simulate the seasonal thawing and freezing of the ground the crhm ahm model uses the xg algorithm xie and gough 2013 which is a simplified solution for stefan s equation that allows multi layered soil with non uniform soil properties this method only considers the latent heat of fusion and neglects the volumetric heat capacity of the soil associated with sensible heat fluxes and heat advection and thus it assumes a uniform temperature profile at the freezing point 0 c below the thawing front the xg algorithm simulates a freezing thawing front from the ground surface downward based on a surface freeze thaw index degree day and assumes a linear temperature profile within soil layers as such it requires estimates of ground surface temperature to provide the upper boundary condition to the model the ground surface temperature is estimated using the rcc approach williams et al 2015 the soil profile configuration used here consists of 20 soil layers which represent the upper most three meters of the ground records of soil temperature show that below 1 5 m the soil does not thaw and thus a three meter ground layer is sufficient to represent the seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer the top 10 layers are 0 1 m thick and the lower 10 layers are 0 2 m thick the top 4 layers in the windy pass model represent the top organic soil and the lower 16 layers represent the mineral soil fig 2a the rio roca model has a thicker organic layer represented by the top 8 layers in the model and the mineral soil represented by the remaining 12 layers fig 2b the thermal properties and porosities used in the organic and mineral soil layers are based on reference values presented by woo 2012 for the organic soil layer the porosity dry thermal conductivity saturated unfrozen thermal conductivity saturated frozen thermal conductivity was set to 0 8 0 1 w m 1 k 1 1 0 w m 1 k 1 and 1 9 w m 1 k 1 respectively whereas the same parameters for the mineral soil layer were set to 0 4 0 25 w m 1 k 1 2 5 w m 1 k 1 and 1 9 w m 1 k 1 respectively the crhm ahm model uses the relationships from johansen 1975 p 221 to calculate the thermal conductivity of non saturated soils based on the degree of saturation of the soil and saturated thermal conductivity 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis to quantify the uncertainty on simulated ground thaw associated with the typically most uncertain subsurface parameter a sensitivity analysis for a range of possible and documented values was performed the six parameters included in the sensitivity analysis and their range were the dry thermal conductivity ranging between 0 06 0 15 and 0 2 0 3 w m 1 k 1 for the organic and soil layers respectively unfrozen saturated thermal conductivity ranging between 0 25 0 75 and 2 0 3 0 w m 1 k 1 for organic and soil layers respectively and porosity ranging between 0 7 0 9 and 0 3 0 5 for organic and soil layers respectively we used the global sensitivity analysis developed by razavi and gupta 2016 referred as vars variogram analysis of response surfaces in particular the star var implementation was used this method accounts for the spatial ordered structure of the model response across the parameter range which is typically neglected in other methods razavi et al 2019 this implementation requires a number of stars to determine how many model iterations to be performed here 15 stars and a resolution of sampling h 0 1 recommended value by razavi et al 2019 were used resulting in 825 model iterations to quantify the global sensitivity of the model we used the integrated variogram analysis between the 0 and 50 of the parameter range typically referred as ivars50 the objective function to measure the sensitivity of the model is based on the mean bias between observed and simulated ground thaw at four depths 3 2 modelling decision analysis a model experiment was run using model configurations with different levels of complexities to evaluate the importance of pursuing more physically based approaches to represent key physical processes in arctic environments this took advantage of crhm s flexible modular structure to swap and replace physically based modules with empirical ones whilst leaving the rest of the model unchanged here the crhm ahm was modified by switching the representation of snow accumulation sublimation and melt and ground surface temperature as described below model configuration 1 mc1 as opposed to using the two layer mass and energy balance model snobal marks et al 1998 normally used in crhm which includes a calculation of sublimation losses as well as snowpack energetics a conventional degree day melt model was used in which snowmelt is simulated as an empirical relationship with air temperature that is represented by a degree day coefficient typically this coefficient needs to be calibrated however here it is assumed that no local calibration data is available which is a reasonable assumption in most arctic and subarctic regions the most reasonable estimation for the degree day coefficient for northwestern north america is from kane et al 1997 who calibrated this coefficient for an arctic basin in adjacent northern alaska over a six year period the degree day coefficient from kane et al 1997 that produced the best fit over the six year period was 2 7 mm d 1 c 1 which is the value that is used here no attempt was made to improve the performance of this model by for example including a radiation component through more empirical coefficients such as the one presented by kustas et al 1994 to minimize the sources of uncertainties in the experiment model configuration 2 mc2 the algorithm normally used in crhm to estimate ground surface temperature was changed the rcc approach williams et al 2015 was replaced with a temperature index approach n factor in which ground surface temperature was calculated as a relationship with air temperature the temperature index was the empirical relationship presented by woo et al 2007 which was developed using 30 years of observed data in northwestern canada this relationship requires three empirical coefficients b c and s as well as the depth of ground thaw as follows 1 t g t a b c e x p s p where tg and ta are the ground surface and air temperature c respectively and p is the depth of ground thaw m the values presented by woo et al 2007 for the louisy point a tundra site with organic terrain in the mackenzie delta of the adjacent northwest territories were used due to their similarly with the conditions found at rio roca and windy pass their values are b 0 5 c 0 54 and s 0 05 model configuration 3 mc3 in this experiment mc1 and mc2 were combined meaning that the degree day model was used to calculate snowmelt and the n factor was used for the ground surface temperature 3 3 air temperature sensitivity the last analysis investigates the effect of climate warming on snow accumulation and melt and ground thaw these variables are key in cold regions environments controlling subsurface flow rates runoff volume and energy exchange with the atmosphere three warming scenarios that increase the mean annual air temperature by 2 4 and 6 c were implemented representing scenarios of moderate significant and severe climate warming these scenarios can be implemented using a climate change feature of crhm that holds relative humidity constant but allows vapour pressure to vary 4 results 4 1 model validation 4 1 1 snow water equivalent fig 4 presents a comparison between simulated snow water equivalent swe against two snow surveys for water years 2014 and 2015 at the rio roca and windy pass site fig 4a and 4b respectively both snow surveys were performed in late march during the accumulation season and about a month before the date of peak swe early may the snow survey consisted of an approximately 25 m transect across each study site where swe samples were taken every 5 m mean and standard deviations of swe are presented to show the degree of variability that can be found similar performance was found at both sites the mean biases for the rio roca site were 30 and 24 mm for the water years 2014 and 2015 respectively whereas at the windy pass site biases were 29 and 30 mm respectively despite the underestimation at both sites simulated swe was within the observed swe standard deviation observed swe standard deviations suggests a relatively large spatial variability along the snow transect both sites due to small topographic and vegetation variations producing wind redistribution and trapping variations at scales smaller than can be modelled by the blowing snow algorithm in crhm overall the model simulations underestimated observed swe which may be due to uncertainty in the wind undercatch correction used smith 2008 model error e g calculation of blowing snow or turbulent fluxes or biophysical and wind exposure differences between the instrument site and the snow survey transect continuous snow depth observations by the ultrasonic depth sensor at windy pass allows evaluation of the timing of the end of snow ablation fig 4c the observed dates for the end of snow ablation for the years 2015 2016 and 2017 were may 19 may 14 and may 9 respectively whereas simulations were may 19 may 11 and may 15 this shows that the model simulated a 3 day earlier and 6 days later end of snow ablation period for the years 2016 and 2017 respectively but captured the exact day in 2015 this is particularly important as the end of the snow ablation triggers the initiation of ground thaw unfortunately for the rio roca site records from the ultrasonic sensor were particularly noisy precluding an accurate identification of the end of snow ablation date 4 1 2 ground thaw and ground surface temperature fig 5 presents a comparison between observed ground surface daily temperature at 1 cm depth and simulations for the snow free period of 2015 and 2016 for windy pass fig 5a and b and 2015 for rio roca fig 5c the model represents ground surface temperature well at both sites with a slightly better performance at windy pass mean bias ranges from 0 5 and 0 4 c at windy pass and 0 04 c at rio roca correlation coefficient ranges from 0 95 at windy pass to 0 88 at rio roca and the root mean square error ranges from 1 4 c at windy pass to 2 2 c at rio roca a slightly later one week initiation of ground surface thaw was simulated at rio roca overall this analysis demonstrates the capability of the non calibrated rcc model williams et al 2015 to simulate daily ground surface temperature at rio roca and windy pass fig 6 shows simulated versus observed ground thaw for the years 2015 and 2016 at windy pass and 2015 at rio roca observed ground thaw was calculated by identifying the date and depth at which the soil temperature reached 0 c using the four soil temperature sensors at windy pass and during the thawing season of 2015 the model underestimated ground thaw by 10 13 23 and 15 cm at 10 23 51 and 91 cm deep respectively resulting in a mean bias of 15 cm during the 2016 thawing season the model also underestimated observations by 10 2 7 and 3 cm at 10 23 51 and 91 cm deep respectively resulting in a mean bias of 6 cm at rio roca a better agreement was found with differences of 10 0 02 0 0 and 9 cm at 10 30 51 and 76 cm depths respectively resulting in a mean bias of 5 cm the initiation of ground thaw was 5 days late and likely due to late snow ablation in the model overall the model slightly underestimated ground thaw by 15 and 5 cm which is sometimes explained by a later than observer initiation of thawing season but also likely due to model errors however this is an overall good model performance considering the lack of calibration to represent ground thaw 4 2 ground thaw sensitivity to soil parameters fig 7 presents the results of sensitivity analyses for the rio roca and windy pass models upper panels show the ratio of factor sensitivity using the ivars50 metric as recommended by razavi and gupta 2016 in both cases the parameter that had the greatest impact on the model i e the largest ratio of factor sensitivity fig 7a and d was the dry thermal conductivity of the organic soil layer p3 followed by the porosity of the organic layer p1 uncertainties in simulating ground thaw at both sites was estimated using the same 825 parameter scenarios generated with vars at rio roca fig 7b little uncertainty associated with the soil parameters was found with an active layer thickness alt that varied between 0 93 and 1 m at windy pass fig 7e alt varied between 1 17 and 1 42 m for the year 2015 and between 1 31 and 1 58 m for the year 2016 revealing that the simulated alt at windy pass is more sensitive to the selection of parameters particularly those associated with the upper organic soil layer this can be explained by the warmer and longer thawing season found at windy pass fig 6 allowing a larger variability by the end of the season histograms of simulations mean bias show that at windy pass fig 7f parameter uncertainty alone does not completely explain the model underestimation of ground thaw as for all the scenarios the mean bias was always at least 6 cm at rio roca fig 7c some simulations showed a mean bias of 3 cm suggesting that with a different combination of realistic parameters the model bias can be further reduced to smaller values 4 3 impact of modelling decisions fig 8 shows simulated swe and ground thaw at the rio roca and windy pass site for the three model configuration experiments and the control run which is the model configuration using the most physically based approaches i e the crhm ahm swe analysis shows a significant deterioration of simulations of snow accumulation for all years and sites under the mc1 and mc3 i e degree day for snowmelt increasing substantially the error in simulating observed swe the model performance deterioration is particularly evident at the windy pass site were not only observed swe is largely underestimated but also snow seems to be completely depleted in the middle of the 2015 2016 winter which is highly unlike in such a cold environment demonstrating the strong need for calibration for the empirical snow model swe in the mc2 shows the same performance as the control run which is expected as the n factor for calculating ground surface temperature does not play a role in representing snow accumulation and melt ground thaw simulations also show a significant deterioration of the model s performance when using the n factor method i e mc2 and mc3 to estimate ground surface temperature in both mc2 and mc3 ground thaw rates are significantly underestimated producing an alt about 10 to 15 cm below that of the control run at rio roca which already showed an underestimation of the mean ground thaw conditions at windy pass alt difference between mc2 and mc3 with the control run is even larger and between 35 and 40 cm in 2015 and between 43 and 50 cm in 2016 this analysis showed that re calibrating the n factor is needed to better simulate ground thaw at these two sites it is also interesting to note the difference between the mc1 degree day and the control run as there are two key differences introduced by misrepresenting snow accumulation and melt the first is the snowcover depletion date which controls the initiation of ground thaw and the second is the amount of water that infiltrates the soil which has a significant impact on the thermal conductivity with wetter thawed soils having a larger thermal conductivity and thus higher thawing rates differences in representing ground surface temperature are presented in table 2 at both sites the mc1 and mc3 showed the worst performance in both correlations and mean bias when compared with observed ground surface temperature note that using a more physically based approach to simulate both ground surface temperature and ground thaw is not enough to properly represent ground surface temperature as the impact of misrepresenting snow accumulation and melt i e mc1 degree day on ground thaw is also significant due to its impact on ground thaw initiation and rates interestingly mc2 i e n factor has a high correlation even higher than that of the control run at rio roca however its mean bias is the largest of all scenarios at 2 35 and 3 75 c in rio roca and windy pass respectively this suggests that the regionally calibrated n factor is not suitable to representing ground surface temperature locally 4 4 climate warming analysis average changes to peak swe for the two winter seasons at rio roca are 31 40 and 56 mm for the 2 4 and 6 c scenario respectively fig 9 at windy pass average changes are 4 21 and 45 mm for the 2 4 and 6 c respectively with significant interannual variability during warmer winters like the 2015 2016 the snowpack is more sensitive to increases in temperature producing mid winter melt events as shown for windy pass warmer snowpack or precipitation phase may shift from snowfall to rainfall reducing snow accumulation this is particularly important at the beginning and end of the accumulation season and can provide extra energy to melt the snowpack pomeroy et al 2016 not only peak swe changed considerably after warming advances in the date of peak swe and the end of snow depletion were also found table a5 for example the date of peak swe at rio roca for the 2014 2015 winter shifted earlier by about two to three weeks whereas it changed little for the 2015 2016 winter changes to the snowpack not only impact the amount of water available for spring and summer runoff but also change the date of the ground thaw initiation as discussed in previous sections significant changes to ground thaw were found under the warming scenarios for the 2 c scenario at rio roca alt increased 17 cm or 18 whereas for the 6 c scenario it increased up to 50 cm or 53 ground thaw initiation advanced between one to three weeks as temperatures increase at rio roca increasing the duration of the thawing seasons for about one to two months for the 2 and 6 c scenarios respectively table a4 more severe changes to alt were found at the windy pass site table a5 particularly during the 2015 summer with a 26 cm or 20 increase in the 2 c scenario and a 61 cm or 48 increase in the 6 c scenario changes to the end of the ground thaw season at windy pass are not as severe as those found at rio roca with the only significant changes found for the 4 and 6 c scenarios by about a week during the 2016 summer the duration of the thawing season at windy pass increased by 40 and 25 days for the 2015 and 2016 summer and the 6 c scenario overall results associated to changes to ground thaw showed that alt at windy pass is more sensitive to increasing temperature which is likely due to the generally longer thawing season than at rio roca however the initiation end and duration of the thawing season are more sensitive at the rio roca site 5 discussion the site scale application of the crhm ahm model successfully represented daily ground surface temperature at the two sites fig 5 demonstrating the capacity of the rcc model to be successfully transferred and applied to different conditions without calibration ground surface temperature is a critical state variable in the model as it is used as the upper boundary condition to the module simulating ground thaw and it is typically used for that purpose by other models as well hayashi et al 2007 kurylyk et al 2014 woo et al 2007 the model slightly underestimated ground thaw at both sites fig 6 model underestimation of ground thaw could be due to late simulations of the initiation of ground thaw which is controlled partially by the end of the snow ablation and meteorological inputs simulated end of snow ablation at windy pass was three days earlier in 2015 and six days later in 2016 therefore the later snow disappearance in 2016 can partially explain for the underestimation of ground thaw during 2016 but not during the 2015 thawing season differences between simulated and observed snow depth at windy pass may be due to several factors including the lack of representation of blowing snow redistribution over complex terrain by the site scale crhm ahm model as the model implementation uses a single hydrological response unit it neglects any spatial heterogeneity in the terrain that may also explain for differences in the snowpack and ground thaw between simulations and observations unfortunately measured snow depth at rio roca was too noisy to extract a reasonable estimation for the end of the snow ablation another reason to explain the underestimation of ground thaw is an underestimation of the saturated thermal conductivity which in combination with the degree of saturation of the soil define the unsaturated thermal conductivity this application of the crhm ahm model does not represent inputs of lateral subsurface flow but it allows outflows which may impact the accurate representation of the subsurface water storage in either case the average underestimation of ground thaw is considered small for hydrological applications particularly when parameters from the literature are being used as opposed to measured or locally calibrated values this is an important finding as hydrological models of headwater basins in the arctic typically either neglected or used simplified representations of ground thaw i e degree day zhang et al 2000 schramm et al 2007 however the crhm ahm successfully represented the evolution of the active layer using a robust yet computationally inexpensive approach the sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters associated with the upper organic soil layer are the most important in the model s behaviour fig 7a and 7d however this is not particularly surprising as this layer has the lowest thermal conductivity nevertheless finding this expected behaviour is reassuring of a reasonable process representation by the model this analysis also showed that mean differences between observed soil temperature and simulations fig 7b and 7e are not very sensitive to parameter selection with the largest uncertainty in the relatively warmer and deeper active layer found at the windy pass site fig 5 therefore although there is uncertainty in parameter selection it was shown that it does not significantly impact ground thaw simulations demonstrating the robustness of the model when using a realistic set of physical parameters this study investigated the effect of different modelling decisions associated with changing the complexity of some parameterizations on the model s performance the two layer energy and mass balance model snobal marks et al 1998 was replaced with a degree day approach that has been used in previous arctic hydrological studies hinzman and kane 1992 kane et al 1997 and persists in many hydrological models though more recent modelling applications in the arctic have moved toward energy balance type of models e g krogh et al 2017 zhang et al 2000 also the representation of ground surface temperature by the rcc approach williams et al 2015 was replaced by the empirical n factor woo et al 2007 this analysis revealed the importance of pursuing more physically based approaches to represent arctic sub surface hydrology as this showed a significantly improved performance without calibration however if no other alternative is feasible empirical approaches like the n factor may still provide reasonable estimates when their parameters are well calibrated or constrained using non calibrated empirically based approaches significantly deteriorated the performance of the hydrological model swe was largely underestimated at both study sites and during each water year impacting the representation of other processes such as ground thaw fig 8 the impact of changing the representation of ground surface temperature had a significant effect on ground thaw reducing the alt by 10 and 15 cm at rio roca and by 35 to 40 cm at windy pass such changes in the representation of the alt can have significant runoff and subsurface storage effects at the hillslope to basin scale woo 2012 this also influences the depth of the subsurface water table which in turn impact the effective subsurface hydraulic conductivity subsurface flow and connectivity connon et al 2014 quinton and carey 2008 quinton and gray 2003 this study examined three scenarios of increasing mean air temperature by 2 4 and 6 c which are expected to represent conservative significant and severe warming projections warming projections by the end of the century for the canadian arctic under the rcp8 5 scenario riahi et al 2011 by li et al 2019 show that northwestern canada is projected to warm up to 10 c in the winter and up to 4 c in the summer air temperature projections from li et al 2019 for the region encompassing the rio roca and windy pass sites are not as severe as others in northwestern canada but are still very significant with increases in winter air temperature of about 5 6 c within the range of the sensitivity analysis the impact of the three warming scenarios on the snowpack at rio roca and windy pass showed decreasing peak snow accumulation shortening of the snowcovered season and earlier date of the snow depletion with great interannual variability fig 9 these changes are explained by shifting snowfall to rainfall and a warmer snowpack more susceptible to melt which other studies have shown for other sites in the region krogh and pomeroy 2019 rasouli et al 2019 changes to the alt go from roughly 17 cm or 18 at rio roca up 61 cm or 48 at windy pass for the moderate 2 c and severe 6 c warming scenarios respectively changes to the duration of the ground thaw season also showed a significant increase up to one to two months for the severe 6 c warming scenario whereas for the moderate scenario 2 c it increased between one to four weeks with the colder rio roca site showing the largest changes changes to the alt under changing climate scenarios have been previously studied for other sites in the region park et al 2015 studied the impact that changing precipitation and thus the snowpack extent and depth at the pan arctic scale using a process based land surface model they found that the alt was the most sensitive to changes in autumn snowpack conditions with larger early season snowpacks having the deeper next season alt due to the isolation effect of the snowpack to the cold winter temperatures similarly to park et al 2015 we show that the snowpack has a significant impact on the development of the alt however we relate it to the peak snow accumulation we found that shallower end of the winter snowpacks that fully ablate earlier in the season allow for an earlier initiation of ground thaw and thus deeper alts fig 9 this highlights the importance of accurately simulating snowpack processes to properly capture permafrost dynamics woo et al 2007 investigated changes to the alt at several sites with different soil cover and two climate scenarios a2 and b2 and found that for the most severe scenario a2 increases to the alt were around 30 cm by the end of the century for the sites covered by a thin layer of peat 20 cm and about 10 cm thicker for the sites with a thick 1 m peat cover both within the range of expected sensitivity presented in this study fig 9 krogh and pomeroy 2019 used the crhm ahm and climate projections by li et al 2019 about 6 c increase in mean annual air temperature at a basin near inuvik nwt they found average increases to alt of 25 cm and a thawing season extended by about three weeks by the end of the century which are within the range of changes found in this study results from the air temperature sensitivity analysis are likely to be representative of other relatively flat arctic basins with a similar soil layer configuration however they might vary significantly in steeper places or places with deeper snowpacks 6 conclusions this study demonstrated that a robust and yet computationally inexpensive algorithm to represent active layer development in regions underlain by continuous permafrost can be successfully coupled to a physically based hydrological model for cold regions providing reasonable estimates at two relatively level tundra sites in northwestern canada although differences in simulating the end of the snow ablation up to six days and the active layer development up to 15 cm were found these are considered reasonable for hydrological applications supporting the transferability of them model to other arctic regions the sensitivity analysis of key soil thermal properties and porosity demonstrated the robust representation of ground thaw where results did not significantly change when using a realistic range for the physical parameters supporting the model s implementation in places with little soil information the modelling decision analysis revealed that implementing non calibrated empirically based algorithms using available regional information to represent snowpack dynamics and ground surface temperature resulted in a significant deterioration of the model s performance this supports the fact that the arctic and more generally cold regions hydrology would benefit from more physically based algorithms to produce more realistic hydrological simulations at least at the scale of the presented analysis this appears to be particularly true in remote poorly monitored regions where empirically based algorithms are more prone to failure due to lack of data for calibration and incomplete coupling of mass and energy budgets the air temperature sensitivity analysis showed substantial increases in active layer thickness declining snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt with increasing air temperature which can help informing policy makers in the region as climate change

4237,to predict future hydrological cycling in permafrost dominated regions requires consideration of complex hydrological interactions that involve cryospheric states and fluxes and hence thermodynamics this challenges many hydrological models particularly those applied in the arctic this study presents the implementation and validation of set of algorithms representing permafrost and frozen ground dynamics coupled into a physically based modular cold regions hydrological model at two tundra sites in northern yukon territory canada hydrological processes represented in the model include evapotranspiration soil moisture dynamics flow through organic and mineral terrain ground freeze thaw infiltration to frozen and unfrozen soils snowpack energy balance and the accumulation wind redistribution sublimation and canopy interception of snow the model was able to successfully represent observed ground surface temperature ground thaw and snow accumulation at the two sites without calibration a sensitivity analysis of simulated ground thaw revealed that the soil properties of the upper organic layer dominated the model response however its performance was robust for a range of realistic physical parameters different modelling decisions were assessed by removing the physically based algorithms for snowpack dynamics and ground surface temperature and replacing them with empirical approaches results demonstrate that more physically based approaches should be pursued to reduce uncertainties in poorly monitored environments finally the model was driven by three climate warming scenarios to assess the sensitivity of snow redistribution and ablation processes and ground thaw to warming temperatures this showed great sensitivity of snow regime and soil thaw to warming even in the cold continental climate of the northwestern canadian arctic the results are pertinent to transportation infrastructure and water management in this remote cold sparsely gauged region where traditional approaches to hydrological prediction are not possible keywords permafrost hydrology arctic cold regions hydrological modelling model uncertainty 1 introduction the warming arctic is undergoing several environmental changes such as shrub expansion and densification lantz et al 2013 myers smith et al 2018 sturm et al 2001 permafrost thaw payette 2004 and declines in terrestrial water storage suzuki et al 2018 permafrost thaw has been shown to be critical for hydrological connectivity supra and super permafrost groundwater exchange hydraulic conductivity and subsurface runoff and storage walvoord and kurylyk 2016 carbon dioxide and methane release herndon 2018 knoblauch et al 2018 changes in landscape liljedahl et al 2016 myers smith et al 2008 and infrastructure such as building foundations and roadbed stability therefore a better understanding of and ability to predict permafrost thaw and its hydrological consequences are needed in the context of climate and vegetation change simulating the ground freeze and thaw regime represents a great challenge as it is the result of complex interactions between processes representing the energy and mass exchanges amongst atmosphere land snowpack and subsurface kane et al 1991 park et al 2015 woo 2012 yamazaki 2001 zhao et al 1997 numerical methods representing the heat transfer equation including heat conduction latent heat and convective heat exchange coupled with subsurface flow have been shown to properly simulate ground freeze and thaw using detailed ground information and forcing data kurylyk and watanabe 2013 models like the advance terrestrial simulator ats atchley et al 2015 jan et al 2020 jan et al 2018 painter et al 2016 sutra ice mckenzie et al 2007 and geotop endrizzi et al 2014 have been extensively tested demonstrating their ability to represent the hydrological and thermal regime of the arctic however their main disadvantage is that they are data intensive and computationally expensive which may preclude their implementation in regions of the arctic that are not heavily monitored or when needed to be applied at large scales for hydrological applications conversely there are simplified empirical representations for the active layer thickness based on empirical equations e g degree day which have been used for hydrological modelling in cold regions kane et al 1997 schramm et al 2007 zhang et al 2000 the main disadvantage of these approaches is that they are not reliable under conditions different from which they were developed sivapalan 2003 limiting their implementation in remote and ungauged or poorly gauged regions and for climate change impact studies for which more physically based approaches should be pursued instead pomeroy et al 2013 therefore models of more intermediate complexities that can reliably represent ground freeze and thaw among other critical arctic and subarctic processes and can be relatively easily implemented in hydrological models are needed to allow multiple model realizations and assess model uncertainty and sensitivity in the context of models of intermediate complexity stefan s equation juminikis 1977 p 205 is a commonly used and relatively simple one directional model that estimates ground freeze and thaw in homogeneous soils which considers the latent heat of fusion and neglects the soil volumetric heat capacity and convective heat exchange modified versions of stefan s equation have been developed to be implemented in multilayered soils fox 1992 hayashi et al 2007 woo et al 2004 yi et al 2006 another modified version of stefan s equation developed by xie and gough 2013 referred as the xg algorithm differs from previous approaches as it does not require averaging of soil parameters for multilayered soils and is independent of the number and thickness of soil layers algorithms based on stefan s equation require ground surface temperature estimation as the upper boundary condition measuring this variable is not common and even if it is measured at a point spatially distributed estimations are required for hydrological models simulation of ground surface temperature has been typically approached by implementing a ratio between ground surface temperature to air temperature referred as the n factor woo 2012 p 56 which is commonly assumed to be constant main issues associated to the use of the n factor are its empirical basis and that it varies spatially klene et al 2001 and temporally woo et al 2007 williams et al 2015 presented a novel approach to estimate ground surface temperature based on air temperature net radiation and ground thaw depth referred as the radiative conductive convective rcc approach the rcc approach showed good performance at three research basins in northern canada and it proved to have a superior performance over the empirical n factor both the xg algorithm and the rcc approach were incorporated in the cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 and they are part of the arctic hydrology model ahm developed by krogh et al 2017 using crhm and applied by krogh and pomeroy 2019 krogh and pomeroy 2018 to investigate historical and future hydrological changes in an arctic basin under transient climate and vegetation this study investigates the incorporation of the xg algorithm and rcc approach into the crhm ahm using detailed ground observations and demonstrates why more physically based models of intermediate complexity should be pursued instead of empirical approaches particularly in cold remote and poorly monitored regions as a secondary goal the sensitivity of the model to changes in the soil thermal properties and porosity is also examined for model transferability and climate change studies finally three warming air temperature scenarios are assessed to investigate the vulnerability of this region to projected changes in air temperature to pursue these goals the model is applied at a site scale to two well instrumented tundra research sites in northern yukon territory canada for which measurements of soil temperature ground surface temperature snowpack and meteorological variables are available 2 study sites and data the two sites selected for this study in northern yukon territory canada fig 1 are rio roca 66 50 1 0 n 136 20 0 0 w and windy pass 65 4 0 8 n 138 14 46 1 w these sites were selected as they represent the sparsely wooded tundra drainage basins of the region have good access from the only road in northern yukon the dempster highway are relatively sheltered from wind and bridge the gap between existing weather stations along the dempster highway corridor the elevation at windy pass is 1 030 m a s l in a terrain with a mild slope estimated at 5 and surrounded by shrubs moss and scattered spruce the soil profile at windy pass is characterized by an upper partially decomposed organic layer 23 cm thick followed by a denser organic matter layer 15 cm thick underlain by mineral soil fig 2 a the elevation at rio roca is 660 m a s l with a ground surface slope estimated at 4 is surrounded by scattered shrubs and spruce and with moss lichen and grass on the ground the soil profile at rio roca is characterized by an upper partially decomposed organic layer 18 cm thick followed by a denser and organic matter layer of at least 63 cm thickness at which point continuous ice rich permafrost was reached and further subsoil investigations were not possible fig 2b according to the brown et al 2002 permafrost classification shown in fig 1 both sites are underlain by continuous permafrost with low ice content 10 however we found that that was not case for the rio roca site fig 2b both stations were equipped with sensors to measure the following variables precipitation air temperature relative humidity incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation wind direction and speed snow depth soil heat flux soil moisture and temperature four depths ground surface temperature and snow temperature the sensors models manufacturers and height depths are detailed in table 1 the data was recorded using a cr1000 datalogger from campbell scientific canada ltd and the frequency of measurements was every 30 min for all variables except for soil moisture and temperature which were measured every 6 h 2 1 observed hydrometeorological conditions 2 1 1 rio roca continuous records are available from september 2014 until june 2016 when this site was damaged by a bear therefore only one ground thaw season 2015 and two winter seasons 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 are available fig 3 a presents mean monthly precipitation and mean daily temperature for the observed period precipitation was corrected for the effect of wind undercatch typically found for snowfall in cold windy and dry environments goodison et al 1998 using the empirical relationship between wind speed and undercatch developed by smith 2008 mean annual precipitation was 439 mm for which the maximum monthly precipitation occurred in august at 111 mm mean summer precipitation june to august was 205 mm or 47 of the mean annual precipitation whereas winter precipitation october to april accounted for 165 mm or 38 of the mean annual precipitation mean annual air temperature at rio roca was 4 1 c and the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures were 25 5 and 36 3 c respectively with an average 0 c season of 150 days from april 25 to september 22 wind speed was relatively mild with most events below 4 m s 1 however some isolated event reached up top 10 m s 1 fig 3b presents mean daily soil temperature at four depths showing the duration of ground thawing and freezing seasons table a1 note that ground temperature at all depths go well below 0 c supporting the presence of continuous permafrost as shown by the brown et al 2002 classification shown in fig 1 2 1 2 windy pass continuous weather and soil data is available from september 2014 to june 2017 including two summers 2015 and 2016 and three winters 2014 2015 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 fig 3c presents mean monthly precipitation and mean daily air temperature precipitation was also corrected for the effect of wind undercatch using the expression from smith 2008 corrected mean annual precipitation was 407 mm slightly drier than rio roca with a maximum in august at 104 mm and a total summer precipitation of 243 mm or 60 of the mean annual precipitation winter precipitation october to april was 107 mm or 26 of the mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature was 4 4 c colder than rio roca and the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures were 25 0 and 42 1 c respectively with an average 0 c season of 148 days from april 28 to september 23 winds were relatively mild and typically below 2 m s 1 but reached up to 8 m s 1 fig 3d presents mean daily soil temperature at four depths showing the duration of the thawing season which was shorter in 2015 than in 2016 table a2 presents a summary with the initiation duration and end of ground thawing and freezing for the two water years in general the deeper into the ground the longer the thawing season is at windy pass which is the opposite of the colder rio roca site 3 hydrological model site scale application the arctic hydrology model ahm krogh et al 2017 developed using the cold regions hydrological model platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2016 was used to simulate surface and subsurface mass and energy interactions at windy pass and rio roca the crhm ahm model is a physically based and semi distributed hydrological model that uses hydrological response units to compute the energy and mass balance when run at a site scale as in this application the model is composed of a single hydrological response unit that represent the scale of the site where hydrological and atmospheric observations are taken and thus it lacks a streamflow routing routine hydrological processes represented in this application include snow albedo decay precipitation phase sublimation evaporation from canopy intercepted snowfall rainfall snowpack mass and energy balance snow redistribution and sublimation by wind ground freeze and thaw evaporation and transpiration surface and subsurface flow and storage runoff detention flow through organic terrain and snowpack and infiltration into frozen and unfrozen soils a brief description with the key characteristics of each module representing the hydrological processes are presented in table a3 however a more detailed description can be found in krogh et al 2017 for a basin scale application most algorithms used to represent these hydrological processes have a strong physical basis allowing confidence in the model and parameter transferability between sites with similar conditions the crhm ahm requires hourly input forcing data consisting of precipitation air temperature relative humidity wind speed and shortwave irradiance longwave irradiance was estimated in the model using the method presented by sicart et al 2006 as a fine scale implementation of the crhm ahm model to fairly flat sites this application did not allow horizontal inputs of liquid water fluxes such as surface and subsurface flow though water can flow out and blowing snow can also be transferred horizontally through wind redistribution the majority of the parameters used in this study are presented and discussed by krogh et al 2017 which were taken from detailed process studies in the region or in places with similar hydrological conditions however parameters describing local characteristics such as elevation aspect slope vegetation and soil profile are specific to each site and derived from local measurements the interactions between subsurface physical processes within crhm ahm are shown in the fig 4 of krogh et al 2017 which is the same model structure as used here to simulate the seasonal thawing and freezing of the ground the crhm ahm model uses the xg algorithm xie and gough 2013 which is a simplified solution for stefan s equation that allows multi layered soil with non uniform soil properties this method only considers the latent heat of fusion and neglects the volumetric heat capacity of the soil associated with sensible heat fluxes and heat advection and thus it assumes a uniform temperature profile at the freezing point 0 c below the thawing front the xg algorithm simulates a freezing thawing front from the ground surface downward based on a surface freeze thaw index degree day and assumes a linear temperature profile within soil layers as such it requires estimates of ground surface temperature to provide the upper boundary condition to the model the ground surface temperature is estimated using the rcc approach williams et al 2015 the soil profile configuration used here consists of 20 soil layers which represent the upper most three meters of the ground records of soil temperature show that below 1 5 m the soil does not thaw and thus a three meter ground layer is sufficient to represent the seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer the top 10 layers are 0 1 m thick and the lower 10 layers are 0 2 m thick the top 4 layers in the windy pass model represent the top organic soil and the lower 16 layers represent the mineral soil fig 2a the rio roca model has a thicker organic layer represented by the top 8 layers in the model and the mineral soil represented by the remaining 12 layers fig 2b the thermal properties and porosities used in the organic and mineral soil layers are based on reference values presented by woo 2012 for the organic soil layer the porosity dry thermal conductivity saturated unfrozen thermal conductivity saturated frozen thermal conductivity was set to 0 8 0 1 w m 1 k 1 1 0 w m 1 k 1 and 1 9 w m 1 k 1 respectively whereas the same parameters for the mineral soil layer were set to 0 4 0 25 w m 1 k 1 2 5 w m 1 k 1 and 1 9 w m 1 k 1 respectively the crhm ahm model uses the relationships from johansen 1975 p 221 to calculate the thermal conductivity of non saturated soils based on the degree of saturation of the soil and saturated thermal conductivity 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis to quantify the uncertainty on simulated ground thaw associated with the typically most uncertain subsurface parameter a sensitivity analysis for a range of possible and documented values was performed the six parameters included in the sensitivity analysis and their range were the dry thermal conductivity ranging between 0 06 0 15 and 0 2 0 3 w m 1 k 1 for the organic and soil layers respectively unfrozen saturated thermal conductivity ranging between 0 25 0 75 and 2 0 3 0 w m 1 k 1 for organic and soil layers respectively and porosity ranging between 0 7 0 9 and 0 3 0 5 for organic and soil layers respectively we used the global sensitivity analysis developed by razavi and gupta 2016 referred as vars variogram analysis of response surfaces in particular the star var implementation was used this method accounts for the spatial ordered structure of the model response across the parameter range which is typically neglected in other methods razavi et al 2019 this implementation requires a number of stars to determine how many model iterations to be performed here 15 stars and a resolution of sampling h 0 1 recommended value by razavi et al 2019 were used resulting in 825 model iterations to quantify the global sensitivity of the model we used the integrated variogram analysis between the 0 and 50 of the parameter range typically referred as ivars50 the objective function to measure the sensitivity of the model is based on the mean bias between observed and simulated ground thaw at four depths 3 2 modelling decision analysis a model experiment was run using model configurations with different levels of complexities to evaluate the importance of pursuing more physically based approaches to represent key physical processes in arctic environments this took advantage of crhm s flexible modular structure to swap and replace physically based modules with empirical ones whilst leaving the rest of the model unchanged here the crhm ahm was modified by switching the representation of snow accumulation sublimation and melt and ground surface temperature as described below model configuration 1 mc1 as opposed to using the two layer mass and energy balance model snobal marks et al 1998 normally used in crhm which includes a calculation of sublimation losses as well as snowpack energetics a conventional degree day melt model was used in which snowmelt is simulated as an empirical relationship with air temperature that is represented by a degree day coefficient typically this coefficient needs to be calibrated however here it is assumed that no local calibration data is available which is a reasonable assumption in most arctic and subarctic regions the most reasonable estimation for the degree day coefficient for northwestern north america is from kane et al 1997 who calibrated this coefficient for an arctic basin in adjacent northern alaska over a six year period the degree day coefficient from kane et al 1997 that produced the best fit over the six year period was 2 7 mm d 1 c 1 which is the value that is used here no attempt was made to improve the performance of this model by for example including a radiation component through more empirical coefficients such as the one presented by kustas et al 1994 to minimize the sources of uncertainties in the experiment model configuration 2 mc2 the algorithm normally used in crhm to estimate ground surface temperature was changed the rcc approach williams et al 2015 was replaced with a temperature index approach n factor in which ground surface temperature was calculated as a relationship with air temperature the temperature index was the empirical relationship presented by woo et al 2007 which was developed using 30 years of observed data in northwestern canada this relationship requires three empirical coefficients b c and s as well as the depth of ground thaw as follows 1 t g t a b c e x p s p where tg and ta are the ground surface and air temperature c respectively and p is the depth of ground thaw m the values presented by woo et al 2007 for the louisy point a tundra site with organic terrain in the mackenzie delta of the adjacent northwest territories were used due to their similarly with the conditions found at rio roca and windy pass their values are b 0 5 c 0 54 and s 0 05 model configuration 3 mc3 in this experiment mc1 and mc2 were combined meaning that the degree day model was used to calculate snowmelt and the n factor was used for the ground surface temperature 3 3 air temperature sensitivity the last analysis investigates the effect of climate warming on snow accumulation and melt and ground thaw these variables are key in cold regions environments controlling subsurface flow rates runoff volume and energy exchange with the atmosphere three warming scenarios that increase the mean annual air temperature by 2 4 and 6 c were implemented representing scenarios of moderate significant and severe climate warming these scenarios can be implemented using a climate change feature of crhm that holds relative humidity constant but allows vapour pressure to vary 4 results 4 1 model validation 4 1 1 snow water equivalent fig 4 presents a comparison between simulated snow water equivalent swe against two snow surveys for water years 2014 and 2015 at the rio roca and windy pass site fig 4a and 4b respectively both snow surveys were performed in late march during the accumulation season and about a month before the date of peak swe early may the snow survey consisted of an approximately 25 m transect across each study site where swe samples were taken every 5 m mean and standard deviations of swe are presented to show the degree of variability that can be found similar performance was found at both sites the mean biases for the rio roca site were 30 and 24 mm for the water years 2014 and 2015 respectively whereas at the windy pass site biases were 29 and 30 mm respectively despite the underestimation at both sites simulated swe was within the observed swe standard deviation observed swe standard deviations suggests a relatively large spatial variability along the snow transect both sites due to small topographic and vegetation variations producing wind redistribution and trapping variations at scales smaller than can be modelled by the blowing snow algorithm in crhm overall the model simulations underestimated observed swe which may be due to uncertainty in the wind undercatch correction used smith 2008 model error e g calculation of blowing snow or turbulent fluxes or biophysical and wind exposure differences between the instrument site and the snow survey transect continuous snow depth observations by the ultrasonic depth sensor at windy pass allows evaluation of the timing of the end of snow ablation fig 4c the observed dates for the end of snow ablation for the years 2015 2016 and 2017 were may 19 may 14 and may 9 respectively whereas simulations were may 19 may 11 and may 15 this shows that the model simulated a 3 day earlier and 6 days later end of snow ablation period for the years 2016 and 2017 respectively but captured the exact day in 2015 this is particularly important as the end of the snow ablation triggers the initiation of ground thaw unfortunately for the rio roca site records from the ultrasonic sensor were particularly noisy precluding an accurate identification of the end of snow ablation date 4 1 2 ground thaw and ground surface temperature fig 5 presents a comparison between observed ground surface daily temperature at 1 cm depth and simulations for the snow free period of 2015 and 2016 for windy pass fig 5a and b and 2015 for rio roca fig 5c the model represents ground surface temperature well at both sites with a slightly better performance at windy pass mean bias ranges from 0 5 and 0 4 c at windy pass and 0 04 c at rio roca correlation coefficient ranges from 0 95 at windy pass to 0 88 at rio roca and the root mean square error ranges from 1 4 c at windy pass to 2 2 c at rio roca a slightly later one week initiation of ground surface thaw was simulated at rio roca overall this analysis demonstrates the capability of the non calibrated rcc model williams et al 2015 to simulate daily ground surface temperature at rio roca and windy pass fig 6 shows simulated versus observed ground thaw for the years 2015 and 2016 at windy pass and 2015 at rio roca observed ground thaw was calculated by identifying the date and depth at which the soil temperature reached 0 c using the four soil temperature sensors at windy pass and during the thawing season of 2015 the model underestimated ground thaw by 10 13 23 and 15 cm at 10 23 51 and 91 cm deep respectively resulting in a mean bias of 15 cm during the 2016 thawing season the model also underestimated observations by 10 2 7 and 3 cm at 10 23 51 and 91 cm deep respectively resulting in a mean bias of 6 cm at rio roca a better agreement was found with differences of 10 0 02 0 0 and 9 cm at 10 30 51 and 76 cm depths respectively resulting in a mean bias of 5 cm the initiation of ground thaw was 5 days late and likely due to late snow ablation in the model overall the model slightly underestimated ground thaw by 15 and 5 cm which is sometimes explained by a later than observer initiation of thawing season but also likely due to model errors however this is an overall good model performance considering the lack of calibration to represent ground thaw 4 2 ground thaw sensitivity to soil parameters fig 7 presents the results of sensitivity analyses for the rio roca and windy pass models upper panels show the ratio of factor sensitivity using the ivars50 metric as recommended by razavi and gupta 2016 in both cases the parameter that had the greatest impact on the model i e the largest ratio of factor sensitivity fig 7a and d was the dry thermal conductivity of the organic soil layer p3 followed by the porosity of the organic layer p1 uncertainties in simulating ground thaw at both sites was estimated using the same 825 parameter scenarios generated with vars at rio roca fig 7b little uncertainty associated with the soil parameters was found with an active layer thickness alt that varied between 0 93 and 1 m at windy pass fig 7e alt varied between 1 17 and 1 42 m for the year 2015 and between 1 31 and 1 58 m for the year 2016 revealing that the simulated alt at windy pass is more sensitive to the selection of parameters particularly those associated with the upper organic soil layer this can be explained by the warmer and longer thawing season found at windy pass fig 6 allowing a larger variability by the end of the season histograms of simulations mean bias show that at windy pass fig 7f parameter uncertainty alone does not completely explain the model underestimation of ground thaw as for all the scenarios the mean bias was always at least 6 cm at rio roca fig 7c some simulations showed a mean bias of 3 cm suggesting that with a different combination of realistic parameters the model bias can be further reduced to smaller values 4 3 impact of modelling decisions fig 8 shows simulated swe and ground thaw at the rio roca and windy pass site for the three model configuration experiments and the control run which is the model configuration using the most physically based approaches i e the crhm ahm swe analysis shows a significant deterioration of simulations of snow accumulation for all years and sites under the mc1 and mc3 i e degree day for snowmelt increasing substantially the error in simulating observed swe the model performance deterioration is particularly evident at the windy pass site were not only observed swe is largely underestimated but also snow seems to be completely depleted in the middle of the 2015 2016 winter which is highly unlike in such a cold environment demonstrating the strong need for calibration for the empirical snow model swe in the mc2 shows the same performance as the control run which is expected as the n factor for calculating ground surface temperature does not play a role in representing snow accumulation and melt ground thaw simulations also show a significant deterioration of the model s performance when using the n factor method i e mc2 and mc3 to estimate ground surface temperature in both mc2 and mc3 ground thaw rates are significantly underestimated producing an alt about 10 to 15 cm below that of the control run at rio roca which already showed an underestimation of the mean ground thaw conditions at windy pass alt difference between mc2 and mc3 with the control run is even larger and between 35 and 40 cm in 2015 and between 43 and 50 cm in 2016 this analysis showed that re calibrating the n factor is needed to better simulate ground thaw at these two sites it is also interesting to note the difference between the mc1 degree day and the control run as there are two key differences introduced by misrepresenting snow accumulation and melt the first is the snowcover depletion date which controls the initiation of ground thaw and the second is the amount of water that infiltrates the soil which has a significant impact on the thermal conductivity with wetter thawed soils having a larger thermal conductivity and thus higher thawing rates differences in representing ground surface temperature are presented in table 2 at both sites the mc1 and mc3 showed the worst performance in both correlations and mean bias when compared with observed ground surface temperature note that using a more physically based approach to simulate both ground surface temperature and ground thaw is not enough to properly represent ground surface temperature as the impact of misrepresenting snow accumulation and melt i e mc1 degree day on ground thaw is also significant due to its impact on ground thaw initiation and rates interestingly mc2 i e n factor has a high correlation even higher than that of the control run at rio roca however its mean bias is the largest of all scenarios at 2 35 and 3 75 c in rio roca and windy pass respectively this suggests that the regionally calibrated n factor is not suitable to representing ground surface temperature locally 4 4 climate warming analysis average changes to peak swe for the two winter seasons at rio roca are 31 40 and 56 mm for the 2 4 and 6 c scenario respectively fig 9 at windy pass average changes are 4 21 and 45 mm for the 2 4 and 6 c respectively with significant interannual variability during warmer winters like the 2015 2016 the snowpack is more sensitive to increases in temperature producing mid winter melt events as shown for windy pass warmer snowpack or precipitation phase may shift from snowfall to rainfall reducing snow accumulation this is particularly important at the beginning and end of the accumulation season and can provide extra energy to melt the snowpack pomeroy et al 2016 not only peak swe changed considerably after warming advances in the date of peak swe and the end of snow depletion were also found table a5 for example the date of peak swe at rio roca for the 2014 2015 winter shifted earlier by about two to three weeks whereas it changed little for the 2015 2016 winter changes to the snowpack not only impact the amount of water available for spring and summer runoff but also change the date of the ground thaw initiation as discussed in previous sections significant changes to ground thaw were found under the warming scenarios for the 2 c scenario at rio roca alt increased 17 cm or 18 whereas for the 6 c scenario it increased up to 50 cm or 53 ground thaw initiation advanced between one to three weeks as temperatures increase at rio roca increasing the duration of the thawing seasons for about one to two months for the 2 and 6 c scenarios respectively table a4 more severe changes to alt were found at the windy pass site table a5 particularly during the 2015 summer with a 26 cm or 20 increase in the 2 c scenario and a 61 cm or 48 increase in the 6 c scenario changes to the end of the ground thaw season at windy pass are not as severe as those found at rio roca with the only significant changes found for the 4 and 6 c scenarios by about a week during the 2016 summer the duration of the thawing season at windy pass increased by 40 and 25 days for the 2015 and 2016 summer and the 6 c scenario overall results associated to changes to ground thaw showed that alt at windy pass is more sensitive to increasing temperature which is likely due to the generally longer thawing season than at rio roca however the initiation end and duration of the thawing season are more sensitive at the rio roca site 5 discussion the site scale application of the crhm ahm model successfully represented daily ground surface temperature at the two sites fig 5 demonstrating the capacity of the rcc model to be successfully transferred and applied to different conditions without calibration ground surface temperature is a critical state variable in the model as it is used as the upper boundary condition to the module simulating ground thaw and it is typically used for that purpose by other models as well hayashi et al 2007 kurylyk et al 2014 woo et al 2007 the model slightly underestimated ground thaw at both sites fig 6 model underestimation of ground thaw could be due to late simulations of the initiation of ground thaw which is controlled partially by the end of the snow ablation and meteorological inputs simulated end of snow ablation at windy pass was three days earlier in 2015 and six days later in 2016 therefore the later snow disappearance in 2016 can partially explain for the underestimation of ground thaw during 2016 but not during the 2015 thawing season differences between simulated and observed snow depth at windy pass may be due to several factors including the lack of representation of blowing snow redistribution over complex terrain by the site scale crhm ahm model as the model implementation uses a single hydrological response unit it neglects any spatial heterogeneity in the terrain that may also explain for differences in the snowpack and ground thaw between simulations and observations unfortunately measured snow depth at rio roca was too noisy to extract a reasonable estimation for the end of the snow ablation another reason to explain the underestimation of ground thaw is an underestimation of the saturated thermal conductivity which in combination with the degree of saturation of the soil define the unsaturated thermal conductivity this application of the crhm ahm model does not represent inputs of lateral subsurface flow but it allows outflows which may impact the accurate representation of the subsurface water storage in either case the average underestimation of ground thaw is considered small for hydrological applications particularly when parameters from the literature are being used as opposed to measured or locally calibrated values this is an important finding as hydrological models of headwater basins in the arctic typically either neglected or used simplified representations of ground thaw i e degree day zhang et al 2000 schramm et al 2007 however the crhm ahm successfully represented the evolution of the active layer using a robust yet computationally inexpensive approach the sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters associated with the upper organic soil layer are the most important in the model s behaviour fig 7a and 7d however this is not particularly surprising as this layer has the lowest thermal conductivity nevertheless finding this expected behaviour is reassuring of a reasonable process representation by the model this analysis also showed that mean differences between observed soil temperature and simulations fig 7b and 7e are not very sensitive to parameter selection with the largest uncertainty in the relatively warmer and deeper active layer found at the windy pass site fig 5 therefore although there is uncertainty in parameter selection it was shown that it does not significantly impact ground thaw simulations demonstrating the robustness of the model when using a realistic set of physical parameters this study investigated the effect of different modelling decisions associated with changing the complexity of some parameterizations on the model s performance the two layer energy and mass balance model snobal marks et al 1998 was replaced with a degree day approach that has been used in previous arctic hydrological studies hinzman and kane 1992 kane et al 1997 and persists in many hydrological models though more recent modelling applications in the arctic have moved toward energy balance type of models e g krogh et al 2017 zhang et al 2000 also the representation of ground surface temperature by the rcc approach williams et al 2015 was replaced by the empirical n factor woo et al 2007 this analysis revealed the importance of pursuing more physically based approaches to represent arctic sub surface hydrology as this showed a significantly improved performance without calibration however if no other alternative is feasible empirical approaches like the n factor may still provide reasonable estimates when their parameters are well calibrated or constrained using non calibrated empirically based approaches significantly deteriorated the performance of the hydrological model swe was largely underestimated at both study sites and during each water year impacting the representation of other processes such as ground thaw fig 8 the impact of changing the representation of ground surface temperature had a significant effect on ground thaw reducing the alt by 10 and 15 cm at rio roca and by 35 to 40 cm at windy pass such changes in the representation of the alt can have significant runoff and subsurface storage effects at the hillslope to basin scale woo 2012 this also influences the depth of the subsurface water table which in turn impact the effective subsurface hydraulic conductivity subsurface flow and connectivity connon et al 2014 quinton and carey 2008 quinton and gray 2003 this study examined three scenarios of increasing mean air temperature by 2 4 and 6 c which are expected to represent conservative significant and severe warming projections warming projections by the end of the century for the canadian arctic under the rcp8 5 scenario riahi et al 2011 by li et al 2019 show that northwestern canada is projected to warm up to 10 c in the winter and up to 4 c in the summer air temperature projections from li et al 2019 for the region encompassing the rio roca and windy pass sites are not as severe as others in northwestern canada but are still very significant with increases in winter air temperature of about 5 6 c within the range of the sensitivity analysis the impact of the three warming scenarios on the snowpack at rio roca and windy pass showed decreasing peak snow accumulation shortening of the snowcovered season and earlier date of the snow depletion with great interannual variability fig 9 these changes are explained by shifting snowfall to rainfall and a warmer snowpack more susceptible to melt which other studies have shown for other sites in the region krogh and pomeroy 2019 rasouli et al 2019 changes to the alt go from roughly 17 cm or 18 at rio roca up 61 cm or 48 at windy pass for the moderate 2 c and severe 6 c warming scenarios respectively changes to the duration of the ground thaw season also showed a significant increase up to one to two months for the severe 6 c warming scenario whereas for the moderate scenario 2 c it increased between one to four weeks with the colder rio roca site showing the largest changes changes to the alt under changing climate scenarios have been previously studied for other sites in the region park et al 2015 studied the impact that changing precipitation and thus the snowpack extent and depth at the pan arctic scale using a process based land surface model they found that the alt was the most sensitive to changes in autumn snowpack conditions with larger early season snowpacks having the deeper next season alt due to the isolation effect of the snowpack to the cold winter temperatures similarly to park et al 2015 we show that the snowpack has a significant impact on the development of the alt however we relate it to the peak snow accumulation we found that shallower end of the winter snowpacks that fully ablate earlier in the season allow for an earlier initiation of ground thaw and thus deeper alts fig 9 this highlights the importance of accurately simulating snowpack processes to properly capture permafrost dynamics woo et al 2007 investigated changes to the alt at several sites with different soil cover and two climate scenarios a2 and b2 and found that for the most severe scenario a2 increases to the alt were around 30 cm by the end of the century for the sites covered by a thin layer of peat 20 cm and about 10 cm thicker for the sites with a thick 1 m peat cover both within the range of expected sensitivity presented in this study fig 9 krogh and pomeroy 2019 used the crhm ahm and climate projections by li et al 2019 about 6 c increase in mean annual air temperature at a basin near inuvik nwt they found average increases to alt of 25 cm and a thawing season extended by about three weeks by the end of the century which are within the range of changes found in this study results from the air temperature sensitivity analysis are likely to be representative of other relatively flat arctic basins with a similar soil layer configuration however they might vary significantly in steeper places or places with deeper snowpacks 6 conclusions this study demonstrated that a robust and yet computationally inexpensive algorithm to represent active layer development in regions underlain by continuous permafrost can be successfully coupled to a physically based hydrological model for cold regions providing reasonable estimates at two relatively level tundra sites in northwestern canada although differences in simulating the end of the snow ablation up to six days and the active layer development up to 15 cm were found these are considered reasonable for hydrological applications supporting the transferability of them model to other arctic regions the sensitivity analysis of key soil thermal properties and porosity demonstrated the robust representation of ground thaw where results did not significantly change when using a realistic range for the physical parameters supporting the model s implementation in places with little soil information the modelling decision analysis revealed that implementing non calibrated empirically based algorithms using available regional information to represent snowpack dynamics and ground surface temperature resulted in a significant deterioration of the model s performance this supports the fact that the arctic and more generally cold regions hydrology would benefit from more physically based algorithms to produce more realistic hydrological simulations at least at the scale of the presented analysis this appears to be particularly true in remote poorly monitored regions where empirically based algorithms are more prone to failure due to lack of data for calibration and incomplete coupling of mass and energy budgets the air temperature sensitivity analysis showed substantial increases in active layer thickness declining snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt with increasing air temperature which can help informing policy makers in the region as climate change

4238,satellite altimetry helps to monitor continental water levels with global coverage and near real time accessibility however a main drawback of satellite altimetry is its low acquisition frequency that hinders the use of altimeters in flood forecasting or reservoir operation processes this study provides a new method to estimate daily river heights from multisource hydro climate satellite products without using ground based data first the approach develops a simple statistical model a seasonal linear model using satellite altimetry land surface temperature lst satellite precipitation and satellite soil moisture products second a monte carlo simulation is used to understand the model accuracy by attributing the model output errors to uncertainties from the multiple satellite products for the first aim the study shows that using high frequency satellite data to improve the temporal resolution of the satellite radar altimetry is better than an approach merging multiple satellite altimetry data with respect to the second objective it is found that higher variances are found in seasonal transition periods where there are significant changes in satellite observations the overall error of the model is attributed to both uncertainties of satellite input data and the interactions among their uncertainties the results demonstrate the capability of using multisource satellite data to predict daily time series of river heights in data poor areas the results also highlight the importance of quantifying uncertainty to increase the reliability of flood forecasting models using satellite products keywords jason 2 satellite altimetry modis land surface temperature gsmap satellite precipitation smos soil moisture uncertainty mekong river 1 introduction flood warning systems provide early warnings which can minimise deaths injuries and reduce the economic effects of flooding pappenberger et al 2008 flood early warnings also provide valuable information for reservoir flood control operations to manage flood risk huang et al 2018 for the last decade the increased reliability of flood forecasting has better information for decision making processes ramos et al 2013 however flood warning systems in large and remote areas or developing countries are often difficult to develop due to the limited access slow distribution of data and the sparse distribution of gauge stations di baldassarre et al 2011 yan et al 2015 alsdorf et al 2016 recently large scale satellite derived data have been widely used to complement ground based data for predictions of hydrological extreme events flood or drought and water resource management bates 2012 yan et al 2015 palmer et al 2015 li et al 2016b di baldassarre and uhlenbrook 2012 satellite data can provide information on topography precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture vegetation dynamics surface water elevations and water surface extents for flood forecasting satellite altimeters are particularly valuable to observe river water levels and provide forecasts of water level in rivers kouraev et al 2004 getirana et al 2009 getirana and peters lidard 2013 frappart et al 2015 tourian et al 2013 tarpanelli et al 2013 paris et al 2016 there are a number of past and current satellite altimetry missions including ers 2 envisat saral altilka topex poseidon t p jason 1 2 3 sentinel 3a 3b cryosat 2 and icesat 1 2 and future mission such as sentinel 6a b and swot in addition to flood forecasting satellite altimeters have been used for a variety applications see table 1s in the supplementary document despite the promise of satellite altimetry data for flood forecasting the low temporal resolution of satellite radar altimetry between 10 and 35 days is a major barrier to its use tarpanelli et al 2017 michailovsky et al 2013 one solution is to integrate satellite altimeter data with in situ data or model results to generate higher frequency data roux et al 2008 biancamaria et al 2011b hossain et al 2014 however this approach is typically limited to areas where in situ data are available for areas without in situ data multiple satellite altimetry can be merged spatially and temporally to improve data frequency crétaux et al 2011 boergens et al 2017 schwatke et al 2015 although the temporal resolution of the combined products is typically still low up to 3 days to address these problems pham et al 2018 developed a method to estimate daily river heights without using any ground based data to infill jason 2 satellite altimetry the method used remotely sensed differences between daytime and night time land surface temperature δlst a seasonal linear model was used to relate δlst to water levels for several locations in the lower mekong river the model was particularly effective for the dry seasons with both cold and hot temperatures but tended to underestimate water levels in the wet season in the dry season the model was also not able to predict high water levels associated with anomalous rainfalls this indicates that the model might be enhanced by including other hydro climate data here we develop an extended model relating δlst and water levels by incorporating satellite precipitation soil moisture data and upstream modelled water levels to improve the predictive skill of the model particularly in high flow events considering multiple satellite products can provide valuable information in terms of input data model calibration model evaluation or to update model forecasts via approaches such as data assimilation however satellite data have inherent uncertainties which introduce errors in the model outputs the uncertainties of satellite data should not be ignored but rather they should be considered to improve the reliability of the predictions maggioni et al 2016 uncertainty assessment shows how the uncertainty of multiple satellite data propagates into the model outputs and provides a better understanding of the overall model accuracy to understand the propagation of these uncertainties into predictions we need to know the uncertainties of the individual input satellite products which is usually difficult to quantify due to a lack of accurate ground based data liu et al 2012 a summary of previous studies addressing uncertainty quantification in multiple satellite data are presented in table 2s in the supplementary material uncertainties in individual satellite products i e satellite based precipitation soil moisture or water level have different effects on different flood prediction models domeneghetti et al 2015 hong et al 2006 wanders et al 2014b it is still not known how a combination of uncertainties in multiple satellite data could affect a flood prediction model or how significant the combination of uncertainties may be under different conditions here we extend the pham et al 2018 model by considering multiple satellite data to improve the accuracy of the prediction and then we assess the effects of the combined uncertainties of the multisource satellite products on the prediction model the study objectives are to i derive daily water levels from multisource hydro climatic satellite datasets and ii assess the propagation of uncertainty from multiple satellite data into the model outputs for the first objective we integrate global satellite mapping precipitation near real time gsmap nrt soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and δlst derived from modis products to generate a new seasonal linear model in addition the modelled water levels at the upstream virtual gauge are incorporated as a lag variable in the new model for the second objective the uncertainty of multiple satellite data is incorporated and a monte carlo framework is used to attribute uncertainty in the model outputs to the uncertainty of multiple satellite data sensitivity analysis is used to estimate the contribution of each satellite to the total variability of predicted water levels answering these objectives will improve the predictive skill of the previous seasonal linear model highlight the role of each satellite to the total ensemble uncertainty and provide probabilistic forecasts of water levels in a data poor region 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the upper reaches of the lower mekong river basin fig 1 which is one of the largest rivers in terms of length and discharge in the world and runs through six countries china myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam mrc 2010a the average river width in the study area is more than 400 m the satellite altimetry jason 2 ground tracks pass 205 and pass 027 intersect the mekong river over china and passes 103 140 and 179 intersect the mekong river over laos cambodia and vietnam fig 1 however in situ data at jing hong gauge in china are not available via the mekong river commission database and the locations of the intersections between jason 2 ground tracks passes 205 027 and the mekong river are too far from their respective gauges more than 160 km therefore we exclude passes 205 and 027 from our study virtual gauges red squares have been designated at the locations where the mekong river blue line intersects the ground tracks of satellite altimetry jason 2 for passes 103 140 and 179 black dashed lines the three gauges green triangles corresponding with these vs 103 vs140 and vs 179 are luang prabang vs 103 nong khai vs 140 and pasksane vs 179 the area around vs 103 is dominated by broad leaved trees whereas the other sites have a mixture of developed area croplands and bare soil mrc 2010b 2 2 data and pre processing multiple satellite products are used in this study to derive daily river heights and information of satellite based data are summarised in table 1 the mekong river commission in situ water levels are collected only to validate the model 2 2 1 satellite altimetry due to its short revisit frequency 10 day and the longest period of observed data 2008 present the jason 2 sensor interim geophysical data record s igdr data have been selected to derive river heights the longer revisit times of alternatives such as envisat and saral 35 days and sentinel 3a 3b 27 days preclude their use more recent missions including saral altika launched in 2013 jason 3 and sentinel 3a launched in 2016 and sentinel 3b launched in 2018 show promise for studies such as this in the future but at present their short periods of record limits their use more technical information about the jason 2 satellite altimetry products are available in dumont et al 2009 the detailed process for deriving water levels from the jason 2 satellite altimetry in the upper reaches of the lower mekong river were presented in pham et al 2018 here we briefly describe the four main steps of the jason 2 data pre processing first we obtain satellite altitude a dry troposphere correction cdry wet troposphere correction cwet solid earth tide csolid tide and pole tides cpole tide from the on board algorithms while the range r is derived from the ice 1 and ionosphere correction cion is obtained from the global ionosphere maps secondly we adopt a semi automated method roux et al 2010 to develop virtual gauges thirdly we compute the surface river heights h at all data points within a virtual gauge using eq 1 1 h a r cdry cwet cion csolid tide cpole tide finally for a specific date we calculate the median of estimated surface river heights at the data points within a virtual gauge to obtain the river water levels at that virtual gauge frappart et al 2005 2 2 2 land surface temperature land surface temperature lst derived from landsat has higher spatial resolution 30 m compared to lst derived from modis 1 km but landsat has lower temporal resolution 16 days in comparison to modis aqua or terra twice per day the main purpose of this study is to estimate daily time series of water level from multisource satellite products hence higher temporal resolution product with more information modis product was selected land surface temperature lst is derived from the modis aqua products because they have more clear cloud data than the terra products we use the daytime 1 30 pm and night time 1 30 am modis aqua daily lst 0 01 version 6 myd11a1 products wan 2016 to obtain δlst there are gaps in the modis observations because the thermal infrared technique in modis does not penetrate clouds wan and li 1997 here we use the passive microwave lst products retrieved from the 0 25 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 with the land parameter retrieval model algorithm lprm amsr2 holmes et al 2009 to fill the gaps the in situ air temperature retrieved from the noaa http www ncdc noaa gov land based station data are used to validate the merged lst from the myd11a1 and the lprm amsr 2 more details of the pre processing and validation of the lst products were presented in pham et al 2018 2 2 3 precipitation our model is designed to be used in ungauged areas and thus uncorrected satellite based precipitation is used rather than rain gauge data or corrected satellite precipitation remotely sensed precipitation can vary in latency spatiotemporal resolution and available period for flood prediction in sparsely and ungauged catchments we need data that has short latency high spatiotemporal resolution and is only derived from satellite sources here we use the global satellite mapping of precipitation near real time gsmap nrt product kubota et al 2007 which satisfies these criteria the gsmap algorithm combines satellite input streams from passive microwave mw and infrared ir sensors to produce high accuracy and high resolution near global precipitation maps ushio et al 2009 the gsmap algorithm is based on attributes derived from the trmm precipitation radar pr and gpm dual precipitation radar dpr there are three gsmap products based on latency and accuracy including a near real time product gsmap nrt a reanalysed product using a moving vector with kalman filter method gsmap mvk and a gauge adjusted product gsmap gau the gsmap nrt product is derived from available microwave imagers land sounders ocean and ir retrievals and has the shortest latency of the three for that reason we use the gsmap nrt 0 1 daily product to provide precipitation estimates to incorporate the effects of catchment wetness and effective rainfall over catchment we convert daily precipitation data into the antecedent precipitation index api eq 2 fedora 1987 this index is commonly used in soil moisture validation and flood inundation crow et al 2010 parinussa et al 2016b crow et al 2012 2 apit pδt k apit δt where apit is the api at time t pδt is a precipitation during δt period and k is a recession coefficient that depends on the land cover and soil properties fedora 1987 and typically ranges from 0 8 to 0 98 hong et al 2007 based on the land cover types and soil types mrc 2010b of the study sites a k value of 0 86 is used for the study 2 2 4 soil moisture surface soil moisture can be obtained from a range of remotely sensed data products such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos soil moisture active and passive smap advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 or advanced scatterometer ascat on board the metop a b although smap provides high accuracy soil moisture data its available data 2015 present is shorter than that of smos 2010 present l band smos has lower noise compared to c band amsr 2 and ascat products montzka et al 2017 to maximise the data availability we use the smos product for soil moisture data the smos satellite was launched in november 2009 carrying the microwave imaging radiometer using aperture synthesis miras instrument to penetrate soil depth to 5 cm and vegetation cover with water content up to 5 kg m2 the smos satellite uses l band 1 413 ghz 21 cm passive radiometer kerr et al 2001 the smos satellite overpasses the equator at 6 00 am solar local time ascending orbit and 6 00 pm solar local time descending orbit kerr et al 2010 this study use daily smos 0 25 daily level 3 products provided by the centre aval de traitement des données catds centre which has 1 3 days temporal resolution daily latency and an accuracy of 0 04 m3 m3 kerr et al 2012 the smos grid closest to each virtual station is used to represent the surface moisture content more details of the smos level 3 products and retrieval algorithm can be found in kerr and jacquette 2013 the study period was from june 2012 to june 2016 to maximise the availability of both satellite based and ground based data due to the low frequency of the jason 2 observations there were around 120 altimeters for the model evaluation at each virtual station in addition approximately 1449 in situ river height measurements were used to validate the model at each station 3 methodology the methodology includes three main sections i model development and model evaluation ii uncertainty assessment and iii attributing uncertainty to inputs fig 2 section 3 1 presents model development using multisource satellite products gsmap modis smos and predicted water level at upstream virtual station associated with 10 day jason 2 observations the predictive skill of model was evaluated by 5 fold cross validation and compared to in situ water level 90 prediction interval was also calculated to estimate the reliability of model prediction in section 3 2 the propagation of uncertainty from multiple satellite products into the modeled water level was assessed using monte carlo simulation finally the contribution of each satellite and their interactions to total variability of the model outputs was investigated using sensitivity analysis in section 3 3 3 1 daily river heights derived from multisource satellite data pham et al 2018 developed four mathematical models to evaluate the appropriate model structure for using δlst and jason 2 altimeters to estimate daily river heights at three different virtual gauges in the mekong river they demonstrated that the linear model incorporating seasonal patterns outperformed the other models as discussed previously the model had lower skill in the wet season and during anomalous rainfall periods in the dry seasons to improve the predictive skill of this model here we integrated other hydro climate variables and the modelled river heights at the upstream virtual gauge as a lag variable to develop a new model eq 3 3 y b 0 j b j x j j 1 3 where y is the predicted river height j indicates the three classified seasons boj is a scalar of the intercept b j is a vector of the coefficients of the model b j b 1 b k j and x j is a matrix with each column representing one of the predictor variables x j x 1 x k j where k indicates number of predictor variables due to the differences in the accuracy of the satellite based lst and soil moisture at locations with different land cover the proposed model was implemented separately at each virtual gauge vs 103 is the most upstream virtual gauge the vs 103 is dominated by broadleaf forest which leads to poor quality smos data in this area evidenced by the low correlation between smos soil moisture and altimeters 0 19 we therefore excluded soil moisture data from the model for vs 103 leading to a model with two variables api and δlst the predictions at the two downstream stations vs 140 and vs 179 can be improved by including upstream water level information we thus incorporated time lagged modelled water level from the upstream virtual gauge in the seasonal linear model as another predictor variable the time lag between two virtual gauges was estimated by maximising the cross correlation between the time series of jason 2 river heights derived at these stations the time lag between vs 103 and vs 140 was found to be three days and one day between vs 140 and the vs 179 thus x j in eq 3 at vs 140 and vs 179 has four variables including api δlst soil moisture sm and the lagged modelled water levels at upstream virtual gauge uswl to select the most parsimonious model with good skill we used stepwise regression to select the optimum subset of independent variables backward selection was used to remove non significant variables from the full initial model at each step the p value of the f statistic is estimated to test models with and without a potential variable if any variables have p values greater than the set threshold p remove the variable with the largest p value is removed from the model this process continues until no more non significant variables are included in the model here an optimisation with objective function of minimising root mean squared error rmse was used and the threshold for the predictor selection was p remove 0 2 the predicted river heights were compared to satellite altimetry observations using the pearson s correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as shown in eqs 4 5 and 6 to assess the efficiency of the model 4 r i 1 n y i o y o y i y i 1 n y i o y o 2 i 1 n y i y 2 5 r m s e i 1 n y i o y i 2 n 6 n s e 1 i 1 n y i o y i 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 where y i o are the observed river heights y i are the predicted river heights y o is the mean of the observations y is the mean of the predictions and n is the number of observations to estimate the skill of a statistical model we used cross validation method rather than a simple split sample because evaluation of model skill using cross validation leads to a less biased result than other methods such as a split sample james et al 2013 cross validation cv was used to avoid overfitting the models we used 5 fold cv to estimate the prediction errors with 20 of the data withheld each time the r nse and rmse were calculated for predictions from trained model comparing to the withheld independent dataset we then averaged these metrics over the five partitions to estimate the cross validated prediction errors the 90 prediction intervals pi were also calculated eq 7 to provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the predictions 7 p i y h t α 2 n 2 mse 1 1 n x h x 2 x i x 2 where y h are the predicted river heights when the predictor is x h and t α 2 n 2 is the students t value for n 2 degrees of freedom and significance level α which is adopted as 0 01 mse is mean square error and mse 1 1 n x h x 2 x i x 2 is standard error of the prediction the prediction intervals were used to estimate the reliability of the model which reflects the proportion of the observations falling within the 90 prediction intervals compared to the total number of observations finally the model predictions were validated against the in situ water levels rather than other satellite products because of their uncertainties due to the different locations of the virtual gauges and gauges which affect the actual river heights the correlation coefficient between the predictions and ground based water levels was used for this validation 3 2 uncertainty assessment the prediction intervals calculated above are associated with the residual model error and are related to the structural uncertainty associated with the choice of prediction model it however assumes that the forcing data for the model is perfectly known as discussed in section 1 this is not the case with uncertainties in each of the satellite based precipitation lst and soil moisture data as a result we investigate a monte carlo sampling strategy to explicitly account for the satellite data uncertainty this section discusses how these uncertainties can be quantified for each individual product and how they propagate through the seasonal linear model into the predicted water levels 3 2 1 uncertainty in satellite data the uncertainty in the satellite based precipitation lst and soil moisture data have been defined based on published comparison studies here we assumed that the uncertainties of the lst and soil moisture products are normal distributed with zero mean and fixed standard deviation estimated from the literature a multiplicative error structure was assumed for precipitation modelled with a log normal distribution with fixed mean and standard deviation table 2 for the uncertainty of the gsmap nrt precipitation we have adopted the estimates from the southwestern yungui plateau region zhao et al 2018 which is relatively close to our study site and has similar topography and climate the merged lst product was generated from the optical modis aqua myd11a1 products and the passive microwave lprm amsr 2 products therefore the uncertainty of the merged lst data was assessed using both statistical metrics of these satellite based lst products based on the land cover of the study area the uncertainty in myd11a1 products were taken from forest duan et al 2018 for high density of vegetation coverage due to the tropical monsoon climate regime over the study area the standard errors of lprm amsr 2 products for tropical climate zone from parinussa et al 2016a were used estimates of uncertainty in smos soil moisture product were based on the performance of smos in tropical humid tropical rainforest regions al yaari et al 2014 3 2 2 uncertainty propagation analysis the error estimates from section 3 2 1 are incorporated into the prediction model using a monte carlo framework we generated 1000 ensembles of each satellite input variable eq 8 and used these as inputs to the seasonal linear model to produce a probability distribution for each of the modelled river heights the multiple realisations of myd11a1 lst and lprm amsr 2 daytime and nighttime data are generated separately using the uncertainty of each product the ensemble of the merged lst product is then comprised from the ensemble of optical lst products and the ensemble of microwave lst products for daytime and nighttime the 5th and 95th percentile of the modelled water level ensemble at each time step were used to provide the 90 confidence interval of the water levels the average width of 90 confidence interval was calculated to indicate the sharpness of modelled water level ensembles li et al 2016a narrower confidence intervals suggest sharper prediction and assist with easier decision making 3 3 attributing uncertainty to inputs sensitivity analysis plays a crucial role in quantification of uncertainty optimization model calibration and model parameterization song et al 2015 to attribute the variability in the modeled water levels to the input data uncertainty a one at a time oat sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2016 was used to estimate the contribution of each satellite variable to the total uncertainty of the model outputs each satellite input variable was sampled in turn while the other variables were held fixed at the expected value to create ensembles of water levels solely related to the uncertainty of the sampled individual input variable equation 9 8 y i a β o a β 1 a x i a i 1 1000 9 y i v β o v β 1 v x i v i 1 1000 where a and v superscripts denote all input variables and an individual input variable respectively we then calculated the cumulative distribution function cdf of the deterministic modelled water level y we estimated the pth percentiles from 10th to 95th at increments increasing by 5 of the cdf of the deterministic modelled water level y and found the corresponding time steps at which the p th percentiles of the cdf occurred based on these reference time steps we extracted the y i a and the y i v water levels at each time step to derive y i a p and y i v p water levels associated to the p th percentiles respectively finally the variance of the ensembles of the water levels from all perturbed input variables corresponding the p th percentiles σ a 2 p was calculated via eq 10 whereas the variances of the ensembles of the water levels from individual perturbed input variable with respect to the p th percentiles σ v 2 p was estimated through eq 11 10 σ a 2 p e y i a y a 2 p i 1 1000 p 10 t h 95 t h 11 σ v 2 p e y i v y v 2 p i 1 1000 p 10 t h 95 t h to understand how each satellite contributed to the total variability of the model water levels we calculated the variance fraction f at each p th percentile for each input variable v as presented in eq 12 the fraction of interactions that represent interdependency between input variables were calculated at each percentile pth as defined in eq 13 12 f v p σ v 2 p σ a 2 p 13 f inter p 100 v f v p 4 results 4 1 daily river heights derived from multisource satellite data the first study objective is to predict daily river heights using multisource satellite datasets to improve the seasonal linear model the daily api obtained from the gsmap nrt precipitation data daily soil moisture data derived from the smos product the daily δlst retrieved from the myd11a1 for the clear cloud date and the lprm amsr 2 lst for the missing data and 10 day river height series derived from jason 2 altimeters at the vs 179 are shown in fig 3 it is apparent that the 10 day satellite altimeter data has similar dynamics to daily api and daily soil moisture data fig 3a b and d with an inverse relationship with daily δlst fig 3c and d under dry conditions with lower amount of water content in soil and no rainfall it has been found that lst heats and cools more rapidly in addition due to their lower thermal mass shallow water bodies emit a smaller heat flux at night time thus for dry locations and or times of year the difference between daytime and night time lst δlst increases when wet conditions are experienced humidity and cloud cover contribute to a smaller δlst due to slower warming and cooling deep inundation in the wet season leads to more emissive heat flux at night time due to the higher thermal mass of the water body therefore δlst decreases during wet conditions with higher soil moisture content and precipitation these results highlight the potential integration of the high frequency hydro climate variables into the seasonal linear model to improve the prediction skill of the model the predicted river heights derived from the new seasonal linear model using multiple satellite data variables and the lag variable of the modeled river heights from the upstream station model 2 were compared to the modelled water surface elevations from the pham et al 2018 seasonal linear model using only δlst variable model 1 fig 4 the results show that the modelled river heights from the model 2 had better agreement with the jason 2 observations compared to the simpler model the most interesting aspect of fig 4 is that the large underestimates in model 1 in the wet season fig 4a are reduced fig 4b model 2 improves the correlation r and nse values and leads to a lower rmse compared to model 1 similar results were found at the other virtual gauges vs 103 and vs 140 which are presented in figs 1s and 2s of the supplementary material the statistical measures and cross validated prediction errors of the two modeled river heights versus the jason 2 altimeters are shown in table 3 these results indicate that there was moderate improvement at vs 103 in the predictions from model 2 compared to model 1 highlighting the value of api as an additional predictor as well as δlst substantial improvements compared to pham et al 2018 were found at the two other virtual gauges vs 140 and vs 179 when four variables including api δlst sm and uswl were used table 3 the independent validation of both models using in situ river height data also confirms the good performance of model 2 with improved correlation coefficients at all three locations compared to the previous work the modelled water levels of two models were compared with observations in different seasons table 4 moderate improvements of modeled water levels were found in the cold dry and hot dry seasons but there were significant improvements of modeled water levels in wet season specially at two downstream stations vs 140 and vs 179 this is because more variables precipitation soil moisture δlst modeled river height at upstream station were included in the new model compared to only δlst variable including in the previous model in dry condition low flows usually are less influenced by external factors such as heavy rain or floods routing from upstream station the behaviour of δlst could be useful land surface condition to simulate the dynamic of natural flows in cold dry and hot dry seasons whereas in wet season external conditions become more important and δlst becomes less important to model the dynamic of river heights and hence there are high biases in peak flows in the previous model when the other variables such as precipitation forcing input and soil moisture wetness condition were involved in the new model the biases in peak events were reduced substantially moreover when modeled water level at upstream station was included in the new model the dynamic of this boundary condition added the dynamic pattern of river heights to the model outcomes and hence the correlation was improved substantially the model 2 river heights and the satellite altimetry observations at the three virtual gauges were plotted against gauge height at their adjacent gauging stations fig 5 to compare the model 2 water levels blue lines to the jason 2 water levels red dots and in situ water stages black lines at the three virtual gauges the aim of this comparison is to consider the dynamics of the water level predictions and their timing rather than the absolute water levels since the in situ gauges are not at the same locations as the virtual stations although there are discrepancies between the model 2 river heights and the satellite altimetry observations at the most upstream station of the study area vs 103 fig 5a the model 2 river heights at the vs 140 and the vs 179 have good agreement with the jason 2 observations in all three seasons fig 5b and c to demonstrate the improvements of model 2 compared to pham et al 2018 model 1 we plot the maximum water levels blue lines along with of the rmse red dashed lines and cyan dashed lines in the river cross sections derived from srtm dem 30 m at three virtual gauges fig 6 the maximum water levels of model 2 fig 6b d and f were higher than the maximum water levels of model 1 fig 6a c and e because model 2 better captured the high peak flows compared to model 1 the reliability of the flood predictions from model 2 is better than model 1 smaller distance between the upper red lines and lower cyan lines limits particularly at vs 140 and vs 179 4 2 uncertainty assessment the second objective of the study is to assess how uncertainty propagates from the multiple satellite input into the model errors a monte carlo simulation was used to generate 1000 synthetic input data using a lognormal distribution for the gsmap nrt data and a normal distribution for the other variables the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ensembles of modelled river heights indicate the 90 confidence intervals grey areas fig 7 the sharpness average width of confidence intervals was used to measure the spread of the probability distribution of the modelled river heights ensembles the low flows have slightly better sharpness than the high flows the sharpness at the vs 103 2 04 is wider than at the other downstream virtual gauges vs 140 1 88 and the vs 179 1 87 however narrower confidence intervals are desirable only if the prediction model is reliable here the reliability was calculated to present the statistical consistency of the model the 90 prediction intervals of the model pink areas fig 7 at all virtual gauges represent quite well the actual observations with good reliability 94 96 it means that the model should reliably predict a new observation when it is available there are large differences in the relative widths of the confidence intervals and prediction intervals at vs 103 fig 7a while for the two downstream stations vs 140 and vs 179 the relative widths of the prediction intervals and confidence intervals are more similar fig 7b and fig 7c prediction intervals are always wider than the corresponding confidence intervals because the prediction intervals have the extra mean square error mse term in the standard error which was presented in eq 7 the mse of the model at vs 103 is quite high 2 9 m compared to the two downstream stations 0 55 m and 0 56 m leading to wider prediction intervals at the most upstream station 4 3 attributing uncertainty to inputs finally we have quantified the contribution of each satellite data error to the total predicted variability fig 8 the predicted river heights at vs 103 were estimated from two predictors api and δlst while four predictors api sm δlst and uswl were used to estimate water levels at the vs 104 and the vs 179 each perturbed satellite input data has different effects on the prediction model and they have different contributions to the overall error of the model under different river flow conditions at the vs 103 fig 8a the dynamic pattern of variance of the modeled water levels from all perturbed input variables black line are similar to the pattern of variance of the modeled water levels from individual perturbed δlst variable blue line at low flows smaller than 70th percentile both modelled water levels from the individual sampling api and δlst have similar patterns of variance while at high flows larger than 70th percentile the variance of the predicted water levels from δlst is far larger than the variance contributed by api fig 8a the fraction of the variance from each predictor and their interactions at the three virtual gauges are presented in fig 8b d and f at the vs 103 δlst dominates the uncertainty at high percentiles larger than the 70th percentile while api contributes the most to overall uncertainty for low flows 10th percentile fig 8b the variability of forecast water levels at the vs 140 at high percentiles larger the 70th percentile is mainly attributed to the variance of the uswl variable fig 8d sm and δlst only have small contributions to overall uncertainty for medium and high percentiles from 40th to 95th percentile and becomes more important in lower percentiles from 10th to 40th percentile fig 8d the highest variance fractions of the api are found at medium flows from 30th to 60th percentile where the most significant percentage of the interactions also occurs at the 30th percentile fig 8d similar to vs 140 the variance of the uswl greatly outweighs the uncertainty of the predicted river heights at the vs 179 fig 8f api substantially contributes to the variability of predicted water levels at the 30th 60th and 70th percentiles but becomes less important at other percentiles sm and δlst only have large contributions to the overall uncertainty at lower flows from 10th to 40th percentile the interesting feature of fig 8f is that the contribution of the interactions to the overall uncertainty substantially increases at the high flow larger than 80th percentile three peaks of the variance of the modeled water levels were found at the 80th the 70th and the 40th percentile of the ensemble of the predicted river heights at the vs 103 fig 8a while two peaks of the variance of the modeled water levels are found at the 70th and 40th percentile at the other virtual gauges fig 8c and e this is because the dynamics of the observed predictors precipitation soil moisture lst and water levels in the transition between seasons leads to larger variations in the predictions to demonstrate this we plotted time series of the predicted river heights at three virtual gauges along with these percentiles with the background showing the three seasons fig 9 the predicted river heights corresponding to the 80th and 70th percentiles at the vs 103 and to the 70th percentile at the vs 140 and vs 179 occur at the seasonal transition from the wet seasons to the cold dry seasons the predicted river heights related to the 40th percentile at the three virtual gauges are found in the seasonal transition from the hot dry seasons to the wet seasons fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 comparison to other approaches for estimating daily river heights derived from satellite data prior studies have noted the need to address the long gaps in time series due to the satellite altimetry revisit period when they are to be used for hydrodynamic models particularly in ungauged areas tourian et al 2016 boergens et al 2017 pham et al 2018 demonstrated that the relationship between the change in water levels and the behavior of δlst could be useful to model daily water levels for several virtual gauges along the mekong river however biases in the peak events reduced the practical utility of the proposed model therefore the first objective of this study was to improve the prediction skill by integrating multisource satellite data and modeled water levels from upstream station into the seasonal linear model consistent with previous research lakshmi et al 2004 xavier et al 2010 water levels have a measurable correlation with precipitation and soil moisture data and inverse correlation with δlst these results confirm the applicability of multisource of hydro climate satellites to improve the prediction model the results indicate that the new model with multiple satellite data had better predictive skill for flood forecasting compared to pham et al 2018 a moderate improvement of the modeled water levels was found at the vs 103 when we integrate api data into the new model rmse 1 7 m in comparison to the previous model rmse 1 9 m when four variables api sm δlst and uswl were included there were substantial improvements in prediction skill of the model rmse 0 74 m and 0 75 m compared to the previous model at the same locations rmse 1 45 m and 1 51 m these findings show that although δlst can provide useful evidence of water level behavior in ungauged regions it cannot fully represent the effects of precipitation and wetness condition in the catchment at the daily time scale the improvements in the model with other hydro climate variables highlight the value of using precipitation forcing data soil moisture wetness condition and the modeled river heights at upstream virtual gauge boundary condition in the prediction model the daily river heights estimated from the new seasonal linear model rmse 0 75 m have similar or smaller errors than previous models that have improved the temporal resolution of water level data for example tourian et al 2016 produced 3 day time series with an rmse of 0 8 m and boergens et al boergens et al 2017 created 5 day time series with rmse values from 0 82 m to 1 29 m the daily time series of the present model are also a big improvement over the 3 day and 5 day time series produced by these previous studies the previous studies have combined multi mission of satellite altimeters at multiple virtual gauges to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of the time series due to different ground track locations of different satellite altimetry missions and different observation times of the same orbit satellites there are not too much observations at a virtual station therefore this is a difficult task to generate daily water levels by merging very low frequencies of multi mission of satellite altimetry in contrast to these previous approaches we used high frequency data derived from multisource of hydro climate satellites to address this problem the good performance of the model here shows the value of using a range of remotely sensed data to model water levels in data scarce or ungauged areas and performs better than approaches combining multi mission satellite altimeters swot satellite mission which will be targeted to launch in february 2022 will provide better understanding of the world s ocean and its terrestrial surface water swot products will provide water bodies associated with water level elevations with an accuracy of 10 cm a future study could integrate swot observations into the model to improve the accuracy of model predictions although the results of cross validation demonstrate that the model has good predictive skill there are limitations attributing to inadequacy of data short in length of data series might not covers extreme events and thus model parameter estimation may not be robust enough to predict high dynamics of hydrologic variables in this study we also calculated the 90 confidence interval and 90 predictive interval to evaluate the sharpness and the reliability criteria these estimations can represent parametric and predictive uncertainties due to the limited data 5 2 comparison to previous satellite product uncertainty assessments satellites products have inherent uncertainty that is difficult to minimize and thereby methods for assessing the impacts of this uncertainty on potential applications are needed thus the second aim of this study was to assess the contribution of the different satellite data sources to the variability of the modeled water levels the results indicate that the model with higher uncertainty higher rmse value has large variability in the model output this finding is in the line with that of qi et al 2016 who also found that the hydrological model structure contributes most uncertainty in a streamflow simulation comparison of the uncertainties of satellite precipitation propagated into hydrologic models with previous studies hong et al 2006 falck et al 2015 nikolopoulos et al 2010 qi et al 2016 knoche et al 2014 confirms that the propagation of input data uncertainties to models is non linear this study also shows that precipitation uncertainties are most influential in the model at the seasonal transitions for soil moisture data the results indicate that the satellite data over complex topography and vegetation conditions have some issues in soil moisture retrieval at station vs 103 this was also found by laiolo et al 2016 over complex terrain and snow cover regions different to previous studies in which remotely sensed soil moisture data is assimilated into hydrologic models to improve model predictions yan and moradkhani 2016 laiolo et al 2016 hirpa et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2016 lievens and de lannoy 2016 this study used a soil moisture product as an input for a statistical model the results of the propagation of soil moisture uncertainties to the model output indicate that initial condition uncertainties are sensitive to the variability of low flow and have less significance in the variability of high flow similarly lst satellite data have been assimilated in land surface models to improve predictions of energy and water fluxes in previous studies han et al 2015 ghent et al 2010 reichle et al 2010 and have been used for hydrological model calibrations zink et al 2018 however this study evaluates the predictive skill of lst with respect to water levels the findings of the present study broadly support previous work in the sensitivity of lst to changes in hydrologic characteristics the results show that lst data has a similar magnitude of contribution to water level uncertainty as soil moisture data the novel contribution of this work is to demonstrate the propagation of uncertainties from multiple satellite data sources to the model outputs one of the key findings of the uncertainty analysis is that the 90 confidence intervals in the high flows wet seasons are wider than those in the low flows dry seasons this improved sharpness in the low flows demonstrates that it is easier to model environmental flows than peak flows this is because satellite precipitation has higher variance in the wet season than in the dry season dos reis et al 2017 in the dry season soil moisture contributed strongly to the total uncertainty consistent with korres et al 2015 who showed that lower sm content tend to have higher coefficient of variation and vice versa in the wet season soil is saturated and less impacted by precipitation variations whereas unsaturated soil in the dry season is considerably influenced by precipitation variations in the two predictor model we found that during high flows most of the uncertainty is due to δlst uncertainties in the wet seasons the microwave sensor lst lprm amsr 2 was used to fill gaps in missing data of the optical sensor lst myd11a1 because the microwave sensor lst has higher uncertainties compared to the optical sensor lst this gap filling also contributes to the uncertainty in the model outputs in the wet seasons developing alternative ways to gap fill lst data that minimizes the uncertainty and could therefore improve flood predictions the improved sharpness at the two downstream stations show the benefits of using more satellite input data along with information on upstream water levels uncertainty in the modelled upstream water levels influenced the overall uncertainty at the downstream virtual stations the uncertainty from the multiple satellite data sources used to model the river heights at the upstream virtual gauge e g vs 140 propagates through to the downstream model e g vs 179 one alternative would be to directly use satellite altimetry measurements and their associated uncertainties to provide the upstream water levels for the prediction model instead of the modelled water level however the rmse of the modelled water levels in this study 0 74 m 1 71 m is similar to the rmse of the jason 2 satellite altimetry data itself 0 6 m 1 1 m domeneghetti et al 2015 and ers 2 and envisat altimeters 0 46 m 1 24 m birkinshaw et al 2010 therefore there would be limited benefit in directly using upstream satellite altimeter data with the drawback that only 10 day or 35 day water levels are available for these products compared to the daily modelled water level data comparing the total variance in the predicted water levels to the sum of the uncertainty in each of the predictors is useful to understand interactions between predictors if the errors in the predictors are all independent then the sum of the individual variances would be equal to the total variance here some interactions were identified particularly at vs 179 fig 7 suggesting that uncertainties in the predictors are correlated further study of the interactions between different satellite product errors would be worthwhile to understand this pattern 5 3 application to other ungauged sparsely gauged regions the daily water level estimation shown here from multi source satellite products suggest that similarly to the findings in siddique e akbor et al 2014 wanders et al 2014a and zink et al 2018 satellite data can be used to improve model performance this has implications for improved predictions in ungauged or sparsely gauged basins however the findings in this study were made under specific topographic climatic and vegetation conditions the results show that improved model performance is found in low relief areas this is because the accuracy of satellite based precipitation and soil moisture are lower in complex terrain therefore when adapting the model to other regions modelers should consider the complexity of topography in addition basins with highly dense vegetation have negative impacts on performances of satellite soil moisture observations and satellite altimetry to apply the proposed model to such regions pre processing data should be carried out carefully moreover the climate of the study area is classified as tropical monsoonal without snowfall the implications of the model over snow cover regions might be a limitation also lower mekong river which is a perennial river with large river width further research should be undertaken to investigate the applicability of this model to other types of rivers intermittent and ephemeral and narrower rivers to have a full picture of the implication of the proposed model due to sparse meteorological and hydrological measurement networks it is difficult to select sufficient data for implementing machine learning techniques or physical models for such prediction problems we have shown that a reasonably simple statistical model based on multiple satellite data can be used provide early warning of high water levels in poorly gauged areas in future works it might be possible to apply this approach in different climate regions or different landscapes mountainous or low relief areas to understand the performance of the prediction model under different conditions it should be noted that due to limitations of satellite sensors in different observed conditions some satellite observations are unreliable over some types of land cover a modeller should initially check the correlations between satellite based predictors and the response of interest as a pre screening step in the model set up if a predictor does not provide useful information for the model prediction it should be removed from the model 6 conclusion the main goals of the current study are to predict daily time series of river heights from multisource satellite data at ungauged regions and to assess the responsibility of uncertainties of multiple satellite data and the upstream modelled water levels in the variability of the modelled water levels the key findings are the efficiency reliability and sharpness of the prediction model with multisource satellite products shows that the model is useful for flood warning systems and near real time reservoir operation processes in ungauged regions the new seasonal linear model with multisource satellite data precipitation soil moisture δlst and the predicted river heights from upstream station is better than the previous models that used single satellite input data or merging multi mission of satellite altimetry high variances in the modeled water level ensembles occur in the transition between seasons and in the high flow periods the evidence of the contribution of uncertainties of multiple satellite data suggests that the overall model output error is attributed to both uncertainties of multiple satellite data and their interactions further studies regarding the insights in the model performance in another poorly gauged areas and the interaction of multiple satellite uncertainties would be worthwhile the methods used here highlight the importance of uncertainty quantification and

4238,satellite altimetry helps to monitor continental water levels with global coverage and near real time accessibility however a main drawback of satellite altimetry is its low acquisition frequency that hinders the use of altimeters in flood forecasting or reservoir operation processes this study provides a new method to estimate daily river heights from multisource hydro climate satellite products without using ground based data first the approach develops a simple statistical model a seasonal linear model using satellite altimetry land surface temperature lst satellite precipitation and satellite soil moisture products second a monte carlo simulation is used to understand the model accuracy by attributing the model output errors to uncertainties from the multiple satellite products for the first aim the study shows that using high frequency satellite data to improve the temporal resolution of the satellite radar altimetry is better than an approach merging multiple satellite altimetry data with respect to the second objective it is found that higher variances are found in seasonal transition periods where there are significant changes in satellite observations the overall error of the model is attributed to both uncertainties of satellite input data and the interactions among their uncertainties the results demonstrate the capability of using multisource satellite data to predict daily time series of river heights in data poor areas the results also highlight the importance of quantifying uncertainty to increase the reliability of flood forecasting

warning systems provide early warnings which can minimise deaths injuries and reduce the economic effects of flooding pappenberger et al 2008 flood early warnings also provide valuable information for reservoir flood control operations to manage flood risk huang et al 2018 for the last decade the increased reliability of flood forecasting has better information for decision making processes ramos et al 2013 however flood warning systems in large and remote areas or developing countries are often difficult to develop due to the limited access slow distribution of data and the sparse distribution of gauge stations di baldassarre et al 2011 yan et al 2015 alsdorf et al 2016 recently large scale satellite derived data have been widely used to complement ground based data for predictions of hydrological extreme events flood or drought and water resource management bates 2012 yan et al 2015 palmer et al 2015 li et al 2016b di baldassarre and uhlenbrook 2012 satellite data can provide information on topography precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture vegetation dynamics surface water elevations and water surface extents for flood forecasting satellite altimeters are particularly valuable to observe river water levels and provide forecasts of water level in rivers kouraev et al 2004 getirana et al 2009 getirana and peters lidard 2013 frappart et al 2015 tourian et al 2013 tarpanelli et al 2013 paris et al 2016 there are a number of past and current satellite altimetry missions including ers 2 envisat saral altilka topex poseidon t p jason 1 2 3 sentinel 3a 3b cryosat 2 and icesat 1 2 and future mission such as sentinel 6a b and swot in addition to flood forecasting satellite altimeters have been used for a variety applications see table 1s in the supplementary document despite the promise of satellite altimetry data for flood forecasting the low temporal resolution of satellite radar altimetry between 10 and 35 days is a major barrier to its use tarpanelli et al 2017 michailovsky et al 2013 one solution is to integrate satellite altimeter data with in situ data or model results to generate higher frequency data roux et al 2008 biancamaria et al 2011b hossain et al 2014 however this approach is typically limited to areas where in situ data are available for areas without in situ data multiple satellite altimetry can be merged spatially and temporally to improve data frequency crétaux et al 2011 boergens et al 2017 schwatke et al 2015 although the temporal resolution of the combined products is typically still low up to 3 days to address these problems pham et al 2018 developed a method to estimate daily river heights without using any ground based data to infill jason 2 satellite altimetry the method used remotely sensed differences between daytime and night time land surface temperature δlst a seasonal linear model was used to relate δlst to water levels for several locations in the lower mekong river the model was particularly effective for the dry seasons with both cold and hot temperatures but tended to underestimate water levels in the wet season in the dry season the model was also not able to predict high water levels associated with anomalous rainfalls this indicates that the model might be enhanced by including other hydro climate data here we develop an extended model relating δlst and water levels by incorporating satellite precipitation soil moisture data and upstream modelled water levels to improve the predictive skill of the model particularly in high flow events considering multiple satellite products can provide valuable information in terms of input data model calibration model evaluation or to update model forecasts via approaches such as data assimilation however satellite data have inherent uncertainties which introduce errors in the model outputs the uncertainties of satellite data should not be ignored but rather they should be considered to improve the reliability of the predictions maggioni et al 2016 uncertainty assessment shows how the uncertainty of multiple satellite data propagates into the model outputs and provides a better understanding of the overall model accuracy to understand the propagation of these uncertainties into predictions we need to know the uncertainties of the individual input satellite products which is usually difficult to quantify due to a lack of accurate ground based data liu et al 2012 a summary of previous studies addressing uncertainty quantification in multiple satellite data are presented in table 2s in the supplementary material uncertainties in individual satellite products i e satellite based precipitation soil moisture or water level have different effects on different flood prediction models domeneghetti et al 2015 hong et al 2006 wanders et al 2014b it is still not known how a combination of uncertainties in multiple satellite data could affect a flood prediction model or how significant the combination of uncertainties may be under different conditions here we extend the pham et al 2018 model by considering multiple satellite data to improve the accuracy of the prediction and then we assess the effects of the combined uncertainties of the multisource satellite products on the prediction model the study objectives are to i derive daily water levels from multisource hydro climatic satellite datasets and ii assess the propagation of uncertainty from multiple satellite data into the model outputs for the first objective we integrate global satellite mapping precipitation near real time gsmap nrt soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and δlst derived from modis products to generate a new seasonal linear model in addition the modelled water levels at the upstream virtual gauge are incorporated as a lag variable in the new model for the second objective the uncertainty of multiple satellite data is incorporated and a monte carlo framework is used to attribute uncertainty in the model outputs to the uncertainty of multiple satellite data sensitivity analysis is used to estimate the contribution of each satellite to the total variability of predicted water levels answering these objectives will improve the predictive skill of the previous seasonal linear model highlight the role of each satellite to the total ensemble uncertainty and provide probabilistic forecasts of water levels in a data poor region 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the upper reaches of the lower mekong river basin fig 1 which is one of the largest rivers in terms of length and discharge in the world and runs through six countries china myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam mrc 2010a the average river width in the study area is more than 400 m the satellite altimetry jason 2 ground tracks pass 205 and pass 027 intersect the mekong river over china and passes 103 140 and 179 intersect the mekong river over laos cambodia and vietnam fig 1 however in situ data at jing hong gauge in china are not available via the mekong river commission database and the locations of the intersections between jason 2 ground tracks passes 205 027 and the mekong river are too far from their respective gauges more than 160 km therefore we exclude passes 205 and 027 from our study virtual gauges red squares have been designated at the locations where the mekong river blue line intersects the ground tracks of satellite altimetry jason 2 for passes 103 140 and 179 black dashed lines the three gauges green triangles corresponding with these vs 103 vs140 and vs 179 are luang prabang vs 103 nong khai vs 140 and pasksane vs 179 the area around vs 103 is dominated by broad leaved trees whereas the other sites have a mixture of developed area croplands and bare soil mrc 2010b 2 2 data and pre processing multiple satellite products are used in this study to derive daily river heights and information of satellite based data are summarised in table 1 the mekong river commission in situ water levels are collected only to validate the model 2 2 1 satellite altimetry due to its short revisit frequency 10 day and the longest period of observed data 2008 present the jason 2 sensor interim geophysical data record s igdr data have been selected to derive river heights the longer revisit times of alternatives such as envisat and saral 35 days and sentinel 3a 3b 27 days preclude their use more recent missions including saral altika launched in 2013 jason 3 and sentinel 3a launched in 2016 and sentinel 3b launched in 2018 show promise for studies such as this in the future but at present their short periods of record limits their use more technical information about the jason 2 satellite altimetry products are available in dumont et al 2009 the detailed process for deriving water levels from the jason 2 satellite altimetry in the upper reaches of the lower mekong river were presented in pham et al 2018 here we briefly describe the four main steps of the jason 2 data pre processing first we obtain satellite altitude a dry troposphere correction cdry wet troposphere correction cwet solid earth tide csolid tide and pole tides cpole tide from the on board algorithms while the range r is derived from the ice 1 and ionosphere correction cion is obtained from the global ionosphere maps secondly we adopt a semi automated method roux et al 2010 to develop virtual gauges thirdly we compute the surface river heights h at all data points within a virtual gauge using eq 1 1 h a r cdry cwet cion csolid tide cpole tide finally for a specific date we calculate the median of estimated surface river heights at the data points within a virtual gauge to obtain the river water levels at that virtual gauge frappart et al 2005 2 2 2 land surface temperature land surface temperature lst derived from landsat has higher spatial resolution 30 m compared to lst derived from modis 1 km but landsat has lower temporal resolution 16 days in comparison to modis aqua or terra twice per day the main purpose of this study is to estimate daily time series of water level from multisource satellite products hence higher temporal resolution product with more information modis product was selected land surface temperature lst is derived from the modis aqua products because they have more clear cloud data than the terra products we use the daytime 1 30 pm and night time 1 30 am modis aqua daily lst 0 01 version 6 myd11a1 products wan 2016 to obtain δlst there are gaps in the modis observations because the thermal infrared technique in modis does not penetrate clouds wan and li 1997 here we use the passive microwave lst products retrieved from the 0 25 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 with the land parameter retrieval model algorithm lprm amsr2 holmes et al 2009 to fill the gaps the in situ air temperature retrieved from the noaa http www ncdc noaa gov land based station data are used to validate the merged lst from the myd11a1 and the lprm amsr 2 more details of the pre processing and validation of the lst products were presented in pham et al 2018 2 2 3 precipitation our model is designed to be used in ungauged areas and thus uncorrected satellite based precipitation is used rather than rain gauge data or corrected satellite precipitation remotely sensed precipitation can vary in latency spatiotemporal resolution and available period for flood prediction in sparsely and ungauged catchments we need data that has short latency high spatiotemporal resolution and is only derived from satellite sources here we use the global satellite mapping of precipitation near real time gsmap nrt product kubota et al 2007 which satisfies these criteria the gsmap algorithm combines satellite input streams from passive microwave mw and infrared ir sensors to produce high accuracy and high resolution near global precipitation maps ushio et al 2009 the gsmap algorithm is based on attributes derived from the trmm precipitation radar pr and gpm dual precipitation radar dpr there are three gsmap products based on latency and accuracy including a near real time product gsmap nrt a reanalysed product using a moving vector with kalman filter method gsmap mvk and a gauge adjusted product gsmap gau the gsmap nrt product is derived from available microwave imagers land sounders ocean and ir retrievals and has the shortest latency of the three for that reason we use the gsmap nrt 0 1 daily product to provide precipitation estimates to incorporate the effects of catchment wetness and effective rainfall over catchment we convert daily precipitation data into the antecedent precipitation index api eq 2 fedora 1987 this index is commonly used in soil moisture validation and flood inundation crow et al 2010 parinussa et al 2016b crow et al 2012 2 apit pδt k apit δt where apit is the api at time t pδt is a precipitation during δt period and k is a recession coefficient that depends on the land cover and soil properties fedora 1987 and typically ranges from 0 8 to 0 98 hong et al 2007 based on the land cover types and soil types mrc 2010b of the study sites a k value of 0 86 is used for the study 2 2 4 soil moisture surface soil moisture can be obtained from a range of remotely sensed data products such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos soil moisture active and passive smap advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 or advanced scatterometer ascat on board the metop a b although smap provides high accuracy soil moisture data its available data 2015 present is shorter than that of smos 2010 present l band smos has lower noise compared to c band amsr 2 and ascat products montzka et al 2017 to maximise the data availability we use the smos product for soil moisture data the smos satellite was launched in november 2009 carrying the microwave imaging radiometer using aperture synthesis miras instrument to penetrate soil depth to 5 cm and vegetation cover with water content up to 5 kg m2 the smos satellite uses l band 1 413 ghz 21 cm passive radiometer kerr et al 2001 the smos satellite overpasses the equator at 6 00 am solar local time ascending orbit and 6 00 pm solar local time descending orbit kerr et al 2010 this study use daily smos 0 25 daily level 3 products provided by the centre aval de traitement des données catds centre which has 1 3 days temporal resolution daily latency and an accuracy of 0 04 m3 m3 kerr et al 2012 the smos grid closest to each virtual station is used to represent the surface moisture content more details of the smos level 3 products and retrieval algorithm can be found in kerr and jacquette 2013 the study period was from june 2012 to june 2016 to maximise the availability of both satellite based and ground based data due to the low frequency of the jason 2 observations there were around 120 altimeters for the model evaluation at each virtual station in addition approximately 1449 in situ river height measurements were used to validate the model at each station 3 methodology the methodology includes three main sections i model development and model evaluation ii uncertainty assessment and iii attributing uncertainty to inputs fig 2 section 3 1 presents model development using multisource satellite products gsmap modis smos and predicted water level at upstream virtual station associated with 10 day jason 2 observations the predictive skill of model was evaluated by 5 fold cross validation and compared to in situ water level 90 prediction interval was also calculated to estimate the reliability of model prediction in section 3 2 the propagation of uncertainty from multiple satellite products into the modeled water level was assessed using monte carlo simulation finally the contribution of each satellite and their interactions to total variability of the model outputs was investigated using sensitivity analysis in section 3 3 3 1 daily river heights derived from multisource satellite data pham et al 2018 developed four mathematical models to evaluate the appropriate model structure for using δlst and jason 2 altimeters to estimate daily river heights at three different virtual gauges in the mekong river they demonstrated that the linear model incorporating seasonal patterns outperformed the other models as discussed previously the model had lower skill in the wet season and during anomalous rainfall periods in the dry seasons to improve the predictive skill of this model here we integrated other hydro climate variables and the modelled river heights at the upstream virtual gauge as a lag variable to develop a new model eq 3 3 y b 0 j b j x j j 1 3 where y is the predicted river height j indicates the three classified seasons boj is a scalar of the intercept b j is a vector of the coefficients of the model b j b 1 b k j and x j is a matrix with each column representing one of the predictor variables x j x 1 x k j where k indicates number of predictor variables due to the differences in the accuracy of the satellite based lst and soil moisture at locations with different land cover the proposed model was implemented separately at each virtual gauge vs 103 is the most upstream virtual gauge the vs 103 is dominated by broadleaf forest which leads to poor quality smos data in this area evidenced by the low correlation between smos soil moisture and altimeters 0 19 we therefore excluded soil moisture data from the model for vs 103 leading to a model with two variables api and δlst the predictions at the two downstream stations vs 140 and vs 179 can be improved by including upstream water level information we thus incorporated time lagged modelled water level from the upstream virtual gauge in the seasonal linear model as another predictor variable the time lag between two virtual gauges was estimated by maximising the cross correlation between the time series of jason 2 river heights derived at these stations the time lag between vs 103 and vs 140 was found to be three days and one day between vs 140 and the vs 179 thus x j in eq 3 at vs 140 and vs 179 has four variables including api δlst soil moisture sm and the lagged modelled water levels at upstream virtual gauge uswl to select the most parsimonious model with good skill we used stepwise regression to select the optimum subset of independent variables backward selection was used to remove non significant variables from the full initial model at each step the p value of the f statistic is estimated to test models with and without a potential variable if any variables have p values greater than the set threshold p remove the variable with the largest p value is removed from the model this process continues until no more non significant variables are included in the model here an optimisation with objective function of minimising root mean squared error rmse was used and the threshold for the predictor selection was p remove 0 2 the predicted river heights were compared to satellite altimetry observations using the pearson s correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as shown in eqs 4 5 and 6 to assess the efficiency of the model 4 r i 1 n y i o y o y i y i 1 n y i o y o 2 i 1 n y i y 2 5 r m s e i 1 n y i o y i 2 n 6 n s e 1 i 1 n y i o y i 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 where y i o are the observed river heights y i are the predicted river heights y o is the mean of the observations y is the mean of the predictions and n is the number of observations to estimate the skill of a statistical model we used cross validation method rather than a simple split sample because evaluation of model skill using cross validation leads to a less biased result than other methods such as a split sample james et al 2013 cross validation cv was used to avoid overfitting the models we used 5 fold cv to estimate the prediction errors with 20 of the data withheld each time the r nse and rmse were calculated for predictions from trained model comparing to the withheld independent dataset we then averaged these metrics over the five partitions to estimate the cross validated prediction errors the 90 prediction intervals pi were also calculated eq 7 to provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the predictions 7 p i y h t α 2 n 2 mse 1 1 n x h x 2 x i x 2 where y h are the predicted river heights when the predictor is x h and t α 2 n 2 is the students t value for n 2 degrees of freedom and significance level α which is adopted as 0 01 mse is mean square error and mse 1 1 n x h x 2 x i x 2 is standard error of the prediction the prediction intervals were used to estimate the reliability of the model which reflects the proportion of the observations falling within the 90 prediction intervals compared to the total number of observations finally the model predictions were validated against the in situ water levels rather than other satellite products because of their uncertainties due to the different locations of the virtual gauges and gauges which affect the actual river heights the correlation coefficient between the predictions and ground based water levels was used for this validation 3 2 uncertainty assessment the prediction intervals calculated above are associated with the residual model error and are related to the structural uncertainty associated with the choice of prediction model it however assumes that the forcing data for the model is perfectly known as discussed in section 1 this is not the case with uncertainties in each of the satellite based precipitation lst and soil moisture data as a result we investigate a monte carlo sampling strategy to explicitly account for the satellite data uncertainty this section discusses how these uncertainties can be quantified for each individual product and how they propagate through the seasonal linear model into the predicted water levels 3 2 1 uncertainty in satellite data the uncertainty in the satellite based precipitation lst and soil moisture data have been defined based on published comparison studies here we assumed that the uncertainties of the lst and soil moisture products are normal distributed with zero mean and fixed standard deviation estimated from the literature a multiplicative error structure was assumed for precipitation modelled with a log normal distribution with fixed mean and standard deviation table 2 for the uncertainty of the gsmap nrt precipitation we have adopted the estimates from the southwestern yungui plateau region zhao et al 2018 which is relatively close to our study site and has similar topography and climate the merged lst product was generated from the optical modis aqua myd11a1 products and the passive microwave lprm amsr 2 products therefore the uncertainty of the merged lst data was assessed using both statistical metrics of these satellite based lst products based on the land cover of the study area the uncertainty in myd11a1 products were taken from forest duan et al 2018 for high density of vegetation coverage due to the tropical monsoon climate regime over the study area the standard errors of lprm amsr 2 products for tropical climate zone from parinussa et al 2016a were used estimates of uncertainty in smos soil moisture product were based on the performance of smos in tropical humid tropical rainforest regions al yaari et al 2014 3 2 2 uncertainty propagation analysis the error estimates from section 3 2 1 are incorporated into the prediction model using a monte carlo framework we generated 1000 ensembles of each satellite input variable eq 8 and used these as inputs to the seasonal linear model to produce a probability distribution for each of the modelled river heights the multiple realisations of myd11a1 lst and lprm amsr 2 daytime and nighttime data are generated separately using the uncertainty of each product the ensemble of the merged lst product is then comprised from the ensemble of optical lst products and the ensemble of microwave lst products for daytime and nighttime the 5th and 95th percentile of the modelled water level ensemble at each time step were used to provide the 90 confidence interval of the water levels the average width of 90 confidence interval was calculated to indicate the sharpness of modelled water level ensembles li et al 2016a narrower confidence intervals suggest sharper prediction and assist with easier decision making 3 3 attributing uncertainty to inputs sensitivity analysis plays a crucial role in quantification of uncertainty optimization model calibration and model parameterization song et al 2015 to attribute the variability in the modeled water levels to the input data uncertainty a one at a time oat sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2016 was used to estimate the contribution of each satellite variable to the total uncertainty of the model outputs each satellite input variable was sampled in turn while the other variables were held fixed at the expected value to create ensembles of water levels solely related to the uncertainty of the sampled individual input variable equation 9 8 y i a β o a β 1 a x i a i 1 1000 9 y i v β o v β 1 v x i v i 1 1000 where a and v superscripts denote all input variables and an individual input variable respectively we then calculated the cumulative distribution function cdf of the deterministic modelled water level y we estimated the pth percentiles from 10th to 95th at increments increasing by 5 of the cdf of the deterministic modelled water level y and found the corresponding time steps at which the p th percentiles of the cdf occurred based on these reference time steps we extracted the y i a and the y i v water levels at each time step to derive y i a p and y i v p water levels associated to the p th percentiles respectively finally the variance of the ensembles of the water levels from all perturbed input variables corresponding the p th percentiles σ a 2 p was calculated via eq 10 whereas the variances of the ensembles of the water levels from individual perturbed input variable with respect to the p th percentiles σ v 2 p was estimated through eq 11 10 σ a 2 p e y i a y a 2 p i 1 1000 p 10 t h 95 t h 11 σ v 2 p e y i v y v 2 p i 1 1000 p 10 t h 95 t h to understand how each satellite contributed to the total variability of the model water levels we calculated the variance fraction f at each p th percentile for each input variable v as presented in eq 12 the fraction of interactions that represent interdependency between input variables were calculated at each percentile pth as defined in eq 13 12 f v p σ v 2 p σ a 2 p 13 f inter p 100 v f v p 4 results 4 1 daily river heights derived from multisource satellite data the first study objective is to predict daily river heights using multisource satellite datasets to improve the seasonal linear model the daily api obtained from the gsmap nrt precipitation data daily soil moisture data derived from the smos product the daily δlst retrieved from the myd11a1 for the clear cloud date and the lprm amsr 2 lst for the missing data and 10 day river height series derived from jason 2 altimeters at the vs 179 are shown in fig 3 it is apparent that the 10 day satellite altimeter data has similar dynamics to daily api and daily soil moisture data fig 3a b and d with an inverse relationship with daily δlst fig 3c and d under dry conditions with lower amount of water content in soil and no rainfall it has been found that lst heats and cools more rapidly in addition due to their lower thermal mass shallow water bodies emit a smaller heat flux at night time thus for dry locations and or times of year the difference between daytime and night time lst δlst increases when wet conditions are experienced humidity and cloud cover contribute to a smaller δlst due to slower warming and cooling deep inundation in the wet season leads to more emissive heat flux at night time due to the higher thermal mass of the water body therefore δlst decreases during wet conditions with higher soil moisture content and precipitation these results highlight the potential integration of the high frequency hydro climate variables into the seasonal linear model to improve the prediction skill of the model the predicted river heights derived from the new seasonal linear model using multiple satellite data variables and the lag variable of the modeled river heights from the upstream station model 2 were compared to the modelled water surface elevations from the pham et al 2018 seasonal linear model using only δlst variable model 1 fig 4 the results show that the modelled river heights from the model 2 had better agreement with the jason 2 observations compared to the simpler model the most interesting aspect of fig 4 is that the large underestimates in model 1 in the wet season fig 4a are reduced fig 4b model 2 improves the correlation r and nse values and leads to a lower rmse compared to model 1 similar results were found at the other virtual gauges vs 103 and vs 140 which are presented in figs 1s and 2s of the supplementary material the statistical measures and cross validated prediction errors of the two modeled river heights versus the jason 2 altimeters are shown in table 3 these results indicate that there was moderate improvement at vs 103 in the predictions from model 2 compared to model 1 highlighting the value of api as an additional predictor as well as δlst substantial improvements compared to pham et al 2018 were found at the two other virtual gauges vs 140 and vs 179 when four variables including api δlst sm and uswl were used table 3 the independent validation of both models using in situ river height data also confirms the good performance of model 2 with improved correlation coefficients at all three locations compared to the previous work the modelled water levels of two models were compared with observations in different seasons table 4 moderate improvements of modeled water levels were found in the cold dry and hot dry seasons but there were significant improvements of modeled water levels in wet season specially at two downstream stations vs 140 and vs 179 this is because more variables precipitation soil moisture δlst modeled river height at upstream station were included in the new model compared to only δlst variable including in the previous model in dry condition low flows usually are less influenced by external factors such as heavy rain or floods routing from upstream station the behaviour of δlst could be useful land surface condition to simulate the dynamic of natural flows in cold dry and hot dry seasons whereas in wet season external conditions become more important and δlst becomes less important to model the dynamic of river heights and hence there are high biases in peak flows in the previous model when the other variables such as precipitation forcing input and soil moisture wetness condition were involved in the new model the biases in peak events were reduced substantially moreover when modeled water level at upstream station was included in the new model the dynamic of this boundary condition added the dynamic pattern of river heights to the model outcomes and hence the correlation was improved substantially the model 2 river heights and the satellite altimetry observations at the three virtual gauges were plotted against gauge height at their adjacent gauging stations fig 5 to compare the model 2 water levels blue lines to the jason 2 water levels red dots and in situ water stages black lines at the three virtual gauges the aim of this comparison is to consider the dynamics of the water level predictions and their timing rather than the absolute water levels since the in situ gauges are not at the same locations as the virtual stations although there are discrepancies between the model 2 river heights and the satellite altimetry observations at the most upstream station of the study area vs 103 fig 5a the model 2 river heights at the vs 140 and the vs 179 have good agreement with the jason 2 observations in all three seasons fig 5b and c to demonstrate the improvements of model 2 compared to pham et al 2018 model 1 we plot the maximum water levels blue lines along with of the rmse red dashed lines and cyan dashed lines in the river cross sections derived from srtm dem 30 m at three virtual gauges fig 6 the maximum water levels of model 2 fig 6b d and f were higher than the maximum water levels of model 1 fig 6a c and e because model 2 better captured the high peak flows compared to model 1 the reliability of the flood predictions from model 2 is better than model 1 smaller distance between the upper red lines and lower cyan lines limits particularly at vs 140 and vs 179 4 2 uncertainty assessment the second objective of the study is to assess how uncertainty propagates from the multiple satellite input into the model errors a monte carlo simulation was used to generate 1000 synthetic input data using a lognormal distribution for the gsmap nrt data and a normal distribution for the other variables the 5th and 95th percentiles of the ensembles of modelled river heights indicate the 90 confidence intervals grey areas fig 7 the sharpness average width of confidence intervals was used to measure the spread of the probability distribution of the modelled river heights ensembles the low flows have slightly better sharpness than the high flows the sharpness at the vs 103 2 04 is wider than at the other downstream virtual gauges vs 140 1 88 and the vs 179 1 87 however narrower confidence intervals are desirable only if the prediction model is reliable here the reliability was calculated to present the statistical consistency of the model the 90 prediction intervals of the model pink areas fig 7 at all virtual gauges represent quite well the actual observations with good reliability 94 96 it means that the model should reliably predict a new observation when it is available there are large differences in the relative widths of the confidence intervals and prediction intervals at vs 103 fig 7a while for the two downstream stations vs 140 and vs 179 the relative widths of the prediction intervals and confidence intervals are more similar fig 7b and fig 7c prediction intervals are always wider than the corresponding confidence intervals because the prediction intervals have the extra mean square error mse term in the standard error which was presented in eq 7 the mse of the model at vs 103 is quite high 2 9 m compared to the two downstream stations 0 55 m and 0 56 m leading to wider prediction intervals at the most upstream station 4 3 attributing uncertainty to inputs finally we have quantified the contribution of each satellite data error to the total predicted variability fig 8 the predicted river heights at vs 103 were estimated from two predictors api and δlst while four predictors api sm δlst and uswl were used to estimate water levels at the vs 104 and the vs 179 each perturbed satellite input data has different effects on the prediction model and they have different contributions to the overall error of the model under different river flow conditions at the vs 103 fig 8a the dynamic pattern of variance of the modeled water levels from all perturbed input variables black line are similar to the pattern of variance of the modeled water levels from individual perturbed δlst variable blue line at low flows smaller than 70th percentile both modelled water levels from the individual sampling api and δlst have similar patterns of variance while at high flows larger than 70th percentile the variance of the predicted water levels from δlst is far larger than the variance contributed by api fig 8a the fraction of the variance from each predictor and their interactions at the three virtual gauges are presented in fig 8b d and f at the vs 103 δlst dominates the uncertainty at high percentiles larger than the 70th percentile while api contributes the most to overall uncertainty for low flows 10th percentile fig 8b the variability of forecast water levels at the vs 140 at high percentiles larger the 70th percentile is mainly attributed to the variance of the uswl variable fig 8d sm and δlst only have small contributions to overall uncertainty for medium and high percentiles from 40th to 95th percentile and becomes more important in lower percentiles from 10th to 40th percentile fig 8d the highest variance fractions of the api are found at medium flows from 30th to 60th percentile where the most significant percentage of the interactions also occurs at the 30th percentile fig 8d similar to vs 140 the variance of the uswl greatly outweighs the uncertainty of the predicted river heights at the vs 179 fig 8f api substantially contributes to the variability of predicted water levels at the 30th 60th and 70th percentiles but becomes less important at other percentiles sm and δlst only have large contributions to the overall uncertainty at lower flows from 10th to 40th percentile the interesting feature of fig 8f is that the contribution of the interactions to the overall uncertainty substantially increases at the high flow larger than 80th percentile three peaks of the variance of the modeled water levels were found at the 80th the 70th and the 40th percentile of the ensemble of the predicted river heights at the vs 103 fig 8a while two peaks of the variance of the modeled water levels are found at the 70th and 40th percentile at the other virtual gauges fig 8c and e this is because the dynamics of the observed predictors precipitation soil moisture lst and water levels in the transition between seasons leads to larger variations in the predictions to demonstrate this we plotted time series of the predicted river heights at three virtual gauges along with these percentiles with the background showing the three seasons fig 9 the predicted river heights corresponding to the 80th and 70th percentiles at the vs 103 and to the 70th percentile at the vs 140 and vs 179 occur at the seasonal transition from the wet seasons to the cold dry seasons the predicted river heights related to the 40th percentile at the three virtual gauges are found in the seasonal transition from the hot dry seasons to the wet seasons fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 comparison to other approaches for estimating daily river heights derived from satellite data prior studies have noted the need to address the long gaps in time series due to the satellite altimetry revisit period when they are to be used for hydrodynamic models particularly in ungauged areas tourian et al 2016 boergens et al 2017 pham et al 2018 demonstrated that the relationship between the change in water levels and the behavior of δlst could be useful to model daily water levels for several virtual gauges along the mekong river however biases in the peak events reduced the practical utility of the proposed model therefore the first objective of this study was to improve the prediction skill by integrating multisource satellite data and modeled water levels from upstream station into the seasonal linear model consistent with previous research lakshmi et al 2004 xavier et al 2010 water levels have a measurable correlation with precipitation and soil moisture data and inverse correlation with δlst these results confirm the applicability of multisource of hydro climate satellites to improve the prediction model the results indicate that the new model with multiple satellite data had better predictive skill for flood forecasting compared to pham et al 2018 a moderate improvement of the modeled water levels was found at the vs 103 when we integrate api data into the new model rmse 1 7 m in comparison to the previous model rmse 1 9 m when four variables api sm δlst and uswl were included there were substantial improvements in prediction skill of the model rmse 0 74 m and 0 75 m compared to the previous model at the same locations rmse 1 45 m and 1 51 m these findings show that although δlst can provide useful evidence of water level behavior in ungauged regions it cannot fully represent the effects of precipitation and wetness condition in the catchment at the daily time scale the improvements in the model with other hydro climate variables highlight the value of using precipitation forcing data soil moisture wetness condition and the modeled river heights at upstream virtual gauge boundary condition in the prediction model the daily river heights estimated from the new seasonal linear model rmse 0 75 m have similar or smaller errors than previous models that have improved the temporal resolution of water level data for example tourian et al 2016 produced 3 day time series with an rmse of 0 8 m and boergens et al boergens et al 2017 created 5 day time series with rmse values from 0 82 m to 1 29 m the daily time series of the present model are also a big improvement over the 3 day and 5 day time series produced by these previous studies the previous studies have combined multi mission of satellite altimeters at multiple virtual gauges to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of the time series due to different ground track locations of different satellite altimetry missions and different observation times of the same orbit satellites there are not too much observations at a virtual station therefore this is a difficult task to generate daily water levels by merging very low frequencies of multi mission of satellite altimetry in contrast to these previous approaches we used high frequency data derived from multisource of hydro climate satellites to address this problem the good performance of the model here shows the value of using a range of remotely sensed data to model water levels in data scarce or ungauged areas and performs better than approaches combining multi mission satellite altimeters swot satellite mission which will be targeted to launch in february 2022 will provide better understanding of the world s ocean and its terrestrial surface water swot products will provide water bodies associated with water level elevations with an accuracy of 10 cm a future study could integrate swot observations into the model to improve the accuracy of model predictions although the results of cross validation demonstrate that the model has good predictive skill there are limitations attributing to inadequacy of data short in length of data series might not covers extreme events and thus model parameter estimation may not be robust enough to predict high dynamics of hydrologic variables in this study we also calculated the 90 confidence interval and 90 predictive interval to evaluate the sharpness and the reliability criteria these estimations can represent parametric and predictive uncertainties due to the limited data 5 2 comparison to previous satellite product uncertainty assessments satellites products have inherent uncertainty that is difficult to minimize and thereby methods for assessing the impacts of this uncertainty on potential applications are needed thus the second aim of this study was to assess the contribution of the different satellite data sources to the variability of the modeled water levels the results indicate that the model with higher uncertainty higher rmse value has large variability in the model output this finding is in the line with that of qi et al 2016 who also found that the hydrological model structure contributes most uncertainty in a streamflow simulation comparison of the uncertainties of satellite precipitation propagated into hydrologic models with previous studies hong et al 2006 falck et al 2015 nikolopoulos et al 2010 qi et al 2016 knoche et al 2014 confirms that the propagation of input data uncertainties to models is non linear this study also shows that precipitation uncertainties are most influential in the model at the seasonal transitions for soil moisture data the results indicate that the satellite data over complex topography and vegetation conditions have some issues in soil moisture retrieval at station vs 103 this was also found by laiolo et al 2016 over complex terrain and snow cover regions different to previous studies in which remotely sensed soil moisture data is assimilated into hydrologic models to improve model predictions yan and moradkhani 2016 laiolo et al 2016 hirpa et al 2014 alvarez garreton et al 2016 lievens and de lannoy 2016 this study used a soil moisture product as an input for a statistical model the results of the propagation of soil moisture uncertainties to the model output indicate that initial condition uncertainties are sensitive to the variability of low flow and have less significance in the variability of high flow similarly lst satellite data have been assimilated in land surface models to improve predictions of energy and water fluxes in previous studies han et al 2015 ghent et al 2010 reichle et al 2010 and have been used for hydrological model calibrations zink et al 2018 however this study evaluates the predictive skill of lst with respect to water levels the findings of the present study broadly support previous work in the sensitivity of lst to changes in hydrologic characteristics the results show that lst data has a similar magnitude of contribution to water level uncertainty as soil moisture data the novel contribution of this work is to demonstrate the propagation of uncertainties from multiple satellite data sources to the model outputs one of the key findings of the uncertainty analysis is that the 90 confidence intervals in the high flows wet seasons are wider than those in the low flows dry seasons this improved sharpness in the low flows demonstrates that it is easier to model environmental flows than peak flows this is because satellite precipitation has higher variance in the wet season than in the dry season dos reis et al 2017 in the dry season soil moisture contributed strongly to the total uncertainty consistent with korres et al 2015 who showed that lower sm content tend to have higher coefficient of variation and vice versa in the wet season soil is saturated and less impacted by precipitation variations whereas unsaturated soil in the dry season is considerably influenced by precipitation variations in the two predictor model we found that during high flows most of the uncertainty is due to δlst uncertainties in the wet seasons the microwave sensor lst lprm amsr 2 was used to fill gaps in missing data of the optical sensor lst myd11a1 because the microwave sensor lst has higher uncertainties compared to the optical sensor lst this gap filling also contributes to the uncertainty in the model outputs in the wet seasons developing alternative ways to gap fill lst data that minimizes the uncertainty and could therefore improve flood predictions the improved sharpness at the two downstream stations show the benefits of using more satellite input data along with information on upstream water levels uncertainty in the modelled upstream water levels influenced the overall uncertainty at the downstream virtual stations the uncertainty from the multiple satellite data sources used to model the river heights at the upstream virtual gauge e g vs 140 propagates through to the downstream model e g vs 179 one alternative would be to directly use satellite altimetry measurements and their associated uncertainties to provide the upstream water levels for the prediction model instead of the modelled water level however the rmse of the modelled water levels in this study 0 74 m 1 71 m is similar to the rmse of the jason 2 satellite altimetry data itself 0 6 m 1 1 m domeneghetti et al 2015 and ers 2 and envisat altimeters 0 46 m 1 24 m birkinshaw et al 2010 therefore there would be limited benefit in directly using upstream satellite altimeter data with the drawback that only 10 day or 35 day water levels are available for these products compared to the daily modelled water level data comparing the total variance in the predicted water levels to the sum of the uncertainty in each of the predictors is useful to understand interactions between predictors if the errors in the predictors are all independent then the sum of the individual variances would be equal to the total variance here some interactions were identified particularly at vs 179 fig 7 suggesting that uncertainties in the predictors are correlated further study of the interactions between different satellite product errors would be worthwhile to understand this pattern 5 3 application to other ungauged sparsely gauged regions the daily water level estimation shown here from multi source satellite products suggest that similarly to the findings in siddique e akbor et al 2014 wanders et al 2014a and zink et al 2018 satellite data can be used to improve model performance this has implications for improved predictions in ungauged or sparsely gauged basins however the findings in this study were made under specific topographic climatic and vegetation conditions the results show that improved model performance is found in low relief areas this is because the accuracy of satellite based precipitation and soil moisture are lower in complex terrain therefore when adapting the model to other regions modelers should consider the complexity of topography in addition basins with highly dense vegetation have negative impacts on performances of satellite soil moisture observations and satellite altimetry to apply the proposed model to such regions pre processing data should be carried out carefully moreover the climate of the study area is classified as tropical monsoonal without snowfall the implications of the model over snow cover regions might be a limitation also lower mekong river which is a perennial river with large river width further research should be undertaken to investigate the applicability of this model to other types of rivers intermittent and ephemeral and narrower rivers to have a full picture of the implication of the proposed model due to sparse meteorological and hydrological measurement networks it is difficult to select sufficient data for implementing machine learning techniques or physical models for such prediction problems we have shown that a reasonably simple statistical model based on multiple satellite data can be used provide early warning of high water levels in poorly gauged areas in future works it might be possible to apply this approach in different climate regions or different landscapes mountainous or low relief areas to understand the performance of the prediction model under different conditions it should be noted that due to limitations of satellite sensors in different observed conditions some satellite observations are unreliable over some types of land cover a modeller should initially check the correlations between satellite based predictors and the response of interest as a pre screening step in the model set up if a predictor does not provide useful information for the model prediction it should be removed from the model 6 conclusion the main goals of the current study are to predict daily time series of river heights from multisource satellite data at ungauged regions and to assess the responsibility of uncertainties of multiple satellite data and the upstream modelled water levels in the variability of the modelled water levels the key findings are the efficiency reliability and sharpness of the prediction model with multisource satellite products shows that the model is useful for flood warning systems and near real time reservoir operation processes in ungauged regions the new seasonal linear model with multisource satellite data precipitation soil moisture δlst and the predicted river heights from upstream station is better than the previous models that used single satellite input data or merging multi mission of satellite altimetry high variances in the modeled water level ensembles occur in the transition between seasons and in the high flow periods the evidence of the contribution of uncertainties of multiple satellite data suggests that the overall model output error is attributed to both uncertainties of multiple satellite data and their interactions further studies regarding the insights in the model performance in another poorly gauged areas and the interaction of multiple satellite uncertainties would be worthwhile the methods used here highlight the importance of uncertainty quantification and

4239,forests exert control on snowpack properties and processes through their modification of energy balance and micrometeorological conditions though forest disturbance by fire is increasing in frequency and severity in many warm regions containing seasonal snowpacks increases are also expected in high latitude and altitude regions as a result of climate change the influence of fire on snowpack internal thermodynamics particularly at the snowpack tree stem interface has yet to be examined this study measured tree stem temperatures horizontal snowpack temperatures surrounding tree stems vertical internal snowpack temperatures and micrometeorological variables to determine snowpack thermodynamics in undisturbed and fire disturbed eucalyptus pauciflora snow gum forests in the australian alps analysis focused on average snowpack temperature characteristics of each area and the micrometeorological drivers of internal snowpack temperatures shortwave radiation at the fire disturbed forest was 700 higher than that of the undisturbed forest with stem temperatures exceeding ambient air temperature by an average of 5 3 c by comparison average stem temperatures at the undisturbed forest were an average of 1 8 c lower than ambient air temperatures increased stem temperatures were associated with tree wells of more uniform development in size shape and distribution within the fire disturbed forest increased shortwave radiation and ambient air temperature at the fire disturbed forest coincided with greater diurnal variation in snowpack temperature in general snowpack temperature was heavily dependent on location in the snowpack surrounding the stem and snowpack depth ambient air temperature was found to be the primary meteorological driver of horizontal snowpack temperature changes when examining variable importance from a random forest regression model this study finds that changes in snowpack dynamics at the scale of individual tree stems is very important when considering fire impacts on hydrological processes in forested regions keywords snowpack thermodynamics bushfire tree well forest 1 introduction mountain snowpacks provide critical water for ecosystems agriculture recreation and energy production these snowpacks often exist in sub alpine forests that exert controls on their energy balance accumulation and ablation processes anthropogenic climate change has resulted in warmer montane temperatures lópez moreno et al 2008 changes to synoptic weather patterns pepler et al 2019 schwartz et al 2020b theobald et al 2016 and forest disturbance through fire and pest abatzoglou and williams 2016 welch et al 2016 this has decreased longevity and depth of seasonal montane snowpacks gleason et al 2013 disturbance to high altitude forests is expected to increase in frequency as climate continues to warm lucas et al 2007 stocker et al 2014 likely with long lasting impacts to snowpack dynamics and montane region water resources therefore it is important to identify relationships between sub alpine forests the snowpacks contained within them and the effect that forest disturbance has on those relationships forest canopies are known to exert control on snowpack energy balance berris and harr 1987 gryning et al 2001 harding and pomeroy 1996 accumulation and distribution sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 and ablation gleason et al 2013 disturbance by fire significantly alters these processes through changes to vegetation cover and color resulting in decreased snowpack depth and longevity gleason et al 2013 schwartz et al 2020a gleason et al 2013 showed that forest shedding of pyrogenic carbon reduced snowpack albedo and increased shortwave radiation in conjunction with reduction of canopy cover due to fire disturbance similarly snowpack distribution and depth within forests is altered by fire disturbance and effects can be complex with increases to ablation correlated to fire severity and scale dependent effects on accumulation stevens 2017 warm climate snowpacks are highly susceptible to changes in energy balance parameters particularly radiative and turbulent exchanges fayad et al 2017 lundquist et al 2013 schwartz et al 2020a these snowpacks often occur in landscapes that have an increased susceptibility to fires predicted to increase in intensity and severity as climate warms further lucas et al 2007 sub alpine forests can be slow to recover as they may not be adapted to occurrence of fire which can lead to effects of fire disturbance existing for several decades schwartz et al 2020a repeated fire disturbance will reduce forest regeneration in many of these areas fairman et al 2017 and will lead to long term changes of hydrology and water availability for ecosystem and anthropogenic use knowledge of snowpack and tree stem interactions is currently limited to snowpack depth and surface melt surrounding individual stems hardy and albert 1995 musselman et al 2008 woo and giesbrecht 2000 and has not identified the thermodynamic effects of tree stem temperature on surrounding snowpack many snowpack energy balance studies and hydrological models rely on the assumption that tree canopy and stem temperature are equivalent to ambient air temperature boon 2009 essery et al 2008 however observations made by pomeroy et al 2009 showed warmer canopy temperatures and significant variability when compared to those approximated using air temperature due to solar radiation incident on tree canopy and trunks similarly webster et al 2016 found that tree stem temperatures exceeded air temperatures by up to 25 c which led to errors in modelling incoming sub canopy longwave radiation with a two part air temperature model larch tree stems are also known to exceed surrounding canopy temperatures by as much as 18 c on clear sky days webster et al 2017 however tree stems have been shown to contribute relatively little longwave energy to the snowpack with only highly localized effects on snowmelt which are consistent with observations of tree wells musselman and pomeroy 2017 the effects of tree stems may be enhanced when applied to warm climate snowpacks that often have higher daily net shortwave radiation values than their cold region counterparts that can contribute higher levels of energy to the forests similarly snowpack thermal transfer has traditionally been based on spatially homogenous vertical thermal gradients driven by heat fluxes at interfaces with the atmosphere or soil luce and tarboton 2001 burns et al 2014 showed seasonal variability in snowpack temperatures including the development of several distinct isothermal periods at a study site near niwot ridge in colorado that were the result of synoptic and chinook wind controls on ambient air temperature however these assumptions omit possible horizontal heat transfer at the tree stem to snowpack interface which may be enhanced by charring and darkening of tree stems in response to fire disturbance eucalyptus pauciflora snow gum forests in the australian alps have undergone significant alteration due to large bushfires in 2003 worboys 2003 and the black

gap in knowledge of internal e pauciflora forest snowpack thermodynamics following disturbance of the forest by fire to do this four primary objectives were addressed 1 investigation of tree stem

seasonal snowpack of the australian alps has been defined as having marginal characteristics bilish et al 2019 bilish et al 2018 schwartz et al 2020a as it is affected by relatively warm winter air

snowpack exists at altitudes above 1500 m a s l which coincides with 1400 km2 of pure e pauciflora forests e pauciflora are broadleaf evergreen trees that retain their leaves throughout the year resulting in little variation of vegetation indices between seasons these forests are particularly vulnerable to fire have slow regrowth following fire disturbance pickering and barry 2005 and have increased mortality resulting from subsequent fires fairman et al 2017 this is of concern as e pauciflora woodland is present throughout the australian alps and exists in 57 of the area s biomes

forests with regular seasonal snowpack the impact of fire at the scale of individual tree stems is highly significant to forest snowpack processes given both the extent of e pauciflora forests and magnitude of recent fire impact in a region that is dependent on snowpack runoff as a vital source of water 3 snowpack and tree stem measurements measurements were made within two e pauciflora forests an undisturbed forest 36 432 s 148 368 w 1851 m and a fire disturbed forest 36 410 s 148 421 w 1842 m fig 2 c in kosciuszko national park new south wales australia fig 1c the two measurement sites were approximately 5 km apart and both sites had a northeast aspect of 13 at the undisturbed forest and 20 at the fire disturbed forest fire disturbance occurred in 2003 and limited coppiced regrowth had developed with maximum tree heights of approximately two meters at the time of this study fig 3 vegetation area index vai and sky view factor measurements were collected at 5 m intervals along 50 m transects with the 25 m measurements occurring directly at the energy balance instrumentation at both forested sites vai was 78 higher 1 85 at the undisturbed forest than the fire disturbed forest 0

fire disturbed forest 8400 stems ha 1 than in the undisturbed forest 1900 stems ha 1 while regrowth within the fire disturbed forest contributed to higher stem density its relatively short height had a minimal impact on vai measurements of tree stem diameter at breast height dbh showed similar sizes of stems in the forests with a mean dbh of 18 cm at the undisturbed forest and 16 cm at the fire disturbed forest which may have been the result of an additional 15 years of growth at the undisturbed site fire disturbance at the site had occurred 15 years earlier 2003 fires so some characteristics generally associated with recent fire such as tree stem char no longer existed herein the terms undisturbed and fire disturbed are used to avoid confusion about forest characteristics

than other options type k j at study temperatures measured thermocouples were calibrated using ice baths and all were found to be within 0 075 c of the control temperature ten thermocouple ladders fig 2a were built to record snowpack temperature at 10 cm intervals with 8 being used to measure temperature variation surrounding tree stems and two measuring vertical temperature profiles of the snowpack fig 2 the ladders consisted of mono filament nylon line that held the thermocouples between rigid frames of pvc plastic tubing both of which were chosen for their low thermal conductivity six thermocouples were manufactured to measure internal tree stem temperature at the sites in addition to the 100 manufactured for the ladders vertical thermocouple ladders were installed at both forested sites between 29 april 2018 and 1 may 2018 and made measurements during the 2018 and 2019 snowpack seasons fig 1 the same forest locations were used in schwartz et al 2020a diagrams of the instrumentation at both sites can be seen in fig 3 both vertical thermocouple ladders were within 1 5 m of the horizontal thermocouple measurements an e pauciflora stem representative of the stems in the surrounding stand and proximal to the energy balance instrumentation was instrumented at the undisturbed forest on 30 april 2019 thermocouple ladders were placed around the stem at north 0 east 90 south 180 and west 270 orientations at a constant height of 30 cm a g l as stems were generally in clusters within the fire disturbed forest finding an individual stem to instrument without interference from others was problematic as such two proximal stems separated by 1 m located near the energy balance instrumentation at the fire disturbed forest were instrumented with the north 0 and east 90 ladders on the eastern stem and the south 180 and west 270 ladders on the western stem fig 2b installation of the horizontal thermocouple ladders at the fire disturbed forest occurred on 1 may 2019 any underbrush beneath the ladders at either site was trimmed to prevent temperature measurement from sources other than the desired stems cavities at heights of 33 cm 66 cm and 99 cm a g l were drilled to a depth of 3 cm on the north side of the single stem at the undisturbed forest and on the north side of the western stem at the fire disturbed forest individual thermocouples were placed in each of the holes that were then plugged with silicon sealing putty 4 snowpack temperature interpolation though temperature measurements were made on four sides of the stems values between the thermocouple ladders were interpolated to provide a more comprehensive overview of the snowpack characteristics interpolated values followed the horizontal distancing of the measured values extending from 0 1 m to 1 0 m away from each tree stem in addition to the measurements at the four existing angles 0 90 180 and 270 interpolated values were added at 4 5 angle increments between the existing values for a total of 810 measured and interpolated values interpolated values were calculated by determining the ratio of the position between the two measured values from 0 to 1 using ratio θ int θ m 90 where θ int is the angle of the value needing to be interpolated and θ m is the angle of the nearest measured value that does not exceed θ int once the interpolated value location ratio was determined the value was calculated using the equation tem p θ int x r a t i o θ m 90 x 1 r a t i o θ m x where x is the distance from the tree stem of the interpolated value tem p θ int x is the interpolated temperature value at a specific angle and horizontal distance from the tree stem θ m 90 x is the measured temperature value at the corresponding distance at the thermocouple ladder angle greater than that of the value being interpolated and θ m x is the measured temperature at the corresponding distance at the thermocouple ladder angle less than the angle of the interpolated value 5 data analysis periods with snowpack depth 40 cm were chosen for analysis of horizontal snowpack thermodynamics as these periods ensured coverage of the horizontal thermocouple ladders that were placed 30 cm above ground level east 90 thermocouple values were omitted from analysis as both ladders were likely moved by weather or animal before the seasonal snowpack was established and the thermocouples were in contact with the ground surface for the entirety of the season reference to specific thermocouples on the horizontal ladders is made by combining the first letter of the ladder direction n w or s and the distance of the thermocouple from the tree stem in cm 10 100 cm vertical thermocouples above the snowpack as determined by measured snowpack depth were removed from analysis to ensure correct representativeness of internal snowpack temperatures with minimal contamination from ambient air temperature however as snowpack depth is rarely homogenous and depth measurements were made 5 m from the vertical thermocouple ladder at the undisturbed site and 2 m from the vertical ladder at the fire disturbed site occasional temperature measurements at the top of the snowpack may include air temperature data data loss occurred due to power failure at the undisturbed forest site prior to 2 august 2018 intermittently during august 2018 and after 4 september 2019 5 1 snowpack temperature variable importance the supervised machine learning algorithm random forest breiman 2001 was used to build regression models of snowpack temperature around the tree stems at each site variables used as inputs were thermocouple ladder location n w or s thermocouple distance from the tree stem 10 100 cm at 10 cm intervals snowpack depth ds ambient air temperature td and energy balance values for the 30 minute period including net shortwave k and net longwave radiation l sensible qh latent qe ground qg and rain qr heat fluxes variable importance for change in temperature was determined by examining the percent increase of mean squared error mse due to random permutation of each variable liaw and wiener 2002 6 background on site snowpack energy balances schwartz et al 2020a examined the energy balances of the sites used in this paper and found that net shortwave radiation was 347 higher in the fire disturbed forest stand across the snowpack season which was primarily due to reduction in canopy cover at the site and lower albedo that resulted from shedding of woody debris onto the snowpack similarly increases to turbulent fluxes were noted at the fire disturbed forest compared to the undisturbed forest due to increases in wind speeds from reduction in canopy cover schwartz et al 2020a overall schwartz et al 2020a showed that e pauciflora canopies moderated energy fluxes to the snowpack by reducing turbulent and radiative fluxes 7 results analysis herein examines the tree stem to snowpack interface in relation to the primary study objectives beginning with internal tree stem temperature characteristics section 7 1 and then horizontal snowpack temperature trends surrounding tree stems section 7 2 relationships between meteorological conditions including energy balance parameters and snowpack temperatures at the tree stem interface are also investigated section 7 3 finally an analysis of vertical snowpack temperature trends in each of the areas is presented to expand on the horizontal temperature trends and develop a comprehensive overview of internal snowpack thermodynamics at each site section 7 4 7 1 tree stem temperatures vertical tree stem temperatures and their relationship to ambient air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation were investigated to develop an understanding of the controls for tree stem to snowpack heat transfer mean daily ambient air temperature tree stem temperature and net shortwave radiation at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests during periods with 40 cm snowpack depth were investigated and found higher solar radiation to the snowpack and warmer tree stem surfaces at the fire disturbed site fig 4 cumulative daily shortwave radiation was seven times higher at the fire disturbed forest 5 41 mj m2 day 1 compared to the undisturbed forest 0 77 mj m2 day 1 which resulted in stem temperatures that exceeded ambient air temperatures on most days maximum temperature of the fire disturbed stem at 99 cm a g l exceeded maximum ambient air temperatures on 87 of days and was an average of 5 3 c warmer than the surrounding air by comparison temperatures at 99 cm a g l in the undisturbed stem only exceeded ambient air temperatures on 20 of days and averaged 1 8 c lower the substantial increase in stem temperatures within the fire disturbed forest suggests shortwave radiation is the dominant control on stem temperature peaks in tree stem temperatures occurred later in the undisturbed forest 17 30 than at the fire disturbed forest which had the maximum average daily temperature between 15 30 and 16 00 fire disturbed stem temperatures immediately prior to sunrise at 99 cm and 66 cm a g l were colder than surrounding ambient air temperatures stem temperatures at all heights at the undisturbed forest remained higher than ambient air temperatures during the entirety of the night the higher rates of fluctuation in fire disturbed stem temperature could be due to two factors 1 increased solar radiation from a reduction of canopy cover contributed significant amounts of energy to the stems 2 while no measurements of stem wood density were taken the relatively brittle and dry fire disturbed stems likely had a lower heat capacity than those of the healthy trees which would result in higher heat transfer with the sub canopy air space and snowpack interface 7 2 snowpack horizontal temperatures snowpack temperatures radiating horizontally from tree stems at the undisturbed and fire disturbed sites were evaluated to determine spatiotemporal patterns of thermal contributions from tree stems to the snowpack snow cover was present at both sites from 27 may 2019 and continued through to mid september 2019 four periods totalling 57 days were used for analysis of horizontal temperature data at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests two periods in late autumn early winter may 30 2019 to june 1 2019 one mid winter period from 13 july 2019 to 2 august 2019 and a late winter period from 8 august 2019 to 4 september 2019 snowpack depth was generally less at the fire disturbed forest from 1 may 2019 to 1 october 2019 mean difference of 32 cm with the exception of late may early june 2019 fig 5 7 2 1 tree well development snowpack tree wells provide a greater surface area for the interaction of sub canopy air and the snowpack may act to alter tree stem to snowpack heat exchange and were investigated during periods of tree well development at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests in general tree wells were more consistent in size and shape at the snowpack surface within the fire disturbed forest figs 6c 6 d and were more uniform in their distribution than those that developed in the undisturbed forest figs 6a 6b that were often only on the north and west sides of the stems fig 6b these results are consistent with the same interpretation from section 7 1 that canopy induced differences in incoming shortwave impact individual stem temperatures and this also translates into explaining variation in the depth width and overall shape of snowpack tree wells development of tree wells was identified by determining periods of temperatures above 0 c at the first thermocouple on the horizontal ladders which corresponded to a 10 cm distance from the tree stem three of these periods developed at the fire disturbed forest during the snowpack season fig 5 15 july 2019 to 8 august 2019 17 august 2019 to 5 september 2019 and 7 september 2019 to 16 september 2019 when the snowpack depth fell below 40 cm initial development of tree wells was expected to be on the northern and western side of stems as incident shortwave radiation would have been highest on those sides however no consistent pattern in the direction of tree well development was noted between the three events as development during the first event was w10 n10 s10 and the other two tree wells developed on all sides of the stem simultaneously it is likely that the 7 september 2019 tree well was a continuation of the previous 17 august 2019 development as temperatures above 0 c quickly developed 2 days on all sides following a brief snowfall period tree well signatures when temperatures above 0 c existed at the first thermocouple on a horizontal ladder in snowpack temperature were not as evident at the undisturbed forest as they were at the fire disturbed forest periods where greater variation in temperature of the 10 cm horizontal thermocouples was noted on all sides of the stem but temperatures generally stayed at or below 0 c including the thermocouples closest to the stem as such it was difficult to ascertain when tree wells developed following periods of snowfall within the undisturbed forest 7 2 2 average daily snowpack horizontal temperature patterns greater tree well development at the fire disturbed site creates a potential for greater sensible heat and longwave fluxes to the snowpack this would likely result in warmer snowpack temperatures at the fire disturbed forest particularly on the north and west sides of the stem where greatest incoming solar radiation would be present average snowpack temperatures surrounding the tree stems were nearly identical with only a 0 02 c difference between the fire disturbed stem and the undisturbed forest stem fig 7 which is within the error range of the thermocouples used for measurement however mean variation in snowpack temperature over a 24 hour period was 0 8 c lower in the undisturbed forest 0 4 c than the fire disturbed forest 1 2 c suggesting greater control by diurnal patterns of shortwave radiation and ambient air temperature fig 4 in the larger tree wells at the fire disturbed forest changes in snowpack temperature began at the tree stem to snowpack interface and travelled away from the stem these changes and the corresponding radial pulses of temperature change were particularly pronounced at the fire disturbed forest and were associated with its greater variability in stem and air temperatures fig 4 intrusion of cold temperatures at the tree stem to snowpack interface occurred at similar times between the two sites with decreases in temperature at the undisturbed stem occurring at 00 00 and two hours earlier at 22 00 at the fire disturbed stem increase in daily snowpack temperature began after sunrise 08 00 at the fire disturbed site on the north side of the tree stem before developing on the south and west sides whereas warming occurred relatively uniformly surrounding the undisturbed stem two hours later 10 00 maximum daily snowpack temperatures around the stems occurred 5 h later at the undisturbed forest 22 30 than at the fire disturbed forest 17 30 snowpack on the southern side of undisturbed stem showed the smallest variation σ 0 4 c throughout the day compared to the northern σ 0 5 c and western σ 0 7 c sides the fire disturbed forest had similar variation on the south and west side of the stem 1 2 c and 1 1 c respectively but the greatest variation occurred on the northern side of the stem 1 6 c comparisons of seasonal mean horizontal temperatures showed that the south ladder measured generally warmer snowpack at the undisturbed forest fig 8 a but had the coldest temperatures of all measurements at the fire disturbed forest fig 8b both sites showed reduction of temperature variation between ladders and convergence of mean snowpack temperatures for ladders of all aspects as distance from tree stems increased similar to temporal variation in snowpack temperatures spatial variation of snowpack temperature surrounding the stems was highest at the fire disturbed forest fire disturbed forest σ 0 2 c undisturbed forest σ 0 1 c despite increased day time variation 08 00 and 17 00 greatest variation in snowpack temperatures occurred closest to both tree stems σn10 1 5 c σw10 1 5 c σs10 1 0 c with larger magnitude diurnal patterns occurring in these locations than those further away from the stems σn100 0 8 c σw100 0 8 c σs100 0 7 c standard deviation of seasonal snowpack temperatures was greatest at the fire disturbed forest σ 1 5 c with the standard deviations of all thermocouples exceeding those of the undisturbed forest σ 0 7 c by an average of 114 greatest increase in standard deviation between the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests occurred between the south ladders with s10 standard deviation increasing from 0 3 c to 1 7 c 467 a pearson correlation test showed that distance from stem and temperature standard deviation had a correlation of 0 71 r2 0 50 p value 0 05 at the fire disturbed forest as all ladders experienced a decrease with increased distance however south ladder temperature standard deviations at the undisturbed forest increased with distance and prevented a similarly significant correlation at that site a correlation similar to that of the fire disturbed forest was found at the undisturbed forest 0 69 r2 0 48 p value 0 05 when the south ladder was removed from the analysis 7 3 drivers of snowpack horizontal temperatures as forest canopy removal fundamentally changes snowpack energy balance and tree stem interaction with the sub canopy air space drivers of horizontal snowpack energy balance exchange were investigated at both areas to determine bushfire alteration of snowpack processes surrounding tree stems thermocouple location in the snowpack surrounding the tree stem was the most important variable in modelling snowpack temperature at both sites fig 9 ladder direction n w and s was the most important variable at the two sites and resulted in an increase to mse of 363 when permutated at the undisturbed forest and an increase of 252 at the fire disturbed forest which can likely be attributed to the increased shortwave radiation incident on the northern side of the tree stems thermocouple distance from stem was the second most important variable in modelling snowpack temperature with increases to mse of 310 and 198 at the undisturbed forest and fire disturbed forest respectively other than qg greater response to changes in all variables occurred at the undisturbed forest snowpack depth was the third most important variable in snowpack temperature at both sites but had increased importance at the undisturbed forest 173 increase in mse though analysis was conducted with periods of 40 cm of snow at the sites the larger variation in snowpack depth at the undisturbed forest throughout the season likely contributed to the increased importance when compared to the fire disturbed forest 95 increase in mse ambient air temperature had a relatively high importance to snowpack temperature at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests 121 and 54 increase in mse respectively as did qg 130 and 188 increase in mse respectively thirty minute bulk averaged energy balance measurements had relatively little importance overall model output from the fire disturbed forest showed that l was associated with greater changes in snowpack temperature than k suggesting greater influence of stem longwave radiation transfer on snowpack temperatures at depth than k however the opposite was true at the undisturbed forest where k was associated with greater change in snowpack temperature than l it is possible that the modelled increased importance of k at the undisturbed forest is a result of longwave radiation at the site remaining relatively constant due to canopy modulation of radiative fluxes schwartz et al 2020a this would potentially allow for relatively small differences in k to have a greater effect on snowpack temperatures similarly qh had a higher importance than qe as stem exchange of sensible heat would provide more heat than the more snowpack surface based evaporative processes 7 4 vertical snowpack temperature given schwartz et al 2020a demonstrated that fire modifies forest canopy and snowpack energetics in favor of greater net shortwave radiation and increased turbulent fluxes higher variation in vertical snowpack temperatures would be expected from fire disturbed forests in this study we found that a clear response to diurnal radiation and ambient air temperature patterns existed in the top 10 cm of the snowpacks fig 10 with the undisturbed forest snowpack having a higher daily temperature and lower variation 1 6 1 5 c than the fire disturbed forest 2 2 2 2 c mean daily temperatures 10 cm a g l were lower at the undisturbed forest 0 7 c than at the fire disturbed forest 0 5 c and diurnal signals that matched those of the surface did develop at the undisturbed forest in august 2018 and september 2018 it is possible that this was caused by development of cavities between the ground and snowpack which were confirmed as a common occurrence when taking manual snow depth measurements during the 2018 snowpack season details of snowpack diurnal temperature signals and exchanges of heat with the sub canopy air space were more apparent when examined at a weekly scale fig 11 though several periods of snowpack basal temperature change occurred 24th 26th and 28th july 2019 at the undisturbed forest site the majority of snowpack temperature influence at both sites was from surface processes that permeated downward these temperature changes were generally concentrated within the top 10 30 cm of the snowpack but did affect deeper regions when warmer or colder air temperatures occurred for prolonged periods such as on 24th and 25th july 2019 counterintuitively mean vertical snowpack temperatures were higher at the undisturbed forest 0 5 c than at the fire disturbed forest 0 9 c during this week long study period however variation in temperature in the top 10 cm of the snowpack was lower at the undisturbed forest σ 0 97 c than at the fire disturbed forest σ 1 43 c snowpack temperature minima were associated with snowfall periods and low ambient air temperatures and persisted at deeper levels of the snowpack despite re development of diurnal temperature patterns at the surface effects of snowfall periods on snowpack temperatures can also be seen in horizontal temperature measurements fig 5 following 27 30 may 2019 11 14 july 2019 and 8 12 august 2019 periods these regions persisted in the mid to lower levels of the snowpacks despite the re development of diurnal signals after snowfall had stopped and temperatures returned to values closer to the daily means above 0 c 8 discussion 8 1 tree stem temperatures and tree well development snowpack and tree stem temperature data from the 2018 and 2019 snowpack seasons showed significant control on internal snowpack temperatures from tree stems as 1 tree well development allowed for greater contributions of heat to the snowpack through ambient air temperature and 2 bushfire increased mean internal snowpack temperatures and variability but cooled surface temperatures undisturbed forest canopy acted to modulate incoming shortwave radiation schwartz et al 2020a and tree stem temperature in this area was associated with ambient air temperature fluctuations by comparison tree stem temperatures in the fire disturbed forest where sky view factor was 132 higher were largely the result of greater incoming shortwave radiation and exceeded ambient air temperatures regularly which was associated with more uniform development of tree wells this is consistent with the findings of pomeroy et al 2009 in north american lodgepole pine stands that exceeded air temperatures during periods of increased incoming shortwave radiation the higher temperatures of the fire disturbed stem also suggest control by post fire reductions in wood density water sap flow and changes to the internal stem thermodynamics which would have made for easier faster heating of the tree stem when compared to the living stems at the undisturbed forest it is also important to note that the measurements of internal stem temperature may not represent the actual emitted temperatures of the stems as they were at a depth of 3 cm in the stem the spatial heterogeneity of forest canopy and associated micro meteorological processes suggests that differences likely exist between the measured energy balances at the instrumentation towers and those that occurred at the tree stem mazzotti et al 2020 the variation in these fluxes over small distances means that the fluxes included in this analysis may not be completely representative of those that influenced snowpack temperatures at the tree stem interface as such investigation of the spatial variability of these fluxes within snow gum forests and methods for identifying the fluxes at the tree stem should be a priority for further work identification of tree well development was problematic in the undisturbed forest and is believed to be due to several reasons 1 snowpack depth was greater at the undisturbed forest and greater tree well depth was needed to affect the temperatures of the thermocouple ladders at 30 cm a g l 2 incoming shortwave radiation that could impact tree stems and subsequent radiative and thermal exchange at the snowpack tree stem interface was less than at the fire disturbed forest and 3 turbulent mixing of air in undisturbed forest tree wells was at a minimum due to canopy reduction of wind speeds and turbulent fluxes schwartz et al 2020a the development of tree wells through radiative and thermal processes between the snowpack tree stem interface is an important consideration for understanding the impact of fire on sub alpine hydrology sub alpine forest ecosystems are expected to be subjected to increased fire frequency and severity due to climate change including across north america abatzoglou and williams 2016 and australia lucas et al 2007 this study shows that the contribution of additional heat to the snowpack by these tree wells while occurring at the micro tree stand level when translated across fire impacted landscapes such as what has been seen within australia in 2003 and 2019 20 will result in more marginal snowpack characteristics this is particularly an issue for locations that already have warm dense and shallow marginal snowpacks and areas with greater sensitivity to changes in synoptic conditions and resulting energy balance 8 2 horizontal heat to the snowpack from tree stems and tree wells shortwave radiation is often the dominant control on snowpack energy fluxes at the surface for warm snowpacks fayad et al 2017 schwartz et al 2020a schwartz et al 2020b in this study air temperature has been found to be the primary atmospheric driver of internal temperature change on horizontal thermocouples near tree stems which is similar to what was found by burns et al 2014 snowpack depth was also identified as an important control on snowpack temperature and had a greater effect at the fire disturbed forest the increased importance in snow depth can likely be attributed to lower snow depths at the site and the 30 cm measurement heights of the horizontal thermocouple ladders snowpack depths at the site were much closer to the depth of the measurements and any changes in depth would have resulted in a greater impact on the temperature and energy fluxes to the thermocouple locations it is important to note that snowpack depth likely had a significant and uneven effect on the horizontal measurements of snowpack temperature around the tree stems as the depths at each site were significantly different ideally these measurements would have been made at similar depths from the top of the snowpack rather than at consistent heights above the ground level and this should be a focus of future research consistent with past work turbulent fluxes and rain heat flux had little effect on changes to snowpack temperature at 30 cm a g l but longwave radiation was an important consideration as increased stem temperatures from high incident shortwave radiation resulted in increased longwave irradiance from the stems to the snowpack contrary to the findings of the fire disturbed site that had higher temperatures and diurnal variability on the north and west side of stems from increased shortwave radiation the tree stem to snowpack interface at the undisturbed forest acted to reduce surrounding snowpack temperatures on the north and west sides of the stem it is possible that this is due to the lower overnight ambient air temperatures at the undisturbed site entering the tree wells through increased stable stratification of the sub canopy air due to low wind velocities this intrusion of cold air into the tree well and the relatively low temperatures of the tree stems likely allowed the cooler temperatures to persist next to the snowpack and reduce the snowpack temperature at the tree stem interface snowpack on the southern side of stems at both forests had the least temperature variation and had dissimilar temperature trends to snowpack on the western or northern sides snowpack temperatures on the south side of stems were warmest at the undisturbed forest and coldest at the fire disturbed forest as tree well to snowpack thermal exchange acted to warm the snowpack in the fire disturbed forest and cool the snowpack in the undisturbed forest with the thermocouples closest to the undisturbed stem on the north and west sides having lower temperatures the reduced shortwave heating of the stems on the southern side made these areas less likely to be affected by temperature changes as such bushfire modification of e pauciflora forests increases snowpack temperatures substantially through the switch of tree well regulation on the snowpack from temperature reduction to temperature increase 8 3 snowpack vertical temperature characteristics the cooler snowpack surface temperatures of the fire disturbed forest snowpack agree with schwartz et al 2020a that found increased evaporation sublimation that led to latent cooling of the snowpack surface unsurprisingly mean snowpack temperature was largely dependent on snowpack depth as the greatest changes to snowpack temperature occurred in the top 10 30 cm of the snowpack in response to ambient air temperature similarly periods of cooler snowpack temperatures following periods of snowfall and colder ambient temperatures supports the argument made by bilish et al 2018 that the australian snowpack is event driven in nature unlike burns et al 2014 no clear seasonal trends in snowpack temperature were evident and snowpack temperatures remained isothermal for the majority of the period the development of cold pools throughout the depth of the snowpack following extended periods of cold ambient air temperatures illustrates the importance of cooler ambient air temperatures in moderating snowpack temperature control of the australian snowpack even partially by ambient air temperatures is particularly concerning as trends in synoptic circulation show poleward migration of frontal systems cai et al 2005 catto et al 2014 and increases in anticyclonic conditions in the snowy mountains hendon et al 2007 pepler et al 2019 the resulting reductions in caa and increased susceptibility of the warm and shallow marginal snowpack to changes in energy balance within the fire disturbed forest will result in reduction of snowpack depth and longevity similar to what has been found in previous research at the same sites schwartz et al 2020a a significant limit to this research is that comprehensive snowpack density measurement was not possible and as such establishing density effects on internal thermodynamics was not possible overall the impacts of bushfire increased heat transfer to the snowpack from individual e pauciflora stems through increased incident solar radiation that heated the stems developed tree wells with greater effects on snowpack processes and coincided with increases in snowpack temperature and variation surrounding the stems as this paper reports findings 15 to 16 years following the initial impacts of bushfire in the study area the results presented are likely to underestimate impacts in the years immediately following fire when tree stems would have been charred and likely to deposit increased amounts of char on the snowpack surface close to tree stems increased solar radiation at the snowpack surface and reductions in snowpack depth and longevity schwartz et al 2020a will act in conjunction with these changes to fundamentally alter the hydrology of bushfire disturbed areas of the australian alps similarly these changes will make the snowpack more susceptible to reductions in longevity and depth due to future warming from climate change lópez moreno et al 2008 increases to fire severity and frequency lucas et al 2007 in combination with higher e pauciflora mortality from successive fire events fairman et al 2017 and slow regrowth will result in long lasting hydrological implications following bushfire including in the forests studied in this paper this has implications for fire prone snow covered areas globally 9 conclusions bushfire disturbance to e pauciflora forest in the australian alps significantly altered snowpack tree stem interactions and internal snowpack thermodynamics reductions in forest canopy cover increased incident shortwave radiation on the tree stems in the fire disturbed forest that were associated with the development of well defined tree well periods tree well development resulted in opposing temperature contributions to the snowpack surrounding stems as stems cooled snowpack temperatures in the undisturbed forest and warmed temperatures in the fire disturbed forest snowpack temperature surrounding stems was primarily dependent on location distance from stem snowpack depth and ambient air temperature though vertical snowpack temperature trends were relatively similar at each site the reduced snow depth at the fire disturbed forest made it more responsive to changes in air temperatures throughout the entire depth of the snowpack the clear diurnal and snowfall event driven impacts on snowpack temperature agreed with the event driven assessment of snowpack processes discussed in prior research bilish et al 2018 schwartz et al 2020a schwartz et al 2020b as a result areas impacted by bushfire are more susceptible to changes in atmospheric parameters fire intensity and frequency is expected to increase due to climate change in many regions including north america abatzoglou and williams 2016 and australia lucas et al 2007 the resulting alteration of forests and snowpack processes within them will likely contribute to reductions in snowpack longevity as such the bushfire impacted australian snowpack can be considered a proxy for snowpacks that will either develop new or continued marginal characteristics as climate change progresses and fire becomes

4239,forests exert control on snowpack properties and processes through their modification of energy balance and micrometeorological conditions though forest disturbance by fire is increasing in frequency and severity in many warm regions containing seasonal snowpacks increases are also expected in high latitude and altitude regions as a result of climate change the influence of fire on snowpack internal thermodynamics particularly at the snowpack tree stem interface has yet to be examined this study measured tree stem temperatures horizontal snowpack temperatures surrounding tree stems vertical internal snowpack temperatures and micrometeorological variables to determine snowpack thermodynamics in undisturbed and fire disturbed eucalyptus pauciflora snow gum forests in the australian alps analysis focused on average snowpack temperature characteristics of each area and the micrometeorological drivers of internal snowpack temperatures shortwave radiation at the fire disturbed forest was 700 higher than that of the undisturbed forest with stem temperatures exceeding ambient air temperature by an average of 5 3 c by comparison average stem temperatures at the undisturbed forest were an average of 1 8 c lower than ambient air temperatures increased stem temperatures were associated with tree wells of more uniform development in size shape and distribution within the fire disturbed forest increased shortwave radiation and ambient air temperature at the fire disturbed forest coincided with greater diurnal variation in snowpack temperature in general snowpack temperature was heavily dependent on location in the snowpack surrounding the stem and snowpack depth ambient air temperature was found to be the primary meteorological driver of horizontal snowpack temperature changes when examining variable importance from a random forest regression model this study finds that changes in snowpack dynamics at the scale of individual tree stems is very important when considering fire impacts on hydrological processes in forested regions keywords snowpack thermodynamics bushfire tree well forest 1 introduction mountain snowpacks provide critical water for ecosystems agriculture recreation and energy production these snowpacks often exist in sub alpine forests that exert controls on their energy balance accumulation and ablation processes anthropogenic climate change has resulted in warmer montane temperatures lópez moreno et al 2008 changes to synoptic weather patterns pepler et al 2019 schwartz et al 2020b theobald et al 2016 and forest disturbance through fire and pest abatzoglou and williams 2016 welch et al 2016 this has decreased longevity and depth of seasonal montane snowpacks gleason et al 2013 disturbance to high altitude forests is expected to increase in frequency as climate continues to warm lucas et al 2007 stocker et al 2014 likely with long lasting impacts to snowpack dynamics and montane region water resources therefore it is important to identify relationships between sub alpine forests the snowpacks contained within them and the effect that forest disturbance has on those relationships forest canopies are known to exert control on snowpack energy balance berris and harr 1987 gryning et al 2001 harding and pomeroy 1996 accumulation and distribution sanmiguel vallelado et al 2020 and ablation gleason et al 2013 disturbance by fire significantly alters these processes through changes to vegetation cover and color resulting in decreased snowpack depth and longevity gleason et al 2013 schwartz et al 2020a gleason et al 2013 showed that forest shedding of pyrogenic carbon reduced snowpack albedo and increased shortwave radiation in conjunction with reduction of canopy cover due to fire disturbance similarly snowpack distribution and depth within forests is altered by fire disturbance and effects can be complex with increases to ablation correlated to fire severity and scale dependent effects on accumulation stevens 2017 warm climate snowpacks are highly susceptible to changes in energy balance parameters particularly radiative and turbulent exchanges fayad et al 2017 lundquist et al 2013 schwartz et al 2020a these snowpacks often occur in landscapes that have an increased susceptibility to fires predicted to increase in intensity and severity as climate warms further lucas et al 2007 sub alpine forests can be slow to recover as they may not be adapted to occurrence of fire which can lead to effects of fire disturbance existing for several decades schwartz et al 2020a repeated fire disturbance will reduce forest regeneration in many of these areas fairman et al 2017 and will lead to long term changes of hydrology and water availability for ecosystem and anthropogenic use knowledge of snowpack and tree stem interactions is currently limited to snowpack depth and surface melt surrounding individual stems hardy and albert 1995 musselman et al 2008 woo and giesbrecht 2000 and has not identified the thermodynamic effects of tree stem temperature on surrounding snowpack many snowpack energy balance studies and hydrological models rely on the assumption that tree canopy and stem temperature are equivalent to ambient air temperature boon 2009 essery et al 2008 however observations made by pomeroy et al 2009 showed warmer canopy temperatures and significant variability when compared to those approximated using air temperature due to solar radiation incident on tree canopy and trunks similarly webster et al 2016 found that tree stem temperatures exceeded air temperatures by up to 25 c which led to errors in modelling incoming sub canopy longwave radiation with a two part air temperature model larch tree stems are also known to exceed surrounding canopy temperatures by as much as 18 c on clear sky days webster et al 2017 however tree stems have been shown to contribute relatively little longwave energy to the snowpack with only highly localized effects on snowmelt which are consistent with observations of tree wells musselman and pomeroy 2017 the effects of tree stems may be enhanced when applied to warm climate snowpacks that often have higher daily net shortwave radiation values than their cold region counterparts that can contribute higher levels of energy to the forests similarly snowpack thermal transfer has traditionally been based on spatially homogenous vertical thermal gradients driven by heat fluxes at interfaces with the atmosphere or soil luce and tarboton 2001 burns et al 2014 showed seasonal variability in snowpack temperatures including the development of several distinct isothermal periods at a study site near niwot ridge in colorado that were the result of synoptic and chinook wind

snowpack exists at altitudes above 1500 m a s l which coincides with 1400 km2 of pure e pauciflora forests e pauciflora are broadleaf evergreen trees that retain their leaves throughout the year resulting in little variation of vegetation indices between seasons these forests are particularly vulnerable to fire have slow regrowth following fire disturbance pickering and barry 2005 and have increased mortality resulting from subsequent fires fairman et al 2017 this is of concern as e pauciflora woodland is present throughout the australian alps and exists in 57 of the area s biomes

forests with regular seasonal snowpack the impact of fire at the scale of individual tree stems is highly significant to forest snowpack processes given both the extent of e pauciflora forests and magnitude of recent fire impact in a region that is dependent on snowpack runoff as a vital source of water 3 snowpack and tree stem measurements measurements were made within two e pauciflora forests an undisturbed forest 36 432 s 148 368 w 1851 m and a fire disturbed forest 36 410 s 148 421 w 1842 m fig 2 c in kosciuszko national park new south wales australia fig 1c the two measurement sites were approximately 5 km apart and both sites had a northeast aspect of 13 at the undisturbed forest and 20 at the fire disturbed forest fire disturbance occurred in 2003 and limited coppiced regrowth had developed with maximum tree heights of approximately two meters at the time of this study fig 3 vegetation area index vai and sky view factor measurements were collected at 5 m intervals along 50 m transects with the 25 m measurements occurring directly at the energy balance instrumentation at both forested sites vai was 78 higher 1 85 at the undisturbed forest than the fire disturbed forest 0 4 and similar characteristics occurred with sky view factor at the sites with 0 34 at the undisturbed forest and 0 79 at the fire disturbed forest however stem density was substantially higher in the fire disturbed forest 8400 stems ha 1 than in the undisturbed forest 1900 stems ha 1 while regrowth within the fire disturbed forest contributed to higher stem density its relatively short height had a minimal impact on vai measurements of tree stem diameter at breast height dbh showed similar sizes of stems in the forests with a mean dbh of 18 cm at the undisturbed forest and 16 cm at the fire disturbed forest which may have been the result of an additional 15 years of growth at the undisturbed site fire disturbance at the site had occurred 15 years earlier 2003 fires so some characteristics generally associated with recent fire such as tree stem char no longer existed herein the terms undisturbed and fire disturbed are used to avoid confusion about forest characteristics

snowpack depth and soil variables energy balance measurements consisted of shortwave and longwave radiation 3 m above ground level sensible and latent heat turbulent fluxes 3 m above ground level and ground and precipitation heat fluxes 10 hz turbulent heat fluxes were measured via eddy covariance and density webb et al 1980 sensor separation and double coordinate rotation stiperski and rotach 2016 corrections were applied snowy hydro limited shl provided precipitation data from a nearby eti noah ii precipitation gauge in a 6 m diameter dual fence inter comparison reference dfir shield rasmussen et al 2012 this paper uses the same approach as schwartz et al 2020a and the reader is referred to that paper for more detailed information on the measurements instrumentation specifications and data processing procedures nickel chromium constantan type e thermocouples with a 24 gauge wire size were selected to measure snowpack temperatures as they have higher accuracy and stronger signal than other options type k j at study temperatures measured thermocouples were calibrated using ice baths and all were found to be within 0 075 c of the control temperature ten thermocouple ladders fig 2a were built to record snowpack temperature at 10 cm intervals with 8 being used to measure temperature variation surrounding tree stems and two measuring vertical temperature profiles of the snowpack fig 2 the ladders consisted of mono filament nylon line that held the thermocouples between rigid frames of pvc plastic tubing both of which were chosen for their low thermal conductivity six thermocouples were manufactured to measure internal tree stem temperature at the sites in addition to the 100 manufactured for the ladders vertical thermocouple ladders were installed at both forested sites between 29 april 2018 and 1 may 2018 and made measurements during the 2018 and 2019 snowpack seasons fig 1 the same forest locations were used in schwartz et al 2020a diagrams of the instrumentation at both sites can be seen in fig 3 both vertical thermocouple ladders were within 1 5 m of the horizontal thermocouple measurements an e pauciflora stem representative of the stems in the surrounding stand and proximal to the energy balance instrumentation was instrumented at the undisturbed forest on 30 april 2019 thermocouple ladders were placed around the stem at north 0 east 90 south 180 and west 270 orientations at a constant height of 30 cm a g l as stems were generally in clusters within the fire disturbed forest finding an individual stem to instrument without interference from others was problematic as such two proximal stems separated by 1 m located near the energy balance instrumentation at the fire disturbed forest were instrumented with the north 0 and east 90 ladders on the eastern stem and the south 180 and west 270 ladders on the western stem fig 2b installation of the horizontal thermocouple ladders at the fire disturbed forest occurred on 1 may 2019 any underbrush beneath the ladders at either site was trimmed to prevent temperature measurement from sources other than the desired stems cavities at heights of 33 cm 66 cm and 99 cm a g l were drilled to a depth of 3 cm on the north side of the single stem at the undisturbed forest and on the north side of the western stem at the fire disturbed forest individual thermocouples were placed in each of the holes that were then plugged with silicon sealing putty 4 snowpack temperature interpolation though temperature measurements were made on four sides of the stems values between the thermocouple ladders were interpolated to provide a more comprehensive overview of the snowpack characteristics interpolated values followed the horizontal distancing of the measured values extending from 0 1 m to 1 0 m away from each tree stem in addition to the measurements at the four existing angles 0 90 180 and 270 interpolated values were added at 4 5 angle increments between the existing values for a total of 810 measured and interpolated values interpolated values were calculated by determining the ratio of the position between the two measured values from 0 to 1 using ratio θ int θ m 90 where θ int is the angle of the value needing to be interpolated and θ m is the angle of the nearest measured value that does not exceed θ int once the interpolated value location ratio was determined the value was calculated using the equation tem p θ int x r a t i o θ m 90 x 1 r a t i o θ m x where x is the distance from the tree stem of the interpolated value tem p θ int x is the interpolated temperature value at a specific angle and horizontal distance from the tree stem θ m 90 x is the measured temperature value at the corresponding distance at the thermocouple ladder angle greater than that of the value being interpolated and θ m x is the measured temperature at the corresponding distance at the thermocouple ladder angle less than the angle of the interpolated value 5 data analysis periods with snowpack depth 40 cm were chosen for analysis of horizontal snowpack thermodynamics as these periods ensured coverage of the horizontal thermocouple ladders that were placed 30 cm above ground level east 90 thermocouple values were omitted from analysis as both ladders were likely moved by weather or animal before the seasonal snowpack was established and the thermocouples were in contact with the ground surface for the entirety of the season reference to specific thermocouples on the horizontal ladders is made by combining the first letter of the ladder direction n w or s and the distance of the thermocouple from the tree stem in cm 10 100 cm vertical thermocouples above the snowpack as determined by measured snowpack depth were removed from analysis to ensure correct representativeness of internal snowpack temperatures with minimal contamination from ambient air temperature however as snowpack depth is rarely homogenous and depth measurements were made 5 m from the vertical thermocouple ladder at the undisturbed site and 2 m from the vertical ladder at the fire disturbed site occasional temperature measurements at the top of the snowpack may include air temperature data data loss occurred due to power failure at the undisturbed forest site prior to 2 august 2018 intermittently during august 2018 and after 4 september 2019 5 1 snowpack temperature variable importance the supervised machine learning algorithm random forest breiman 2001 was used to build regression models of snowpack temperature around the tree stems at each site variables used as inputs were thermocouple ladder location n w or s thermocouple distance from the tree stem 10 100 cm at 10 cm intervals snowpack depth ds ambient air temperature td and energy balance values for the 30 minute period including net shortwave k and net longwave radiation l sensible qh latent qe ground qg and rain qr heat fluxes variable importance for change in temperature was determined by examining the percent increase of mean squared error mse due to random permutation of each variable liaw and wiener 2002 6 background on site snowpack energy balances schwartz et al 2020a examined the energy balances of the sites used in this paper and found that net shortwave radiation was 347 higher in the fire disturbed forest stand across the snowpack season which was primarily due to reduction in canopy cover at the site and lower albedo that resulted from shedding of woody debris onto the snowpack similarly increases to turbulent fluxes were noted at the fire disturbed forest compared to the undisturbed forest due to increases in wind speeds from reduction in canopy cover schwartz et al 2020a overall schwartz et al 2020a showed that e pauciflora canopies moderated energy fluxes to the snowpack by reducing turbulent and radiative fluxes 7 results analysis herein examines the tree stem to snowpack interface in relation to the primary study objectives beginning with internal tree stem temperature characteristics section 7 1 and then horizontal snowpack temperature trends surrounding tree stems section 7 2 relationships between meteorological conditions including energy balance parameters and snowpack temperatures at the tree stem interface are also investigated section 7 3 finally an analysis of vertical snowpack temperature trends in each of the areas is presented to expand on the horizontal temperature trends and develop a comprehensive overview of internal snowpack thermodynamics at each site section 7 4 7 1 tree stem temperatures vertical tree stem temperatures and their relationship to ambient air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation were investigated to develop an understanding of the controls for tree stem to snowpack heat transfer mean daily ambient air temperature tree stem temperature and net shortwave radiation at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests during periods with 40 cm snowpack depth were investigated and found higher solar radiation to the snowpack and warmer tree stem surfaces at the fire disturbed site fig 4 cumulative daily shortwave radiation was seven times higher at the fire disturbed forest 5 41 mj m2 day 1 compared to the undisturbed forest 0 77 mj m2 day 1 which resulted in stem temperatures that exceeded ambient air temperatures on most days maximum temperature of the fire disturbed stem at 99 cm a g l exceeded maximum ambient air temperatures on 87 of days and was an average of 5 3 c warmer than the surrounding air by comparison temperatures at 99 cm a g l in the undisturbed stem only exceeded ambient air temperatures on 20 of days and averaged 1 8 c lower the substantial increase in stem temperatures within the fire disturbed forest suggests shortwave radiation is the dominant control on stem temperature peaks in tree stem temperatures occurred later in the undisturbed forest 17 30 than at the fire disturbed forest which had the maximum average daily temperature between 15 30 and 16 00 fire disturbed stem temperatures immediately prior to sunrise at 99 cm and 66 cm a g l were colder than surrounding ambient air temperatures stem temperatures at all heights at the undisturbed forest remained higher than ambient air temperatures during the entirety of the night the higher rates of fluctuation in fire disturbed stem temperature could be due to two factors 1 increased solar radiation from a reduction of canopy cover contributed significant amounts of energy to the stems 2 while no measurements of stem wood density were taken the relatively brittle and dry fire disturbed stems likely had a lower heat capacity than those of the healthy trees which would result in higher heat transfer with the sub canopy air space and snowpack interface 7 2 snowpack horizontal temperatures snowpack temperatures radiating horizontally from tree stems at the undisturbed and fire disturbed sites were evaluated to determine spatiotemporal patterns of thermal contributions from tree stems to the snowpack snow cover was present at both sites from 27 may 2019 and continued through to mid september 2019 four periods totalling 57 days were used for analysis of horizontal temperature data at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests two periods in late autumn early winter may 30 2019 to june 1 2019 one mid winter period from 13 july 2019 to 2 august 2019 and a late winter period from 8 august 2019 to 4 september 2019 snowpack depth was generally less at the fire disturbed forest from 1 may 2019 to 1 october 2019 mean difference of 32 cm with the exception of late may early june 2019 fig 5 7 2 1 tree well development snowpack tree wells provide a greater surface area for the interaction of sub canopy air and the snowpack may act to alter tree stem to snowpack heat exchange and were investigated during periods of tree well development at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests in general tree wells were more consistent in size and shape at the snowpack surface within the fire disturbed forest figs 6c 6 d and were more uniform in their distribution than those that developed in the undisturbed forest figs 6a 6b that were often only on the north and west sides of the stems fig 6b these results are consistent with the same interpretation from section 7 1 that canopy induced differences in incoming shortwave impact individual stem temperatures and this also translates into explaining variation in the depth width and overall shape of snowpack tree wells development of tree wells was identified by determining periods of temperatures above 0 c at the first thermocouple on the horizontal ladders which corresponded to a 10 cm distance from the tree stem three of these periods developed at the fire disturbed forest during the snowpack season fig 5 15 july 2019 to 8 august 2019 17 august 2019 to 5 september 2019 and 7 september 2019 to 16 september 2019 when the snowpack depth fell below 40 cm initial development of tree wells was expected to be on the northern and western side of stems as incident shortwave radiation would have been highest on those sides however no consistent pattern in the direction of tree well development was noted between the three events as development during the first event was w10 n10 s10 and the other two tree wells developed on all sides of the stem simultaneously it is likely that the 7 september 2019 tree well was a continuation of the previous 17 august 2019 development as temperatures above 0 c quickly developed 2 days on all sides following a brief snowfall period tree well signatures when temperatures above 0 c existed at the first thermocouple on a horizontal ladder in snowpack temperature were not as evident at the undisturbed forest as they were at the fire disturbed forest periods where greater variation in temperature of the 10 cm horizontal thermocouples was noted on all sides of the stem but temperatures generally stayed at or below 0 c including the thermocouples closest to the stem as such it was difficult to ascertain when tree wells developed following periods of snowfall within the undisturbed forest 7 2 2 average daily snowpack horizontal temperature patterns greater tree well development at the fire disturbed site creates a potential for greater sensible heat and longwave fluxes to the snowpack this would likely result in warmer snowpack temperatures at the fire disturbed forest particularly on the north and west sides of the stem where greatest incoming solar radiation would be present average snowpack temperatures surrounding the tree stems were nearly identical with only a 0 02 c difference between the fire disturbed stem and the undisturbed forest stem fig 7 which is within the error range of the thermocouples used for measurement however mean variation in snowpack temperature over a 24 hour period was 0 8 c lower in the undisturbed forest 0 4 c than the fire disturbed forest 1 2 c suggesting greater control by diurnal patterns of shortwave radiation and ambient air temperature fig 4 in the larger tree wells at the fire disturbed forest changes in snowpack temperature began at the tree stem to snowpack interface and travelled away from the stem these changes and the corresponding radial pulses of temperature change were particularly pronounced at the fire disturbed forest and were associated with its greater variability in stem and air temperatures fig 4 intrusion of cold temperatures at the tree stem to snowpack interface occurred at similar times between the two sites with decreases in temperature at the undisturbed stem occurring at 00 00 and two hours earlier at 22 00 at the fire disturbed stem increase in daily snowpack temperature began after sunrise 08 00 at the fire disturbed site on the north side of the tree stem before developing on the south and west sides whereas warming occurred relatively uniformly surrounding the undisturbed stem two hours later 10 00 maximum daily snowpack temperatures around the stems occurred 5 h later at the undisturbed forest 22 30 than at the fire disturbed forest 17 30 snowpack on the southern side of undisturbed stem showed the smallest variation σ 0 4 c throughout the day compared to the northern σ 0 5 c and western σ 0 7 c sides the fire disturbed forest had similar variation on the south and west side of the stem 1 2 c and 1 1 c respectively but the greatest variation occurred on the northern side of the stem 1 6 c comparisons of seasonal mean horizontal temperatures showed that the south ladder measured generally warmer snowpack at the undisturbed forest fig 8 a but had the coldest temperatures of all measurements at the fire disturbed forest fig 8b both sites showed reduction of temperature variation between ladders and convergence of mean snowpack temperatures for ladders of all aspects as distance from tree stems increased similar to temporal variation in snowpack temperatures spatial variation of snowpack temperature surrounding the stems was highest at the fire disturbed forest fire disturbed forest σ 0 2 c undisturbed forest σ 0 1 c despite increased day time variation 08 00 and 17 00 greatest variation in snowpack temperatures occurred closest to both tree stems σn10 1 5 c σw10 1 5 c σs10 1 0 c with larger magnitude diurnal patterns occurring in these locations than those further away from the stems σn100 0 8 c σw100 0 8 c σs100 0 7 c standard deviation of seasonal snowpack temperatures was greatest at the fire disturbed forest σ 1 5 c with the standard deviations of all thermocouples exceeding those of the undisturbed forest σ 0 7 c by an average of 114 greatest increase in standard deviation between the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests occurred between the south ladders with s10 standard deviation increasing from 0 3 c to 1 7 c 467 a pearson correlation test showed that distance from stem and temperature standard deviation had a correlation of 0 71 r2 0 50 p value 0 05 at the fire disturbed forest as all ladders experienced a decrease with increased distance however south ladder temperature standard deviations at the undisturbed forest increased with distance and prevented a similarly significant correlation at that site a correlation similar to that of the fire disturbed forest was found at the undisturbed forest 0 69 r2 0 48 p value 0 05 when the south ladder was removed from the analysis 7 3 drivers of snowpack horizontal temperatures as forest canopy removal fundamentally changes snowpack energy balance and tree stem interaction with the sub canopy air space drivers of horizontal snowpack energy balance exchange were investigated at both areas to determine bushfire alteration of snowpack processes surrounding tree stems thermocouple location in the snowpack surrounding the tree stem was the most important variable in modelling snowpack temperature at both sites fig 9 ladder direction n w and s was the most important variable at the two sites and resulted in an increase to mse of 363 when permutated at the undisturbed forest and an increase of 252 at the fire disturbed forest which can likely be attributed to the increased shortwave radiation incident on the northern side of the tree stems thermocouple distance from stem was the second most important variable in modelling snowpack temperature with increases to mse of 310 and 198 at the undisturbed forest and fire disturbed forest respectively other than qg greater response to changes in all variables occurred at the undisturbed forest snowpack depth was the third most important variable in snowpack temperature at both sites but had increased importance at the undisturbed forest 173 increase in mse though analysis was conducted with periods of 40 cm of snow at the sites the larger variation in snowpack depth at the undisturbed forest throughout the season likely contributed to the increased importance when compared to the fire disturbed forest 95 increase in mse ambient air temperature had a relatively high importance to snowpack temperature at the undisturbed and fire disturbed forests 121 and 54 increase in mse respectively as did qg 130 and 188 increase in mse respectively thirty minute bulk averaged energy balance measurements had relatively little importance overall model output from the fire disturbed forest showed that l was associated with greater changes in snowpack temperature than k suggesting greater influence of stem longwave radiation transfer on snowpack temperatures at depth than k however the opposite was true at the undisturbed forest where k was associated with greater change in snowpack temperature than l it is possible that the modelled increased importance of k at the undisturbed forest is a result of longwave radiation at the site remaining relatively constant due to canopy modulation of radiative fluxes schwartz et al 2020a this would potentially allow for relatively small differences in k to have a greater effect on snowpack temperatures similarly qh had a higher importance than qe as stem exchange of sensible heat would provide more heat than the more snowpack surface based evaporative processes 7 4 vertical snowpack temperature given schwartz et al 2020a demonstrated that fire modifies forest canopy and snowpack energetics in favor of greater net shortwave radiation and increased turbulent fluxes higher variation in vertical snowpack temperatures would be expected from fire disturbed forests in this study we found that a clear response to diurnal radiation and ambient air temperature patterns existed in the top 10 cm of the snowpacks fig 10 with the undisturbed forest snowpack having a higher daily temperature and lower variation 1 6 1 5 c than the fire disturbed forest 2 2 2 2 c mean daily temperatures 10 cm a g l were lower at the undisturbed forest 0 7 c than at the fire disturbed forest 0 5 c and diurnal signals that matched those of the surface did develop at the undisturbed forest in august 2018 and september 2018 it is possible that this was caused by development of cavities between the ground and snowpack which were confirmed as a common occurrence when taking manual snow depth measurements during the 2018 snowpack season details of snowpack diurnal temperature signals and exchanges of heat with the sub canopy air space were more apparent when examined at a weekly scale fig 11 though several periods of snowpack basal temperature change occurred 24th 26th and 28th july 2019 at the undisturbed forest site the majority of snowpack temperature influence at both sites was from surface processes that permeated downward these temperature changes were generally concentrated within the top 10 30 cm of the snowpack but did affect deeper regions when warmer or colder air temperatures occurred for prolonged periods such as on 24th and 25th july 2019 counterintuitively mean vertical snowpack temperatures were higher at the undisturbed forest 0 5 c than at the fire disturbed forest 0 9 c during this week long study period however variation in temperature in the top 10 cm of the snowpack was lower at the undisturbed forest σ 0 97 c than at the fire disturbed forest σ 1 43 c snowpack temperature minima were associated with snowfall periods and low ambient air temperatures and persisted at deeper levels of the snowpack despite re development of diurnal temperature patterns at the surface effects of snowfall periods on snowpack temperatures can also be seen in horizontal temperature measurements fig 5 following 27 30 may 2019 11 14 july 2019 and 8 12 august 2019 periods these regions persisted in the mid to lower levels of the snowpacks despite the re development of diurnal signals after snowfall had stopped and temperatures returned to values closer to the daily means above 0 c 8 discussion 8 1 tree stem temperatures and tree well development snowpack and tree stem temperature data from the 2018 and 2019 snowpack seasons showed significant control on internal snowpack temperatures from tree stems as 1 tree well development allowed for greater contributions of heat to the snowpack through ambient air temperature and 2 bushfire increased mean internal snowpack temperatures and variability but cooled surface temperatures undisturbed forest canopy acted to modulate incoming shortwave radiation schwartz et al 2020a and tree stem temperature in this area was associated with ambient air temperature fluctuations by comparison tree stem temperatures in the fire disturbed forest where sky view factor was 132 higher were largely the result of greater incoming shortwave radiation and exceeded ambient air temperatures regularly which was associated with more uniform development of tree wells this is consistent with the findings of pomeroy et al 2009 in north american lodgepole pine stands that exceeded air temperatures during periods of increased incoming shortwave radiation the higher temperatures of the fire disturbed stem also suggest control by post fire reductions in wood density water sap flow and changes to the internal stem thermodynamics which would have made for easier faster heating of the tree stem when compared to the living stems at the undisturbed forest it is also important to note that the measurements of internal stem temperature may not represent the actual emitted temperatures of the stems as they were at a depth of 3 cm in the stem the spatial heterogeneity of forest canopy and associated micro meteorological processes suggests that differences likely exist between the measured energy balances at the instrumentation towers and those that occurred at the tree stem mazzotti et al 2020 the variation in these fluxes over small distances means that the fluxes included in this analysis may not be completely representative of those that influenced snowpack temperatures at the tree stem interface as such investigation of the spatial variability of these fluxes within snow gum forests and methods for identifying the fluxes at the tree stem should be a priority for further work identification of tree well development was problematic in the undisturbed forest and is believed to be due to several reasons 1 snowpack depth was greater at the undisturbed forest and greater tree well depth was needed to affect the temperatures of the thermocouple ladders at 30 cm a g l 2 incoming shortwave radiation that could impact tree stems and subsequent radiative and thermal exchange at the snowpack tree stem interface was less than at the fire disturbed forest and 3 turbulent mixing of air in undisturbed forest tree wells was at a minimum due to canopy reduction of wind speeds and turbulent fluxes schwartz et al 2020a the development of tree wells through radiative and thermal processes between the snowpack tree stem interface is an important consideration for understanding the impact of fire on sub alpine hydrology sub alpine forest ecosystems are expected to be subjected to increased fire frequency and severity due to climate change including across north america abatzoglou and williams 2016 and australia lucas et al 2007 this study shows that the contribution of additional heat to the snowpack by these tree wells while occurring at the micro tree stand level when translated across fire impacted landscapes such as what has been seen within australia in 2003 and 2019 20 will result in more marginal snowpack characteristics this is particularly an issue for locations that already have warm dense and shallow marginal snowpacks and areas with greater sensitivity to changes in synoptic conditions and resulting energy balance 8 2 horizontal heat to the snowpack from tree stems and tree wells shortwave radiation is often the dominant control on snowpack energy fluxes at the surface for warm snowpacks fayad et al 2017 schwartz et al 2020a schwartz et al 2020b in this study air temperature has been found to be the primary atmospheric driver of internal temperature change on horizontal thermocouples near tree stems which is similar to what was found by burns et al 2014 snowpack depth was also identified as an important control on snowpack temperature and had a greater effect at the fire disturbed forest the increased importance in snow depth can likely be attributed to lower snow depths at the site and the 30 cm measurement heights of the horizontal thermocouple ladders snowpack depths at the site were much closer to the depth of the measurements and any changes in depth would have resulted in a greater impact on the temperature and energy fluxes to the thermocouple locations it is important to note that snowpack depth likely had a significant and uneven effect on the horizontal measurements of snowpack temperature around the tree stems as the depths at each site were significantly different ideally these measurements would have been made at similar depths from the top of the snowpack rather than at consistent heights above the ground level and this should be a focus of future research consistent with past work turbulent fluxes and rain heat flux had little effect on changes to snowpack temperature at 30 cm a g l but longwave radiation was an important consideration as increased stem temperatures from high incident shortwave radiation resulted in increased longwave irradiance from the stems to the snowpack contrary to the findings of the fire disturbed site that had higher temperatures and diurnal variability on the north and west side of stems from increased shortwave radiation the tree stem to snowpack interface at the undisturbed forest acted to reduce surrounding snowpack temperatures on the north and west sides of the stem it is possible that this is due to the lower overnight ambient air temperatures at the undisturbed site entering the tree wells through increased stable stratification of the sub canopy air due to low wind velocities this intrusion of cold air into the tree well and the relatively low temperatures of the tree stems likely allowed the cooler temperatures to persist next to the snowpack and reduce the snowpack temperature at the tree stem interface snowpack on the southern side of stems at both forests had the least temperature variation and had dissimilar temperature trends to snowpack on the western or northern sides snowpack temperatures on the south side of stems were warmest at the undisturbed forest and coldest at the fire disturbed forest as tree well to snowpack thermal exchange acted to warm the snowpack in the fire disturbed forest and cool the snowpack in the undisturbed forest with the thermocouples closest to the undisturbed stem on the north and west sides having lower temperatures the reduced shortwave heating of the stems on the southern side made these areas less likely to be affected by temperature changes as such bushfire modification of e pauciflora forests increases snowpack temperatures substantially through the switch of tree well regulation on the snowpack from temperature reduction to temperature increase 8 3 snowpack vertical temperature characteristics the cooler snowpack surface temperatures of the fire disturbed forest snowpack agree with schwartz et al 2020a that found increased evaporation sublimation that led to latent cooling of the snowpack surface unsurprisingly mean snowpack temperature was largely dependent on snowpack depth as the greatest changes to snowpack temperature occurred in the top 10 30 cm of the snowpack in response to ambient air temperature similarly periods of cooler snowpack temperatures following periods of snowfall and colder ambient temperatures supports the argument made by bilish et al 2018 that the australian snowpack is event driven in nature unlike burns et al 2014 no clear seasonal trends in snowpack temperature were evident and snowpack temperatures remained isothermal for the majority of the period the development of cold pools throughout the depth of the snowpack following extended periods of cold ambient air temperatures illustrates the importance of cooler ambient air temperatures in moderating snowpack temperature control of the australian snowpack even partially by ambient air temperatures is particularly concerning as trends in synoptic circulation show poleward migration of frontal systems cai et al 2005 catto et al 2014 and increases in anticyclonic conditions in the snowy mountains hendon et al 2007 pepler et al 2019 the resulting reductions in caa and increased susceptibility of the warm and shallow marginal snowpack to changes in energy balance within the fire disturbed forest will result in reduction of snowpack depth and longevity similar to what has been found in previous research at the same sites schwartz et al 2020a a significant limit to this research is that comprehensive snowpack density measurement was not possible and as such establishing density effects on internal thermodynamics was not possible overall the impacts of bushfire increased heat transfer to the snowpack from individual e pauciflora stems through increased incident solar radiation that heated the stems developed tree wells with greater effects on snowpack processes and coincided with increases in snowpack temperature and variation surrounding the stems as this paper reports findings 15 to 16 years following the initial impacts of bushfire in the study area the results presented are likely to underestimate impacts in the years immediately following fire when tree stems would have been charred and likely to deposit increased amounts of char on the snowpack surface close to tree stems increased solar radiation at the snowpack surface and reductions in snowpack depth and longevity schwartz et al 2020a will act in conjunction with these changes to fundamentally alter the hydrology of bushfire disturbed areas of the australian alps similarly these changes will make the snowpack more susceptible to reductions in longevity and depth due to future warming from climate change lópez moreno et al 2008 increases to fire severity and frequency lucas et al 2007 in combination with higher e pauciflora mortality from successive fire events fairman et al 2017 and slow regrowth will result in long lasting hydrological implications following bushfire including in the forests studied in this paper this has implications for fire prone snow covered areas globally 9 conclusions bushfire disturbance to e pauciflora forest in the australian alps significantly altered snowpack tree stem interactions and internal snowpack thermodynamics reductions in forest canopy cover increased incident shortwave radiation on the tree stems in the fire disturbed forest that were associated with the development of well defined tree well periods tree well development resulted in opposing temperature contributions to the snowpack surrounding stems as stems cooled snowpack temperatures in the undisturbed forest and warmed temperatures in the fire disturbed forest snowpack temperature surrounding stems was primarily dependent on location distance from stem snowpack depth and ambient air temperature though vertical snowpack temperature trends were relatively similar at each site the reduced snow depth at the fire disturbed forest made it more responsive to changes in air temperatures throughout the entire depth of the snowpack the clear diurnal and snowfall event driven impacts on snowpack temperature agreed with the event driven assessment of snowpack processes discussed in prior research bilish et al 2018 schwartz et al 2020a schwartz et al 2020b as a result areas impacted by bushfire are more susceptible to changes in atmospheric parameters fire intensity and frequency is expected to increase due to climate change in many regions including north america abatzoglou and williams 2016 and australia lucas et al 2007 the resulting alteration of forests and snowpack processes within them will likely contribute to reductions in snowpack longevity as such the bushfire impacted australian snowpack can be considered a proxy for snowpacks that will either develop new or continued marginal characteristics as climate change progresses and fire becomes
