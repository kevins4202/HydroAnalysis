7000,pan evaporation as a straightforward proxy of potential evapotranspiration has consistently decreased during the last several decades in many regions across the globe mainly because of global dimming and or decreases in wind speed based on a robust measurement dataset of 30 year large pan evaporation however we found that recent increasing extreme climate events have reversed the decreasing trend in pan evaporation by the lower yellow river with a significant increase of up to 25 2 mm yr during 2008 2014 further analyses show that the decrease in large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 5 1 mm yr was mainly caused by the decreased vapor pressure deficit vpd and sunshine hours while the sharp increase in large pan evaporation after 2008 was mainly caused by more frequent heat wave and drought events in spring and summer which resulted in concurrent increases in air temperature vpd and sunshine hours our finding of evaporation rebound due to heat wave and droughts calls for improved strategies of water and crop managements for mitigating the negative effects of increasing extreme climate events keywords large pan evaporation climatic variables extreme climatic events heat wave drought 1 introduction pan evaporation has been measured for a few decades in agricultural hydrological and climatic sciences as an estimate of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere rotstayn et al 2006 potential evapotranspiration pet is the amount of et that occurs if a sufficient water source is available which is essential for water resources managements such as agricultural irrigation and water supply brutsaert and parlange 1998 ohmura and wild 2002 peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2002 both pan evaporation and pet could quantify the evaporative demand of the atmosphere although they differ in acquisition methods measure vs calculation and surfaces water surface within a pan vs land surfaces thus pan evaporation is commonly used as a proxy of pet the long term measurements of pan evaporation are helpful to understand the changes in the atmospheric water demand and to improve water resources managements under changing environments trends in pan evaporation globally reported after 2011 were summarized in table 1 since global trends in pan evaporation reported before 2011 have been summarized by mcvicar et al 2012 during the last several decades a decreasing trend in pan evaporation was widely reported in many regions across the globe for example usa and former soviet union golubev et al 2001 canada burn and hesch 2007 australia roderick and farquhar 2004 roderick et al 2007 china liu et al 2010 liu et al 2011b xie et al 2015 yang and yang 2012 zhang et al 2007 india jhajharia et al 2009 and thailand limjirakan and limsakul 2012 although some sites showed an increasing trend in pan evaporation liu et al 2010 liu et al 2011a you et al 2013 pan evaporation was also reported to persistently decrease in both energy and water limited regions which is reversely consistent with the increasing trend in global averaged air temperature mcvicar et al 2012 these decreasing trends in pan evaporation across above mentioned regions were mainly attributed to global dimming or reduction in solar irradiance and or decreases in wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 roderick et al 2007 wang and yang 2014 wild 2009 considered as one of the most interesting trends observed and identified to be associated in some way with climate change the trend in pan evaporation and its underlying causes and implications for the global hydrologic cycle have attracted broad interests among the scientific community brutsaert and parlange 1998 kisi 2015 lim et al 2016 ohmura and wild 2002 peterson et al 1995 roderick and farquhar 2002 sherwood and fu 2014 wang et al 2012 as shown in table 1 and mcvicar et al 2012 most measurements of pan evaporation were obtained using the φ20 evaporation pan with a diameter of 20 cm and a depth of 10 cm in china and the us class a evaporation pan with a diameter of 120 7 cm and a depth of 25 cm outside of china whereas the world meteorological organization wmo recommends a 20 m2 evaporation pan as the standard equipment for free water surface evaporation the raw measurements of both class a and φ20 evaporators might not directly record the atmospheric evaporative demand above free water surfaces the conversion coefficients between the 20 m2 evaporator and given evaporators are commonly used to calibrate class a and φ20 evaporation measurements but they vary with evaporator types and time fu et al 2004 therefore a long term evaporation record from a 20 m2 evaporator could provide a straightforward view to understand the atmospheric evaporative demand and its trend recent investigations reported that the decrease trend in pan evaporation measured by the φ20 evaporator disappeared since 1993 across china wang et al 2017 with a typical case in the arid region of northwest china where pan evaporation obviously decreased at a rate of 6 0 mm yr before 1993 and turned to increase at a rate of 10 7 mm yr after 1993 li et al 2013 the north china plain ncp one of three major grain producing areas in china has experienced an increase in air temperature at a rate of 0 16 c per decade during 1985 2014 this warming rate is higher than the global average of 0 13 c per decade ipcc 2013 recent studies also reveal that climate change in the ncp has led to extreme temperatures extraordinary rainfall events and more intense and prolonged droughts tao et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 through the overview of studies on pan evaporation trends until 2018 across the world in table 1 and mcvicar et al 2012 almost all studies related to pan evaporation trends solely with climatic trends however extreme events along with climatic trends have not been well investigated to understand the magnitude and changing trend in pan evaporation in this study therefore we aim to 1 provide a robust dataset of 30 year pan evaporation observations from a 20 m2 large tank by the lower yellow river 2 examine changing trends in large pan evaporation as influenced by climate change and local extreme climate events heat wave and drought and 3 explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for recent changes in pan evaporation by the lower yellow river in the ncp 2 methodology 2 1 experimental station and database the observation site 36 56 n 116 38 e is located at the yucheng comprehensive experimental station yces along the north of the lower yellow river in the north china plain fig 1 the yces is characterized by a semi humid monsoon climate and a cropping system of winter wheat summer maize which can be representative of the ncp during the study period of 1985 2014 the average annual mean air temperature was approximately 13 4 c the average annual precipitation was 576 7 mm yr and the average annual large pan evaporation was 939 3 mm yr at the yces the dominant cropping system is winter wheat prior oct jun followed by summer maize jun oct around the observation site the 15 types of pan evaporator with different depths and areas are scattered in the 30 m 40 m observation field within which the ground is covered by short grass between evaporation pans fig 1 pan evaporation was measured through observing the change in water surface measurements on 8 00 and 20 00 from 1985 the evaporator with an area of 20 m2 and a depth of 2 m large pan was found to have the closest observational values to the open water surface evaporation chin and zhao 1995 fu et al 2004 the meteorological instruments were installed about 20 m away from the evaporators to record air temperature air humidity wind speed and direction precipitation sunshine hours and water evaporation measured by a weighting pan evaporator with a diameter of 20 cm small pan i e the φ20 evaporator the sensors of air temperature air humidity and sunshine hours were installed at the 2 m height the sensors of wind speed and direction were installed at the 10 m height the weighting pan evaporator was installed on the ground which can work during the frozen season since both the meteorological observation field and the pan evaporation field are surrounded by croplands with much large areas the effect of pan evaporation on the meteorological observations could be almost ignored monthly large pan evaporation data from 1985 to 2014 were collected for yearly and seasonal trend analyses considering climatic factors are closely related to pan evaporation meteorological data including air temperature daily mean tmean maximum tmax and minimum tmin humidity wind speed precipitation sunshine hours and small pan evaporation were collected for attribution analyses the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated using air temperature and humidity the water within the large pan is pumped out and the large pan does not work from later november to later march large pan evaporation data gaps during frozen winter were filled using the φ20 evaporation records with a calibration coefficient of 0 6 this coefficient was obtained through relating observations between the large pan and the φ20 evaporation pan during unfrozen seasons 2 2 analysis methods a linear regression method was used to obtain the yearly and seasonal trends and p values of large pan evaporation and related climatic factors the partial least squares pls regression was used to investigate the attribution of the change in the trend of large pan evaporation climatic factors temperature vpd sunshine hours closely related to pan evaporation sometimes have good correlations between them however the pls method works even when attributed variables are of multicollinearity eriksson et al 2006 yu et al 2012 the variable importance in the projection vip and the pearson correlation coefficient r obtained from the pls analysis were used to measure the strength of the relationships between large pan evaporation and considered climatic factors where the climatic factors with vip scores above 0 8 were identified as important ones for the relationship model in this study the ms excel v2010 microsoft usa and simca p v11 umetrics ab sweden were used for linear regression and pls analyses the stardex tool was used to calculate about 40 climatic indices of temperature and rainfall see https crudata uea ac uk projects stardex for details about the stardex accessed on mar 1 2017 some typical extreme climate indices were used to investigate local prevailing extreme climate events of heat wave and drought including mean tmax txav tmax 90th percentile txq90 mean dry day persistence ppdd defined as the ratio of the total number of consecutive dry days to the total number of dry days for a given period and mean of dry spell lengths pdsav 3 results 3 1 changing trends in large pan evaporation during 1985 2014 the 30 year time series of yearly and seasonal large pan evaporation derived from the monthly large pan evaporation dataset from 1985 to 2014 were used to obtain the values of trend and p through a linear regression method two distinct trends in yearly large pan evaporation were found during 1985 2008 and 2008 2014 respectively fig 2 3 1 1 annual pattern yearly large pan evaporation had a significantly decreasing trend during 1985 2008 with a trend of 0 014 mm day yr i e 5 1 mm yr and a p value of 0 0014 whereas yearly large pan evaporation turned to a sharply increasing trend during 2008 2014 with a trend of 0 069 mm day yr i e 25 2 mm yr and a p value of 0 0053 the magnitude of the increasing trend in yearly large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 is nearly five times that of the decreasing trend during 1985 2008 3 1 2 seasonal pattern spring mar apr and may summer jun jul and aug and autumn sep oct nov large pan evaporation had the same pattern to yearly large pan evaporation fig 3 the large pan evaporation in spring summer and autumn during 1985 2008 decreased in trends of 0 012 mm day yr i e 1 1 mm yr p 0 072 0 029 mm day yr i e 2 7 mm yr p 0 0067 and 0 015 mm day yr i e 1 4 mm yr p 0 028 respectively table s1 whereas the large pan evaporation in spring summer and autumn during 2008 2014 increased in relatively larger trends of 0 11 mm day yr i e 10 1 mm yr p 0 015 0 086 mm day yr i e 7 9 mm yr p 0 18 and 0 056 mm day yr i e 5 1 mm yr p 0 041 the large pan evaporation in winter dec jan and feb had no obvious changing trend during 1985 2008 with a trend value of 0 0019 mm day year i e 0 17 mm yr p 0 51 but had relatively obvious increasing trend during 2008 2014 with a trend value of 0 021 mm day year i e 1 9 mm yr p 0 47 3 1 3 monthly pattern during 1985 2008 as shown in fig 4 large pan evaporation records of 9 months except feb mar and nov show decreasing trends at the range from 0 0002 mm day yr in dec i e 0 02 mm yr to 0 033 mm day yr in jul i e 1 02 mm yr and the trends in apr jul aug and sep 0 025 mm day yr 0 033 mm day yr are statistically significant p 0 05 during 2008 2014 large pan evaporation records of 11 months except feb show increasing trends at the range from 0 022 mm day yr in jun i e 0 66 mm yr to 0 13 mm day yr in mar and aug i e 4 03 mm yr but all trends are statistically non significant p 0 05 at the monthly scale the magnitude of the increasing trend in large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 is much greater than that of the decreasing trend during 1985 2008 in summary spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 contributes to the yearly decreasing trend in proportions of 22 53 28 and 3 respectively whereas spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 contributes to the yearly increasing trend in proportions of 40 32 20 and 8 respectively 3 2 relative contributions of climatic factors to changes in large pan evaporation during 1985 2014 following the penman equation for calculating evaporation from open water surfaces large pan evaporation positively correlates to air temperature vpd solar radiation and wind speed in this study the relationships between large pan evaporation and related factors air temperature vpd sunshine hours and wind speed were investigated to understand the attributions of the changing trends in large pan evaporation during the past 30 years fig 5 the pls method was used to analyze large pan evaporation vs air temperature vpd sunshine hours and wind speed at the yearly seasonal and monthly scales respectively on the yearly scale as shown in fig 6 and tables s2 s5 the decreasing vpd vip 1 13 r 0 51 and sunshine hours vip 1 50 r 0 68 significantly contributed to decreasing large pan evaporation during 1982 2008 however only air temperature vip 0 45 r 0 18 had a positive and non significant contribution to the increasing trend in yearly large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 on the seasonal scale as shown in fig 7 and tables s2 s5 air temperature in summer and winter vip 1 r 0 59 vpd in four seasons vip 1 19 r 0 64 and sunshine hours in spring summer and autumn vip 1 07 r 0 64 had significant contributions to the decreasing trends in seasonal large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 whereas air temperature vip 1 18 r 0 76 and sunshine hours vip 1 24 r 0 59 in summer had significant contributions to the increasing trends in summer large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 on the monthly scale as shown in fig 8 and tables s2 s5 the decreasing trends in monthly large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 significantly positively correlate to air temperature in jan feb mar may jun and jul vip 0 87 r 0 55 vpd in all months vip 1 18 r 0 46 sunshine hours in all months vip 0 90 r 0 44 and wind speed in may sep and oct vip 0 81 r 0 48 whereas the increasing trends in monthly large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 were significantly positively correlated to air temperature in jun and aug vip 1 25 r 0 86 vpd in jun vip 1 08 r 0 78 sunshine hours in may jun and dec vip 1 12 r 0 81 and wind speed in may sep and oct vip 0 81 r 0 48 in summary the decreasing large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 were mainly caused by the decreasing vpd and sunshine hours in all months and air temperature and wind speed in several months whereas the sharply increasing large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 are mainly caused by the increasing air temperature vpd and sunshine hours in spring and summer 3 3 relations between recent extreme events and rapid rebound in large pan evaporation after 2008 recently heat wave and drought frequently occurred in spring and summer in the ncp tao et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 which may cause increases in concurrent air temperature and vpd and then cause increase in large pan evaporation therefore we further investigated extreme climate events using temperature and precipitation related extreme indices during 1985 2014 3 3 1 heat wave evidences were explored using temperature related extreme indices some numerical characteristics of the mean tmax txav and the tmax 90th percentile txq90 during a given period could indicate the duration and intensity of heat wave table 2 shows that the txav and txq90 sharply increased in spring and summer during 2008 2014 the trend trend 0 21 c yr p 0 65 in spring txav during 2008 2014 is about 4 times that during 1985 2008 furthermore the trend trend 0 16 c yr p 0 02 in summer txav during 2008 2014 is 16 times that during 1985 2008 the trend in txq90 also shows sharp increases in spring trend 0 36 c yr p 0 36 and summer trend 0 15 c yr p 0 65 during 2008 2014 after offsetting the decreasing trends in autumn and winter txq90 the increasing trends in spring and summer txq90 still contribute to a significant increase in yearly txq90 trend 0 21 c yr p 0 05 remarkable increases in daily maximum temperature and its 90th percentile in spring and summer during 2008 2014 suggest that concurrent heat wave occurred with longer duration or higher intensity 3 3 2 drought evidences were explored using precipitation related extreme indices precipitation related extreme indices of the mean dry day persistence ppdd and the mean of dry spell lengths pdsav can be used to quantify the duration and intensity of drought table 3 shows that the yearly ppdd and pdsave significantly increased with the trends of 0 01 yr p 0 05 and 0 46 days yr p 0 05 during 2008 2014 respectively the yearly trends of ppdd and pdsave during 2008 2014 were mainly attributed to their sharp increases in spring and summer although their statistical levels are not significant the above statistical results indicate that the total number of consecutive dry days and dry spell lengths significantly increased in recent spring and summer this suggests that both frequency and duration of drought increased in spring and summer during 2008 2014 3 3 3 the rapid rebound in large pan evaporation after 2008 was explored against heat wave and drought in spring and summer the above evidences of increasing heat wave and drought events in spring and summer are closely related to concurrent changes in air temperature vpd sunshine hours heat wave and drought would increase air temperature and vpd heat wave and drought commonly occur in cloudless or less cloud days which could result in longer sunshine hours consequently the increases in these factors then would accelerate large pan evaporation figs 7 and 8 fig 9 shows straightforward relations of large pan evaporation and four extreme climatic indices during 2008 2014 spring large pan evaporation significantly correlates to spring droughts with an r of 0 94 for ppdd and an r of 0 89 for pdsav whereas summer large pan evaporation significantly correlates to summer heat waves with an r of 0 94 for txav and an r of 0 80 for txq90 subsequently yearly large pan evaporation significantly correlates to ppdd pdsav and txq90 with r values of 0 77 p 0 05 finally it could be inferred that recent increasing extreme events of heat wave and drought in spring and summer contributed prevailingly to inversing from the decreasing trend in large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 4 discussion 4 1 effect of pan evaporator types on evaporation measurement pan evaporation measurements vary with evaporation pan types the 1985 2014 pan evaporation records from the 20 m2 φ20 and class a pans at the yces station show distinct differences in amplitude on yearly and monthly scales fig 10 in a previous study the 15 types of evaporation pans were used for pan evaporation observation about 225 km south to the yces station during 1985 1990 including a widely used class a evaporation pan and a 20 m2 evaporation tank fu et al 2004 the 20 m2 evaporation tank is suggested as the standard equipment for free water surface evaporation by the world meteorological organization chin and zhao 1995 fu et al 2004 converting measurements of other pan evaporators to free water surface evaporation involves conversion coefficients by reference to the measurements of the 20 m2 pan evaporator these conversion coefficients are commonly given as constants although they are affected by installation methods evaporator structure manufacturing materials and meteorological factors such as wind speed and relative humidity chin and zhao 1995 fu et al 2004 pereira et al 1995 in this study therefore the 30 year measurements of the 20 m2 pan evaporator provide a straightforward dataset for investigating the vapor flux from the lands to the atmosphere avoiding the potential errors derived from the use of small pan evaporation measurements and constant conversion coefficients this dataset can be also used to evaluate model based pan evaporation analyses pan evaporation records show a similar rebound trend among three evaporator types of the 20 m2 φ20 and class a pans although they have different amplitudes compared with the rebound trend of the 20 m2 pan evaporation during 2008 2014 the φ20 pan evaporation shows a stronger rebound with a trend of 48 9 mm yr i e 0 13 mm day yr p 0 01 while the class a pan evaporation shows a moderate rebound with a trend of 6 2 mm yr i e 0 017 mm day yr p 0 05 therefore it is suggested that pan evaporation measurements from various pan types might present consistent trends but with different evaporation values 4 2 impact of climatic change and extreme climate events on pan evaporation the decreasing trends of sunshine hours vpd and wind speed before 2008 resulted in the continuous decrease in pan evaporation at the yces this attribution is partially supported by previous studies which found that the decreasing trend in pan evaporation across many regions of the global could be attributed to the decreases in solar radiation and or wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 roderick et al 2007 wang and yang 2014 wild 2009 the decrease in solar radiation was mainly caused by the increase in atmospheric aerosol in the ncp wang and yang 2014 farmland expansion and irrigation could cause the increase in air humidity and then the decrease in vpd douglas et al 2006 some previous studies have reported an increasing trend in pan evaporation in china such as you et al 2013 suggested that southwestern china experienced an increase in pan evaporation during 1981 2010 mainly caused by the increases in wind speed and sunshine hours liu et al 2011a indicated an increase in pan evaporation in eight climatic regions due to temperature increase during the period of the early 1990s to 2007 in this study we found that the recent rebound of large pan evaporation in the ncp was mainly caused by the increasing heat wave and drought events in spring and summer which has not been reported to date 4 3 potential impacts of pan evaporation rebound the rapid rebound of large pan evaporation will bring us new issues the potential water flux from the land to the atmosphere would increase pan evaporation could be used to estimate actual et using empirical coefficients this indicates that more water might be required for more actual et to sustain high crop yields the ncp is one of three major regions of grain production in china where crop yields mainly depend on precipitation and irrigation the increasing heat wave and drought is changing the magnitude and frequency of precipitation and potential irrigation demands with the purpose of adapting to increasing extreme events of heat wave and drought therefore the finding of this study suggests that it is urgent to adopt the strategies of water and crop managements to mitigate the negative effects of extreme climate events on crops 5 conclusions pan evaporation is a straightforward proxy of the potential water flux from the land to the atmosphere in this study a robust 30 year dataset of large pan evaporation was built to investigate changes in pan evaporation at the monthly seasonal and yearly time steps in the north china plain we found that yearly large pan evaporation significantly decreased with a trend of 5 1 mm yr during 1985 2008 to which spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation contributed in proportions of 22 53 28 and 3 respectively this decreasing trend in large pan evaporation was mainly caused by the decreasing vpd and sunshine hours whereas large pan evaporation significantly increased with a trend of up to 25 2 mm yr during 2008 2014 to which spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation contributed in proportions of 40 32 20 and 8 respectively this sharp rebound in large pan evaporation was mainly caused by recent spring and summer heat wave and drought events which increased concurrent air temperature vpd and sunshine hours our finding of rapid rebound in pan evaporation alerts us to promptly

2004 the meteorological instruments were installed about 20 m away from the evaporators to record air temperature air humidity wind speed and direction precipitation sunshine hours and water evaporation measured by a weighting pan evaporator with a diameter of 20 cm small pan i e the φ20 evaporator the sensors of air temperature air humidity and sunshine hours were installed at the 2 m height the sensors of wind speed and direction were installed at the 10 m height the weighting pan evaporator was installed on the ground which can work during the frozen season since both the meteorological observation field and the pan evaporation field are surrounded by croplands with much large areas the effect of pan evaporation on the meteorological observations could be almost ignored monthly large pan evaporation data from 1985 to 2014 were collected for yearly and seasonal trend analyses considering climatic factors are closely related to pan evaporation meteorological data including air temperature daily mean tmean maximum tmax and minimum tmin humidity wind speed precipitation sunshine hours and small pan evaporation were collected for attribution analyses the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated using air temperature and humidity the water within the large pan is pumped out and the large pan does not work from later november to later march large pan evaporation data gaps during frozen winter were filled using the φ20 evaporation records with a calibration coefficient of 0 6 this coefficient was obtained through relating observations between the large pan and the φ20 evaporation pan during unfrozen seasons 2 2 analysis methods a linear regression method was used to obtain the yearly and seasonal trends and p values of large pan evaporation and related climatic factors the partial least squares pls regression was used to investigate the attribution of the change in the trend of large pan evaporation climatic factors temperature vpd sunshine hours closely related to pan evaporation sometimes have good correlations between them however the pls method works even when attributed variables are of multicollinearity eriksson et al 2006 yu et al 2012 the variable importance in the projection vip and the pearson correlation coefficient r obtained from the pls analysis were used to measure the strength of the relationships between large pan evaporation and considered climatic factors where the climatic factors with vip scores above 0 8 were identified as important ones for the relationship model in this study the ms excel v2010 microsoft usa and simca p v11 umetrics ab sweden were used for linear regression and pls analyses the stardex tool was used to calculate about 40 climatic indices of temperature and rainfall see https crudata uea ac uk projects stardex for details about the stardex accessed on mar 1 2017 some typical extreme climate indices were used to investigate local prevailing extreme climate events of heat wave and drought including mean tmax txav tmax 90th percentile txq90 mean dry day persistence ppdd defined as the ratio of the total number of consecutive dry days to the total number of dry days for a given period and mean of dry spell lengths pdsav 3 results 3 1 changing trends in large pan evaporation during 1985 2014 the 30 year time series of yearly and seasonal large pan evaporation derived from the monthly large pan evaporation dataset from 1985 to 2014 were used to obtain the values of trend and p through a linear regression method two distinct trends in yearly large pan evaporation were found during 1985 2008 and 2008 2014 respectively fig 2 3 1 1 annual pattern yearly large pan evaporation had a significantly decreasing trend during 1985 2008 with a trend of 0 014 mm day yr i e 5 1 mm yr and a p value of 0 0014 whereas yearly large pan evaporation turned to a sharply increasing trend during 2008 2014 with a trend of 0 069 mm day yr i e 25 2 mm yr and a p value of 0 0053 the magnitude of the increasing trend in yearly large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 is nearly five times that of the decreasing trend during 1985 2008 3 1 2 seasonal pattern spring mar apr and may summer jun jul and aug and autumn sep oct nov large pan evaporation had the same pattern to yearly large pan evaporation fig 3 the large pan evaporation in spring summer and autumn during 1985 2008 decreased in trends of 0 012 mm day yr i e 1 1 mm yr p 0 072 0 029 mm day yr i e 2 7 mm yr p 0 0067 and 0 015 mm day yr i e 1 4 mm yr p 0 028 respectively table s1 whereas the large pan evaporation in spring summer and autumn during 2008 2014 increased in relatively larger trends of 0 11 mm day yr i e 10 1 mm yr p 0 015 0 086 mm day yr i e 7 9 mm yr p 0 18 and 0 056 mm day yr i e 5 1 mm yr p 0 041 the large pan evaporation in winter dec jan and feb had no obvious changing trend during 1985 2008 with a trend value of 0 0019 mm day year i e 0 17 mm yr p 0 51 but had relatively obvious increasing trend during 2008 2014 with a trend value of 0 021 mm day year i e 1 9 mm yr p 0 47 3 1 3 monthly pattern during 1985 2008 as shown in fig 4 large pan evaporation records of 9 months except feb mar and nov show decreasing trends at the range from 0 0002 mm day yr in dec i e 0 02 mm yr to 0 033 mm day yr in jul i e 1 02 mm yr and the trends in apr jul aug and sep 0 025 mm day yr 0 033 mm day yr are statistically significant p 0 05 during 2008 2014 large pan evaporation records of 11 months except feb show increasing trends at the range from 0 022 mm day yr in jun i e 0 66 mm yr to 0 13 mm day yr in mar and aug i e 4 03 mm yr but all trends are statistically non significant p 0 05 at the monthly scale the magnitude of the increasing trend in large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 is much greater than that of the decreasing trend during 1985 2008 in summary spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 contributes to the yearly decreasing trend in proportions of 22 53 28 and 3 respectively whereas spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 contributes to the yearly increasing trend in proportions of 40 32 20 and 8 respectively 3 2 relative contributions of climatic factors to changes in large pan evaporation during 1985 2014 following the penman equation for calculating evaporation from open water surfaces large pan evaporation positively correlates to air temperature vpd solar radiation and wind speed in this study the relationships between large pan evaporation and related factors air temperature vpd sunshine hours and wind speed were investigated to understand the attributions of the changing trends in large pan evaporation during the past 30 years fig 5 the pls method was used to analyze large pan evaporation vs air temperature vpd sunshine hours and wind speed at the yearly seasonal and monthly scales respectively on the yearly scale as shown in fig 6 and tables s2 s5 the decreasing vpd vip 1 13 r 0 51 and sunshine hours vip 1 50 r 0 68 significantly contributed to decreasing large pan evaporation during 1982 2008 however only air temperature vip 0 45 r 0 18 had a positive and non significant contribution to the increasing trend in yearly large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 on the seasonal scale as shown in fig 7 and tables s2 s5 air temperature in summer and winter vip 1 r 0 59 vpd in four seasons vip 1 19 r 0 64 and sunshine hours in spring summer and autumn vip 1 07 r 0 64 had significant contributions to the decreasing trends in seasonal large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 whereas air temperature vip 1 18 r 0 76 and sunshine hours vip 1 24 r 0 59 in summer had significant contributions to the increasing trends in summer large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 on the monthly scale as shown in fig 8 and tables s2 s5 the decreasing trends in monthly large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 significantly positively correlate to air temperature in jan feb mar may jun and jul vip 0 87 r 0 55 vpd in all months vip 1 18 r 0 46 sunshine hours in all months vip 0 90 r 0 44 and wind speed in may sep and oct vip 0 81 r 0 48 whereas the increasing trends in monthly large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 were significantly positively correlated to air temperature in jun and aug vip 1 25 r 0 86 vpd in jun vip 1 08 r 0 78 sunshine hours in may jun and dec vip 1 12 r 0 81 and wind speed in may sep and oct vip 0 81 r 0 48 in summary the decreasing large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 were mainly caused by the decreasing vpd and sunshine hours in all months and air temperature and wind speed in several months whereas the sharply increasing large pan evaporation during 2008 2014 are mainly caused by the increasing air temperature vpd and sunshine hours in spring and summer 3 3 relations between recent extreme events and rapid rebound in large pan evaporation after 2008 recently heat wave and drought frequently occurred in spring and summer in the ncp tao et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 which may cause increases in concurrent air temperature and vpd and then cause increase in large pan evaporation therefore we further investigated extreme climate events using temperature and precipitation related extreme indices during 1985 2014 3 3 1 heat wave evidences were explored using temperature related extreme indices some numerical characteristics of the mean tmax txav and the tmax 90th percentile txq90 during a given period could indicate the duration and intensity of heat wave table 2 shows that the txav and txq90 sharply increased in spring and summer during 2008 2014 the trend trend 0 21 c yr p 0 65 in spring txav during 2008 2014 is about 4 times that during 1985 2008 furthermore the trend trend 0 16 c yr p 0 02 in summer txav during 2008 2014 is 16 times that during 1985 2008 the trend in txq90 also shows sharp increases in spring trend 0 36 c yr p 0 36 and summer trend 0 15 c yr p 0 65 during 2008 2014 after offsetting the decreasing trends in autumn and winter txq90 the increasing trends in spring and summer txq90 still contribute to a significant increase in yearly txq90 trend 0 21 c yr p 0 05 remarkable increases in daily maximum temperature and its 90th percentile in spring and summer during 2008 2014 suggest that concurrent heat wave occurred with longer duration or higher intensity 3 3 2 drought evidences were explored using precipitation related extreme indices precipitation related extreme indices of the mean dry day persistence ppdd and the mean of dry spell lengths pdsav can be used to quantify the duration and intensity of drought table 3 shows that the yearly ppdd and pdsave significantly increased with the trends of 0 01 yr p 0 05 and 0 46 days yr p 0 05 during 2008 2014 respectively the yearly trends of ppdd and pdsave during 2008 2014 were mainly attributed to their sharp increases in spring and summer although their statistical levels are not significant the above statistical results indicate that the total number of consecutive dry days and dry spell lengths significantly increased in recent spring and summer this suggests that both frequency and duration of drought increased in spring and summer during 2008 2014 3 3 3 the rapid rebound in large pan evaporation after 2008 was explored against heat wave and drought in spring and summer the above evidences of increasing heat wave and drought events in spring and summer are closely related to concurrent changes in air temperature vpd sunshine hours heat wave and drought would increase air temperature and vpd heat wave and drought commonly occur in cloudless or less cloud days which could result in longer sunshine hours consequently the increases in these factors then would accelerate large pan evaporation figs 7 and 8 fig 9 shows straightforward relations of large pan evaporation and four extreme climatic indices during 2008 2014 spring large pan evaporation significantly correlates to spring droughts with an r of 0 94 for ppdd and an r of 0 89 for pdsav whereas summer large pan evaporation significantly correlates to summer heat waves with an r of 0 94 for txav and an r of 0 80 for txq90 subsequently yearly large pan evaporation significantly correlates to ppdd pdsav and txq90 with r values of 0 77 p 0 05 finally it could be inferred that recent increasing extreme events of heat wave and drought in spring and summer contributed prevailingly to inversing from the decreasing trend in large pan evaporation during 1985 2008 4 discussion 4 1 effect of pan evaporator types on evaporation measurement pan evaporation measurements vary with evaporation pan types the 1985 2014 pan evaporation records from the 20 m2 φ20 and class a pans at the yces station show distinct differences in amplitude on yearly and monthly scales fig 10 in a previous study the 15 types of evaporation pans were used for pan evaporation observation about 225 km south to the yces station during 1985 1990 including a widely used class a evaporation pan and a 20 m2 evaporation tank fu et al 2004 the 20 m2 evaporation tank is suggested as the standard equipment for free water surface evaporation by the world meteorological organization chin and zhao 1995 fu et al 2004 converting measurements of other pan evaporators to free water surface evaporation involves conversion coefficients by reference to the measurements of the 20 m2 pan evaporator these conversion coefficients are commonly given as constants although they are affected by installation methods evaporator structure manufacturing materials and meteorological factors such as wind speed and relative humidity chin and zhao 1995 fu et al 2004 pereira et al 1995 in this study therefore the 30 year measurements of the 20 m2 pan evaporator provide a straightforward dataset for investigating the vapor flux from the lands to the atmosphere avoiding the potential errors derived from the use of small pan evaporation measurements and constant conversion coefficients this dataset can be also used to evaluate model based pan evaporation analyses pan evaporation records show a similar rebound trend among three evaporator types of the 20 m2 φ20 and class a pans although they have different amplitudes compared with the rebound trend of the 20 m2 pan evaporation during 2008 2014 the φ20 pan evaporation shows a stronger rebound with a trend of 48 9 mm yr i e 0 13 mm day yr p 0 01 while the class a pan evaporation shows a moderate rebound with a trend of 6 2 mm yr i e 0 017 mm day yr p 0 05 therefore it is suggested that pan evaporation measurements from various pan types might present consistent trends but with different evaporation values 4 2 impact of climatic change and extreme climate events on pan evaporation the decreasing trends of sunshine hours vpd and wind speed before 2008 resulted in the continuous decrease in pan evaporation at the yces this attribution is partially supported by previous studies which found that the decreasing trend in pan evaporation across many regions of the global could be attributed to the decreases in solar radiation and or wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 roderick et al 2007 wang and yang 2014 wild 2009 the decrease in solar radiation was mainly caused by the increase in atmospheric aerosol in the ncp wang and yang 2014 farmland expansion and irrigation could cause the increase in air humidity and then the decrease in vpd douglas et al 2006 some previous studies have reported an increasing trend in pan evaporation in china such as you et al 2013 suggested that southwestern china experienced an increase in pan evaporation during 1981 2010 mainly caused by the increases in wind speed and sunshine hours liu et al 2011a indicated an increase in pan evaporation in eight climatic regions due to temperature increase during the period of the early 1990s to 2007 in this study we found that the recent rebound of large pan evaporation in the ncp was mainly caused by the increasing heat wave and drought events in spring and summer which has not been reported to date 4 3 potential impacts of pan evaporation rebound the rapid rebound of large pan evaporation will bring us new issues the potential water flux from the land to the atmosphere would increase pan evaporation could be used to estimate actual et using empirical coefficients this indicates that more water might be required for more actual et to sustain high crop yields the ncp is one of three major regions of grain production in china where crop yields mainly depend on precipitation and irrigation the increasing heat wave and drought is changing the magnitude and frequency of precipitation and potential irrigation demands with the purpose of adapting to increasing extreme events of heat wave and drought therefore the finding of this study suggests that it is urgent to adopt the strategies of water and crop managements to mitigate the negative effects of extreme climate events on crops 5 conclusions pan evaporation is a straightforward proxy of the potential water flux from the land to the atmosphere in this study a robust 30 year dataset of large pan evaporation was built to investigate changes in pan evaporation at the monthly seasonal and yearly time steps in the north china plain we found that yearly large pan evaporation significantly decreased with a trend of 5 1 mm yr during 1985 2008 to which spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation contributed in proportions of 22 53 28 and 3 respectively this decreasing trend in large pan evaporation was mainly caused by the decreasing vpd and sunshine hours whereas large pan evaporation significantly increased with a trend of up to 25 2 mm yr during 2008 2014 to which spring summer autumn and winter large pan evaporation contributed in proportions of 40 32 20 and 8 respectively this sharp rebound in large pan evaporation was mainly caused by recent spring and summer heat wave and drought events which increased concurrent air temperature vpd and sunshine hours our finding of rapid rebound in pan evaporation alerts us to promptly adopt appropriate mitigating strategies of water and crop managements to cope with increasing extreme climate events acknowledgments this research was supported by the strategic priority research

7001,sustainable water resources management in arid and semi arid areas needs robust models which allow accurate and reliable predictive modeling this issue has motivated the researchers to develop hybrid models that offer solutions on modelling problems and accurate predictions of groundwater potential zonation for this purpose this research aims to investigate the capability and robustness of a novel hybrid model namely the logistic model tree lmt and compares it with state of the art models such as the support vector machine and c4 5 models that locate potential zones for groundwater springs a spring location dataset consisting of 359 springs was provided by field surveys and national reports and from which three different sample data sets s1 s3 were randomly prepared 70 for training and 30 for validation additionally 16 spring related factors were analyzed using regression logistic analysis to find which factors play a significant role in spring occurrence twelve significant geo environmental and morphometric factors were identified and applied in all models the accuracy of models was evaluated by three different threshold dependent and independent methods including efficiency e true skill statistic tss and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve auc roc methods results showed that the lmt model had the highest accuracy performance for all three validation datasets emean 0 860 tssmean 0 718 auc rocmean 0 904 although a slight sensitivity to change in input data was sometimes observed for this model furthermore the findings showed that relative slope position rsp was the most important factor followed by distance from faults and lithology keywords hybrid model groundwater spring robustness gis logistic model tree 1 introduction groundwater has always been one of the most precious natural resources in the world due to its importance at different levels in society such as residential agricultural and industrial water supply in addition as a non renewable resource groundwater has important attributes such as low pollution vulnerability water quality steady temperature low susceptibility to environmental disasters and climate change impacts chowdhury et al 2009 manap et al 2013 neshat et al 2014 in fact one third of the world population are reliant on groundwater supplies for their needs which has led to substantial global overuse of this valuable resource the sustainable development of groundwater in arid and semi arid areas is a crucial issue to maintain fresh and usable water resources anbazhagan and jothibasu 2016 the existence and movement of groundwater depend on various geo environmental variables oh et al 2011 in iran where two thirds of its landmass is categorized as arid and semi arid desert land has struggled with water scarcity during the last decades agriculture is one of the most crucial economic sectors in iran and therefore knowledge of groundwater supplies and its potential especially in water scarce areas can be helpful in order to overcome this crisis razandi et al 2015 rahmati et al 2016 drilling geophysical geological and hydrological methods are traditional approaches used to map groundwater resources rahmati et al 2016 geographical information system gis and remote sensing methods have major potential for groundwater potential mapping and assessment oh et al 2011 gis has the ability to work with large spatial datasets and has application in environmental and geological fields oh et al 2011 oh and pradhan 2011 pham et al 2016 rahmati et al 2016 nampak et al 2018 tehrany et al 2014 according to the literature various types of gis based models have been employed for groundwater potential modelling including the frequency ratio oh et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2015 razandi et al 2015 guru et al 2016 weights of evidence modeling corsini et al 2009 lee et al 2012 ozdemir 2011a ghorbani nejad et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017a dempster shafer theory rahmati and melesse 2016 multi

sahoo et al 2017b patra et al 2018 yin et al 2018 for the gpm purpose recently machine learning techniques mlts have attracted the attention of researchers because they recognize patterns hidden in historical groundwater data and capture the nonlinear relation between variables e g suryanarayana et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 rezaie balf et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017c barzegar et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 different mlts such as random forest rahmati et al 2016 classification and regression tree naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 boosted regression tree naghibi et al 2016 golkarian et al 2018 maximum entropy rahmati et al 2016 generalized additive model falah et al 2017 artificial neural network model corsini et al 2009 and aquifer sustainability factor smith et al 2010 have been found useful in the field of modeling groundwater potential among all the statistical methods lr is a robust model which has some advantages in terms of strict assumptions prior to study and capability for ensembling with other models another advantage of lr model is that it represents the predicted probabilities for given patterns pradhan 2010 dong et al 2011 however it still has some drawbacks in analyzing the classes of each conditioning factor tehrany et al 2013 2015 in addition its relative performance depends on the characteristics and the size of the dataset landwehr et al 2005 to overcome these drawbacks in modelling a hybrid model called logistic model tree ltm which is based on the lr model and c4 5 decision tree has been proposed and applied in different fields of study such as flood prediction chapi et al 2017 landslide bui et al 2017a chen et al 2017b and satellite image classification colkesen and kavzoglu 2017 the major aim of this research is the capability of different types of machine learning models including lmt c4 5 and svm to locate potential zones for groundwater springs and to reach this goal the bojnourd area in iran was selected another main reason that makes this study valuable and independent is that the ltm and c4 5 decision tree models are applied separately for the first time in groundwater field and results are compared together with the support vector machine svm model in the studied region moreover the results could be implemented in further natural resources management and planning therefore the specific objectives of the current research are to i spatially predict the groundwater spring potential using different state of the art models including lmt c4 5 and svm ii investigate their performance and capability based on the evaluation criteria and iii explore the robustness and sensitivity of all models to the random splitting of input data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the bojnourd region of north khorasan province iran which is situated between latitudes 37 15 and 37 35 n and longitudes 57 03 and 57 40 e longitudes altitude of the bojnourd region ranges between 875 and 2968 m annual precipitation is 272 mm and the low and high temperatures respectively are 6 8 c and 19 7 c according to khorasan shomali methorological organization http www nkhmet ir index aspx tempname english lang 2 sub 0 fig 1 indicates the location of the studied region karstic structures in iran are segmented into three different zones including the zagros the central zone and the sanandaj sirjan fault area in these karstic areas more than 18 000 m of exploration drilling excluding alluvium plain have taken place afrasiabian 1986 in addition there are numerous faults and many folds in the study area which play important roles in the development of springs groundwater resources provide 88 percent of the water resource for khorasan province this province has 17 000 km2 of karst masses which are used as karst water resources in order to supply drinking water for citizens of north and razavi khorasan provinces furthermore the area of the north khorasan province is 248 000 km2 with a high population of 6 000 000 people farming is the major activity in this province north khorasan is exposed to an extreme fluctuation in climate sanjani et al 2011 2 2 data used 2 2 1 spring dataset in the study region a total of 359 springs were identified based on both multiple field surveys and documents available from the iranian department of water resources management for the year 2017 fig 1 table 1 monitoring data of these springs in the study area reflected that spring groundwater discharge peaks in march or april and decreases until late august or september iranian department of water resources management idwrm 2015 the yield of springs ranges from a maximum of about 0 8 m3 s in the winter to a minimum of about 0 0005 m3 s in the summer in addition in the study area there are many low yielding springs that outcrop at locations where the local groundwater table intersects the land surface such springs are often temporal and were neglected in the analysis for this analysis the spring inventory locations were randomly divided into two groups 70 251 spring locations and 30 108 spring locations for the purpose of training and validation respectively in other words the validation group were determined through a randomization and was not used in model building it is generally recommended in spatial modeling to use approximately equal proportions of spring present 1 and spring absent 0 pixels corsini et al 2009 ozdemir 2011b keeping this in mind the 359 spring present pixels and randomly selected 359 spring absent pixels were used in the modeling it needs to be clarified that to investigate the robustness of the algorithms three training and three validation datasets s1 s3 were created by implementing the random selection of dependent variable spring locations in a gis environment fig 2 conoscenti et al 2014 angileri et al 2016 the training datasets consisted of 251 spring locations while validation datasets included 108 spring locations 2 2 2 geo environmental factors there are no universal guidelines for selecting groundwater conditioning factors gcf in the present study sixteen geo environmental factors were selected based on the literature to evaluate groundwater spring potential including e g corsini et al 2009 ozdemir 2011a b oh et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2015 naghibi et al 2017a c chen et al 2018 those were altitude aspect plan curvature profile curvature slope land use cover lithology soil distance from fault distance from stream stream density topographic wetness index twi convergence index ci relative slope position rsp topographic position index tpi and terrain roughness index tri in order to identify factors which have a significant relationship with groundwater springs a logistic regression was performed in other word logistic regression establishes a functional relationship between spring locations dependent variable and different conditioning factors independent variables that are recognized as playing a role in spring development ozdemir 2011a b a detailed description and background on the logistic regression method can be found in hosmer et al 2013 the general form of logistic regression is as follows 1 p 1 1 e z where p is the probability of an event occurring and varies from 0 to 1 on an s shaped curve z is a linear combination which can be defined as 2 z a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where a is the intercept x1 xn represent the values of the independent variables and b1 bn represent the coefficients in fact this statistical method examines the relative strength and significance of the factors tehrany et al 2013 2015 in this study a forward stepwise logistic regression was performed in spss software to analyze data all factors which have a significance value sig of less than 0 5 were accepted as influential predictor variables after the forward stepwise logistic regression analysis twelve gcfs which are altitude aspect slope convergence index distance from fault distance from stream stream density rsp tpi tri twi and lithology were selected because they were statistically significant table 2 however some variables such as the soil land use cover plan curvature and profile curvature were not found to be statistically significant in the model the basic maps such as geology land use and soil were obtained from the iranian department of water resources management and iranian department of geology in addition a digital elevation model dem 20 20 m pixel size was also obtained from iranian national cartographic center for preparing the dem derived layers the dem layer was used altitude indirectly impacts groundwater potential for example higher elevations have higher slope and infiltration decreases mangangka 2008 zapata et al 2000 althuwaynee et al 2012 2014 accordingly this factor was also used in the modelling process slope has an important function in infiltration and influences surface runoff sarkar et al 2001 therefore this map was generated using arcgis 10 2 and a dem of the studied region and was considered as a continuous factor aspect which defines exposure to sunlight dai et al 2001 and subsequently impacts evaporation was also considered as a predictive factor this gcf was also prepared and classified into nine classes of main and sub main classes in addition to a flat category the tpi shows the corresponding position of each pixel it can be computed as eq 3 guisan et al 1999 de reu et al 2013 3 tpi e pixel e surrounding where e pixel shows the altitude of the cell and e surrounding depicts the mean altitude of the neighbor pixels the twi calculates the degree of accumulation of water at a certain pixel in the studied region pourghasemi et al 2013 the twi can be computed by as below 4 twi ln α tan β where α depicts area which drains to a point and β shows the slope angle at the pixel the tri represents the convex and concave slopes althuwaynee et al 2014 kalantar et al 2017 this factor can be calculated as 5 tri x max 2 min 2 where x depicts elevation of each neighbor cell to cell 0 0 m max and min show the largest and smallest elevation value among nine neighbor pixels respectively two stream based layers such as distance from streams and stream density were also produced using euclidean distance and line density functions in arcgis 10 5 these layers were implemented in the modelling process since they are known to influencing groundwater potential liu and yamanaka 2012 nampak et al 2014 the lithology is a very essential gcf as it determines porosity and permeability of an aquifer adiat et al 2012 to investigate the influence of the lithology lithological categories were extracted from a 1 100 000 scale geological map of the studied region obtained from iranian department of geology lithological characteristics of study area are presented in table 3 in addition a layer of distance from faults was produced where the faults were extracted from the geological map of the studied region all of gcf layers are illustrated in fig 3 2 3 methodology the methodology of study is explained in following sections and is shown in fig 4 2 3 1 description of models 2 3 1 1 logistic model tree the logistic model tree lmt is a typical decision tree classification algorithm with a root node inner nodes and leaves however lmt is difference from other tree algorithms in the process of growing splitting and pruning pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances in addition it often reduces the complexity of the final classifier and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting herein logistic regressions eq 1 were built at the nodes and leaves using the logitboost algorithm doetsch et al 2009 whereas the c4 5 rule quinlan 1993 was used to split samples for tree growing and the cart algorithm breiman et al 1984 was employed to prune the tree and prevent overfitting landwehr et al 2005 let s be a spring groundwater training dataset s x i y i i 1 n where n is the total number of the training samples x i r d is the spring groundwater conditioning factors and y i is the class label such as spring groundwater occurrence sg and non spring groundwater occurrence nsg the goal of the training process is to build a tree like structure model that can separate samples into two classes the probability values belong to the spring groundwater occurrence class is used as spring groundwater potential index the process of building the lmt model is summarized below step 1 establishment of the root node using the training sample the root node of the lmt tree model is constructed where a logistic regression model eq 6 is built with the help of the logitboost algorithm thus additive logistic regression is performed and is the optimization process with the aim of minimizing the logistic loss function ln 1 e y i f x i using newton steps as below 1 using the training dataset s compute i initial weight w i 1 n 2 initial committee function f x 0 and probability p x p s g x 1 2 2 repeat i 1 to n iterations we used the default n 200 estimate w i and

coefficient update f x f x 1 2 f iteration x and p x i 9 p x i exp f sg n s g x exp f sg x exp f nsg x 3 output the final lmt classifier is obtained as sign f x step 2 tree growing the tree is grown by splitting the training samples at the root node using the c4 5 splitting rule 52 to create subsets for inner nodes subsequently using the subsets logistic regression models for these inner nodes are constructed using the logitboost algorithm mentioned above the tree is allowed to continue to grow in the same procedure until nodes have less than 15 samples as the stopping criteria these nodes are converted to leaves step 3 tree pruning finally the tree pruning process is carried out using the cart pruning scheme breiman et al 1984 to prevent overfitting and balance the error rate of the lmt model 2 3 1 2 c4 5 decision tree the c4 5 dt model which was originally presented by quinlan 1986 is an extension of id3 models where attributes are selected using the entropy based gain ratio gr technique for modelling chen et al 2014 the c4 5 dt has two processes that include tree growth which occurs from a node and is then split based on the largest value of gr or the smallest value of entropy and the tree pruning process chen et al 2014 entropy is a measurement of uncertainty and in the modeling process it is an appropriate way to assign an uncertainty score to a stochastic variable thuraisingham and gottwald 2006 let s is a set of training dataset f yi s is the number of cases in the training dataset s which belong to class yi groundwater spring and non groundwater spring the entropy of the groundwater and non groundwater spring at a node f is computed as follows 10 entropy f j p y j f log 2 p y j f where y j f is the relative frequency of node f of the k attribute of f the entropy for a given conditioning factor such as slope is obtained as follows 11 entrop y slope f j 1 k f j f e n t r o p y f j information gain ig was used to calculate the differences between the entropy of the original node and newly a split node which is obtained based on the following equation 12 e n t r o p y slope e n t r o p y f e n t r o p y slope f the ig in the tree selects an attribute with many split points this process leads to growth of the tree toward continuous attributes therefore splitinfo the ig normalized is used to detect this challenge the following equation shows the splitinfo for f node 13 splitinfo j 1 v f j f log 2 f j f the gain ratio gr for slope factor which is the ig rectified by splitinfo denotes as follows 14 gr s l o p e ig s l o p e splitinfo s l o p e to prepare groundwater spring potential mapping the probability of groundwater spring and non groundwater spring classes occurring in the leaf nodes can be computes as follows 15 probability f n groundwaterspring n non g r o u n d w a t e r s p r i n g n groundwaterspring where n groundwater spring and n non groundwater spring are the number of groundwater spring and non groundwater spring classes it is noted that the probability of groundwater and non groundwater springs cannot be utilized as the estimated probability this is because using the above equation eq 15 the estimated probability calculates an extreme value 0 or 1 in leaf nodes therefore to solve this issue the probability is calculated using the smoothing frequencies through ranking leaf nodes using the following equation 16 rank n o d e c h i l d n groundwater s p r i n g m r a n k n o d e p a r e n t n non g r o u n d w a t e r s p r i n g n groundwater s p r i n g m where parameter m is obtained as follows 17 m r d 1 d r k where r is a constant parameter k is the global cardinality of the dataset and d is the depth of the node 2 3 1 3 support vector machines support vector machine svm is one of the advanced and popular supervised machine learning models which was developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 for classification and regression issues bui et al 2017a it is developed based on statistical learning based theory non linear classifiers and the concept of the optimal separation hyperplane in order to specify the widest margin in the training data points between two classes kavzoglu et al 2015 consider a training dataset x x 1 x 2 x n where x is the groundwater spring conditioning factor and y y 1 y 2 is the class label of the dependent variable groundwater spring and non groundwater spring the svm tries to categorize the training dataset into subsets or classes 1 1 using an optimal separating hyperplane which can be formulated as follows 18 f x y i w x i b 1 ξ i where the vector w is the vector of weights determined by the model and specifies the hyperplane orientation of the feature b is a constant which represents the offset of the hyperplane from the origin and ξi is the positive slack variable the solution of w in eq 11 using lagrange multipliers can be found as samui 2008 19 minimize i 1 n α i 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n α i α j y i y j x i x j subject to i 1 n α i y i 0 0 α c where α i are the lagrange multipliers and c is the penalty the decision function of svm can be expressed by the following equation 20 g x sign j 1 n α i x i y i b if the linear kernel function cannot separate the hyperplane some non linear kernel functions are able to do that therefore the decision function of svm can be formulated as follows 21 g x sign j 1 n α i y i k x i x j b where k x i x j is the kernel function there are four types of kernel function in the svm model including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf and sigmoid kernels in fact kernels provide a modular framework in support of vector machines that can be adapted to different tasks such as pattern analysis or recognition steinwart and christmann 2008 the classification accuracy of svm is related to selection of the proper kernel function rahmati et al 2017 the rbf kernel function was used in this study because it has a good interpolation capability zhu et al 2011 the rbf kernel is described as follows 22 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 it is noted that two parameters in the rbf kernel function such as the regularization parameter c and kernel width γ play an important role in the performance of the svm model bui et al 2017a b these parameters are called the hyperparameters of the svm the regularization parameter controls the trade off between maximizing the target margin and minimizing the l1 norm of the margin slack vector of the training data friedrichs and igel 2005 therefore the over fitting problem can be controlled using the c parameter whereby if a large value is used for it fewer margins and thus decreased training errors occur and vice versa damaševičius 2010 additionally the degree of nonlinearity of the svm model is controlled by the γ parameter the posterior probabilities of the svm model which is based on the sigmoid transformation can be computed using the following equation platt 1999 23 p y 1 x 1 1 exp a f x b where a and b are constants in this study the above mentioned equation eq 16 was applied to obtain the posterior probabilities for each pixel of the study area to prepare the groundwater spring potential mapping 2 3 2 model application in this research the input factors were processed analyzed and prepared using arcgis10 4 the lmt model the decision tree model and the svm model for the ground water potential mapping were programmed by the authors in the matlab environment using weka application programming interface api in addition a python tool in arcgis10 4 was developed to transfer the derived spring potential result to raster maps 2 3 3 evaluation of the models the predictive performance was assessed using both threshold independent and threshold dependent performance measures the receiver operating characteristics roc curve as a threshold independent method was plotted for all the training and validation datasets and subsequently goodness of fit and prediction efficacy of the algorithms were investigated respectively oh et al 2011 goodness of fit shows the ability of the algorithm in estimating the training dataset while prediction performance works with the validation dataset bui et al 2012 umar et al 2014 in the roc curve a comparison takes place between the computed groundwater potential map with the validation dataset the plot shows the true positive rate tpr as a function of false positive rate fpr oh and lee 2010 nandi and shakoor 2010 in fact the tpr depicts the proportion of spring pixels that are correctly classified as spring occurrences and the fpr reflects the proportion of the non spring pixels that are incorrectly classified as springs corsini et al 2009 frattini et al 2010 the tpr and fpr can be calculated based on a confusion matrix also known as contingency table using eqs 24 and 25 24 tpr tp tp f n 25 fpr fp fp t n where tp true positive and tn true negative are the number of pixels that are correctly classified whereas fp false positive and fn false negative are the numbers of pixels erroneously classified the area under curve auc roc defines the efficiency of a model to accurately predict an occurrence or non occurrence yesilnacar and topal 2005 naghibi and dashtpagerdi 2017 the auc roc alters from 0 5 to 1 a higher value shows a stronger model while a lower value of auc roc determines a weaker model chen et al 2017a hong et al 2017 according to fressard et al 2014 auc roc can be classified as the following five classes of accuracy poor accuracy for auc roc values from 0 6 to 0 7 fair accuracy for auc roc values from 0 7 to 0 8 good accuracy for auc roc values from 0 8 to 0 9 and excellent accuracy for auc roc values from 0 9 to 1 in addition two threshold dependent evaluation metrics including efficiency e and true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 fukuda et al 2013 were considered to assess the efficiency of the models these evaluation criteria can be calculated using following equations 26 e tp t n tp t n f p f n 27 tss t p r f p r the robustness of a model can be determined by analyzing the changes of the model efficiency when small alterations in input data are made frattini et al 2010 conoscenti et al 2015 angileri et al 2016 cama et al 2017 pourghasemi et al 2017 in the current study three data sets were used for both training and validation steps models were applied to the mentioned datasets and then were verified using the validation datasets the robustness of the predictive model is defined as the stability of the model s results in terms of accuracy models when the training and validation samples are altered rahmati et al 2017 the robustness of the models was calculated by differentiating the maximum and minimum accuracy values based on each evaluation criteria conoscenti et al 2014 28 r e e max e min 29 r tss tss max tss min 30 r auc r o c a u c r o c max a u c r o c min where re rtss and rauc roc are the robustness of a model based on efficiency tss and auc roc criteria respectively emax tssmax and auc rocmax are the maximum accuracy values among all datasets in addition minimum accuracy values are denoted as emin tssmin and auc rocmin among all three datasets these analyses were performed in both training and validation steps 3 results 3 1 application of the models to groundwater potential mapping fig 5 a i show groundwater spring potential maps produced by lmt c4 5 and svm for three different training sets the mentioned maps were classified into four categories of low moderate high and very high using the quantile classification method areas classified as high and very high gwp clearly matches with the sections of the watershed with high slope and close to faults areas along the river and sections of the upstream part headwater are shown to have a promising zone for groundwater 3 2 evaluation of the groundwater potential maps the results of the goodness of fit are shown in table 4 in the case of lmt results performance values range from 0 870 to 0 947 mean 0 902 based on e metric from 0 761 to 0 839 mean 0 796 based on tss 0 917 to 0 965 mean 0 941 based on auc roc according to c4 5 dt results e tss and auc roc values were 0 884 0 938 mean 0 917 0 832 0 898 mean 0 868 0 944 0 969 mean 0 952 respectively accuracy assessment of svm results also indicated that e varies between 0 867 and 0 927 mean 0 894 tss ranges between 0 737 and 0 846 mean 0 797 and auc roc alters between 0 923 and 0 941 mean 0 930 therefore it can be observed that all three models have the good excellent performances in fact e tss and auc roc criteria indicated a substantial agreement between the trained models and reality however as the training datasets were used to generate the models they could not be used to assess their prediction capability the validation analysis shows how well the model can predict groundwater potential in a given area in the validation step the results of the applied models were verified using validation datasets and three different evaluation criteria table 5 according to the lmt results e ranges between 0 847 and 0 874 mean 0 860 tss varies between 0 682 and 0 763 mean 0 718 auc roc changes between 0 881 and 0 924 mean 0 904 in the case of the c4 5 dt model e values alter from 0 786 to 0 841 mean 0 818 tss values range from 0 562 to 0 651 mean 0 628 and auc roc values change from 0 864 to 0 875 mean 0 868 regarding the svm model e tss and auc roc values range between 0 799 and 0 863 mean 0 831 0 690 0 713 mean 0 701 and 0 883 0 895 mean 0 889 respectively as can been seen the lmt model exhibited the highest predictive performance based on all evaluation criteria e 0 860 tss 0 718 auc roc 0 904 followed by svm e 0 831 tss 0 701 auc roc 0 889 and c4 5 dt model e 0 818 tss 0 628 auc roc 0 868 in other words the validation of the results demonstrated a strong agreement between the distribution of the existing spring validation dataset and the predictive maps of the lmt model according to the accuracy classification described in the methodology section the lmt indicated an excellent predictive skill auc roc greater than 0 9 although the svm and c4 5 dt models showed a good accuracy auc roc 0 8 0 9 3 3 robustness analysis the findings of robustness based on three different evaluation criteria are presented in fig 6 a c according to fig 6a all three models were found to be stable and robust in both training and validation steps because there were only slight variations when changes of the training and validation samples were performed as it can be observed the lmt algorithm had minimum re value 0 027 in the validation step indicating the highest stability and robustness in comparison with other models 0 055 and 0 064 fig 6b indicates that svm s stability rtss 0 023 was slightly better than lmt rtss 0 081 and c4 5 dt rtss 0 109 as presented in fig 6c results of the svm with minimum rauc roc value of 0 012 i e close auc roc values in different replicates indicate a high stability and robustness while c4 5 dt rauc roc 0 011 and lmt rauc roc 0 043 showed a slight asymmetry in their results however although all three models were robust based on re rtss and rauc roc indices a slightly higher robustness of the lmt model may be expected when the rauc roc index used 3 4 contribution of the factors in the modelling process the contribution of the groundwater conditioning factors was assessed table 6 and the relative slope position was found to be the most important factor in the modelling with the lmt and c4 5 dt models while it had the secondary importance in the svm overall rsp was chosen as the most important gcf followed by distance from faults and lithology factors it was followed by distance from faults and lithology on the contrary tri slope and ci factors were least important factors identified by the modelling procedure 4 discussion machine learning and data driven models have been gaining popularity in the field of geospatial analysis and modeling especially groundwater spring potential modeling in particularly these approaches show promise when tackling the challenge of mapping groundwater potential or spring potential zones for large regions which may not have sufficient geotechnical and hydrogeological data to conduct physically based and or numerical models maliva and missimer 2012 nampak et al 2014 however on the one hand new proposed hybrid models should be applied and also their applicability and capability must be investigated to find the best model which is more accurate robust and less sensitive to noisy input data and also should maximise information output from the least amount of input data on the other hand there are different sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction of groundwater spring potential including those related to input variables sampling strategy and modelling procedure refsgaard et al 2007 according to garosi et al 2018 among those sources random classification of datasets for training and validation purposes can be an important cause of uncertainty in spatial modelling of groundwater spring potential from the validation result it is clear that all the models provided good to excellent performance in predicting the probability of spring occurrence and based on three threshold dependent and independent evaluation criteria importantly the findings demonstrate that lmt model has the highest efficiency tss and auc roc values for all validation dataset although it sometimes indicated a slightly lower robustness but acceptable in comparison with other models the results reflected that the svm and c4 5 dt also have good performances for both training and the validation datasets even when based on different evaluation criteria the most interesting finding was that lmt was identified as the best model in terms of both accuracy and robustness for groundwater spring potential modelling this finding is consistent with those of landwehr et al 2005 and colkesen and kavzoglu 2017 who stated that the lmt uses classification and regression tree for pruning in order to decrease the impact of overfitting lmt employs the logitboost algorithm for building the logistic regression functions at the nodes of a tree and uses the well known cart algorithm for pruning and shoombuatong et al 2012 proposed this characteristic as a main reason for its capability in the modeling process however as explained in the results section lmt was sometimes slightly sensitive to random changes in the input data but nevertheless within an acceptable range therefore even if we demonstrate that the lmt hybrid model generates more accurate predictions it is still important to identify the main sources of variations that affect its robustness furthermore good performance of the c4 5 dt and svm models in groundwater spring potential mapping was successfully demonstrated according to steinwart and christmann 2008 ballabio and sterlacchini 2012 and min and lee 2005 the svm model is capable of analysing datasets which are complicated have nonlinear relationships and can handle noise in datasets in the case of c4 5 dt model its performance has been effectively assessed in other fields of geospatial modeling such as landslide susceptibility and is consistent with the findings of this research yeon et al 2010 this confirms previous studies tiwari and chatterjee 2010 tehrany et al 2013 2014 dehnavi et al 2015 bui et al 2015 2017b which showed that hybrid models result in better accuracy than single models the results of the current study also demonstrated that the lmt model produced reliable results in terms of accuracy and robustness application of the rsp is new in the field of groundwater potential modelling and it was proved to be an important conditioning factor in the modelling process the rsp has also been identified as an important factor in other fields of study such as soil moisture modelling lookingbill and urban 2004 and landscape modelling macmillan et al 2000 schwarz et al 2003 taverna et al 2005 this study demonstrated that the rsp factor was the most important factor based on three different machine learning models including lmt c4 5 dt and svm after rsp factor distance from faults lithology and altitude were the most influential factors on groundwater spring occurrence a variety of gcfs are reported as important conditioning factors in groundwater spring modelling but so far there are no universal and comprehensive guidelines in selecting independent variables among geo environmental factors for instance rahmati et al 2016 stated that altitude drainage density and lithology are the most important factors naghibi et al 2017c mentioned that ndvi altitude and slope angle were reported as the most important conditioning factors sander 2007 reviewed the importance of lineaments and faults in groundwater exploration this variability of the importance of the factors could be associated with the differences between the geological climate and topographical features of the study areas hence we believe that our results reinforce the literature in recognizing the influential factors on groundwater spring potential because our analyses were conducted using different machine learning algorithms also it is recommended that future research deals with the main sources of uncertainty which might be useful to increase model accuracy 5 conclusion this study was carried out in order to not only investigate the capability a hybrid model lmt to predict the groundwater spring potential for the first time but also compare its capability and robustness with two state of the art models including c4 5 dt and svm in addition some new morphometric factors such as tri rsp and ci were applied and the importance of all gcfs was investigated based on all modeling approaches our study demonstrates that there was generally some differentiation in prediction performance and between stability and robustness hybrid of individual machine learning algorithms the results underlined that even when conducting model comparisons with some clear objectives such as prediction performance and robustness understanding the strengths and limitations remains somewhat difficult for model selection according to the achievements lmt obtained the most outstanding performance based on three threshold dependent and independent evaluation criteria although it sometimes showed a slight sensitivity to changes in the calibration validation data in terms of pure prediction performance the c4 5 dt and svm had a slightly lower accuracy when compared to the lmt in addition the result of variable importance indicated that the rsp was the most important gcf followed by distance from faults and lithology factors on the other contrary tri slope and ci factors were the least important factors in the modelling procedure furthermore the findings of this work could be useful for water resources managers in order to deal with the existing uncertain situation and understand different aspects which influence groundwater potential with more accuracy additionally as a suggestion for future research this methodology could be used to analyse vulnerability of spring flows to climate change i e as a regional water resource analysis tool in order to increase accuracy and diminish the uncertainties in the models hybrid modelling can be suggested which reduces some problems in classification models such as over fitting acknowledgements the work was

7001,sustainable water resources management in arid and semi arid areas needs robust models which allow accurate and reliable predictive modeling this issue has motivated the researchers to develop hybrid models that offer solutions on modelling problems and accurate predictions of groundwater potential zonation for this purpose this research aims to investigate the capability and robustness of a novel hybrid model namely the logistic model tree lmt and compares it with state of the art models such as the support vector machine and c4 5 models that locate potential zones for groundwater

groundwater has always been one of the most precious natural resources in the world due to its importance at different levels in society such as residential agricultural and industrial water supply in addition as a non renewable resource groundwater has important attributes such as low pollution vulnerability water quality steady temperature low susceptibility to environmental disasters and climate change impacts chowdhury et al 2009 manap et al 2013 neshat et al 2014 in fact one third of the world population are reliant on groundwater supplies for their needs which has led to substantial global overuse of this valuable resource the sustainable development of groundwater in arid and semi arid areas is a crucial issue to maintain fresh and usable water resources anbazhagan and jothibasu 2016 the existence and movement of groundwater depend on various geo environmental variables oh et al 2011 in iran where two thirds of its landmass is categorized as arid and semi arid desert land has struggled with water scarcity during the last decades agriculture is one of the most crucial economic sectors in iran and therefore knowledge of groundwater supplies and its potential especially in water scarce areas can be helpful in order to overcome this crisis razandi et al 2015 rahmati et al 2016 drilling geophysical geological and hydrological methods are traditional approaches used to map groundwater resources rahmati et al 2016 geographical information system gis and remote sensing methods have major potential for groundwater potential mapping and assessment oh et al 2011 gis has the ability to work with large spatial datasets and has application in environmental and geological fields oh et al 2011 oh and pradhan 2011 pham et al 2016 rahmati et al 2016 nampak et al 2018 tehrany et al 2014 according to the literature various types of gis based models have been employed for groundwater potential modelling including the frequency ratio oh et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2015 razandi et al 2015 guru et al 2016 weights of evidence modeling corsini et al 2009 lee et al 2012 ozdemir 2011a ghorbani nejad et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017a dempster shafer theory rahmati and melesse 2016 multi

sahoo et al 2017b patra et al 2018 yin et al 2018 for the gpm purpose recently machine learning techniques mlts have attracted the attention of researchers because they recognize patterns hidden in historical groundwater data and capture the nonlinear relation between variables e g suryanarayana et al 2014 yoon et al 2016 rezaie balf et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017c barzegar et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 different mlts such as random forest rahmati et al 2016 classification and regression tree naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 boosted regression tree naghibi et al 2016 golkarian et al 2018 maximum entropy rahmati et al 2016 generalized additive model falah et al 2017 artificial neural network model corsini et al 2009 and aquifer sustainability factor smith et al 2010 have been found useful in the field of modeling groundwater potential among all the statistical methods lr is a robust model which has some advantages in terms of strict assumptions prior to study and capability for ensembling with other models another advantage of lr model is that it represents the predicted probabilities for given patterns pradhan 2010 dong et al 2011 however it still has some drawbacks in analyzing the classes of each conditioning factor tehrany et al 2013 2015 in addition its relative performance depends on the characteristics and the size of the dataset landwehr et al 2005 to overcome these drawbacks in modelling a hybrid model called logistic model tree ltm which is based on the lr model and c4 5 decision tree has been proposed and applied in different fields of study such as flood prediction chapi et al 2017 landslide bui et al 2017a chen et al 2017b and satellite image classification colkesen and kavzoglu 2017 the major aim of this research is the capability of different types of machine learning models including lmt c4 5 and svm to locate potential zones for groundwater springs and to reach this goal the bojnourd area in iran was selected another main reason that makes this study valuable and independent is that the ltm and c4 5 decision tree models are applied separately for the first time in groundwater field and results are compared together with the support vector machine svm model in the studied region moreover the results could be implemented in further natural resources management and planning therefore the specific objectives of the current research are to i spatially predict the groundwater spring potential using different state of the art models including lmt c4 5 and svm ii investigate their performance and capability based on the evaluation criteria and iii explore the robustness and sensitivity of all models to the random splitting of input data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the bojnourd

the study area which play important roles in the development of springs groundwater resources provide 88 percent of the water resource for khorasan province this province has 17 000 km2 of karst masses which are used as karst water resources in order to supply drinking water for citizens of north and razavi khorasan provinces furthermore the area of the north khorasan province is 248 000 km2 with a high population of 6 000 000 people farming is the major activity in this province north khorasan is exposed to an extreme fluctuation in climate sanjani et al 2011 2 2 data used 2 2 1 spring dataset in the study region a total of 359 springs were identified based on both multiple field surveys and documents available from the iranian department of water resources management for the year 2017 fig 1 table 1 monitoring data of these springs in the study area reflected that spring groundwater discharge peaks in march or april and decreases until late august or september iranian department of water resources management idwrm 2015 the yield of springs ranges from a maximum of about 0 8 m3 s in the winter to a minimum of about 0 0005 m3 s in the summer in addition in the study area there are many low yielding springs that outcrop at locations where the local groundwater table intersects the land surface such springs are often temporal and were neglected in the analysis for this analysis the spring inventory locations were randomly divided into two groups 70 251 spring locations and 30 108 spring locations for the purpose of training and validation respectively in other words the validation group were determined through a randomization and was not used in model building it is generally recommended in spatial modeling to use approximately equal proportions of spring present 1 and spring absent 0 pixels corsini et al 2009 ozdemir 2011b keeping this in mind the 359 spring present pixels and randomly selected 359 spring absent pixels were used in the modeling it needs to be clarified that to investigate the robustness of the algorithms three training and three validation datasets s1 s3 were created by implementing the random selection of dependent variable spring locations in a gis environment fig 2 conoscenti et al 2014 angileri et al 2016 the training datasets consisted of 251 spring locations while validation datasets included 108 spring locations 2 2 2 geo environmental factors there are no universal guidelines for selecting groundwater conditioning factors gcf in the present study sixteen geo environmental factors were selected based on the literature to evaluate groundwater spring potential including e g corsini et al 2009 ozdemir 2011a b oh et al 2011 moghaddam et al 2015 naghibi et al 2017a c chen et al 2018 those were altitude aspect plan curvature profile curvature slope land use cover lithology soil distance from fault distance from stream stream density topographic wetness index twi convergence index ci relative slope position rsp topographic position index tpi and terrain roughness index tri in order to identify factors which have a significant relationship with groundwater springs a logistic regression was performed in other word logistic regression establishes a functional relationship between spring locations dependent variable and different conditioning factors independent variables that are recognized as playing a role in spring development ozdemir 2011a b a detailed description and background on the logistic regression method can be found in hosmer et al 2013 the general form of logistic regression is as follows 1 p 1 1 e z where p is the probability of an event occurring and varies from 0 to 1 on an s shaped curve z is a linear combination which can be defined as 2 z a b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where a is the intercept x1 xn represent the values of the independent variables and b1 bn represent the coefficients in fact this statistical method examines the relative strength and significance of the factors tehrany et al 2013 2015 in this study a forward stepwise logistic regression was performed in spss software to analyze data all factors which have a significance value sig of less than 0 5 were accepted as influential predictor variables after the forward stepwise logistic regression analysis twelve gcfs which are altitude aspect slope convergence index distance from fault distance from stream stream density rsp tpi tri twi and lithology were selected because they were statistically significant table 2 however some variables such as the soil land use cover plan curvature and profile curvature were not found to be statistically significant in the model the basic maps such as geology land use and soil were obtained from the iranian department of water resources management and iranian department of geology in addition a digital elevation model dem 20 20 m pixel size was also obtained from iranian national cartographic center for preparing the dem derived layers the dem layer was used altitude indirectly impacts groundwater potential for example higher elevations have higher slope and infiltration decreases mangangka 2008 zapata et al 2000 althuwaynee et al 2012 2014 accordingly this factor was also used in the modelling process slope has an important function in infiltration and influences surface runoff sarkar et al 2001 therefore this map was generated using arcgis 10 2 and a dem of the studied region and was considered as a continuous factor aspect which defines exposure to sunlight dai et al 2001 and subsequently impacts evaporation was also considered as a predictive factor this gcf was also prepared and classified into nine classes of main and sub main classes in addition to a flat category the tpi shows the corresponding position of each pixel it can be computed as eq 3 guisan et al 1999 de reu et al 2013 3 tpi e pixel e surrounding where e pixel shows the altitude of the cell and e surrounding depicts the mean altitude of the neighbor pixels the twi calculates the degree of accumulation of water at a certain pixel in the studied region pourghasemi et al 2013 the twi can be computed by as below 4 twi ln α tan β where α depicts area which drains to a point and β shows the slope angle at the pixel the tri represents the convex and concave slopes althuwaynee et al 2014 kalantar et al 2017 this factor can be calculated as 5 tri x max 2 min 2 where x depicts elevation of each neighbor cell to cell 0 0 m max and min show the largest and smallest elevation value among nine neighbor pixels respectively two stream based layers such as distance from streams and stream density were also produced using euclidean distance and line density functions in arcgis 10 5 these layers were implemented in the modelling process since they are known to influencing groundwater potential liu and yamanaka 2012 nampak et al 2014 the lithology is a very essential gcf as it determines porosity and permeability of an aquifer adiat et al 2012 to investigate the influence of the lithology lithological categories were extracted from a 1 100 000 scale geological map of the studied region obtained from iranian department of geology lithological characteristics of study area are presented in table 3 in addition a layer of distance from faults was produced where the faults were extracted from the geological map of the studied region all of gcf layers are illustrated in fig 3 2 3 methodology the methodology of study is explained in following sections and is shown in fig 4 2 3 1 description of models 2 3 1 1 logistic model tree the logistic model tree lmt is a typical decision tree classification algorithm with a root node inner nodes and leaves however lmt is difference from other tree algorithms in the process of growing splitting and pruning pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances in addition it often reduces the complexity of the final classifier and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting herein logistic regressions eq 1 were built at the nodes and leaves using the logitboost algorithm doetsch et al 2009 whereas the c4 5 rule quinlan 1993 was used to split samples for tree growing and the cart algorithm breiman et al 1984 was employed to prune the tree and prevent overfitting landwehr et al 2005 let s be a spring groundwater training dataset s x i y i i 1 n where n is the total number of the training samples x i r d is the spring groundwater conditioning factors and y i is the class label such as spring groundwater occurrence sg and non spring groundwater occurrence nsg the goal of the training process is to build a tree like structure model that can separate samples into two classes the probability values belong to the spring groundwater occurrence class is used as spring groundwater potential index the process of building the lmt model is summarized below step 1 establishment of the root node using the training sample the root node of the lmt tree model is constructed where a logistic regression model eq 6 is built with the help of the logitboost algorithm thus additive logistic regression is performed and is the optimization process with the aim of minimizing the logistic loss function ln 1 e y i f x i using newton steps as below 1 using the training dataset s compute i initial weight w i 1 n 2 initial committee function f x 0 and probability p x p s g x 1 2 2 repeat i 1 to n iterations we used the default n 200 estimate w i and response z i 6 w i p x i 1 p x i 7 z i y i p x i w i w h e r e y i y i 1 2 generating a new dataset x i z i i 1 n and fit the regression function f x 8 f x β i x i β 0 where β i is the logistic coefficient update f x f x 1 2 f iteration x and p x i 9 p x i exp f sg n s g x exp f sg x exp f nsg x 3 output the final lmt classifier is obtained as sign f x step 2 tree growing the tree is grown by splitting the training samples at the root node using the c4 5 splitting rule 52 to create subsets for inner nodes subsequently using the subsets logistic regression models for these inner nodes are constructed using the logitboost algorithm mentioned above the tree is allowed to continue to grow in the same procedure until nodes have less than 15 samples as the stopping criteria these nodes are converted to leaves step 3 tree pruning finally the tree pruning process is carried out using the cart pruning scheme breiman et al 1984 to prevent overfitting and balance the error rate of the lmt model 2 3 1 2 c4 5 decision tree the c4 5 dt model which was originally presented by quinlan 1986 is an extension of id3 models where attributes are selected using the entropy based gain ratio gr technique for modelling chen et al 2014 the c4 5 dt has two processes that include tree growth which occurs from a node and is then split based on the largest value of gr or the smallest value of entropy and the tree pruning process chen et al 2014 entropy is a measurement of uncertainty and in the modeling process it is an appropriate way to assign an uncertainty score to a stochastic variable thuraisingham and gottwald 2006 let s is a set of training dataset f yi s is the number of cases in the training dataset s which belong to class yi groundwater spring and non groundwater spring the entropy of the groundwater and non groundwater spring at a node f is computed as follows 10 entropy f j p y j f log 2 p y j f where y j f is the relative frequency of node f of the k attribute of f the entropy for a given conditioning factor such as slope is obtained as follows 11 entrop y slope f j 1 k f j f e n t r o p y f j information gain ig was used to calculate the differences between the entropy of the original node and newly a split node which is obtained based on the following equation 12 e n t r o p y slope e n t r o p y f e n t r o p y slope f the ig in the tree selects an attribute with many split points this process leads to growth of the tree toward continuous attributes therefore splitinfo the ig normalized is used to detect this challenge the following equation shows the splitinfo for f node 13 splitinfo j 1 v f j f log 2 f j f the gain ratio gr for slope factor which is the ig rectified by splitinfo denotes as follows 14 gr s l o p e ig s l o p e splitinfo s l o p e to prepare groundwater spring potential mapping the probability of groundwater spring and non groundwater spring classes occurring in the leaf nodes can be computes as follows 15 probability f n groundwaterspring n non g r o u n d w a t e r s p r i n g n groundwaterspring where n groundwater spring and n non groundwater spring are the number of groundwater spring and non groundwater spring classes it is noted that the probability of groundwater and non groundwater springs cannot be utilized as the estimated probability this is because using the above equation eq 15 the estimated probability calculates an extreme value 0 or 1 in leaf nodes therefore to solve this issue the probability is calculated using the smoothing frequencies through ranking leaf nodes using the following equation 16 rank n o d e c h i l d n groundwater s p r i n g m r a n k n o d e p a r e n t n non g r o u n d w a t e r s p r i n g n groundwater s p r i n g m where parameter m is obtained as follows 17 m r d 1 d r k where r is a constant parameter k is the global cardinality of the dataset and d is the depth of the node 2 3 1 3 support vector machines support vector machine svm is one of the advanced and popular supervised machine learning models which was developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 for classification and regression issues bui et al 2017a it is developed based on statistical learning based theory non linear classifiers and the concept of the optimal separation hyperplane in order to specify the widest margin in the training data points between two classes kavzoglu et al 2015 consider a training dataset x x 1 x 2 x n where x is the groundwater spring conditioning factor and y y 1 y 2 is the class label of the dependent variable groundwater spring and non groundwater spring the svm tries to categorize the training dataset into subsets or classes 1 1 using an optimal separating hyperplane which can be formulated as follows 18 f x y i w x i b 1 ξ i where the vector w is the vector of weights determined by the model and specifies the hyperplane orientation of the feature b is a constant which represents the offset of the hyperplane from the origin and ξi is the positive slack variable the solution of w in eq 11 using lagrange multipliers can be found as samui 2008 19 minimize i 1 n α i 1 2 i 1 n j 1 n α i α j y i y j x i x j subject to i 1 n α i y i 0 0 α c where α i are the lagrange multipliers and c is the penalty the decision function of svm can be expressed by the following equation 20 g x sign j 1 n α i x i y i b if the linear kernel function cannot separate the hyperplane some non linear kernel functions are able to do that therefore the decision function of svm can be formulated as follows 21 g x sign j 1 n α i y i k x i x j b where k x i x j is the kernel function there are four types of kernel function in the svm model including linear polynomial radial basis function rbf and sigmoid kernels in fact kernels provide a modular framework in support of vector machines that can be adapted to different tasks such as pattern analysis or recognition steinwart and christmann 2008 the classification accuracy of svm is related to selection of the proper kernel function rahmati et al 2017 the rbf kernel function was used in this study because it has a good interpolation capability zhu et al 2011 the rbf kernel is described as follows 22 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 it is noted that two parameters in the rbf kernel function such as the regularization parameter c and kernel width γ play an important role in the performance of the svm model bui et al 2017a b these parameters are called the hyperparameters of the svm the regularization parameter controls the trade off between maximizing the target margin and minimizing the l1 norm of the margin slack vector of the training data friedrichs and igel 2005 therefore the over fitting problem can be controlled using the c parameter whereby if a large value is used for it fewer margins and thus decreased training errors occur and vice versa damaševičius 2010 additionally the degree of nonlinearity of the svm model is controlled by the γ parameter the posterior probabilities of the svm model which is based on the sigmoid transformation can be computed using the following equation platt 1999 23 p y 1 x 1 1 exp a f x b where a and b are constants in this study the above mentioned equation eq 16 was applied to obtain the posterior probabilities for each pixel of the study area to prepare the groundwater spring potential mapping 2 3 2 model application in this research the input factors were processed analyzed and prepared using arcgis10 4 the lmt model the decision tree model and the svm model for the ground water potential mapping were programmed by the authors in the matlab environment using weka application programming interface api in addition a python tool in arcgis10 4 was developed to transfer the derived spring potential result to raster maps 2 3 3 evaluation of the models the predictive performance was assessed using both threshold independent and threshold dependent performance measures the receiver operating characteristics roc curve as a threshold independent method was plotted for all the training and validation datasets and subsequently goodness of fit and prediction efficacy of the algorithms were investigated respectively oh et al 2011 goodness of fit shows the ability of the algorithm in estimating the training dataset while prediction performance works with the validation dataset bui et al 2012 umar et al 2014 in the roc curve a comparison takes place between the computed groundwater potential map with the validation dataset the plot shows the true positive rate tpr as a function of false positive rate fpr oh and lee 2010 nandi and shakoor 2010 in fact the tpr depicts the proportion of spring pixels that are correctly classified as spring occurrences and the fpr reflects the proportion of the non spring pixels that are incorrectly classified as springs corsini et al 2009 frattini et al 2010 the tpr and fpr can be calculated based on a confusion matrix also known as contingency table using eqs 24 and 25 24 tpr tp tp f n 25 fpr fp fp t n where tp true positive and tn true negative are the number of pixels that are correctly classified whereas fp false positive and fn false negative are the numbers of pixels erroneously classified the area under curve auc roc defines the efficiency of a model to accurately predict an occurrence or non occurrence yesilnacar and topal 2005 naghibi and dashtpagerdi 2017 the auc roc alters from 0 5 to 1 a higher value shows a stronger model while a lower value of auc roc determines a weaker model chen et al 2017a hong et al 2017 according to fressard et al 2014 auc roc can be classified as the following five classes of accuracy poor accuracy for auc roc values from 0 6 to 0 7 fair accuracy for auc roc values from 0 7 to 0 8 good accuracy for auc roc values from 0 8 to 0 9 and excellent accuracy for auc roc values from 0 9 to 1 in addition two threshold dependent evaluation metrics including efficiency e and true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 fukuda et al 2013 were considered to assess the efficiency of the models these evaluation criteria can be calculated using following equations 26 e tp t n tp t n f p f n 27 tss t p r f p r the robustness of a model can be determined by analyzing the changes of the model efficiency when small alterations in input data are made frattini et al 2010 conoscenti et al 2015 angileri et al 2016 cama et al 2017 pourghasemi et al 2017 in the current study three data sets were used for both training and validation steps models were applied to the mentioned datasets and then were verified using the validation datasets the robustness of the predictive model is defined as the stability of the model s results in terms of accuracy models when the training and validation samples are altered rahmati et al 2017 the robustness of the models was calculated by differentiating the maximum and minimum accuracy values based on each evaluation criteria conoscenti et al 2014 28 r e e max e min 29 r tss tss max tss min 30 r auc r o c a u c r o c max a u c r o c min where re rtss and rauc roc are the robustness of a model based on efficiency tss and auc roc criteria respectively emax tssmax and auc rocmax are the maximum accuracy values among all datasets in addition minimum accuracy values are denoted as emin tssmin and auc rocmin among all three datasets these analyses were performed in both training and validation steps 3 results 3 1 application of the models to groundwater potential mapping fig 5 a i show groundwater spring potential maps produced by lmt c4 5 and svm for three different training sets the mentioned maps were classified into four categories of low moderate high and very high using the quantile classification method areas classified as high and very high gwp clearly matches with the sections of the watershed with high slope and close to faults areas along the river and sections of the upstream part headwater are shown to have a promising zone for groundwater 3 2 evaluation of the groundwater potential maps the results of the goodness of fit are shown in table 4 in the case of lmt results performance values range from 0 870 to 0 947 mean 0 902 based on e metric from 0 761 to 0 839 mean 0 796 based on tss 0 917 to 0 965 mean 0 941 based on auc roc according to c4 5 dt results e tss and auc roc values were 0 884 0 938 mean 0 917 0 832 0 898 mean 0 868 0 944 0 969 mean 0 952 respectively accuracy assessment of svm results also indicated that e varies between 0 867 and 0 927 mean 0 894 tss ranges between 0 737 and 0 846 mean 0 797 and auc roc alters between 0 923 and 0 941 mean 0 930 therefore it can be observed that all three models have the good excellent performances in fact e tss and auc roc criteria indicated a substantial agreement between the trained models and reality however as the training datasets were used to generate the models they could not be used to assess their prediction capability the validation analysis shows how well the model can predict groundwater potential in a given area in the validation step the results of the applied models were verified using validation datasets and three different evaluation criteria table 5 according to the lmt results e ranges between 0 847 and 0 874 mean 0 860 tss varies between 0 682 and 0 763 mean 0 718 auc roc changes between 0 881 and 0 924 mean 0 904 in the case of the c4 5 dt model e values alter from 0 786 to 0 841 mean 0 818 tss values range from 0 562 to 0 651 mean 0 628 and auc roc values change from 0 864 to 0 875 mean 0 868 regarding the svm model e tss and auc roc values range between 0 799 and 0 863 mean 0 831 0 690 0 713 mean 0 701 and 0 883 0 895 mean 0 889 respectively as can been seen the lmt model exhibited the highest predictive performance based on all evaluation criteria e 0 860 tss 0 718 auc roc 0 904 followed by svm e 0 831 tss 0 701 auc roc 0 889 and c4 5 dt model e 0 818 tss 0 628 auc roc 0 868 in other words the validation of the results demonstrated a strong agreement between the distribution of the existing spring validation dataset and the predictive maps of the lmt model according to the accuracy classification described in the methodology section the lmt indicated an excellent predictive skill auc roc greater than 0 9 although the svm and c4 5 dt models showed a good accuracy auc roc 0 8 0 9 3 3 robustness analysis the findings of robustness based on three different evaluation criteria are presented in fig 6 a c according to fig 6a all three models were found to be stable and robust in both training and validation steps because there were only slight variations when changes of the training and validation samples were performed as it can be observed the lmt algorithm had minimum re value 0 027 in the validation step indicating the highest stability and robustness in comparison with other models 0 055 and 0 064 fig 6b indicates that svm s stability rtss 0 023 was slightly better than lmt rtss 0 081 and c4 5 dt rtss 0 109 as presented in fig 6c results of the svm with minimum rauc roc value of 0 012 i e close auc roc values in different replicates indicate a high stability and robustness while c4 5 dt rauc roc 0 011 and lmt rauc roc 0 043 showed a slight asymmetry in their results however although all three models were robust based on re rtss and rauc roc indices a slightly higher robustness of the lmt model may be expected when the rauc roc index used 3 4 contribution of the factors in the modelling process the contribution of the groundwater conditioning factors was assessed table 6 and the relative slope position was found to be the most important factor in the modelling with the lmt and c4 5 dt models while it had the secondary importance in the svm overall rsp was chosen as the most important gcf followed by distance from faults and lithology factors it was followed by distance from faults and lithology on the contrary tri slope and ci factors were least important factors identified by the modelling procedure 4 discussion machine learning and data driven models have been gaining popularity in the field of geospatial analysis and modeling especially groundwater spring potential modeling in particularly these approaches show promise when tackling the challenge of mapping groundwater potential or spring potential zones for large regions which may not have sufficient geotechnical and hydrogeological data to conduct physically based and or numerical models maliva and missimer 2012 nampak et al 2014 however on the one hand new proposed hybrid models should be applied and also their applicability and capability must be investigated to find the best model which is more accurate robust and less sensitive to noisy input data and also should maximise information output from the least amount of input data on the other hand there are different sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction of groundwater spring potential including those related to input variables sampling strategy and modelling procedure refsgaard et al 2007 according to garosi et al 2018 among those sources random classification of datasets for training and validation purposes can be an important cause of uncertainty in spatial modelling of groundwater spring potential from the validation result it is clear that all the models provided good to excellent performance in predicting the probability of spring occurrence and based on three threshold dependent and independent evaluation criteria importantly the findings demonstrate that lmt model has the highest efficiency tss and auc roc values for all validation dataset although it sometimes indicated a slightly lower robustness but acceptable in comparison with other models the results reflected that the svm and c4 5 dt also have good performances for both training and the validation datasets even when based on different evaluation criteria the most interesting finding was that lmt was identified as the best model in terms of both accuracy and robustness for groundwater spring potential modelling this finding is consistent with those of landwehr et al 2005 and colkesen and kavzoglu 2017 who stated that the lmt uses classification and regression tree for pruning in order to decrease the impact of overfitting lmt employs the logitboost algorithm for building the logistic regression functions at the nodes of a tree and uses the well known cart algorithm for pruning and shoombuatong et al 2012 proposed this characteristic as a main reason for its capability in the modeling process however as explained in the results section lmt was sometimes slightly sensitive to random changes in the input data but nevertheless within an acceptable range therefore even if we demonstrate that the lmt hybrid model generates more accurate predictions it is still important to identify the main sources of variations that affect its robustness furthermore good performance of the c4 5 dt and svm models in groundwater spring potential mapping was successfully demonstrated according to steinwart and christmann 2008 ballabio and sterlacchini 2012 and min and lee 2005 the svm model is capable of analysing datasets which are complicated have nonlinear relationships and can handle noise in datasets in the case of c4 5 dt model its performance has been effectively assessed in other fields of geospatial modeling such as landslide susceptibility and is consistent with the findings of this research yeon et al 2010 this confirms previous studies tiwari and chatterjee 2010 tehrany et al 2013 2014 dehnavi et al 2015 bui et al 2015 2017b which showed that hybrid models result in better accuracy than single models the results of the current study also demonstrated that the lmt model produced reliable results in terms of accuracy and robustness application of the rsp is new in the field of groundwater potential modelling and it was proved to be an important conditioning factor in the modelling process the rsp has also been identified as an important factor in other fields of study such as soil moisture modelling lookingbill and urban 2004 and landscape modelling macmillan et al 2000 schwarz et al 2003 taverna et al 2005 this study demonstrated that the rsp factor was the most important factor based on three different machine learning models including lmt c4 5 dt and svm after rsp factor distance from faults lithology and altitude were the most influential factors on groundwater spring occurrence a variety of gcfs are reported as important conditioning factors in groundwater spring modelling but so far there are no universal and comprehensive guidelines in selecting independent variables among geo environmental factors for instance rahmati et al 2016 stated that altitude drainage density and lithology are the most important factors naghibi et al 2017c mentioned that ndvi altitude and slope angle were reported as the most important conditioning factors sander 2007 reviewed the importance of lineaments and faults in groundwater exploration this variability of the importance of the factors could be associated with the differences between the geological climate and topographical features of the study areas hence we believe that our results reinforce the literature in recognizing the influential factors on groundwater spring potential because our analyses were conducted using different machine learning algorithms also it is recommended that future research deals with the main sources of uncertainty which might be useful to increase model accuracy 5 conclusion this study was carried out in order to not only investigate the capability a hybrid model lmt to predict the groundwater spring potential for the first time but also compare its capability and robustness with two state of the art models including c4 5 dt and svm in addition some new morphometric factors such as tri rsp and ci were applied and the importance of all gcfs was investigated based on all modeling approaches our study demonstrates that there was generally some differentiation in prediction performance and between stability and robustness hybrid of individual machine learning algorithms the results underlined that even when conducting model comparisons with some clear objectives such as prediction performance and robustness understanding the strengths and limitations remains somewhat difficult for model selection according to the achievements lmt obtained the most outstanding performance based on three threshold dependent and independent evaluation criteria although it sometimes showed a slight sensitivity to changes in the calibration validation data in terms of pure prediction performance the c4 5 dt and svm had a slightly lower accuracy when compared to the lmt in addition the result of variable importance indicated that the rsp was the most important gcf followed by distance from faults and lithology factors on the other contrary tri slope and ci factors were the least important factors in the modelling procedure furthermore the findings of this work could be useful for water resources managers in order to deal with the existing uncertain situation and understand different aspects which influence groundwater potential with more accuracy additionally as a suggestion for future research this methodology could be used to analyse vulnerability of spring flows to climate change i e as a regional water resource analysis tool in order to increase accuracy and diminish the uncertainties in the models hybrid modelling can be suggested which reduces some problems in classification models such as over fitting acknowledgements the work was

7002,the permeability of deep seated reservoirs and aquifers usually changes with formation pressure however the widely used analytical method assumes constant permeability resulting in significant errors in flow rate prediction this work extended the conventional analytical method to consider the effect of stress sensitive permeability the proposed analytical method was validated by comparing analytical flow rate solutions for vertical wells with numerical flow rate solutions the production rates of a multi stage fractured horizontal msfh well with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability were obtained a field case of an msfh well was used to test the applicability of the proposed analytical method it was found that the stress sensitive effect negatively affected production rates of the msfh well for the whole flow period increasing with increasing drawdown pressure and permeability modulus the proposed method is appropriate for various well types and reservoir scenarios compared with the conventional method the proposed method can be employed to obtain more accurate production rates with little increase in the computational time keywords transient

groundwater are exploited through a well formation pressure in the reservoir and aquifer decreases and the effective stress of the overburden rock increases causing deformation of the rock skeleton and a decrease in permeability the changes in permeability affect the flow mechanisms of underground fluids and the production performance of the well therefore it is critical to understand the influence of stress sensitive permeability on the transient pressure and transient flow rate in groundwater hydrology petroleum industry and environmental engineering over past decades numerous models considering the stress sensitive effect have been established to analyze transient pressure behaviors of various wells in different scenarios pedrosa 1986 introduced a new variable related to pressure to alleviate the nonlinearity of the seepage model with the stress sensitive effect and proposed a pressure solution with first order approximation based on the perturbation technique kikani and pedrosa 1991 employed the perturbation technique to derive the pressure solution with second order approximation considering the stress sensitive effect ambastha and zhang 1996 used iterative and numerical methods to investigate transient pressure responses of vertical wells in stress sensitive reservoirs aquifers wu and pruess 2000 discussed the pressure characteristics of vertical wells in a stress sensitive porous medium based on the integral method ren and guo 2014 established a seepage model for vertical wells in stress sensitive reservoirs with the assumption of the power function relationship between pressure and permeability and then made a detailed pressure transient analysis zhang et al 2014 investigated pressure buildup responses of fractured vertical wells in stress sensitive reservoirs zhao et al 2014a proposed the zero order perturbation pressure solution for horizontal wells and discussed the effect of stress sensitive permeability on bottomhole pressure wang 2014 proposed a seepage model of multi stage fractured horizontal msfh wells in stress sensitive shale gas reservoirs and obtained a pressure solution with zero order approximation wang et al 2017 investigated the transient pressure of msfh wells taking into account the influence of stress sensitivity on reservoir formation and hydraulic fractures however despite this body of work to date work related to transient flow rate with reference to the stress sensitive effect remains rare the transient flow rates of producing wells not only reflect the production performance but also can be used to analyze reservoir and aquifer properties blasingame et al 1991 guo et al 2012 zhao et al 2014b the main analytical methods employed to obtain transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect for wells producing at a constant bottomhole pressure can be classified into two categories 1 the first approach uses the classical relationship between transient flow rate and transient pressure as proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 which indicates that once the pressure solution in laplace space under constant rate production crp condition has been known the flow rate solution in laplace space under constant pressure production cpp condition can be obtained by the formula derived by van everdingen and hurst 1949 although this strategy has been extensively employed to obtain the production rate of various wells ozkan and raghavan 1991 guo et al 2012 zhao et al 2014b the generated production rate cannot take stress sensitive permeability into consideration recently some scholars zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 have directly substituted the laplace space pressure solution with the stress sensitive effect into the van everdingen and hurst 1949 formula and claimed that the generated flow rate solutions reflect the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition careful analysis has shown that the formula proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 is derived based on duhamel s principle which is only suitable for the linear diffusivity equation rather than the nonlinear one van everdingen and hurst 1949 ren and guo 2018 owing to the nonlinearity of the diffusivity equation including the stress sensitive effect the formula proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 cannot be directly employed to obtain the flow rate solution with the stress sensitive effect 2 the other strategy is to establish explicit models for wells under the cpp condition including the stress sensitive effect deng et al 2016 ji et al 2017 although this strategy can obtain the transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect it is only applied to simple well types such as vertical well or simple flows such as linear flow because it is challenging to directly establish explicit models to obtain analytical flow rate solutions for various wells under the cpp condition especially when the well type and the flow are quite complex therefore this approach is tedious and has some limitations as the above literature summary although the first strategy for obtaining the transient flow rate is simple and applies to a variety of well types the analytical method van everdingen and hurst 1949 only fits linear seepage models and cannot be applied to nonlinear seepage models with the stress sensitive effect therefore it is very natural to consider whether the conventional method van everdingen and hurst 1949 could be improved so as to take into account the influence of stress sensitivity in this study we revisited the analytical method of van everdingen and hurst 1949 and extended it to consider the effect of stress sensitive permeability we validated the proposed method by comparing the analytical flow rate solution for vertical wells with a numerical flow rate solution finally we took an msfh well as an example to discuss the influence of stress sensitive permeability on the transient flow rate 2 mathematical model with the stress sensitive effect in order to obtain the general flow rate solution with the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition a mathematical model with the stress sensitive effect was established for simplicity and without loss of generality a completely penetrating vertical well was considered while the derived flow rate solution was general and suitable for various well types van everdingen and hurst 1949 ren and guo 2018

fluid viscosity pa s p is the formation pressure pa permeability varies with formation pressure when the underground fluid is exploited by wells many stress dependent permeability models have been proposed to describe the variation in permeability such as the one parameter exponential model pedrosa 1986 stepwise permeability model ambastha and zhang 1996 two parameter exponential model ambastha and zhang 1996 strain dependent permeability model chen et al 2007 and power function model zisser and nover 2009 compared with the one parameter exponential model pedrosa jr 1986 other models may obtain more accurate descriptions of stress dependent permeability but the other models are so complex that they cannot be used to establish analytical seepage models on the other hand the one parameter exponential model pedrosa 1986 has sufficient accuracy to satisfy engineering requirements and has been widely used in practice wang 2014 zhao et al 2014a wang et al 2017 therefore the one parameter exponential model pedrosa 1986 was adopted in this work and can be described as follows 3 γ 1 k k p where γ is the permeability modulus p a 1 the fluid compressibility and rock compressibility are expressed as follows 4 c f 1 ρ ρ p 5 c m 1 ϕ ϕ p where c f is the fluid compressibility p a 1 c m is the rock compressibility p a 1 taking eqs 2 5 into eq 1 and assuming γ c f we

δ p r r r w eqs 9 and 11 15 compose a nonlinear seepage model for the vertical well considering the stress sensitive effect when γ 0 the nonlinear seepage model is reduced to the linear one without the stress sensitive effect i e eqs 10 14 and 16 van everdingen and hurst 1949 in order to alleviate the nonlinearity of the nonlinear seepage model the following functional transformation is introduced pedrosa 1986 17 δ p 1 γ ln 1 γ ξ where ξ is the transformed pressure of δ p pa note that the value of γ ξ must lie between zero and unity in eq 17 substituting eq 17 into eqs 9 and 11 15 yields that 18 2 ξ r 2 1 r ξ r ϕ μ c t k i 1 1 γ ξ ξ t 19 ξ t 0 0 20 lim r ξ 0 infinite 21 ξ r r e 0 constant pressure 22 ξ r r r e 0 closed 23 q w t 2 π k i h μ b r ξ r r r w it is obvious that with the aid of eq 17 the strong nonlinearity in eq 9 is considerably weakened in eq 18 where the nonlinearity is restricted to the coefficient of the term on the right side only the following perturbation technique is employed to obtain an approximate analytical solution of the above seepage model eqs 18 23 24 ξ ξ 0 γ ξ 1 γ 2 ξ 2 25 1 1 γ ξ 1 γ ξ γ 2 ξ 2 where ξ 0 ξ 1 ξ 2 are zero order first order and second order perturbation solutions for ξ respectively pa p a 2 p a 3 taking into account that the value of γ is usually small the zero order perturbation solution ξ 0 always has sufficient accuracy to satisfy engineering requirements wang 2014 wang et al 2017 and thus eqs 18 23 can be rewritten as 26 2 ξ 0 r 2 1 r ξ 0 r ϕ μ c t k i ξ 0 t 27 ξ 0 t 0 0 28 lim r ξ 0 0 infinite 29 ξ 0 r r e 0 constant pressure 30 ξ 0 r r r e 0 closed 31 q w t 2 π k i h μ b r ξ 0 r r r w it is obvious that the linearized seepage model including eqs 26 31 with respect to ξ 0 is equivalent to the conventional model including eqs 10 14 and 16 with respect to δ p therefore duhamel s principle can be applied to the linearized system with respect to ξ 0 3 general solution for transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect following the procedures van everdingen and hurst 1949 ren and guo 2018 the general flow rate solution with the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition was derived based on duhamel s principle with the aid of eq 16 the cumulative production solution without the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition is expressed as van everdingen and hurst 1949 32 q w t

dimensionless bottomhole pressure based on duhamel s principle and eq 35 the cumulative production solution without the stress sensitive effect under the variable pressure production condition is given as 42 q w t 2 π h ϕ c t r w 2 b 0 t d δ p w τ d q wd t d τ d d τ d where τ d is a variable of integration in the same way the cumulative production solution with the stress sensitive effect

and the cumulative production of a well producing at a constant flow rate is expressed as 45 q w t q w t considering t d k i t ϕ μ c t r w 2 and substituting eqs 41 and 45 into eq 44 yields 46 t d 0 t

stress sensitive effect and the bottomhole pressure solution under the crp condition without the stress sensitive effect with the aid of eq 55 and the stehfest inversion method stehfest 1970 we can obtain the production rate solution for a variety of wells with the stress sensitive effect once the bottomhole pressure solution without the stress sensitive effect has been obtained if the stress sensitive effect is negligible i e γ d 0 eq 55 is simplified to the classical relationship between the production rate solution and the bottomhole pressure solution van everdingen and hurst 1949 56 p

solution and the bottomhole pressure solution was validated and the analytical solutions for production rate of vertical wells with the stress sensitive effect were compared with numerical solutions 4 1 cpp case with the stress sensitive effect here we considered a vertical well with a constant bottomhole pressure in a lateral infinite reservoir the dimensionless variables are introduced in table 1 and the dimensionless seepage model considering the effect of stress sensitive permeability is displayed as follows the derivation of the dimensionless model shown in supplementary material 57 2 p d r

value of γ d ξ d always lies between zero and unity in the above nonlinear model eqs 62 65 eqs 62 65 compose a nonlinear model that is difficult to solve analytically and thus the perturbation technique is used to linearize the above nonlinear model under the conditions of γ d 1 66 ξ d ξ d0 γ d ξ d1 γ d 2 ξ d2 67 1 1 γ d ξ d 1 γ d ξ d γ d 2 ξ d 2 where ξ d 0 ξ d 1 ξ d 2 are zero order first

laplace space without the stress sensitive effect 81 p wd p d r d 1 k 0 s s s k 1 s it is interesting that multiplying eq 76 by eq 81 yields our proposed relationship in eq 55 which validates the above analysis 4 3 comparison between the zero order analytical solution and numerical solution the analytical solution with zero order approximation presented in eq 76 was validated by comparison with a numerical solution that was based on a nonlinear model including eqs 62 65 obtained by the fully implicit finite difference method the numerical solution of the nonlinear model shown in supplementary material 4 3 1 grid dependency for numerical solution it is critical to test the grid dependency for the numerical solution before applying it to validate a zero order analytical solution we conducted the numerical simulations based on different cell dimensions namely grid numbers n 1000 2000 and 3000 the effect of grid number on the numerical solution is shown in fig 1 there was no obvious improvement in the accuracy of the numerical solution when the grid was refined therefore grid number n 1000 was adopted for the simulations 4 3 2 validity of the zero order analytical solution the zero order perturbation technique was employed to obtain the analytical solution with zero order approximation eqs 66 76 and the accuracy of the zero order analytical solution mainly depended on the magnitude of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d based on the definition of γ d shown in table 1 γ d is proportional to the permeability modulus γ and the drawdown pressure δ p w p i p w the permeability modulus is usually smaller than 0 05 mp a 1 ren and guo 2014 and the drawdown pressure is usually less than 10 mpa so the typical value of γ d is usually less than 0 5 fig 2 shows a comparison between the analytical solution with zero order approximation and the numerical solution under the conditions of γ d 0 1 and 0 5 the analytical solution with zero order approximation is in good agreement with the numerical solution in order to quantify the effect of the zero order approximation on the prediction accuracy of the production rate we defined 82 δ q wda q wdn q wdn 100 where δ is the relative difference between the zero order analytical solution and the numerical solution q wda and q wdn are the dimensionless production rates obtained by the zero order analytical method and the numerical method respectively the perturbation technique shown in eq 66 is established based onthe value of γ d being less than unity pedrosa 1986 and so the zero order perturbation analytical model including eqs 68 71 is derived from the nonlinear model including eqs 62 65 only when γ d 1 in other words the proposed analytical method with the stress sensitive effect is available under the conditions of γ d 1 even though the relative difference between the zero order analytical solution eq 76 and the numerical solution of the nonlinear model eqs 62 65 may be small for the cases of γ d 1 under some conditions in fact the permeability modulus is rarely greater than 0 1 mp a 1 in actual stress sensitive reservoirs ren and guo 2014 and the drawdown pressure is usually smaller than 10 mpa thus the value of γ d is less than 1 0 in most cases in order to test the validity of the proposed analytical method under the conditions of γ d 1 the comparison between the analytical solution with zero order approximation and the numerical solution was conducted based on the values of γ d being less than or equal to 1 0 the results of the relative difference between the analytical solution with zero order approximation and the numerical solution are shown in table 2 from which we can see that the relative difference δ decreases with increasing the elapsed time t d such as when t d 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 and 10 8 for γ d 0 1 the values of δ are 1 48 0 52 0 22 0 12 and 0 08 respectively table 2 as the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d increases the magnitude of δ increases such as when γ d 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 and 1 0 for t d 10 2 the values of the δ are 0 52 1 08 1 59 2 04 2 44 and 2 63 respectively table 2 it should be noted that δ may reach a relatively large value when the value of t d is very small and the value of γ d is extremely big such as δ 8 23 when t d 10 0 and γ d 1 0 on the other hand considering the real fluid and rock properties for a vertical well table 3 the real time t is associated with the dimensionless time t d table 2 based on the definition of t d listed in table 1 fig 3 shows the relative difference δ changes over the real time t under different values of γ d the δ becomes negligibly small less than 0 8 in the cases of γ d 1 0 when the well produces for more than one day in fact as shown in table 2 when t 0 25 days i e t d 10 4 the value of δ for γ d 1 0 is only 0 97 thus it can be concluded that the error of the proposed analytical method for the cases of γ d 1 is negligibly small when the well produces for more than one day in practice we focus on the well production rate in terms of days rather than the short time within one day and production rate data used for production performance analysis are usually collected in terms of days xu et al 2015 ji et al 2017 therefore the proposed analytical method provides a satisfactory way to obtain and predict the production rate with the stress sensitive effect under most conditions in practice fig 4 shows the effect of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d on the production rate of a vertical well in a lateral infinite reservoir the production rate solutions here are obtained by the numerical method the influence of γ d on the production rate takes place across the whole flow period and the production rate decreases with increasing the magnitude of γ d it is interesting that the influence of γ d on the production rate remains almost unchanged for the whole period in the log log production rate plot as shown in fig 4 a the relative differences between production rates with and without the stress sensitive effect are nearly invariable which is in accordance with the results of the explicit models for wells under the cpp condition including the stress sensitive effect deng et al 2016 ji et al 2017 however this finding suggests that the previous analytical methods zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 for predicting the production rate with the stress sensitive effect may be incorrect the characteristics of the production rate obtained by previous analytical methods zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 are that the relative differences between production rates with and without the stress sensitive effect are negligible in the early flow period and increases with the elapsed time t d in the log log production rate plot this is because previous results zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 were obtained based on the classical relationship between transient flow rate and transient pressure as proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 the analytical method proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 is derived from duhamel s principle and only suitable for the linear model without the stress sensitive effect and thus the analytical method proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 cannot be directly employed to obtain a production rate solution with the stress sensitive effect in this study we expanded the analytical method proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 to consider the effect of the stress sensitive permeability and the results obtained by our proposed analytical method were validated by the numerical method therefore we believe the proposed analytical method can be employed to obtain correct production rate solutions with the stress sensitive effect 5 results and analysis as discussed above the general analytical method has been proposed to obtain the production rate with the stress sensitive effect for a variety of well types we took the msfh well as an example and investigated the effect of stress sensitive permeability on the production performance recently various models for msfh wells in different reservoir scenarios without the stress sensitive effect have been proposed here the semi analytical model for msfh wells in a lateral infinite reservoir was considered wan 1999 ren and guo 2015a b the detail of the semi analytical model shown in supplementary material and a schematic of an msfh well is shown in fig 5 based on the superposition principle ozkan 1988 wang and yi 2017 the bottomhole pressure solution of the msfh well under the crp condition without the stress sensitive effect is presented in supplementary material using eqs 55 and 56 the production rates of the msfh well with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability are obtained respectively 5 1 field validation a field case of an msfh well was used to validate the proposed analytical method the msfh well well 1 is located in the pembina cardium field of western canada field data for well 1 were collected from recent published papers clarkson and pedersen 2010 2011 ji et al 2017 the msfh well produced at a nearly constant bottomhole pressure after 21 days and thus the msfh well was considered to produce at a constant bottomhole pressure throughout the whole production period ji et al 2017 to filter out the effect of the outer boundary response production rate data before 250 days were used to conduct production performance analysis based on the above semi analytical model for msfh wells this was chosen because pressure wave had not arrived at the outer boundary on the 250th day clarkson and pedersen 2011 basic parameters of well 1 for generating the matching curves are listed in table 4 and the matching results of production rate data are shown in fig 6 the matching curve with the stress sensitive effect is in good agreement with the production rate data the matching parameters including the fracture wing length and permeability modulus are listed in table 4 and highlighted with an asterisk the matching result of the fracture wing length i e l f 55m by our method is consistent with the matching result i e l f 181 ft 55m presented in the literature clarkson and pedersen 2010 but our method can consider the effect of stress sensitive permeability and obtain the permeability modulus furthermore it can be observed from fig 6 that the matching curve without the stress sensitive effect obviously deviates from production rate data and from the matching curve with the stress sensitive effect of course some other factors also affect the interpretation results such as parameter uncertainty heterogeneity of reservoirs and aquifers and non darcy effect of flow near the well in other words a good match between the production rate data and the matching curve without the stress sensitive effect may be obtained by changing other parameters or choosing other models however as shown in fig 6 stress sensitive permeability has a significant effect on production performance analysis which indicates that ignoring the effect of stress sensitive permeability may result in unreasonable results for the production performance analysis of actual stress sensitive reservoirs 5 2 sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows the effect of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir the magnitude of γ d affects the production rate across the whole flow period the production rate decreases with increasing the value of γ d indicating that the stress sensitive effect has a more negative effect on the production rate when the msfh well produces at a larger drawdown pressure and the permeability modulus of the reservoir formation becomes greater the reason is that the stress sensitive permeability is reduced with increasing the drawdown pressure δ p w i e p i p w and permeability modulus γ based on eq 3 and the reduction of the permeable capacity leads to the decrease in the production rate therefore the production rate decreases with increasing γ d which is proportional to δ p w and γ according to the definition of γ d in table s1 in order to quantify the effect of stress sensitive permeability on production rate we defined the relative difference as 83 ε q wds q wdl q wdl 100 where ε is the relative difference between production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability q wds and q wdl are the dimensionless production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability respectively according to eqs 55 56 and 83 it is easy to obtain 84 ε 1 exp γ d γ d γ d 100 it is clear that the relative difference ε between production rates with and without the stress sensitive effect in the cpp case is mainly dependent on the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d fig 8 shows the effect of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d on the relative difference between production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability the general functional relationship between the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d and the relative difference ε is derived in eq 84 it is obvious that the relative difference ε increases with increasing γ d such as when γ d 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 9 ε is 4 8 4 13 61 21 31 34 06 respectively furthermore it is interesting that as the magnitude of γ d increases the ε firstly increases rapidly but then slows to a lower growth rate the reason for this may be that stress sensitive permeability usually decreases rapidly at first but then reduces more slowly with decreasing formation pressure p i e increasing pressure difference δ p pedrosa 1986 the value of γ d is proportional to the drawdown pressure δ p w p i p w considering the positive correlation between permeability and production rate the relative differences between production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability firstly increase rapidly and then increase slowly with increasing γ d we also considered the influence of some parameters on the production rate of the msfh well in the stress sensitive reservoir formation fig 9 shows the effect of hydraulic fracture number m on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir the m has an effect on the production rate for the whole flow period and increasing m can enhance the production rate while the influence becomes smaller in the late production stage compared with the early and intermediate production stages this is because increasing m can enhance permeable capacity in the area near the wellbore and thus the production rate should increase when the well produces at a constant drawdown pressure as the elapsed time t d increases the affected area of the pressure wave keeps getting bigger and the contribution of the enhanced permeable capacity to the average permeability of the affected area becomes smaller as a consequence it is important for the hydraulic fracturing to increase the hydraulic fracture number of the msfh well in the whole production period especially in the early and intermediate production stages fig 10 shows the effect of fracture spacing δ y i on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir it is clear that the δ y i has no effect on the production rate in the early flow period when the fracture interference has not taken place after the fracture interference occurs the production rate of the msfh well with constant bottomhole pressure will decline rapidly increasing the δ y i gives rise to a later appearance of the fracture interference and thus the production rate increases with the δ y i in the late flow period furthermore as the elapsed time t d increases the effect of the fracture interference on the production rate decreases at the late flow period the reason is that owing to the effect of the fracture interference the permeable capacity in the area near hydraulic fractures will be reduced and thus the production rate of the msfh well will decrease when the well keeps on producing at a constant drawdown pressure however as the elapsed time t d increases the affected area of the pressure wave becomes bigger and bigger and the contribution of the reduced permeable capacity to the average permeability of the affected area becomes smaller so the effect of the fracture spacing on the production rate decreases as the elapsed time t d increases at the late flow period fig 11 shows the effect of fracture wing length l f on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir it is obvious that the l f affects the production rate in nearly the whole flow period a significant influence of l f on the production rate is observed in the early production stage while the influence becomes negligibly small in the late production stage increasing l f enhances the production rate in the cpp case the reason is similar to that of the hydraulic fracture number m the permeable capacity in the area near the wellbore increases with increasing l f and so the production rate increases with increasing l f when the well produces at a constant drawdown pressure however as the elapsed time t d increases the contribution of the enhanced permeable capacity to the average permeability of the affected area becomes relatively insignificant in the late production stage therefore increasing the fracture wing length is critical to obtaining good performance of msfh wells only in the early production stage 6 conclusions in this study we discussed the relationship between models with and without the stress sensitive effect and proposed a general analytical method for transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition based on duhamel s principle the proposed method was validated by comparing the analytical flow rate solutions for vertical wells with numerical flow rate solutions the production rate of an msfh well in the stress sensitive reservoir formation was obtained by the proposed method and a field case of an msfh well was used to test the applicability of the proposed analytical method the effect of relevant parameters on the production rate of the msfh well was discussed in detail several conclusions are listed as follows 1 the flow rate solution with zero order approximation has sufficient accuracy to satisfy engineering requirements thus this approach can be applied to predicting the production rate in practice 2 stress sensitive permeability negatively affects the production rate of msfh wells across the whole flow period the stress sensitive effect increases with increasing drawdown pressure and permeability modulus 3 the relative differences between production rates of the msfh well with and without the stress sensitive effect are mainly dependent on the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d which is related to drawdown pressure and permeability modulus as the magnitude of γ d increases the relative difference firstly increases rapidly and then slows to a lower growth rate 4 increasing the hydraulic fracture number and fracture wing length can significantly enhance the production rate of an msfh well in the early production stage while the effects of the hydraulic fracture number and fracture wing length on the production rate are relatively insignificant during the late production stage 5 the fracture spacing has no effect on the production rate of msfh wells in the early flow period when fracture interference has not taken place fracture interference leads to a decrease in the production rate while the effect of fracture interference decreases with increasing the elapsed time 6 the permeability of deep seated reservoirs and aquifers is usually dependent on pressure and so compared with the conventional analytical method the proposed method considering the stress sensitive effect can be used to obtain more accurate production rate with little increase in

groundwater are exploited through a well formation pressure in the reservoir and aquifer decreases and the effective stress of the overburden rock increases causing deformation of the rock skeleton and a decrease in permeability the changes in permeability affect the flow mechanisms of underground fluids and the production performance of the well therefore it is critical to understand the influence of stress sensitive permeability on the transient pressure and transient flow rate in groundwater hydrology petroleum industry and environmental engineering over past decades numerous models considering the stress sensitive effect have been established to analyze transient pressure behaviors of various wells in different scenarios pedrosa 1986 introduced a new variable related to pressure to alleviate the nonlinearity of the seepage model with the stress sensitive effect and proposed a pressure solution with first order approximation based on the perturbation technique kikani and pedrosa 1991 employed the perturbation technique to derive the pressure solution with second order approximation considering the stress sensitive effect ambastha and zhang 1996 used iterative and numerical methods to investigate transient pressure responses of vertical wells in stress sensitive reservoirs aquifers wu and pruess 2000 discussed the pressure characteristics of vertical wells in a stress sensitive porous medium based on the integral method ren and guo 2014 established a seepage model for vertical wells in stress sensitive reservoirs with the assumption of the power function relationship between pressure and permeability and then made a detailed pressure transient analysis zhang et al 2014 investigated pressure buildup responses of fractured vertical wells in stress sensitive reservoirs zhao et al 2014a proposed the zero order perturbation pressure solution for horizontal wells and discussed the effect of stress sensitive permeability on bottomhole pressure wang 2014 proposed a seepage model of multi stage fractured horizontal msfh wells in stress sensitive shale gas reservoirs and obtained a pressure solution with zero order approximation wang et al 2017 investigated the transient pressure of msfh wells taking into account the influence of stress sensitivity on reservoir formation and hydraulic fractures however despite this body of work to date work related to transient flow rate with reference to the stress sensitive effect remains rare the transient flow rates of producing wells not only reflect the production performance but also can be used to analyze reservoir and aquifer properties blasingame et al 1991 guo et al 2012 zhao et al 2014b the main analytical methods employed to obtain transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect for wells producing at a constant bottomhole pressure can be classified into two categories 1 the first approach uses the classical relationship between transient flow rate and transient pressure as proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 which indicates that once the pressure solution in laplace space under constant rate production crp condition has been known the flow rate solution in laplace space under constant pressure production cpp condition can be obtained by the formula derived by van everdingen and hurst 1949 although this strategy has been extensively employed to obtain the production rate of various wells ozkan and raghavan 1991 guo et al 2012 zhao et al 2014b the generated production rate cannot take stress sensitive permeability into consideration recently some scholars zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 have directly substituted the laplace space pressure solution with the stress sensitive effect into the van everdingen and hurst 1949 formula and claimed that the generated flow rate solutions reflect the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition careful analysis has shown that the formula proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 is derived based on duhamel s principle which is only suitable for the linear diffusivity equation rather than the nonlinear one van everdingen and hurst 1949 ren and guo 2018 owing to the nonlinearity of the diffusivity equation including the stress sensitive effect the formula proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 cannot be directly employed to obtain the flow rate solution with the stress sensitive effect 2 the other strategy is to establish explicit models for wells under the cpp condition including the stress sensitive effect deng et al 2016 ji et al 2017 although this strategy can obtain the transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect it is only applied to simple well types such as vertical well or simple flows such as linear flow because it is challenging to directly establish explicit models to obtain analytical flow rate solutions for various wells under the cpp condition especially when the well type and the flow are quite complex therefore this approach is tedious and has some limitations as the above literature summary although the first strategy for obtaining the transient flow rate is simple and applies to a variety of well types the analytical method van everdingen and hurst 1949 only fits linear seepage models and cannot be applied to nonlinear seepage models with the stress sensitive effect therefore it is very natural to consider whether the conventional method van everdingen and hurst 1949 could be improved so as to take into account the influence of stress sensitivity in this study we revisited the analytical method of van everdingen and hurst 1949 and extended it to consider the effect of stress sensitive permeability we validated the proposed method by comparing the analytical flow rate solution for vertical wells with a numerical flow rate solution finally we took an msfh well as an example to discuss the influence of stress sensitive permeability on the transient flow rate 2 mathematical model with the stress sensitive effect in order to obtain the general flow rate solution with the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition a mathematical model with the stress sensitive effect was established for simplicity and without loss of generality a completely penetrating vertical well was considered while the derived flow rate solution was general and suitable for various well types van everdingen and hurst 1949 ren and guo 2018

fluid viscosity pa s p is the formation pressure pa permeability varies with formation pressure when the underground fluid is exploited by wells many stress dependent permeability models have been proposed to describe the variation in permeability such as the one parameter exponential model pedrosa 1986 stepwise permeability model ambastha and zhang 1996 two parameter exponential model ambastha and zhang 1996 strain dependent permeability model chen et al 2007 and power function model zisser and nover 2009 compared with the one parameter exponential model pedrosa jr 1986 other models may obtain more accurate descriptions of stress dependent permeability but the other models are so complex that they cannot be used to establish analytical seepage models on the other hand the one parameter exponential model pedrosa 1986 has sufficient accuracy to satisfy engineering requirements and has been widely used in practice wang 2014 zhao et al 2014a wang et al 2017 therefore the one parameter exponential model pedrosa 1986 was adopted in this work and can be described as follows 3 γ 1 k k p where γ is the permeability modulus p a 1 the fluid compressibility and rock compressibility are expressed as follows 4 c f 1 ρ ρ p 5 c m 1 ϕ ϕ p where c f is the fluid compressibility p a 1 c m is the rock compressibility p a 1 taking eqs 2 5 into eq 1 and assuming γ c f we

δ p r r r w eqs 9 and 11 15 compose a nonlinear seepage model for the vertical well considering the stress sensitive effect when γ 0 the nonlinear seepage model is reduced to the linear one without the stress sensitive effect i e eqs 10 14 and 16 van everdingen and hurst 1949 in order to alleviate the nonlinearity of the nonlinear seepage model the following functional transformation is introduced pedrosa 1986 17 δ p 1 γ ln 1 γ ξ where ξ is the transformed pressure of δ p pa note that the value of γ ξ must lie between zero and unity in eq 17 substituting eq 17 into eqs 9 and 11 15 yields that 18 2 ξ r 2 1 r ξ r ϕ μ c t k i 1 1 γ ξ ξ t 19 ξ t 0 0 20 lim r ξ 0 infinite 21 ξ r r e 0 constant pressure 22 ξ r r r e 0 closed 23 q w t 2 π k i h μ b r ξ r r r w it is obvious that with the aid of eq 17 the strong nonlinearity in eq 9 is considerably weakened in eq 18 where the nonlinearity is restricted to the coefficient of the term on the right side only the following perturbation technique is employed to obtain an approximate analytical solution of the above seepage model eqs 18 23 24 ξ ξ 0 γ ξ 1 γ 2 ξ 2 25 1 1 γ ξ 1 γ ξ γ 2 ξ 2 where ξ 0 ξ 1 ξ 2 are zero order first order and second order perturbation solutions for ξ respectively pa p a 2 p a 3 taking into account that the value of γ is usually small the zero order perturbation solution ξ 0 always has sufficient accuracy to satisfy engineering requirements wang 2014 wang et al 2017 and thus eqs 18 23 can be rewritten as 26 2 ξ 0 r 2 1 r ξ 0 r ϕ μ c t k i ξ 0 t 27 ξ 0 t 0 0 28 lim r ξ 0 0 infinite 29 ξ 0 r r e 0 constant pressure 30 ξ 0 r r r e 0 closed 31 q w t 2 π k i h μ b r ξ 0 r r r w it is obvious that the linearized seepage model including eqs 26 31 with respect to ξ 0 is equivalent to the conventional model including eqs 10 14 and 16 with respect to δ p therefore duhamel s principle can be applied to the linearized system with respect to ξ 0 3 general solution for transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect following the procedures van everdingen and hurst 1949 ren and guo 2018 the general flow rate solution with the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition was derived

obtain the production rate solution for a variety of wells with the stress sensitive effect once the bottomhole pressure solution without the stress sensitive effect has been obtained if the stress

above analysis 4 3 comparison between the zero order analytical solution and numerical solution the analytical solution with zero order approximation presented in eq 76 was validated by comparison with a numerical solution that was based on a nonlinear model including eqs 62 65 obtained by the fully implicit finite difference method the numerical solution of the nonlinear model shown in supplementary material 4 3 1 grid dependency for numerical solution it is critical to test the grid dependency for the numerical solution before applying it to validate a zero order analytical solution we conducted the numerical simulations based on different cell dimensions namely grid numbers n 1000 2000 and 3000 the effect of grid number on the numerical solution is shown in fig 1 there was no obvious improvement in the accuracy of the numerical solution when the grid was refined therefore grid number n 1000 was adopted for the simulations 4 3 2 validity of the zero order analytical solution the zero order perturbation technique was employed to obtain the analytical solution with zero order approximation eqs 66 76 and the accuracy of the zero order analytical solution mainly depended on the magnitude of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d based on the definition of γ d shown in table 1 γ d is proportional to the permeability modulus γ and the drawdown pressure δ p w p i p w the permeability modulus is usually smaller than 0 05 mp a 1 ren and guo 2014 and the drawdown pressure is usually less than 10 mpa so the typical value of γ d is usually less than 0 5 fig 2 shows a comparison between the analytical solution with zero order approximation and the numerical solution under the conditions of γ d 0 1 and 0 5 the analytical solution with zero order approximation is in good agreement with the numerical solution in order to quantify the effect of the zero order approximation on the prediction accuracy of the production rate we defined 82 δ q wda q wdn q wdn 100 where δ is the relative difference between the zero order analytical solution and the numerical solution q wda and q wdn are the dimensionless production rates obtained by the zero order analytical method and the numerical method respectively the perturbation technique shown in eq 66 is established based onthe value of γ d being less than unity pedrosa 1986 and so the zero order perturbation analytical model including eqs 68 71 is derived from the nonlinear model including eqs 62 65 only when γ d 1 in other words the proposed analytical method with the stress sensitive effect is available under the conditions of γ d 1 even though the relative difference between the zero order analytical solution eq 76 and the numerical solution of the nonlinear model eqs 62 65 may be small for the cases of γ d 1 under some conditions in fact the permeability modulus is rarely greater than 0 1 mp a 1 in actual stress sensitive reservoirs ren and guo 2014 and the drawdown pressure is usually smaller than 10 mpa thus the value of γ d is less than 1 0 in most cases in order to test the validity of the proposed analytical method under the conditions of γ d 1 the comparison between the analytical solution with zero order approximation and the numerical solution was conducted based on the values of γ d being less than or equal to 1 0 the results of the relative difference between the analytical solution with zero order approximation and the numerical solution are shown in table 2 from which we can see that the relative difference δ decreases with increasing the elapsed time t d such as when t d 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 and 10 8 for γ d 0 1 the values of δ are 1 48 0 52 0 22 0 12 and 0 08 respectively table 2 as the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d increases the magnitude of δ increases such as when γ d 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 and 1 0 for t d 10 2 the values of the δ are 0 52 1 08 1 59 2 04 2 44 and 2 63 respectively table 2 it should be noted that δ may reach a relatively large value when the value of t d is very small and the value of γ d is extremely big such as δ 8 23 when t d 10 0 and γ d 1 0 on the other hand considering the real fluid and rock properties for a vertical well table 3 the real time t is associated with the dimensionless time t d table 2 based on the definition of t d listed in table 1 fig 3 shows the relative difference δ changes over the real time t under different values of γ d the δ becomes negligibly small less than 0 8 in the cases of γ d 1 0 when the well produces for more than one day in fact as shown in table 2 when t 0 25 days i e t d 10 4 the value of δ for γ d 1 0 is only 0 97 thus it can be concluded that the error of the proposed analytical method for the cases of γ d 1 is negligibly small when the well produces for more than one day in practice we focus on the well production rate in terms of days rather than the short time within one day and production rate data used for production performance analysis are usually collected in terms of days xu et al 2015 ji et al 2017 therefore the proposed analytical method provides a satisfactory way to obtain and predict the production rate with the stress sensitive effect under most conditions in practice fig 4 shows the effect of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d on the production rate of a vertical well in a lateral infinite reservoir the production rate solutions here are obtained by the numerical method the influence of γ d on the production rate takes place across the whole flow period and the production rate decreases with increasing the magnitude of γ d it is interesting that the influence of γ d on the production rate remains almost unchanged for the whole period in the log log production rate plot as shown in fig 4 a the relative differences between production rates with and without the stress sensitive effect are nearly invariable which is in accordance with the results of the explicit models for wells under the cpp condition including the stress sensitive effect deng et al 2016 ji et al 2017 however this finding suggests that the previous analytical methods zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 for predicting the production rate with the stress sensitive effect may be incorrect the characteristics of the production rate obtained by previous analytical methods zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 are that the relative differences between production rates with and without the stress sensitive effect are negligible in the early flow period and increases with the elapsed time t d in the log log production rate plot this is because previous results zeng et al 2015 li et al 2017 were obtained based on the classical relationship between transient flow rate and transient pressure as proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 the analytical method proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 is derived from duhamel s principle and only suitable for the linear model without the stress sensitive effect and thus the analytical method proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 cannot be directly employed to obtain a production rate solution with the stress sensitive effect in this study we expanded the analytical method proposed by van everdingen and hurst 1949 to consider the effect of the stress sensitive permeability and the results obtained by our proposed analytical method were validated by the numerical method therefore we believe the proposed analytical method can be employed to obtain correct production rate solutions with the stress sensitive effect 5 results and analysis as discussed above the general analytical method has been proposed to obtain the production rate with the stress sensitive effect for a variety of well types we took the msfh well as an example and investigated the effect of stress sensitive permeability on the production performance recently various models for msfh wells in different reservoir scenarios without the stress sensitive effect have been proposed here the semi analytical model for msfh wells in a lateral infinite reservoir was considered wan 1999 ren and guo 2015a b the detail of the semi analytical model shown in supplementary material and a schematic of an msfh well is shown in fig 5 based on the superposition principle ozkan 1988 wang and yi 2017 the bottomhole pressure solution of the msfh well under the crp condition without the stress sensitive effect is presented in supplementary material using eqs 55 and 56 the production rates of the msfh well with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability are obtained respectively 5 1 field validation a field case of an msfh well was used to validate the proposed analytical method the msfh well well 1 is located in the pembina cardium field of western canada field data for well 1 were collected from recent published papers clarkson and pedersen 2010 2011 ji et al 2017 the msfh well produced at a nearly constant bottomhole pressure after 21 days and thus the msfh well was considered to produce at a constant bottomhole pressure throughout the whole production period ji et al 2017 to filter out the effect of the outer boundary response production rate data before 250 days were used to conduct production performance analysis based on the above semi analytical model for msfh wells this was chosen because pressure wave had not arrived at the outer boundary on the 250th day clarkson and pedersen 2011 basic parameters of well 1 for generating the matching curves are listed in table 4 and the matching results of production rate data are shown in fig 6 the matching curve with the stress sensitive effect is in good agreement with the production rate data the matching parameters including the fracture wing length and permeability modulus are listed in table 4 and highlighted with an asterisk the matching result of the fracture wing length i e l f 55m by our method is consistent with the matching result i e l f 181 ft 55m presented in the literature clarkson and pedersen 2010 but our method can consider the effect of stress sensitive permeability and obtain the permeability modulus furthermore it can be observed from fig 6 that the matching curve without the stress sensitive effect obviously deviates from production rate data and from the matching curve with the stress sensitive effect of course some other factors also affect the interpretation results such as parameter uncertainty heterogeneity of reservoirs and aquifers and non darcy effect of flow near the well in other words a good match between the production rate data and the matching curve without the stress sensitive effect may be obtained by changing other parameters or choosing other models however as shown in fig 6 stress sensitive permeability has a significant effect on production performance analysis which indicates that ignoring the effect of stress sensitive permeability may result in unreasonable results for the production performance analysis of actual stress sensitive reservoirs 5 2 sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows the effect of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir the magnitude of γ d affects the production rate across the whole flow period the production rate decreases with increasing the value of γ d indicating that the stress sensitive effect has a more negative effect on the production rate when the msfh well produces at a larger drawdown pressure and the permeability modulus of the reservoir formation becomes greater the reason is that the stress sensitive permeability is reduced with increasing the drawdown pressure δ p w i e p i p w and permeability modulus γ based on eq 3 and the reduction of the permeable capacity leads to the decrease in the production rate therefore the production rate decreases with increasing γ d which is proportional to δ p w and γ according to the definition of γ d in table s1 in order to quantify the effect of stress sensitive permeability on production rate we defined the relative difference as 83 ε q wds q wdl q wdl 100 where ε is the relative difference between production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability q wds and q wdl are the dimensionless production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability respectively according to eqs 55 56 and 83 it is easy to obtain 84 ε 1 exp γ d γ d γ d 100 it is clear that the relative difference ε between production rates with and without the stress sensitive effect in the cpp case is mainly dependent on the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d fig 8 shows the effect of the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d on the relative difference between production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability the general functional relationship between the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d and the relative difference ε is derived in eq 84 it is obvious that the relative difference ε increases with increasing γ d such as when γ d 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 9 ε is 4 8 4 13 61 21 31 34 06 respectively furthermore it is interesting that as the magnitude of γ d increases the ε firstly increases rapidly but then slows to a lower growth rate the reason for this may be that stress sensitive permeability usually decreases rapidly at first but then reduces more slowly with decreasing formation pressure p i e increasing pressure difference δ p pedrosa 1986 the value of γ d is proportional to the drawdown pressure δ p w p i p w considering the positive correlation between permeability and production rate the relative differences between production rates with and without the effect of stress sensitive permeability firstly increase rapidly and then increase slowly with increasing γ d we also considered the influence of some parameters on the production rate of the msfh well in the stress sensitive reservoir formation fig 9 shows the effect of hydraulic fracture number m on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir the m has an effect on the production rate for the whole flow period and increasing m can enhance the production rate while the influence becomes smaller in the late production stage compared with the early and intermediate production stages this is because increasing m can enhance permeable capacity in the area near the wellbore and thus the production rate should increase when the well produces at a constant drawdown pressure as the elapsed time t d increases the affected area of the pressure wave keeps getting bigger and the contribution of the enhanced permeable capacity to the average permeability of the affected area becomes smaller as a consequence it is important for the hydraulic fracturing to increase the hydraulic fracture number of the msfh well in the whole production period especially in the early and intermediate production stages fig 10 shows the effect of fracture spacing δ y i on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir it is clear that the δ y i has no effect on the production rate in the early flow period when the fracture interference has not taken place after the fracture interference occurs the production rate of the msfh well with constant bottomhole pressure will decline rapidly increasing the δ y i gives rise to a later appearance of the fracture interference and thus the production rate increases with the δ y i in the late flow period furthermore as the elapsed time t d increases the effect of the fracture interference on the production rate decreases at the late flow period the reason is that owing to the effect of the fracture interference the permeable capacity in the area near hydraulic fractures will be reduced and thus the production rate of the msfh well will decrease when the well keeps on producing at a constant drawdown pressure however as the elapsed time t d increases the affected area of the pressure wave becomes bigger and bigger and the contribution of the reduced permeable capacity to the average permeability of the affected area becomes smaller so the effect of the fracture spacing on the production rate decreases as the elapsed time t d increases at the late flow period fig 11 shows the effect of fracture wing length l f on the production rate of an msfh well in a lateral infinite reservoir it is obvious that the l f affects the production rate in nearly the whole flow period a significant influence of l f on the production rate is observed in the early production stage while the influence becomes negligibly small in the late production stage increasing l f enhances the production rate in the cpp case the reason is similar to that of the hydraulic fracture number m the permeable capacity in the area near the wellbore increases with increasing l f and so the production rate increases with increasing l f when the well produces at a constant drawdown pressure however as the elapsed time t d increases the contribution of the enhanced permeable capacity to the average permeability of the affected area becomes relatively insignificant in the late production stage therefore increasing the fracture wing length is critical to obtaining good performance of msfh wells only in the early production stage 6 conclusions in this study we discussed the relationship between models with and without the stress sensitive effect and proposed a general analytical method for transient flow rate with the stress sensitive effect under the cpp condition based on duhamel s principle the proposed method was validated by comparing the analytical flow rate solutions for vertical wells with numerical flow rate solutions the production rate of an msfh well in the stress sensitive reservoir formation was obtained by the proposed method and a field case of an msfh well was used to test the applicability of the proposed analytical method the effect of relevant parameters on the production rate of the msfh well was discussed in detail several conclusions are listed as follows 1 the flow rate solution with zero order approximation has sufficient accuracy to satisfy engineering requirements thus this approach can be applied to predicting the production rate in practice 2 stress sensitive permeability negatively affects the production rate of msfh wells across the whole flow period the stress sensitive effect increases with increasing drawdown pressure and permeability modulus 3 the relative differences between production rates of the msfh well with and without the stress sensitive effect are mainly dependent on the dimensionless permeability modulus γ d which is related to drawdown pressure and permeability modulus as the magnitude of γ d increases the relative difference firstly increases rapidly and then slows to a lower growth rate 4 increasing the hydraulic fracture number and fracture wing length can significantly enhance the production rate of an msfh well in the early production stage while the effects of the hydraulic fracture number and fracture wing length on the production rate are relatively insignificant during the late production stage 5 the fracture spacing has no effect on the production rate of msfh wells in the early flow period when fracture interference has not taken place fracture interference leads to a decrease in the production rate while the effect of fracture interference decreases with increasing the elapsed time 6 the permeability of deep seated reservoirs and aquifers is usually dependent on pressure and so compared with the conventional analytical method the proposed method considering the stress sensitive effect can be used to obtain more accurate production rate with little increase in

7003,the cévennes vivarais france is a region prone to heavy precipitation events and flash floods occurring mainly during the autumn season due to this vulnerability it is a well instrumented region to monitor rainfall 4 weather radars of the french aramis radar network 200 hourly raingauges and river discharge 45 stations a multiscale radar raingauge rainfall re analysis from 10 to 300 km2 and 1 h time step has been established for the period 2007 2014 by using the kriging with external drift ked technique in the present work a quantification of the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation and model uncertainties in distributed rainfall runoff simulations is presented for 10 km2 1 h model resolution for this purpose the following methodology is implemented 1 development of a distributed hydrological model based on the curve number and the unit hydrograph concepts for the ardèche and gardon catchments 2 generation of an ensemble of perturbed precipitation fields based on the ked error standard deviations and the space time structure of the residuals to the drift 3 generation of so called behavioral parameter sets for the hydrological model based on generalized sensitive analysis gsa and the use of discharge observations 4 implementation of the hydrological model for gauged and ungauged catchments with the radar raingauge rainfall ensembles and the various parameter sets uncertainties in rainfall and runoff simulations are then quantified in terms of coefficient of variation the main findings reveal that i the precipitation uncertainty is dampened in the hydrological simulation especially as long as the size of the watershed increases in the considered context the model uncertainty dominates the precipitation uncertainty and it is shown to be independent on catchment size keywords radar raingauge merging rainfall stochastic generation distributed rainfall runoff simulation generalized sensitivity analysis uncertainty propagation 1 introduction in hydrology the data information knowledge chain is prone to large uncertainties in the first chain link data are the result of a measurement that includes errors rainfall data usually comes from radars and or rain gauges where each observation system has its own error structure delrieu et al 2014 boudevillain et al 2016 water level and discharge data are also prone to large errors especially during flood events amponsah et al 2016 but also for low water regimes di baldassarre and montanari 2009 in the second chain link information is obtained through data processing with its own errors and added errors due to processing procedures one way to obtain runoff information is using rainfall runoff models which uncertainties depend on mathematical representation of hydrological processes model parameterization and scales issues beven and binley 1992 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 clark et al 2017 finally in the third chain link knowledge is reached by the analysis of information and its uncertainties and this allows to foster studies about river water budgets and flood damage mitigation capabilities rossa et al 2011 hydrological rainfall runoff models are tools based in mathematical expressions and logical assumptions combined to simulate runoff using rainfall inputs according to international hydrological glossary world meteorological organization and unesco 2012 distributed models take into account spatial variations in variables and or parameters within the catchment nevertheless it is impossible to model everything that happens everywhere in space practitioners have introduced some methods to model catchments in a distributed way basically representing them by 1 a set of small lumped models which can be an arrangement of sub catchments and channels where the boundaries are defined by their watershed summits e g hrcdhm carpenter and georgakakos 2004a kineros http www tucson ars ag gov kineros or 2 a mesh of regular grid cells e g marine roux et al 2011 topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 the main difference in these two approaches is the size of their elements usually sub catchments are larger than grid cells in a similar manner to space domain it is impossible to model everything that happens at any time because only discrete observations of precipitation at a certain time step are available to solve this problem the literature reveals two approaches the first one works with total cumulative precipitation at event scale such as the rational method mulvany 1851 or curve number equation united states department of agriculture 1986 but without the capability to describe time dynamics of the flooding event the second one works with incremental precipitation at given temporal resolution e g curve number modification for incremental precipitation kannan et al 2008 or unit hydrograph method sherman 1932 and introduces the problem of which time resolution should be used to model hydrological systems morin et al 2001 to avoid ambiguities with the use of some terms on this paper we refer hereinafter to spatio temporal sampling size as the spatio temporal extent of quantitative precipitation estimation to model resolution as the minimum spatio temporal domain where the model is able to perform a single computation e g area of sub catchments or length of the minimum time step and to catchment scale as the contributing area at an specific river site the problem to simplify a catchment for a given catchment scale is how best to represent hydrological processes with its uncertainties precipitation variability landscape heterogeneities and parametrization in order to constrain those uncertainties beven 2006 the dominant processes concept hall 2004 sivakumar 2004 suggests to develop methods to identify dominant processes and develop models to focus on these dominant processes most of hydrological processes are delayed from precipitation time scale time delay increases as the water passes through the flow path and clearly depends on the dominant runoff mechanism pearce et al 1986 an adequate temporal sampling size should be a fraction e g 1 3 1 4 of the time to peak then spatial sampling size could be estimated by modeling the rainfall spatial decorrelation distance as a function of the temporal sampling size berne et al 2004 delrieu et al 2014 it is recognized that uncertainties in precipitation estimations are minimized when spatio temporal sampling sizes are increased lebel et al 1987 inversely the use of high spatio temporal resolutions computations reduces runoff uncertainties due to improved descriptions of rainfall variability arnaud et al 2011 emmanuel et al 2015 2016 and landscape heterogeneities wu et al 2007 anquetin et al 2010 these two resolution issues raise the question of how to quantify the impact of uncertainties related to precipitation estimation and uncertainties added by representation of hydrological processes in the result of rainfall runoff simulation in hydrological modeling it is hard to distinguish the origin of errors this is one reason why practitioners incorporate all uncertainties by model calibration kavetski et al 2003 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 and generalized sensitivity analysis hornberger and spear 1981 are two popular methods that allow to reflect all uncertainties in the model parameters nevertheless it has been recognized that a separate treatment of different sources of errors is needed to evaluate the importance of each component e g precipitation input hydrological processes representation and prioritize research in the most important aspects zappa et al 2010 the impact of precipitation uncertainties have been studied through several runoff simulations from precipitation ensembles that reflect the characteristics of the precipitation errors this approach shows that radar precipitation systematic and random errors have non negligible correlations in space and time habib et al 2008 germann et al 2009 studies of the impacts of precipitation and model uncertainties combined are not usual the work of carpenter and georgakakos 2004b takes into account these two issues and it represents one of the first contributions to this topic their results show that simulation uncertainty is strongly dependent on catchment scale in both cases where large catchments have less uncertainty in both precipitation and parameters the authors showed that soil water retention diffuses the flow simulation uncertainty this effect is greater in large catchments the present article addresses the problem of quantifying the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation and parametric uncertainties in rainfall runoff simulations as a function of catchment scales a new hydrologic model developed for this purpose is presented which has been set to run only at 10 km2 1 h resolution in addition this paper gives a first look to the impact of use of rain forcing with larger spatial sampling sizes than model resolution section 2 presents the study area section 3 describes the methods used section 4 illustrates the main achievements finally conclusions and some forthcoming work are presented in section 5 2 study area and datasets the study region is composed of the ardèche and gardon catchments located in the south east of france these two watersheds are part of the study window of the cévennes vivarais mediterranean hydrometeorological observatory cvmho http www ohmcv fr boudevillain et al 2011 the cévennes vivarais region is characterized by the recurrence of flash floods which causes loss of human lives and material damages ruin et al 2008 these flash floods are generated by the combination of three factors 1 at the end of summer the warm mediterranean sea provides a huge reservoir of humidity 2 a center of low atmospheric pressure located in the atlantic generates south winds in the region and 3 the resulting advection of the mediterranean humidity towards the cévennes mountains triggers convection and subsequent severe precipitation delrieu et al 2005 fig 1 shows the cvmho rainfall observation system composed of four weather radars of the météofrance aramis network at bollène montclar nîmes and sembadel and approximately 200 hourly raingauges operated by three services namely météofrance the service de prévision

land cover 2012 the results of the isochrone estimation developed by navas and delrieu 2017 fig 2c and geology fig 2d from ign https www geoportail gouv fr donnees cartes geologiques three main datasets will be used for the hydrological model implementation the first one is the radar raingauge re analysis at several space sampling sizes 1 300 km2 and 1 h time step provided by cvmho available for intense rainfall events from 2007 to 2014 precipitation estimation is performed by merging after an in depth critical analysis the radar and raingauge datasets using the kriging with external drift ked technique one of the major advantages of this technique is that rainfall estimates at any space time sampling size come with their error estimates delrieu et al 2014 boudevillain et al 2016 the second dataset is the discharge estimations derived from the spcgd water level network using the corresponding water level discharge rating curves 16 stations of the ardèche and gardon rivers to which the present study is restricted the third dataset is the potential evapotranspiration pet estimates provided by météofrance based on the penman monteith model with a daily time resolution and an 8 km space resolution in this study we have implemented our approach for the rainy season of 2014 which has been an exceptionally rainy season within the considered period table 1 shows duration and total precipitation of the 10 rainfall events that occurred from september to december 2014 in geological terms fig 2d the upstream mountainous part of the watersheds corresponds to primary era formations with granite gneiss and sandstone it has a relative homogeneous land use with mixed forests composed by pines oaks chestnuts fig 2b the downstream part of the watersheds is mostly based on sedimentary formations from jurassic to cretaceous interrupted by faults which delineate the alès graben this graben is filled with sediments coming from the oligocene and holocene further down a cretaceous limestone formation exhibit high degree of karstification with huge caves and groundwater conduits in the surface this region has moderate slopes with garrigue orchards and vineyards urban areas are scarce there are only few small villages and medium sized cities nîmes alès the isochrone map fig 2c shows great differences in terms of routing time between the ardèche and the gardon rivers these differences are mainly due to the drainage characteristics of the catchments the ardèche river is well drained has more tributaries highest slopes in the mountainous part and a rounded shape conversely the gardon river has fewer tributaries lower slopes and an elongated shape with the long side on the flow direction 3 methodology quantification of uncertainties in rainfall and rainfall runoff processing is performed following a methodology sketched in fig 3 the rainfall runoff model described in section 3 2 was chosen so as to be able to provide runoff simulations for both gauged and ungauged watersheds with a rather simple structure and a reasonable number of parameters part of these parameters were estimated and regionalized a priori using geomorphological information topography geology land use the generalized sensitivity technique described in section 3 3 was then implemented using the available discharge estimates at gauged watersheds to determine the most sensitive parameters as well as to provide a set of size m of acceptable parameters with respect to a given cost function the computational efficiency of the model was an important concern due to the need to perform a great number of simulations a stochastic generation technique described in section 3 1 was implemented independently to define an ensemble of perturbed precipitation space time series as inputs for the hydrological model it should be noted that in this approach the model parametric uncertainty actually encompasses the uncertainties one would expect on other model input e g the potential evapotranspiration estimates and on the discharge estimates at the gauged stations nm simulations were performed for several resolutions of the hydrological model for 10 50 100 200 and 300 km2 spatial resolutions and 1 h time step uncertainty of runoff simulations for ungauged watersheds was quantified by the distribution and some specific quantiles hereafter e g the 25 50 75 quantiles as well as the mean value of the simulated discharge the coefficient of variation cv ratio of the standard deviation of the discharge ensemble to the corresponding mean value was calculated for any time step and location results are processed in three categories according to the origin of uncertainties the first one related to rainfall uncertainty only cvq1 is the average of m cvs produced by the n members of the precipitation ensemble eq 1 the second one related to parametric uncertainty only cvq2 is the average of n cvs produced by the m sets of parameters eq 2 the third one related to both rainfall and parametric uncertainties cvq3 defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the nm simulations eq 3 1 cv q 1 t x m 1 m sd q t x n m q t x n m m 2 cv q 2 t x n 1 n sd q t x n m q t x n m n 3 cv q 3 t x sd q t x n m q t x n m where n indexes the n members of the precipitation ensemble m indexes the m members of the parameter set t is the time step and x is the considered location the symbol refers to using all precipitation ensemble and or parameter set q is the runoff mean and sdq is the runoff standard deviation a similar expression can be proposed for the coefficient of variation of the precipitation ensemble 4 cv p t x sd p t x n p t x n 3 1 generation of rainfall ensembles the precipitation uncertainty is represented by an ensemble of perturbed precipitation fields where the 10 km2 spatial sampling size of precipitation matches with the model resolution let us denote n t and n sc the number of time steps t 1 n t and sub catchments x 1 n sc respectively for a given rainfall event we assume that each member n 1 n of the ensemble p t x n can be obtained by adding a stochastic residual δ t x n to a deterministic precipitation estimate r t x 5 p t x n r t x δ t x n as for the deterministic precipitation estimate r t x we will use hereafter the mean value provided by the ked unbiased estimator delrieu et al 2014 we will then assume the stochastic residual δ t x n to follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation sd t x as proposed by delrieu et al 2014 the latter term can be estimated as a bi linear function of the rainfall amount r t x and the normalized estimation standard deviation of the ked method nsd t x 6 sd t x a r r t x n s d t x the term normalized means that nsd t x is the ked estimation standard deviation obtained by using a variogram sill normalized to 1 delrieu et al 2014 have proposed an estimation procedure for the multiplicative factor ar based on a cross validation technique the reader is referred to delrieu et al 2014 for the justification of this error model which comes essentially from the observation that the radar residuals with respect to rainfall reference values conditioned on the rain rate follow a gaussian distribution for the generation of consistent realizations of the residuals it is critical to account for their spatial and temporal structure for this purpose we are using one particular realization of the residuals by taking the differences between the ked estimates obtained with the variogram of residuals inferred from the observations on the one hand and those obtained with a nugget variogram on the other hand the latter case corresponds to the drift estimation boudevillain et al 2016 the resulting matrix of size n t n sc is then used as input for the stochastic generation algorithm proposed by germann et al 2009 in a first step the spatial covariance matrix of the residuals c size n sc n sc is computed and decomposed into a lower triangular and an upper triangular matrix c l u using the lu decomposition algorithm a gaussian random vector y t x n size n sc with zero mean and unit standard deviation is then drawn and the spatial structure is imposed with the following equation 7 δ t x n l y t x n in a second step the temporal structure of the residuals is accounted for by using a second order autoregressive model ar2 8 δ t x n v δ t x n a 1 δ t 1 x n a 2 δ t 2 x n the coefficients a 1 a 2 and v are given by 9 a 1 r 1 r 2 1 1 r 1 2 10 a 2 r 1 2 r 2 1 r 1 2 11 v 1 a 2 1 a 1 a 2 1 a 1 a 2 1 a 2 0 5 where r1 r2 are the temporal autocorrelation coefficients of first and second order computed from the residuals matrix c the drawing procedure is repeated n times and finally an anamorphosis g is applied to the vector δ t x size n to ensure that the generated residuals follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation sd t x 12 δ t x g δ t x 0 sd t x like in germann et al 2009 it is assumed herein that the spatial and temporal structure of the residuals is constant in time and space respectively a notable difference between the two studies lies in the fact that the average value of the residuals considered in our case have a zero mean the ked estimator being unbiased by construction 3 2 rainfall runoff modelling to achieve the objective of this study the mesoscale hydrological computation tool mhct has been developed this section describes the basic principles of this new tool the mhct is time continuous hydrological software with the capability to take into account spatial variations of precipitation and landscape within the studied catchments see fig 4 for sketch illustration and equations catchments are represented by a cascade of sub catchments and channels sub catchment area defines model spatial resolution in this study the model resolution has been matched with the predefined sampling sizes of precipitation presented by delrieu et al 2014 and boudevillain et al 2016 these predefined sampling sizes are indeed the sub catchments elements of the model then a specific design of the channel network has been done to assemble the set of sub catchments and simulate runoff at several catchments scales infiltration exfiltration and runoff processes are modeled by two functions 1 the production function which computes water production as a sum of the effective precipitation and the base flow and 2 the transfer function which adds lag effect due to water storage and routing processes in sub catchments and channels regarding the production function effective precipitation pe is calculated through a modified version of curve number method eqs 13 19 it is to be noted that this computation is done by cumulative precipitation p which in the beginning of each flood event is set to zero beginning of flood events are defined by the occurrence of tdry hours without rainfall before the next rainfall period tlp rossman and huber 2015 base flow qb is estimated as a function of soil water retention potential s and coefficient of permeability b2 and then it is limited by a minimum base flow threshold qbmin the initial curve number cn x estimation for each sub catchment is performed by using the hydrologic soil group and land use fig 2b time evolution of soil water retention potential is simulated by a pseudo water budget which uses incremental precipitation p effective precipitation pe evapotranspiration et and antecedent conditions of soil water retention eq 13 the term pseudo water budget refers to the fact that underground flows are not considered then et is estimated as a function of potential evapotranspiration pet and the depletion coefficient b williams et al 2000 to estimate pet values below daily time step it has been supposed evenly distributed in time soil water retention potential is limited by maximum curve number cnmax for the wettest condition and curve number for the driest condition conditions in the previous time step are known in order to solve the problem of antecedent moisture conditions the simulation has been started in august which is characterized as a dry month then the computation of the water budget during august provides a good estimation of s at the beginning of september next sub catchment total production q is computed as a sum of pe and qb eq 22 the transfer function for sub catchments uses the unit hydrograph method sherman 1932 which simulates the routing process this method is a simple linear model that is used to compute the hydrograph resulting from any amount of q the ordinates of unit hydrograph u are estimated by clark 1945 method which is based on the translation and attenuation of a single precipitation pulse p1 through the sub catchment translation is done by multiplying time area curve a x by p1 where a x is obtained from fig 2c then attenuation is performed by linear reservoir routing which uses storage constant ksc as parameter the transfer function for channels uses the muskingum method cunge 1969 while taking place at the outlet of each sub catchment for every single channel reach this computation needs the weighting coefficient kc ranging from 0 to 0 5 and the time of travel of the flood wave across the channel c obtained from fig 2c 3 3 generalized sensitivity analysis uncertainties in hydrological processes representation are quantified by a generalized sensitivity analysis of the parametrization of the rainfall runoff model table 2 shows the considered ranges of parameters of the production and transfer functions note that single multiplicative coefficients have been introduced for three parameters ccn for c n cvsc for u and cc for c to modulate globally at the regional scale the parameters defined a priori from geomorphological characteristics for each sub catchment or river channel the implementation of the generalized sensitivity analysis gsa hornberger and spear 1981 consists of the following three steps i the parameter space was sampled with the latin hypercubes method to generate 1500 sets of parameters the package parameter space exploration with latin hypercubes https cran r project org package pse was used for this purpose in a first run uniform parameter distributions with ranges given in table 2 were considered for each parameter an ensemble of 1500 simulations of the model was then generated for the 16 gauged stations available for the ardèche and gardon watersheds ii a cost function was defined so as to classify the simulations obtained in two classes behavioral or not behavioral the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was chosen hereinafter for this purpose firstly the nses were computed for each gauged station j and parameter set m 32 nse j m 1 t 1 nt q s t j m q o t j 2 t 1 nt q o t j qo t j 2 where qs and qo are the simulated and observed runoff time series note that only time steps with observed discharge values greater than 1 6 of the flood peak with 2 years of return period was considered in order to focus on the ability of the hydrological model to simulate flood events the resulting nses were then averaged at the regional scale to produce a single cost function value nse r m 33 nse r m 1 j j 1 j n s e j m where j j 1 j indexes the gauged watersheds it is noteworthy that this regional averaging of the cost function allows filtering to some extent the effect of the size of the various gauged watersheds this is an important point since we expect the hydrological model to work as well as possible over the considered range of spatial scales 10 300 km2 actually a slightly more sophisticated procedure was implemented to account for the dominant hydrological processes in the region of interest there are basically two mechanisms 1 infiltration excess that happens when the precipitation rate overpasses the infiltration capacity of the soil 2 saturation excess resulting from flow contributions by the breakout of groundwater as a consequence of saturated soil in the cévennes vivarais region the two types of runoff are present in the mountainous part saturation excess predominates while in the plain part infiltration excess prevails together with exfiltration from karstic conduits in specific places manus et al 2008 therefore four sub regions were considered with the mountainous and plain parts of the ardèche and gardon catchments the local nses were first averaged over the gauged stations available for the four sub regions and the sub regional nses were finally averaged to produce the regional cost function value nse r m as the cost function threshold separating behavioral and non behavioral simulations we have used the value of 0 6 this value represents the inflection point of cost function vs behavioral simulation size it takes near 10 of the best simulations 150 samples this is of course subjective it was checked however that this choice did not change the number of the main parameters of the model otherwise the cost function threshold may impact model uncertainty i e low values of cost function threshold produce more dispersion on runoff realizations in this article we work only with this single value of cost function threshold to analyze the impact of a single level of parameter uncertainty section 4 4 iii the sensitivity index was then computed for each parameter as the maximum distance between the parameter cumulative distributions which produce behavioral and non behavioral model responses fig 5 this allows 1 the determination of parameters that can be considered as not sensitive which values can be then fixed in further model implementations and 2 an adjustment of the range and probability distribution of the most sensitive parameters as a flexible probability distribution we have used hereinafter the power exponential distribution which allows with three parameters to represent symmetric distributions ranging from uniform to gaussian and double exponential 34 pe x 2 κ 1 κ γ 1 1 κ σ e x p x μ κ κ σ κ where μ σ and κ are the parameters of position scale and shape respectively and γ is the gamma function garambois et al 2015 says it is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have main parameters with high sensitivity i e it is possible to have an important parameter with low sensitivity due to correlations with others parameters to avoid this problem and ensure that parameters with low sensitivity values do not take an important role on the behavioral response of the model we have checked that all 10 parameters were not correlated once these steps were completed we performed an ensemble of 2500 runoff realizations from 50 perturbed precipitation fields section 3 1 each with 50 set of parameters fitted to the distributions presented in fig 9 4 results and discussion 4 1 rainfall generation an ensemble of 50 perturbed precipitation space time series has been produced through stochastic generation for the autumn 2014 for the 1 h time step and spatial sampling sizes of 10 50 100 200 and 300 km2 fig 6 a shows the good fit of the gaussian distribution for the rainfall coefficient of variation cv p t x eq 4 for the spatial sampling size of 10 km2 fig 6b presents the evolution of the mean value of the cv p t x distribution as a function of the watershed surface as already evidenced in boudevillain et al 2016 the cv p values decrease significantly when spatial sampling size increases fig 7 shows an example of stochastic generation for two particular sub catchments of 10 km2 top and 200 km2 bottom for the event of november 2 2014 the left side of the figures displays incremental precipitation mean percentiles 10 25 75 90 as well as the 50 members of the ensemble the right side shows cumulative precipitation the dispersion of the cumulative rainfall at the end of the event is the result of 1 the variation of the standard deviation of the error from one time step to the next which increases when the rain rate increases and decreases when the watershed surface increases and 2 the residuals time correlation accounting in the generation procedure like germann et al 2009 we found autocorrelation coefficients r1 r2 of typically 0 3 and 0 15 respectively for the 1 h and 2 h lag times 4 2 generalized sensitivity analysis after performing the generalized sensitivity analysis it were identified ccn ksc b2 and cvsc as the main parameters of the model fig 8 gives an example for the 10 km2 model resolution where ccn 0 43 ksc 0 24 b2 0 09 and cvsc 0 06 at the same time it was verified that there is no correlation between the sets of parameters obtained from behavior realizations fig 9 shows the fit of power exponential distribution to the empirical main parameters obtained for the upper ardèche at 10 km2 1 h this step allows us to generate a set of parameters with certain size in our case 50 set of parameters it is noted that the two most sensitive parameters produce well defined histograms with high density values where ccn has a slight positive skew contrariwise ksc has major negative skew ksc values were limited between 0 and 1 this parameter represent the ratio of direct runoff in the t time step to direct precipitation in t 1 time step 0 means full storage and 1 no storage effect for cvsc and b2 there have been obtained quasi uniforms distributions 4 3 illustration of the model performance to ensure that the model reasonably reproduces runoff hydrographs a visual inspection of the runoff realizations and a quantitative regional evaluation according to regional nash sutcliffe efficiency have been performed as an illustration fig 10 displays 2500 realizations from the combination of 50 perturbed precipitation fields and 50 sets of parameters of the complex flood event occurred in the ardèche river from october 9 to 15 2014 an overall assessment of rising recession limbs and peak discharges of the simulated hydrographs suggests that the model works in an acceptable manner especially for the upper ardèche e g meyras and val les bains downstream e g ucel and vogue and on the right tributaries e g beaume and chessezac the recession limb of the 2nd sub flood has been underestimated this could be due to a singularity in the drainage of the karstic system which has not been considered within the model e g different soil water retention potential note that at the end of the period the problem diminishes and even in some sub catchments the problem disappears e g vogue and ucel a similar analysis was done for gardon catchment with 8 observed hydrographs at different sites that showed similar results than ardèche catchment not presented in this paper the skill of the model was evaluated for the 10 km2 1 h model by firstly considering the corresponding 10 km2 1 h rainfall estimates and secondly the hourly rainfall estimates at different spatial sampling sizes 50 100 200 300 km2 this was done in order to quantify the impact of rain with larger spatial sampling sizes than model resolution it was decided to take this approach as in other regions it is hard to have a sampling size of precipitation adapted to the model resolution please note that to match the different spatial sampling sizes of precipitation with the model resolution it was considered that precipitation is distributed uniformly within each sub catchment i e an uniform spatial downscaling of precipitation is performed in addition note that a new set of acceptable parameters was calculated for each spatial sampling size of precipitation forcing fig 11 shows mean regional nash sutcliffe efficiency and the interquartile range difference between percentiles 75 25 as a dispersion index the highest values of efficiency are obtained from the use of small sampling sizes of precipitation matching model resolution these results can be explained as it was considered that the precipitation is distributed uniformly in space however this condition in natural environments is not true it has been shown that precipitation could follow the relief or convective bands godart et al 2009 now lower mean values of nash sutcliffe efficiency and a higher dispersion rate for larger sampling sizes of precipitation reflects that a rough precipitation forcing induces more uncertainty in section 4 it is presented an analysis of the propagation of errors at different catchment scales at ungauged sites for 10 km2 spatial sampling size of precipitation and equal model resolution 4 4 error propagation as a function of catchment scales after checking the rather good performance of the model at gauged sites section 4 3 we are looking here at the way the rainfall and parametric uncertainties evolve as a function of the catchment scales we are considering for this purpose the model simulations obtained at ungauged sections for headwater catchments of sizes 10 50 100 200 and 300 km2 fig 12 shows the histograms of the coefficients of variation of the discharge cv q obtained for the headwater catchments of 10 km2 using rainfall estimates of 10 km2 as mentioned in section 3 three coefficient of variation of runoff realizations were calculated corresponding to precipitation uncertainty only cv q 1 parametric uncertainty only cv q 2 and precipitation and parametric uncertainties together cv q 3 it is observed that the smallest 50 percentile of coefficient of variation is cv q 1 followed by cv q 2 and last cv q 3 with slight difference between the last two when cv q 1 fig 12a is compared with cv p fig 6a it is noted that runoff uncertainty produced by precipitation uncertainty is less than the precipitation uncertainty itself the 50 percentile of cv q 1 is 0 16 whereas cv p is equal to 0 23 the interquartile ranges of both distributions are relatively equivalent between them q 75 q 25 0 08 and the distribution of cvq1 presents a left skew with respect to the cv p distribution this result could be explained by the storage effect of the catchment which attenuates the perturbed precipitation fields around the average precipitation value this storage phenomenon is analogous to a low pass electronic filter composed by a resistor and a capacitor where the capacitor stores energy and stabilizes the voltage variation around the resistance in the case of the hydrological system catchment stores water and stabilize the flow rate at the outlet cvq2 fig 12b and cvq3 fig 12c histograms are both located to the right of cvq1 distribution which means that in the present context uncertainties produced by parametric uncertainty and the combined effect of precipitation and parametric uncertainties are greater than the uncertainty produced by precipitation the previous results have been expanded to headwater catchments with surfaces of 50 100 200 and 300 km2 fig 13 shows runoff uncertainties in this range of surfaces it is observed that the effect of precipitation uncertainty strongly decreases with the surface of the watershed fig 13a until 100 km2 when it turned to equilibrium this result seems to indicate that the behavior of runoff uncertainties through surfaces follows in shape the uncertainty of areal precipitation fig 6b but it is attenuated by the catchment storage capacity which increases as a function of the catchment scale the inflection point around 100 km2 could be related to the temporal resolution requirement for a given catchment scale e g for cévennes watersheds with 100 km2 time to peak is around 200 min delrieu et al 2014 thus an adequate temporal resolution is one third of that value 1 h which is our resolution when we have analyzed the smaller catchment scales 10 50 km2 we cannot see great differences in shape between cvp and cvq1 as storage and routing process at these catchments scales do not produce great time delay between precipitation forcing and model output the opposite occurs at scales higher than 100 km2 which can be well represented by 1 h model resolution this finding is consistent with the results of carpenter and georgakakos 2004b it is found however that the effect of parametric uncertainty is not dependent on catchment scale fig 13b this is opposite to carpenter and georgakakos 2004b who found the effect of parametric uncertainty to be inversely proportional to the catchment scale this may be due to the parametrization procedure adopted in this study where the set of parameters was selected according to a regional cost function threshold eq 18 the cvq3 graph fig 13c shows the combined effect of both sources of uncertainty it is observed that cvq3 is always over cvq1 and cvq2 meaning that the effect of precipitation and parametric uncertainties together are higher than their isolated effects also cvq3 has a slight negative slope which indicates that it tends to decrease with catchment surface 5 conclusions and outlooks the present study aimed to quantify the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation uncertainty and model parametrization uncertainty in rainfall runoff simulation as a function of the catchment scale 10 300 km2 note that the parametric uncertainty as quantified here with the generalized sensitivity analysis may account and compensate in part for systematic errors related to the mathematical representation of hydrological processes and their regional parameterization as well as for systematic errors on the other input and output variables e g et observed stream flows the work started from the initiative to develop and test a computational tool capable of representing hydrological processes in a distributed way for gauged and ungauged watersheds in the cévennes vivarais region which is prone to heavy precipitation and flash flooding this tool has been evaluated at several gauged sites within the ardèche and gardon catchments and proved reasonably good skills to simulate observed runoff on the one hand uncertainty coming from precipitation is inversely proportional to the catchment surface it follows in shape the uncertainty of areal precipitation which is further attenuated by the storage effect greater for larger catchments on the other hand the parametric uncertainty obtained for the cost function threshold used in this study has proved to be greater than the rainfall uncertainty and quite independent of the catchment scale in addition mean values of nash sutcliffe efficiency and their variation as a function of the rainfall spatial resolution reveal that rough precipitation forcing induces more uncertainty the methodology presented in this work is useful to assess the impact of rainfall uncertainties in rainfall runoff processing with respect to other sources of uncertainty model structure parametric uncertainty uncertainty on other input and output variables in our case we noted that rainfall uncertainty has a relatively minor impact compared to the overall uncertainty quantified here with the parametric uncertainty this is probably related to the facts that i the rainfall observation system is particularly rich in the cévennes vivarais region and ii to the efficiency of the radar raingauge processing based on detailed critical analysis of the raw data and the use of unbiased geostatistical estimators it would be interesting to test other models which may perform better or worse and give rise to lower or higher parametric uncertainty respectively for the same satisfaction of the user requirement given by the choice of the cost function threshold we think that the computation of recession limbs of our model could be upgraded with a complementary scheme that could handle the dynamics of karstic flows an important issue for mediterranean watersheds another finding of this research is the quantification of the attenuation effect of precipitation uncertainty due to the water storage capacity of the catchment nevertheless storage capacity does not depend only on catchment scale it also depends on the dominant runoff mechanism the occurrence of a type of runoff is determined among others by infiltration and precipitation rates antecedent precipitation soil water retention potential at this point the problem arises because most of these factors change over space and time the limitation of this work is that we have not taken into account the different sources of bias which could impact the rainfall runoff uncertainties in one hand with respect to precipitation we accept ked as an unbiased estimator however we know that it could have a non negligible bias under certain conditions e g regions with scarce precipitation network or atypical storm events on the other hand with respect to hydrologic model we focused our analysis over a set of ungauged catchments which are prone to flash flooding this set of catchments lacks of observed hydrographs so it is hard to quantify the bias at the end of the simulation process to overcome this limitation forthcoming works could use post flood peak flow estimation gaume and borga 2008 this new information can also be useful to validate the model at upper catchments acknowledgements the datasets used in this study were provided by cvmho a national observation service

7003,the cévennes vivarais france is a region prone to heavy precipitation events and flash floods occurring mainly during the autumn season due to this vulnerability it is a well instrumented region to monitor rainfall 4 weather radars of the french aramis radar network 200 hourly raingauges and river discharge 45 stations a multiscale radar raingauge rainfall re analysis from 10 to 300 km2 and 1 h time step has been established for the period 2007 2014 by using the kriging with external drift ked technique in the present work a quantification of the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation and model uncertainties in distributed rainfall runoff simulations is presented for 10 km2 1 h model resolution for this purpose the following methodology is implemented 1 development of a distributed hydrological model based on the curve number and the unit hydrograph concepts for the ardèche and gardon catchments 2 generation of an ensemble of perturbed precipitation fields based on the ked error standard deviations and the space time structure of the residuals to the drift 3 generation of so called behavioral parameter sets for the hydrological model based on generalized sensitive analysis gsa and the use of discharge observations 4 implementation of the hydrological model for gauged and ungauged catchments with the radar raingauge rainfall ensembles and the various parameter sets uncertainties in rainfall and runoff simulations are then quantified in terms of coefficient of variation the main findings reveal that i the precipitation uncertainty is dampened in the hydrological simulation especially as long as the size of the watershed increases in the considered context the model uncertainty dominates the precipitation uncertainty and it is shown to be independent on catchment size keywords radar raingauge merging rainfall stochastic generation distributed rainfall runoff simulation generalized sensitivity analysis uncertainty propagation 1 introduction in hydrology the data information knowledge chain is prone to large uncertainties in the first chain link data are the result of a measurement that includes errors rainfall data usually comes from radars and or rain gauges where each observation system has its own error structure delrieu et al 2014 boudevillain et al 2016 water level and discharge data are also prone to large errors especially during flood events amponsah et al 2016 but also for low water regimes di baldassarre and montanari 2009 in the second chain link information is obtained through data processing with its own errors and added errors due to processing procedures one way to obtain runoff information is using rainfall runoff models which uncertainties depend on mathematical representation of hydrological processes model parameterization and scales issues beven and binley 1992 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 clark et al 2017 finally in the third chain link knowledge is reached by the analysis of information and its uncertainties and this allows to foster studies about river water budgets and flood damage mitigation capabilities rossa et al 2011 hydrological rainfall runoff models are tools based in mathematical expressions and logical assumptions combined to simulate runoff using rainfall inputs according to international hydrological glossary world meteorological organization and unesco 2012 distributed models take into account spatial variations in variables and or parameters within the catchment nevertheless it is impossible to model everything that happens everywhere in space practitioners have introduced some methods to model catchments in a distributed way basically representing them by 1 a set of small lumped models which can be an arrangement of sub catchments and channels where the boundaries are defined by their watershed summits e g hrcdhm carpenter and georgakakos 2004a kineros http www tucson ars ag gov kineros or 2 a mesh of regular grid cells e g marine roux et al 2011 topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 the main difference in these two approaches is the size of their elements usually sub catchments are larger than grid cells in a similar manner to space domain it is impossible to model everything that happens at any time because only discrete observations of precipitation at a certain time step are available to solve this problem the literature reveals two approaches the first one works with total cumulative precipitation at event scale such as the rational method mulvany 1851 or curve number equation united states department of agriculture 1986 but without the capability to describe time dynamics of the flooding event the second one works with incremental precipitation at given temporal resolution e g curve number modification for incremental precipitation kannan et al 2008 or unit hydrograph method sherman 1932 and introduces the problem of which time resolution should be used to model hydrological systems morin et al 2001 to avoid ambiguities with the use of some terms on this paper we refer hereinafter to spatio temporal sampling size as the spatio temporal extent of quantitative precipitation estimation to model resolution as the minimum spatio temporal domain where the model is able to perform a single computation e g area of sub catchments or length of the minimum time step and to catchment scale as the contributing area at an specific river site the problem to simplify a catchment for a given catchment scale is how best to represent hydrological processes with its uncertainties precipitation variability landscape heterogeneities and parametrization in order to constrain those uncertainties beven 2006 the dominant processes concept hall 2004 sivakumar 2004 suggests to develop methods to identify dominant processes and develop models to focus on these dominant processes most of hydrological processes are delayed from precipitation time scale time delay increases as the water passes through the flow path and clearly depends on the dominant runoff mechanism pearce et al 1986 an adequate temporal sampling size should be a fraction e g 1 3 1 4 of the time to peak then spatial sampling size could be estimated by modeling the rainfall spatial decorrelation distance as a function of the temporal sampling size berne et al 2004 delrieu et al 2014 it is recognized that uncertainties in precipitation estimations are minimized when spatio temporal sampling sizes are increased lebel et al 1987 inversely the use of high spatio temporal resolutions computations reduces runoff uncertainties due to improved descriptions of rainfall variability arnaud et al 2011 emmanuel et al 2015 2016 and landscape heterogeneities wu et al 2007 anquetin et al 2010 these two resolution issues raise the question of how to quantify the impact of uncertainties related to precipitation estimation and uncertainties added by representation of hydrological processes in the result of rainfall runoff simulation in hydrological modeling it is hard to distinguish the origin of errors this is one reason why practitioners incorporate all uncertainties by model calibration kavetski et al 2003 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 and generalized sensitivity analysis hornberger and spear 1981 are two popular methods that allow to reflect all uncertainties in the model parameters nevertheless it has been recognized that a separate treatment of different sources of errors is needed to evaluate the importance of each component e g precipitation input hydrological processes representation and prioritize research in the most important aspects zappa et al 2010 the impact of precipitation uncertainties have been studied through several runoff simulations from precipitation ensembles that reflect the characteristics of the precipitation errors this approach shows that radar precipitation systematic and random errors have non negligible correlations in space and time habib et al 2008 germann et al 2009 studies of the impacts of precipitation and model uncertainties combined are not usual the work of carpenter and georgakakos 2004b takes into account these two issues and it represents one of the first contributions to this topic their results show that simulation uncertainty is strongly dependent on catchment scale in both cases where large catchments have less uncertainty in both precipitation and parameters the authors showed that soil water retention diffuses the flow simulation uncertainty this effect is greater in large catchments the present article addresses the problem of quantifying the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation and parametric uncertainties in rainfall runoff simulations as a function of catchment scales a new hydrologic model developed for this purpose is presented which has been set to run only at 10 km2 1 h resolution in addition this paper gives a first look to the impact of use of rain forcing with larger spatial sampling sizes than model resolution section 2 presents the study area section 3 describes the methods used section 4 illustrates the main achievements finally conclusions and some forthcoming work are presented in section 5 2 study area and datasets the study region is composed of the ardèche and gardon catchments located in the south east of france these two watersheds are part of the study window of the cévennes vivarais mediterranean hydrometeorological observatory cvmho http www ohmcv fr boudevillain et al 2011 the cévennes vivarais region is characterized by the recurrence of flash floods which causes loss of human lives and material damages ruin et al 2008 these flash floods are generated by the combination of three factors 1 at the end of summer the warm mediterranean sea provides a huge reservoir of humidity 2 a center of low atmospheric pressure located in the atlantic generates south winds in the region and 3 the resulting advection of the mediterranean humidity towards the cévennes mountains triggers convection and subsequent severe precipitation delrieu et al 2005 fig 1 shows the cvmho rainfall observation system composed of four weather radars of the météofrance aramis network at bollène montclar nîmes and sembadel and approximately 200 hourly raingauges operated by three services namely météofrance the service de prévision des crues du grand delta spcgd and electricité de france edf and the 16 stream gauges used in this study within the catchments of ardèche and the gardon these gauges records hydrographs at several

land cover 2012 the results of the isochrone estimation developed by navas and delrieu 2017 fig 2c and geology fig 2d from ign https www geoportail gouv fr donnees cartes geologiques three main datasets will be used for the hydrological model implementation the first one is the radar raingauge re analysis at several space sampling sizes 1 300 km2 and 1 h time step provided by cvmho available for intense rainfall events from 2007 to 2014 precipitation estimation is performed by merging after an in depth critical analysis the radar and raingauge datasets using the kriging with external drift ked technique one of the major advantages of this technique is that rainfall estimates at any space time sampling size come with their error estimates delrieu et al 2014 boudevillain et al 2016 the second dataset is the discharge estimations derived from the spcgd water level network using the corresponding water level discharge rating curves 16 stations of the ardèche and gardon rivers to which the present study is restricted the third dataset is the potential evapotranspiration pet estimates provided by météofrance based on the penman monteith model with a daily time resolution and an 8 km space resolution in this study we have implemented our approach for the rainy season of 2014 which has been an exceptionally rainy season within the considered period table 1 shows duration and total precipitation of the 10 rainfall events that occurred from september to december 2014 in geological terms fig 2d the upstream mountainous part of the watersheds corresponds to primary era formations with granite gneiss and sandstone it has a relative homogeneous land use with mixed forests composed by pines oaks chestnuts fig 2b the downstream part of the watersheds is mostly based on sedimentary formations from jurassic to cretaceous interrupted by faults which delineate the alès graben this graben is filled with sediments coming from the oligocene and holocene further down a cretaceous limestone formation exhibit high degree of karstification with huge caves and groundwater conduits in the surface this region has moderate slopes with garrigue orchards and vineyards urban areas are scarce there are only few small villages and medium sized cities nîmes alès the isochrone map fig 2c shows great differences in terms of routing time between the ardèche and the gardon rivers these differences are mainly due to the drainage characteristics of the catchments the ardèche river is well drained has more tributaries highest slopes in the mountainous part and a rounded shape conversely the gardon river has fewer tributaries lower slopes and an elongated shape with the long side on the flow direction 3 methodology quantification of uncertainties in rainfall and rainfall runoff processing is performed following a methodology sketched in fig 3 the rainfall runoff model described in section 3 2 was chosen so as to be able to provide runoff simulations for both gauged and ungauged watersheds with a rather simple structure and a reasonable number of parameters part of these parameters were estimated and regionalized a priori using geomorphological information topography geology land use the generalized sensitivity technique described in section 3 3 was then implemented using the available discharge estimates at gauged watersheds to determine the most sensitive parameters as well as to provide a set of size m of acceptable parameters with respect to a given cost function the computational efficiency of the model was an important concern due to the need to perform a great number of simulations a stochastic generation technique described in section 3 1 was implemented independently to define an ensemble of perturbed precipitation space time series as inputs for the hydrological model it should be noted that in this approach the model parametric uncertainty actually encompasses the uncertainties one would expect on other model input e g the potential evapotranspiration estimates and on the discharge estimates at the gauged stations nm simulations were performed for several resolutions of the hydrological model for 10 50 100 200 and 300 km2 spatial resolutions and 1 h time step uncertainty of runoff simulations for ungauged watersheds was quantified by the distribution and some specific quantiles hereafter e g the 25 50 75 quantiles as well as the mean value of the simulated discharge the coefficient of variation cv ratio of the standard deviation of the discharge ensemble to the corresponding mean value was calculated for any time step and location results are processed in three categories according to the origin of uncertainties the first one related to rainfall uncertainty only cvq1 is the average of m cvs produced by the n members of the precipitation ensemble eq 1 the second one related to parametric uncertainty only cvq2 is the average of n cvs produced by the m sets of parameters eq 2 the third one related to both rainfall and parametric uncertainties cvq3 defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the nm simulations eq 3 1 cv q 1 t x m 1 m sd q t x n m q t x n m m 2 cv q 2 t x n 1 n sd q t x n m q t x n m n 3 cv q 3 t x sd q t x n m q t x n m where n indexes the n members of the precipitation ensemble m indexes the m members of the parameter set t is the time step and x is the considered location the symbol refers to using all precipitation ensemble and or parameter set q is the runoff mean and sdq is the runoff standard deviation a similar expression can be proposed for the coefficient of variation of the precipitation ensemble 4 cv p t x sd p t x n p t x n 3 1 generation of rainfall ensembles the precipitation uncertainty is represented by an ensemble of perturbed precipitation fields where the 10 km2 spatial sampling size of precipitation matches with the model resolution let us denote n t and n sc the number of time steps t 1 n t and sub catchments x 1 n sc respectively for a given rainfall event we assume that each member n 1 n of the ensemble p t x n can be obtained by adding a stochastic residual δ t x n to a deterministic precipitation estimate r t x 5 p t x n r t x δ t x n as for the deterministic precipitation estimate r t x we will use hereafter the mean value provided by the ked unbiased estimator delrieu et al 2014 we will then assume the stochastic residual δ t x n to follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation sd t x as proposed by delrieu et al 2014 the latter term can be estimated as a bi linear function of the rainfall amount r t x and the normalized estimation standard deviation of the ked method nsd t x 6 sd t x a r r t x n s d t x the term normalized means that nsd t x is the ked estimation standard deviation obtained by using a variogram sill normalized to 1 delrieu et al 2014 have proposed an estimation procedure for the multiplicative factor ar based on a cross validation technique the reader is referred to delrieu et al 2014 for the justification of this error model which comes essentially from the observation that the radar residuals with respect to rainfall reference values conditioned on the rain rate follow a gaussian distribution for the generation of consistent realizations of the residuals it is critical to account for their spatial and temporal structure for this purpose we are using one particular realization of the residuals by taking the differences between the ked estimates obtained with the variogram of residuals inferred from the observations on the one hand and those obtained with a nugget variogram on the other hand the latter case corresponds to the drift estimation boudevillain et al 2016 the resulting matrix of size n t n sc is then used as input for the stochastic generation algorithm proposed by germann et al 2009 in a first step the spatial covariance matrix of the residuals c size n sc n sc is computed and decomposed into a lower triangular and an upper triangular matrix c l u using the lu decomposition algorithm a gaussian random vector y t x n size n sc with zero mean and unit standard deviation is then drawn and the spatial structure is imposed with the following equation 7 δ t x n l y t x n in a second step the temporal structure of the residuals is accounted for by using a second order autoregressive model ar2 8 δ t x n v δ t x n a 1 δ t 1 x n a 2 δ t 2 x n the coefficients a 1 a 2 and v are given by 9 a 1 r 1 r 2 1 1 r 1 2 10 a 2 r 1 2 r 2 1 r 1 2 11 v 1 a 2 1 a 1 a 2 1 a 1 a 2 1 a 2 0 5 where r1 r2 are the temporal autocorrelation coefficients of first and second order computed from the residuals matrix c the drawing procedure is repeated n times and finally an anamorphosis g is applied to the vector δ t x size n to ensure that the generated residuals follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation sd t x 12 δ t x g δ t x 0 sd t x like in germann et al 2009 it is assumed herein that the spatial and temporal structure of the residuals is constant in time and space respectively a notable difference between the two studies lies in the fact that the average value of the residuals considered in our case have a zero mean the ked estimator being unbiased by construction 3 2 rainfall runoff modelling to achieve the objective of this study the mesoscale hydrological computation tool mhct has been developed this section describes the basic principles of this new tool the mhct is time continuous hydrological software with the capability to take into account spatial variations of precipitation and landscape within the studied catchments see fig 4 for sketch illustration and equations catchments are represented by a cascade of sub catchments and channels sub catchment area defines model spatial resolution in this study the model resolution has been matched with the predefined sampling sizes of precipitation presented by delrieu et al 2014 and boudevillain et al 2016 these predefined sampling sizes are indeed the sub catchments elements of the model then a specific design of the channel network has been done to assemble the set of sub catchments and simulate runoff at several catchments scales infiltration exfiltration and runoff processes are modeled by two functions 1 the production function which computes water production as a sum of the effective precipitation and the base flow and 2 the transfer function which adds lag effect due to water storage and routing processes in sub catchments and channels regarding the production function effective precipitation pe is calculated through a modified version of curve number method eqs 13 19 it is to be noted that this computation is done by cumulative precipitation p which in the beginning of each flood event is set to zero beginning of flood events are defined by the occurrence of tdry hours without rainfall before the next rainfall period tlp rossman and huber 2015 base flow qb is estimated as a function of soil water retention potential s and coefficient of permeability b2 and then it is limited by a minimum base flow threshold qbmin the initial curve number cn x estimation for each sub catchment is performed by using the hydrologic soil group and land use fig 2b time evolution of soil water retention potential is simulated by a pseudo water budget which uses incremental precipitation p effective precipitation pe evapotranspiration et and antecedent conditions of soil water retention eq 13 the term pseudo water budget refers to the fact that underground flows are not considered then et is estimated as a function of potential evapotranspiration pet and the depletion coefficient b williams et al 2000 to estimate pet values below daily time step it has been supposed evenly distributed in time soil water retention potential is limited by maximum curve number cnmax for the wettest condition and curve number for the driest condition conditions in the previous time step are known in order to solve the problem of antecedent moisture conditions the simulation has been started in august which is characterized as a dry month then the computation of the water budget during august provides a good estimation of s at the beginning of september next sub catchment total production q is computed as a sum of pe and qb eq 22 the transfer function for sub catchments uses the unit hydrograph method sherman 1932 which simulates the routing process this method is a simple linear model that is used to compute the hydrograph resulting from any amount of q the ordinates of unit hydrograph u are estimated by clark 1945 method which is based on the translation and attenuation of a single precipitation pulse p1 through the sub catchment translation is done by multiplying time area curve a x by p1 where a x is obtained from fig 2c then attenuation is performed by linear reservoir routing which uses storage constant ksc as parameter the transfer function for channels uses the muskingum method cunge 1969 while taking place at the outlet of each sub catchment for every single channel reach this computation needs the weighting coefficient kc ranging from 0 to 0 5 and the time of travel of the flood wave across the channel c obtained from fig 2c 3 3 generalized sensitivity analysis uncertainties in hydrological processes representation are quantified by a generalized sensitivity analysis of the parametrization of the rainfall runoff model table 2 shows the considered ranges of parameters of the production and transfer functions note that single multiplicative coefficients have been introduced for three parameters ccn for c n cvsc for u and cc for c to modulate globally at the regional scale the parameters defined a priori from geomorphological characteristics for each sub catchment or river channel the implementation of the generalized sensitivity analysis gsa hornberger and spear 1981 consists of the following three steps i the parameter space was sampled with the latin hypercubes method to generate 1500 sets of parameters the package parameter space exploration with latin hypercubes https cran r project org package pse was used for this purpose in a first run uniform parameter distributions with ranges given in table 2 were considered for each parameter an ensemble of 1500 simulations of the model was then generated for the 16 gauged stations available for the ardèche and gardon watersheds ii a cost function was defined so as to classify the simulations obtained in two classes behavioral or not behavioral the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was chosen hereinafter for this purpose firstly the nses were computed for each gauged station j and parameter set m 32 nse j m 1 t 1 nt q s t j m q o t j 2 t 1 nt q o t j qo t j 2 where qs and qo are the simulated and observed runoff time series note that only time steps with observed discharge values greater than 1 6 of the flood peak with 2 years of return period was considered in order to focus on the ability of the hydrological model to simulate flood events the resulting nses were then averaged at the regional scale to produce a single cost function value nse r m 33 nse r m 1 j j 1 j n s e j m where j j 1 j indexes the gauged watersheds it is noteworthy that this regional averaging of the cost function allows filtering to some extent the effect of the size of the various gauged watersheds this is an important point since we expect the hydrological model to work as well as possible over the considered range of spatial scales 10 300 km2 actually a slightly more sophisticated procedure was implemented to account for the dominant hydrological processes in the region of interest there are basically two mechanisms 1 infiltration excess that happens when the precipitation rate overpasses the infiltration capacity of the soil 2 saturation excess resulting from flow contributions by the breakout of groundwater as a consequence of saturated soil in the cévennes vivarais region the two types of runoff are present in the mountainous part saturation excess predominates while in the plain part infiltration excess prevails together with exfiltration from karstic conduits in specific places manus et al 2008 therefore four sub regions were considered with the mountainous and plain parts of the ardèche and gardon catchments the local nses were first averaged over the gauged stations available for the four sub regions and the sub regional nses were finally averaged to produce the regional cost function value nse r m as the cost function threshold separating behavioral and non behavioral simulations we have used the value of 0 6 this value represents the inflection point of cost function vs behavioral simulation size it takes near 10 of the best simulations 150 samples this is of course subjective it was checked however that this choice did not change the number of the main parameters of the model otherwise the cost function threshold may impact model uncertainty i e low values of cost function threshold produce more dispersion on runoff realizations in this article we work only with this single value of cost function threshold to analyze the impact of a single level of parameter uncertainty section 4 4 iii the sensitivity index was then computed for each parameter as the maximum distance between the parameter cumulative distributions which produce behavioral and non behavioral model responses fig 5 this allows 1 the determination of parameters that can be considered as not sensitive which values can be then fixed in further model implementations and 2 an adjustment of the range and probability distribution of the most sensitive parameters as a flexible probability distribution we have used hereinafter the power exponential distribution which allows with three parameters to represent symmetric distributions ranging from uniform to gaussian and double exponential 34 pe x 2 κ 1 κ γ 1 1 κ σ e x p x μ κ κ σ κ where μ σ and κ are the parameters of position scale and shape respectively and γ is the gamma function garambois et al 2015 says it is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have main parameters with high sensitivity i e it is possible to have an important parameter with low sensitivity due to correlations with others parameters to avoid this problem and ensure that parameters with low sensitivity values do not take an important role on the behavioral response of the model we have checked that all 10 parameters were not correlated once these steps were completed we performed an ensemble of 2500 runoff realizations from 50 perturbed precipitation fields section 3 1 each with 50 set of parameters fitted to the distributions presented in fig 9 4 results and discussion 4 1 rainfall generation an ensemble of 50 perturbed precipitation space time series has been produced through stochastic generation for the autumn 2014 for the 1 h time step and spatial sampling sizes of 10 50 100 200 and 300 km2 fig 6 a shows the good fit of the gaussian distribution for the rainfall coefficient of variation cv p t x eq 4 for the spatial sampling size of 10 km2 fig 6b presents the evolution of the mean value of the cv p t x distribution as a function of the watershed surface as already evidenced in boudevillain et al 2016 the cv p values decrease significantly when spatial sampling size increases fig 7 shows an example of stochastic generation for two particular sub catchments of 10 km2 top and 200 km2 bottom for the event of november 2 2014 the left side of the figures displays incremental precipitation mean percentiles 10 25 75 90 as well as the 50 members of the ensemble the right side shows cumulative precipitation the dispersion of the cumulative rainfall at the end of the event is the result of 1 the variation of the standard deviation of the error from one time step to the next which increases when the rain rate increases and decreases when the watershed surface increases and 2 the residuals time correlation accounting in the generation procedure like germann et al 2009 we found autocorrelation coefficients r1 r2 of typically 0 3 and 0 15 respectively for the 1 h and 2 h lag times 4 2 generalized sensitivity analysis after performing the generalized sensitivity analysis it were identified ccn ksc b2 and cvsc as the main parameters of the model fig 8 gives an example for the 10 km2 model resolution where ccn 0 43 ksc 0 24 b2 0 09 and cvsc 0 06 at the same time it was verified that there is no correlation between the sets of parameters obtained from behavior realizations fig 9 shows the fit of power exponential distribution to the empirical main parameters obtained for the upper ardèche at 10 km2 1 h this step allows us to generate a set of parameters with certain size in our case 50 set of parameters it is noted that the two most sensitive parameters produce well defined histograms with high density values where ccn has a slight positive skew contrariwise ksc has major negative skew ksc values were limited between 0 and 1 this parameter represent the ratio of direct runoff in the t time step to direct precipitation in t 1 time step 0 means full storage and 1 no storage effect for cvsc and b2 there have been obtained quasi uniforms distributions 4 3 illustration of the model performance to ensure that the model reasonably reproduces runoff hydrographs a visual inspection of the runoff realizations and a quantitative regional evaluation according to regional nash sutcliffe efficiency have been performed as an illustration fig 10 displays 2500 realizations from the combination of 50 perturbed precipitation fields and 50 sets of parameters of the complex flood event occurred in the ardèche river from october 9 to 15 2014 an overall assessment of rising recession limbs and peak discharges of the simulated hydrographs suggests that the model works in an acceptable manner especially for the upper ardèche e g meyras and val les bains downstream e g ucel and vogue and on the right tributaries e g beaume and chessezac the recession limb of the 2nd sub flood has been underestimated this could be due to a singularity in the drainage of the karstic system which has not been considered within the model e g different soil water retention potential note that at the end of the period the problem diminishes and even in some sub catchments the problem disappears e g vogue and ucel a similar analysis was done for gardon catchment with 8 observed hydrographs at different sites that showed similar results than ardèche catchment not presented in this paper the skill of the model was evaluated for the 10 km2 1 h model by firstly considering the corresponding 10 km2 1 h rainfall estimates and secondly the hourly rainfall estimates at different spatial sampling sizes 50 100 200 300 km2 this was done in order to quantify the impact of rain with larger spatial sampling sizes than model resolution it was decided to take this approach as in other regions it is hard to have a sampling size of precipitation adapted to the model resolution please note that to match the different spatial sampling sizes of precipitation with the model resolution it was considered that precipitation is distributed uniformly within each sub catchment i e an uniform spatial downscaling of precipitation is performed in addition note that a new set of acceptable parameters was calculated for each spatial sampling size of precipitation forcing fig 11 shows mean regional nash sutcliffe efficiency and the interquartile range difference between percentiles 75 25 as a dispersion index the highest values of efficiency are obtained from the use of small sampling sizes of precipitation matching model resolution these results can be explained as it was considered that the precipitation is distributed uniformly in space however this condition in natural environments is not true it has been shown that precipitation could follow the relief or convective bands godart et al 2009 now lower mean values of nash sutcliffe efficiency and a higher dispersion rate for larger sampling sizes of precipitation reflects that a rough precipitation forcing induces more uncertainty in section 4 it is presented an analysis of the propagation of errors at different catchment scales at ungauged sites for 10 km2 spatial sampling size of precipitation and equal model resolution 4 4 error propagation as a function of catchment scales after checking the rather good performance of the model at gauged sites section 4 3 we are looking here at the way the rainfall and parametric uncertainties evolve as a function of the catchment scales we are considering for this purpose the model simulations obtained at ungauged sections for headwater catchments of sizes 10 50 100 200 and 300 km2 fig 12 shows the histograms of the coefficients of variation of the discharge cv q obtained for the headwater catchments of 10 km2 using rainfall estimates of 10 km2 as mentioned in section 3 three coefficient of variation of runoff realizations were calculated corresponding to precipitation uncertainty only cv q 1 parametric uncertainty only cv q 2 and precipitation and parametric uncertainties together cv q 3 it is observed that the smallest 50 percentile of coefficient of variation is cv q 1 followed by cv q 2 and last cv q 3 with slight difference between the last two when cv q 1 fig 12a is compared with cv p fig 6a it is noted that runoff uncertainty produced by precipitation uncertainty is less than the precipitation uncertainty itself the 50 percentile of cv q 1 is 0 16 whereas cv p is equal to 0 23 the interquartile ranges of both distributions are relatively equivalent between them q 75 q 25 0 08 and the distribution of cvq1 presents a left skew with respect to the cv p distribution this result could be explained by the storage effect of the catchment which attenuates the perturbed precipitation fields around the average precipitation value this storage phenomenon is analogous to a low pass electronic filter composed by a resistor and a capacitor where the capacitor stores energy and stabilizes the voltage variation around the resistance in the case of the hydrological system catchment stores water and stabilize the flow rate at the outlet cvq2 fig 12b and cvq3 fig 12c histograms are both located to the right of cvq1 distribution which means that in the present context uncertainties produced by parametric uncertainty and the combined effect of precipitation and parametric uncertainties are greater than the uncertainty produced by precipitation the previous results have been expanded to headwater catchments with surfaces of 50 100 200 and 300 km2 fig 13 shows runoff uncertainties in this range of surfaces it is observed that the effect of precipitation uncertainty strongly decreases with the surface of the watershed fig 13a until 100 km2 when it turned to equilibrium this result seems to indicate that the behavior of runoff uncertainties through surfaces follows in shape the uncertainty of areal precipitation fig 6b but it is attenuated by the catchment storage capacity which increases as a function of the catchment scale the inflection point around 100 km2 could be related to the temporal resolution requirement for a given catchment scale e g for cévennes watersheds with 100 km2 time to peak is around 200 min delrieu et al 2014 thus an adequate temporal resolution is one third of that value 1 h which is our resolution when we have analyzed the smaller catchment scales 10 50 km2 we cannot see great differences in shape between cvp and cvq1 as storage and routing process at these catchments scales do not produce great time delay between precipitation forcing and model output the opposite occurs at scales higher than 100 km2 which can be well represented by 1 h model resolution this finding is consistent with the results of carpenter and georgakakos 2004b it is found however that the effect of parametric uncertainty is not dependent on catchment scale fig 13b this is opposite to carpenter and georgakakos 2004b who found the effect of parametric uncertainty to be inversely proportional to the catchment scale this may be due to the parametrization procedure adopted in this study where the set of parameters was selected according to a regional cost function threshold eq 18 the cvq3 graph fig 13c shows the combined effect of both sources of uncertainty it is observed that cvq3 is always over cvq1 and cvq2 meaning that the effect of precipitation and parametric uncertainties together are higher than their isolated effects also cvq3 has a slight negative slope which indicates that it tends to decrease with catchment surface 5 conclusions and outlooks the present study aimed to quantify the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation uncertainty and model parametrization uncertainty in rainfall runoff simulation as a function of the catchment scale 10 300 km2 note that the parametric uncertainty as quantified here with the generalized sensitivity analysis may account and compensate in part for systematic errors related to the mathematical representation of hydrological processes and their regional parameterization as well as for systematic errors on the other input and output variables e g et observed stream flows the work started from the initiative to develop and test a computational tool capable of representing hydrological processes in a distributed way for gauged and ungauged watersheds in the cévennes vivarais region which is prone to heavy precipitation and flash flooding this tool has been evaluated at several gauged sites within the ardèche and gardon catchments and proved reasonably good skills to simulate observed runoff on the one hand uncertainty coming from precipitation is inversely proportional to the catchment surface it follows in shape the uncertainty of areal precipitation which is further attenuated by the storage effect greater for larger catchments on the other hand the parametric uncertainty obtained for the cost function threshold used in this study has proved to be greater than the rainfall uncertainty and quite independent of the catchment scale in addition mean values of nash sutcliffe efficiency and their variation as a function of the rainfall spatial resolution reveal that rough precipitation forcing induces more uncertainty the methodology presented in this work is useful to assess the impact of rainfall uncertainties in rainfall runoff processing with respect to other sources of uncertainty model structure parametric uncertainty uncertainty on other input and output variables in our case we noted that rainfall uncertainty has a relatively minor impact compared to the overall uncertainty quantified here with the parametric uncertainty this is probably related to the facts that i the rainfall observation system is particularly rich in the cévennes vivarais region and ii to the efficiency of the radar raingauge processing based on detailed critical analysis of the raw data and the use of unbiased geostatistical estimators it would be interesting to test other models which may perform better or worse and give rise to lower or higher parametric uncertainty respectively for the same satisfaction of the user requirement given by the choice of the cost function threshold we think that the computation of recession limbs of our model could be upgraded with a complementary scheme that could handle the dynamics of karstic flows an important issue for mediterranean watersheds another finding of this research is the quantification of the attenuation effect of precipitation uncertainty due to the water storage capacity of the catchment nevertheless storage capacity does not depend only on catchment scale it also depends on the dominant runoff mechanism the occurrence of a type of runoff is determined among others by infiltration and precipitation rates antecedent precipitation soil water retention potential at this point the problem arises because most of these factors change over space and time the limitation of this work is that we have not taken into account the different sources of bias which could impact the rainfall runoff uncertainties in one hand with respect to precipitation we accept ked as an unbiased estimator however we know that it could have a non negligible bias under certain conditions e g regions with scarce precipitation network or atypical storm events on the other hand with respect to hydrologic model we focused our analysis over a set of ungauged catchments which are prone to flash flooding this set of catchments lacks of observed hydrographs so it is hard to quantify the bias at the end of the simulation process to overcome this limitation forthcoming works could use post flood peak flow estimation gaume and borga 2008 this new information can also be useful to validate the model at upper catchments acknowledgements the datasets used in this study were provided by cvmho a national observation service

depletion of natural fractures 3 natural fracture radial flow 4 transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and 5 pseudo steady state flow the results reveal that the interporosity flow coefficient storativity ratio natural fracture permeability anisotropy and reservoir size play significant roles on the identified flow regimes compared to the hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir shape the developed solution can be useful for well test analysis by generating a new set of type curves or can be applicable to a forward model

kazemi 1969 de swaan 1976 moench 1984 zimmerman et al 1993 hamm and bidaux 1996 de smedt 2011 dejam et al 2013 the well pressure response in dual porosity reservoirs was first described by warren and root 1963 a complete review of related works in literature can be found elsewhere hassanzadeh et al 2009 due to the very low mobility of stored fluids in tight matrix blocks of a naturally fracture formation it is sometimes required to apply advanced techniques such as hydraulic fracturing for increasing mobility of fluid in these reservoirs and enabling flow to the production wells therefore a better understanding of concepts of fluid flow in hydraulically fractured formations for improving fluid extraction is one of the important areas of research hydraulic fracturing is an effective and operative stimulation method and has been extensively implemented in this technique fluid which consists primarily of water but also include a variety of chemical additives is injected at a rate adequate to increase the wellbore pressure that can exceed the fracture pressure of the reservoir rock the stress induced by the pressure generates hydraulic fractures that increase the formation permeability and cause larger flow rate of fluids into the production well stuart 2012 in other words hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique in which reservoir rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid in fact the purpose of this technique is to enhance hydrocarbon production from wells with damaged zones or from reservoirs with low permeabilities traditionally well test analysis has been used as a tool in the determination of formation properties raghavan et al 1972 gringarten et al 1975 cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego 1981 during the last decades numerous efforts have been performed for modeling of the pressure transient behavior for vertical wells with or without hydraulic fractures in single and dual porosity reservoirs all these efforts were performed based on the application of the source sink term combined with a mathematical method including green function laplace transform etc to solve unsteady state pressure diffusivity equation first russell and truitt 1964 presented data for pressure drawdown for a vertically fractured well in the center of a closed square by solving the diffusivity equation with a source term using a finite difference approximation later raghavan et al 1972 applied a technique to interpret the pressure transient behavior of a vertically fractured well under buildup testing their results substantiate prior results of russell and truitt 1964 then gringarten et al 1974 presented data for drawdown for an infinite conductivity vertical fracture which is located at the center of a closed square drainage region and producing a slightly compressible fluid at a constant rate subsequently gringarten et al 1975 applied their previous results from gringarten et al 1974 to interpret the well test data from the vertical fractured wells thereafter cinco ley 1974 and cinco ley et al 1975 derived an analytical expression for the pressure transient behavior for an inclined fracture accompanied with a vertical well by implementation of the instantaneous point source solution next raghavan et al 1978 were the first developed an analytical model that evaluates the impact of the fracture height on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical fracture they derived their model using the green function product solution technique which was presented by gringarten and ramey 1973 later cinco ley et al 1978 developed a mathematical model to study the pressure transient behavior of a well with a finite conductivity vertical fracture which is located in an infinite slab reservoir by applying green and source functions and the newman product technique then cinco ley and samaniego 1981 presented a new method to analyze pressure data for a well intersected by a finite conductivity vertical fracture they developed their technique applying the bilinear flow theory which considers linear flow not only in fracture but also in formation they coupled the flow equations in the fracture and formation and solved those using successive applications of the laplace transforms with respect to time and vertical coordinate subsequently rodriguez et al 1984a b developed semi analytical solutions to investigate the influence of the partial penetration of infinite and finite conductivity fractures on the pressure transient behavior of a vertically fractured well thereafter ozkan and raghavan 1991 presented point source solutions in the laplace domain and documented an extensive library to obtain the distributions for reservoir pressure and the responses of a well for an extensive range of well structures including partially penetrated vertical and fractured wells fully penetrated or limited entry next igbokoyi and tiab 2008 obtained a solution using the laplace transform to study the impact of the partial penetration of an infinite conductivity hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical well in a naturally fractured reservoir later dinh and tiab 2009a b solved the model developed by cinco ley 1974 and cinco ley et al 1975 for the pressure transient behavior caused by an inclined fracture accompanied with vertical well however development of a straightforward solution for pressure transient analysis in a bounded dual porosity reservoir with a hydraulically fractured vertical well which can show all possible flow regimes is still lacking in literature in order to address this existing gap a new semi analytical solution which is combination of the laplace transform lt with respect to time and the finite fourier cosine transforms ffct s with respect to horizontal and vertical coordinates is applied in this work to solve the two dimensional diffusivity equation in a dual porosity reservoir with a hydraulically fractured vertical production well using the developed new solution various flow regimes have been identified therefore the findings of this study can improve the current understanding of the well test data analysis for hydraulically fractured formations this study focuses on the modeling of the pressure variation for a hydraulically fractured vertical well producing from a bounded dual porosity reservoir for considering the effect of the hydraulically fractured vertical production well through the position of the fracture within the reservoir in a two dimensional diffusivity equation combination of the dirac delta and heaviside step functions is used the laplace transform lt with respect to time and the finite fourier cosine transforms ffct s with respect to horizontal and vertical coordinates are successively used to obtain semi analytical solution of the diffusivity equation the developed solution can be used for generation of type curves for well test or pressure transient analysis of a hydraulically fractured vertical well in a bounded dual porosity reservoir it can also be used as a forward model for estimation of different parameters including hydraulic fracture length interporosity flow coefficient storativity ratio natural fracture permeability anisotropy matrix permeability hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir size in other words the results of

after explanation of the physical model the derivation of the governing equations is described then the solution of the well pressure and its derivative are presented for a two dimensional bounded dual porosity reservoir with a hydraulically fractured vertical production well 2 1 assumptions and explanation of the physical model a hydraulically fractured vertical well producing from a dual porosity formation is considered for the problem under study the three dimensional physical model and its two dimensional top view are shown in fig 1 where x y and z are the coordinates the dual porosity reservoir is comprised of homogeneous anisotropic natural fractures with constant permeability anisotropy in the x y or horizontal plane kfx kfy and homogeneous isotropic matrix the dual

fracture left and right ends and the well are a c b c and a xf c respectively it is noted that b a 2xf the dual porosity reservoir and hydraulic fracture have the same height darcy s law is applied to the fluid flow in both the matrix and the natural fractures the fluid flowing through the dual porosity reservoir is supposed to be single phase and slightly compressible the fluid viscosity is assumed to be constant the well produces at a constant flow rate q the pseudo steady state formulation is considered for the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir the pseudo steady state behavior of the fluid transfer between the matrix and the natural fractures assumes that the rate of pressure change within the matrix remains constant this approach has been used extensively in the literature warren and root 1963 2 2 governing equation the two dimensional diffusivity equation that governs the pressure transient behavior in a dual porosity

as a line source in fact this term is a source term that represents the fluid flow from the reservoir to the hydraulic fracture combination of the dirac delta and heaviside step functions is used to consider the position of the hydraulic fracture within the dual porosity reservoir the pseudo steady state formulation for the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir can be written as warren and root 1963 2 c m ϕ m p m t σ k m μ p m p f where km is the matrix permeability and σ is the shape factor to solve eq 1 using eq 2 two initial conditions

ratio natural fracture permeability anisotropy hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir size on the pressure response of a hydraulically fractured vertical well and its derivative in a dual porosity formation are presented and discussed 3 1 identification of flow regimes for identification of the flow regimes involved in the problem under study eqs 10 and 11 are applied to plot the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure in a dual porosity formation pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus the dimensionless time td to use eqs 10 and 11 a reservoir with the dimensionless size of ld 10 wd 10 hd 10 is considered in which the hydraulically fractured vertical production well is located at the center and the dimensionless coordinates of the hydraulic fracture left and right ends and the well are ad 4 5 cd 5 bd 5 5 cd 5 and ad 1 2 5 cd 5 respectively see fig 2 fig 3 demonstrates the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd solid curve and its derivative dpwd dlntd dashed curve versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity reservoir described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 ω 0 01 and kfd 10 fig 3 clearly identifies five flow regimes including early linear flow volumetric depletion of natural fractures natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow during early times the formation fluid flows linearly from the formation to the hydraulically fractured well as a result this regime is called early linear flow which occurs only in high conductivity fractures on cartesian coordinates pwd is a linear function of t d 1 2 in other words a log log plot of pwd versus td has a slope of 1 2 unless the fracture is damaged the pressure derivative plot exhibits a slope of 1 2 therefore the early linear flow is characterized by a straight line with a slope of 1 2 in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td dpwd dlntd t d 1 2 igbokoyi and tiab 2008 mentioned that the duration of the early linear flow regime depends on the storativity ratio interporosity flow coefficient and dimensionless hydraulic fracture height the unit slope line in the log log plots for pwd and dpwd dlntd against td pwd td and dpwd dlntd td after the early linear flow corresponds to the volumetric depletion of natural fractures in this flow regime the fluid storage within the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir is depleted volumetrically as a result this flow regime is also called the natural fracture storage phenomenon this regime has been previously reported by joseph et al 1986 for the volumetric depletion of higher flow capacity layer during pressure transient behavior in a bounded two layered reservoir located in the shengli field of china a shale reservoir resembles a dual porosity system comprised of natural fractures and matrix the well pressure response in dual porosity reservoirs was first described by warren and root 1963 using two dimensionless variables the interporosity flow coefficient λ and the storativity ratio ω the interporosity flow coefficient is a measure of how easily fluid transfers from the matrix to the natural fractures this dimensionless parameter directly depends on the ratio of matrix permeability to natural fracture permeability in the x direction higher values of λ represent higher fluid exchange between the matrix and the natural fractures the latter variable storativity ratio corresponds to the natural fracture fluid capacitance divided by the total natural fracture matrix fluid capacitance the total dual porosity system incorporates the natural fractures and the matrix the warren and root 1963 model results in a typical s shaped curve associated with an inflection point for the pressure response of the well against the time in a semi log plot the value of ω can be calculated using the separation between the two parallel lines as ω 1 or λ the behavior of a dual porosity reservoir approaches that of a single porosity reservoir in the current study the formation is naturally fractured therefore it is expected to observe three traditional flow regimes including natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and total natural fractures and matrix radial flow because of finite acting reservoir only the first two flow regimes are visible and the last one is not seen in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td natural fracture radial flow regime represents the radial flow of fluid through the natural fractures of the dual porosity formation since the pseudo steady state formulation is used for the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow is represented by a sharp dip or v shape in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td instead of the total natural fractures and matrix radial flow pseudo steady state flow appears at late times the pseudo steady state flow regime occurs for long producing times due to the pressure being affected by all four boundaries of a bounded reservoir simultaneously this regime is characterized by a straight line with a slope of unity in the log log plots for pwd and dpwd dlntd against td pwd td and dpwd dlntd td 3 2 impact of the interporosity flow coefficient the interporosity flow coefficient eq 5f is a dimensionless parameter which determines the ability of the matrix to flow to the natural fractures and depends on the shape factor the ratio of the matrix permeability to the natural fracture permeability and the square of the hydraulic fracture length in a dual porosity reservoir the interporosity flow coefficient traditionally shows the beginning time of the transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow the speed of responding of the matrix to the pressure depletion is controlled by the interporosity flow coefficient thus the interporosity flow coefficient represents the duration of transition houzé et al 2007 igbokoyi and tiab 2008 used the range of 0 01 λ 100 to investigate about the impact of the partial penetration of an infinite conductivity hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical well which is located in a naturally fractured reservoir this range is applied for the interporosity flow coefficient throughout the current study fig 4 illustrates the impact of the interporosity flow coefficient λ on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity formation described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with ω 0 01 and kfd 10 the demonstrated results in fig 4 indicate that by increasing the interporosity flow coefficient the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure decreases the duration of unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened as the interporosity flow coefficient increases however eventually all the dimensionless well pressure curves merge at late times and increase linearly with dimensionless time indicating a bounded or finite formation fig 4 reveals that the duration of the early linear flow is independent from the interporosity flow coefficient in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td the duration of volumetric depletion of natural fractures is prolonged by decreasing the interporosity flow coefficient as the interporosity flow coefficient increases the natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow appear earlier a physical explanation for the earlier occurrence of the last three flow regimes can be given as follows the matrix permeability is higher for a larger interporosity flow coefficient compared to the one for a smaller interporosity flow coefficient therefore the matrix begins to respond to the pressure drop in the natural fractures earlier moreover for a smaller interporosity flow coefficient the generated sharp dip or v shape is shallower in other words the matrix is tighter for a lower interporosity flow coefficient and begins to respond to the pressure drop in the natural fractures later however the generated dip has the same size and shape for all interporosity flow coefficients in addition the duration of the pseudo steady state flow is prolonged by increasing the interporosity flow coefficient since the matrix permeability is higher for a larger interporosity flow coefficient the pressure is influenced by boundaries of the bounded reservoir earlier 3 3 impact of the storativity ratio the storativity ratio eq 5e measures the relative natural fracture storage capacity in a dual porosity reservoir the storativity ratio traditionally determines the depth of the generated dip or v shape during the transition from the natural fracture radial flow to the total natural fractures and matrix radial flow this parameter is usually in the range of 0 01 ω 0 1 dejam et al 2013 which is applied throughout the current study fig 5 demonstrates the impact of the storativity ratio ω on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity formation described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 and kfd 10 fig 5 show that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure decreases as the storativity ratio increases the unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs later for a larger storativity ratio compared to the one for a smaller storativity ratio in addition the duration of the transition between the volumetric depletion of natural fractures and the pseudo steady state flow is shortened by increasing the storativity ratio nevertheless ultimately all the dimensionless well pressure curves merge at late times and increase linearly with dimensionless time representing a finite acting reservoir the results illustrated in fig 5 reveal that the early linear flow can be clearly observed for all storativity ratios in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td however the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures occur later for a larger storativity ratio compared to the one for a smaller storativity ratio therefore the linear flow from the formation to the hydraulically fractured well is a function of the storativity ratio the same observation has been reported by igbokoyi and tiab 2008 moreover the lower storativity ratio results in earlier natural fracture radial flow and transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and deeper transition nevertheless it is very difficult to distinguish the natural fracture radial flow from the transition for higher values of the storativity ratio in other words the size and shape of the generated dip become smaller and shallower as the storativity ratio increases and finally it becomes flat for ω 0 1 therefore the generated dip does not appear for ω 0 1 in addition the onset time of the pseudo steady state flow remains invariant by changing the storativity ratio 3 4 impact of the natural fracture permeability anisotropy another factor that can influence the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well in a dual porosity formation is the natural fracture permeability anisotropy this parameter is usually larger than unity the range of 1 kfd 1000 is applied for this parameter throughout the current study fig 6 shows the impact of the natural fracture permeability anisotropy kfd on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity formation described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 and ω 0 01 the results demonstrated in fig 6 reveal that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure increases as the natural fracture permeability anisotropy increases the unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs earlier by decreasing the anisotropy however finally all the dimensionless well pressure curves merge at late times and increase linearly with dimensionless time due to the finite acting formation from the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td in fig 6 it is concluded that the early linear flow occurs for all anisotropies nevertheless the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller anisotropies the duration of the volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened by increasing the anisotropy this observation can be explained physically as follows based on the definition of the natural fracture permeability anisotropy eq 5d the horizontal natural fracture permeability becomes larger than the vertical natural fracture permeability when the anisotropy increases this implies that the volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs faster as a result the duration of this regime becomes shorter as the anisotropy increases as it is clear from fig 6 the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for kfd 1000 however the anisotropy has no influence on the subsequent flow regimes 3 5 effect of the hydraulically fractured well location to study the effect of the hydraulically fractured well location on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well a dual porosity formation with the dimensionless size of ld 10 wd 10 hd 10 is assumed in which four different cases are considered for the well location see fig 7 the dimensionless coordinates of the hydraulic fracture left and right ends and the well are ad cd bd cd ad 1 2 cd 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 5 2 5 0 75 1 25 1 75 1 25 1 25 1 25 and 0 125 0 625 1 125 0 625 0 625 0 625 for cases 1 to 4 respectively fig 8 shows the effect of the hydraulically fractured well location on the dimensionless well pressure pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 ω 0 01 and kfd 10 the results demonstrated in fig 8 reveal that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure remains unchanged for cases 1 to 3 during the whole time while it decreases for case 4 at early times based on the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td in fig 8 it is worth mentioning that for case 4 where the hydraulically fractured well is located very close to the left formation boundary the early linear flow does not appear and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures is prolonged nevertheless the last three flow regimes are the same for all four cases 3 6 impact of the reservoir size the reservoir size is defined by its dimensionless length ld dimensionless width wd and dimensionless height hd denoted by ld wd hd in order to study the impact of the reservoir size on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well five dual porosity formations with the same shape of square and different dimensionless sizes of ld wd hd 1 1 1 5 5 5 10 10 10 50 50 50 and 100 100 100 are assumed in which the hydraulically fractured vertical production well is located at the center see fig 9 the dimensionless coordinates of the hydraulic fracture left and right ends and the well for each dual porosity formation are ad cd bd cd ad 1 2 cd 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 5 2 5 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 24 5 25 25 5 25 25 25 and 49 5 50 50 5 50 50 50 respectively fig 10 illustrates the impact of the size of the dual porosity formation described in fig 9 on the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 ω 0 01 and kfd 10 the results illustrated in fig 10 reveals that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure decreases as the reservoir size increases it is also concluded that all five identified flow regimes differ from a reservoir size to another one however the unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs later and its duration is shortened by increasing the reservoir size according to the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td in fig 10 it is found that the early linear flow occurs for all reservoir sizes nevertheless the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller reservoir size compared to the one for a larger reservoir size the duration of the volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened by increasing the reservoir size as it is clear from fig 10 the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for ld wd hd 100 100 100 although the derivative of the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure with respect to the natural logarithm of the dimensionless time dpwd dlntd decreases during the whole time by increasing the reservoir size the onset times of the last three flow regimes remain fixed in addition the generated dip has the same size and shape for all reservoir sizes 4 summary and conclusions a model is derived mathematically to investigate the role of a hydraulic fracturing on the pressure of a vertical well producing from a finite acting dual porosity reservoir to include the effect of the hydraulically fractured vertical production well through the position of the fracture within the reservoir in a two dimensional diffusivity equation the dirac delta function combined with the heaviside step function is used the laplace transform lt and the finite fourier cosine transforms ffct s with respect to horizontal and vertical coordinates are successively used to derive the semi analytical solution of the unsteady state diffusivity equation the developed model can be applied for generation of type curves for well test interpretation or can be applied as a forward model for estimation of reservoir parameters the results identify five flow regimes including early linear flow dpwd dlntd t d 1 2 volumetric depletion of natural fractures pwd td and dpwd dlntd td natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow pwd td and dpwd dlntd td the presented results reveal that the interporosity flow coefficient storativity ratio natural fracture permeability anisotropy and reservoir size play significant roles on the pressure response of a hydraulically fractured vertical well and its derivative in a dual porosity formation compared to the hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir shape by increasing the interporosity flow coefficient the duration of the early linear flow is remained fixed while the duration of volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened and the duration of the pseudo steady state flow is prolonged moreover for a smaller interporosity flow coefficient the generated sharp dip or v shape is shallower the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures occur later for a larger storativity ratio compared to the one with a smaller storativity ratio in addition the size and shape of the generated dip become smaller and shallower as the storativity ratio increases and finally it becomes flat for ω 0 1 it is shown that the linear flow from the formation to the hydraulically fractured well is a function of the storativity ratio which agrees with previous studies the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller natural fracture permeability anisotropy moreover the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for kfd 1000 in addition the natural fracture permeability anisotropy has no influence on the subsequent flow regimes the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller reservoir size compared to the one for a larger reservoir size moreover the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for ld wd hd 100 100 100 although the derivative decreases during the whole period by increasing the reservoir size the onset times of the last subsequent flow regimes remain invariant in addition the generated dip has the same size and shape for all reservoir sizes the developed solution can be used for generation of type curves for well test or pressure transient analysis of a hydraulically fractured vertical well in a bounded dual porosity reservoir it can also be used as a forward model for estimation of different parameters including hydraulic fracture length interporosity flow

kazemi 1969 de swaan 1976 moench 1984 zimmerman et al 1993 hamm and bidaux 1996 de smedt 2011 dejam et al 2013 the well pressure response in dual porosity reservoirs was first described by warren and root 1963 a complete review of related works in literature can be found elsewhere hassanzadeh et al 2009 due to the very low mobility of stored fluids in tight matrix blocks of a naturally fracture formation it is sometimes required to apply advanced techniques such as hydraulic fracturing for increasing mobility of fluid in these reservoirs and enabling flow to the production wells therefore a better understanding of concepts of fluid flow in hydraulically fractured formations for improving fluid extraction is one of the important areas of research hydraulic fracturing is an effective and operative stimulation method and has been extensively implemented in this technique fluid which consists primarily of water but also include a variety of chemical additives is injected at a rate adequate to increase the wellbore pressure that can exceed the fracture pressure of the reservoir rock the stress induced by the pressure generates hydraulic fractures that increase the formation permeability and cause larger flow rate of fluids into the production well stuart 2012 in other words hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique in which reservoir rock is fractured by a pressurized liquid in fact the purpose of this technique is to enhance hydrocarbon production from wells with damaged zones or from reservoirs with low permeabilities traditionally well test analysis has been used as a tool in the determination of formation properties raghavan et al 1972 gringarten et al 1975 cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego 1981 during the last decades numerous efforts have been performed for modeling of the pressure transient behavior for vertical wells with or without hydraulic fractures in single and dual porosity reservoirs all these efforts were performed based on the application of the source sink term combined with a mathematical method including green function laplace transform etc to solve unsteady state pressure diffusivity equation first russell and truitt 1964 presented data for pressure drawdown for a vertically fractured well in the center of a closed square by solving the diffusivity equation with a source term using a finite difference approximation later raghavan et al 1972 applied a technique to interpret the pressure transient behavior of a vertically fractured well under buildup testing their results substantiate prior results of russell and truitt 1964 then gringarten et al 1974 presented data for drawdown for an infinite conductivity vertical fracture which is located at the center of a closed square drainage region and producing a slightly compressible fluid at a constant rate subsequently gringarten et al 1975 applied their previous results from gringarten et al 1974 to interpret the well test data from the vertical fractured wells thereafter cinco ley 1974 and cinco ley et al 1975 derived an analytical expression for the pressure transient behavior for an inclined fracture accompanied with a vertical well by implementation of the instantaneous point source solution next raghavan et al 1978 were the first developed an analytical model that evaluates the impact of the fracture height on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical fracture they derived their model using the green function product solution technique which was presented by gringarten and ramey 1973 later cinco ley et al 1978 developed a mathematical model to study the pressure transient behavior of a well with a finite conductivity vertical fracture which is located in an infinite slab reservoir by applying green and source functions and the newman product technique then cinco ley and samaniego 1981 presented a new method to analyze pressure data for a well intersected by a finite conductivity vertical fracture they developed their technique applying the bilinear flow theory which considers linear flow not only in fracture but also in formation they coupled the flow equations in the fracture and formation and solved those using successive applications of the laplace transforms with respect to time and vertical coordinate subsequently rodriguez et al 1984a b developed semi analytical solutions to investigate the influence of the partial penetration of infinite and finite conductivity fractures on the pressure transient behavior of a vertically fractured well thereafter ozkan and raghavan 1991 presented point source solutions in the laplace domain and documented an extensive library to obtain the distributions for reservoir pressure and the responses of a well for an extensive range of well structures including partially penetrated vertical and fractured wells fully penetrated or limited entry next igbokoyi and tiab 2008 obtained a solution using the laplace transform to study the impact of the partial penetration of an infinite conductivity hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical well in a naturally fractured reservoir later dinh and tiab 2009a b solved the model developed by cinco ley 1974 and cinco ley et al 1975 for the pressure transient behavior caused by an inclined fracture accompanied with vertical well however development of a straightforward solution for pressure transient analysis in a bounded dual porosity reservoir with a hydraulically fractured vertical well which can show all possible flow regimes is still lacking in literature in order to address this existing gap a new semi analytical solution which is combination of the laplace transform lt with respect to time and the finite fourier cosine transforms ffct s with respect to horizontal and vertical coordinates is applied in this work to solve the two dimensional diffusivity equation in a dual porosity reservoir with a hydraulically fractured vertical production well using the developed new solution various flow regimes have been identified therefore the findings of this study can improve the current understanding of the well test data analysis for hydraulically fractured formations this study focuses on the modeling of the pressure variation for a hydraulically fractured vertical well producing from a bounded dual porosity reservoir for considering the effect of the hydraulically fractured vertical production well through the position of the fracture within the reservoir in a two dimensional diffusivity equation combination of the dirac delta and heaviside step functions is used the laplace transform lt with respect to time and the finite fourier cosine transforms ffct s with respect to horizontal and vertical coordinates are successively used to obtain semi analytical solution of the diffusivity equation the developed solution can be used for generation of type curves for well test or pressure transient analysis of a hydraulically fractured vertical well in a bounded dual porosity reservoir it can also be used as a forward model for estimation of different parameters including hydraulic fracture length interporosity flow coefficient storativity ratio natural fracture permeability anisotropy matrix permeability hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir size in other words the results of this work find application in well testing of hydraulically fractured vertical wells in dual porosity reservoirs the organization for this work is as follows first the theoretical model and its solution are derived then the obtained results based on the developed model are discussed finally a summary and conclusions for the current work are presented 2 theoretical modeling in this section after explanation of the physical model the derivation of the governing equations is described then the solution of the well pressure and its derivative are presented for a two dimensional bounded dual porosity reservoir with a hydraulically fractured vertical production well 2 1 assumptions and explanation of the physical model a hydraulically fractured vertical well producing from a dual

porosity reservoir is comprised of homogeneous anisotropic natural fractures with constant permeability anisotropy in the x y or horizontal plane kfx kfy and homogeneous isotropic matrix the dual porosity formation is considered as a bounded reservoir the length width and thickness of the dual porosity reservoir are l w and h respectively the vertical production well is located at the center of the hydraulic fracture the hydraulic fracture is assumed to have infinite conductivity the hydraulic fracture has two wings and the length of each wing is xf the coordinates of the hydraulic fracture left and right ends and the well are a c b c and a xf c respectively it is noted that b a 2xf the dual porosity reservoir and hydraulic fracture have the same height darcy s law is applied to the fluid flow in both the matrix and the natural fractures the fluid flowing through the dual porosity reservoir is supposed to be single phase and slightly compressible the fluid viscosity is assumed to be constant the well produces at a constant flow rate q the pseudo steady state formulation is considered for the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir the pseudo steady state behavior of the fluid transfer between the matrix and the natural fractures assumes that the rate of pressure change within the matrix remains constant this approach has been used extensively in the literature warren and root 1963 2 2 governing equation the two dimensional diffusivity equation that governs the pressure transient behavior in a dual porosity

respectively ϕf and ϕm are the natural fracture and matrix porosities respectively and t is the time the third term in eq 1 includes the effect of the hydraulically fractured vertical production well as a line source in fact this term is a source term that represents the fluid flow from the reservoir to the hydraulic fracture combination of the dirac delta and heaviside step functions is used to consider the position of the hydraulic fracture within the dual porosity reservoir the pseudo steady state formulation for the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir can be written as warren and root 1963 2 c m ϕ m p m t σ k m μ p m p f where km is the matrix permeability and σ is the shape factor to solve eq 1 using eq 2 two initial conditions for the natural fractures and the matrix of the dual porosity reservoir two boundary conditions in the horizontal direction and two boundary conditions in the vertical direction for the natural fractures of the dual porosity formation are needed the initial conditions are 3a p f x y 0 p i 3b p m 0 p i where pi is the initial fluid pressure in the dual porosity reservoir since the dual porosity formation is bounded or finite in all the directions the boundary conditions are considered as follows 4a p f 0 y t x 0 4b p f l y t x 0 4c p f x 0 t y 0 4d p f x w t y 0 where l and w are the length and width of the dual porosity reservoir 2 3 dimensionless form of the governing equation conversion of a mathematical model to its dimensionless form is considered as a common practice to

ratio natural fracture permeability anisotropy hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir size on the pressure response of a hydraulically fractured vertical well and its derivative in a dual porosity formation are presented and discussed 3 1 identification of flow regimes for identification of the flow regimes involved in the problem under study eqs 10 and 11 are applied to plot the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure in a dual porosity formation pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus the dimensionless time td to use eqs 10 and 11 a reservoir with the dimensionless size of ld 10 wd 10 hd 10 is considered in which the hydraulically fractured vertical production well is located at the center and the dimensionless coordinates of the hydraulic fracture left and right ends and the well are ad 4 5 cd 5 bd 5 5 cd 5 and ad 1 2 5 cd 5 respectively see fig 2 fig 3 demonstrates the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd solid curve and its derivative dpwd dlntd dashed curve versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity reservoir described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 ω 0 01 and kfd 10 fig 3 clearly identifies five flow regimes including early linear flow volumetric depletion of natural fractures natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow during early times the formation fluid flows linearly from the formation to the hydraulically fractured well as a result this regime is called early linear flow which occurs only in high conductivity fractures on cartesian coordinates pwd is a linear function of t d 1 2 in other words a log log plot of pwd versus td has a slope of 1 2 unless the fracture is damaged the pressure derivative plot exhibits a slope of 1 2 therefore the early linear flow is characterized by a straight line with a slope of 1 2 in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td dpwd dlntd t d 1 2 igbokoyi and tiab 2008 mentioned that the duration of the early linear flow regime depends on the storativity ratio interporosity flow coefficient and dimensionless hydraulic fracture height the unit slope line in the log log plots for pwd and dpwd dlntd against td pwd td and dpwd dlntd td after the early linear flow corresponds to the volumetric depletion of natural fractures in this flow regime the fluid storage within the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir is depleted volumetrically as a result this flow regime is also called the natural fracture storage phenomenon this regime has been previously reported by joseph et al 1986 for the volumetric depletion of higher flow capacity layer during pressure transient behavior in a bounded two layered reservoir located in the shengli field of china a shale reservoir resembles a dual porosity system comprised of natural fractures and matrix the well pressure response in dual porosity reservoirs was first described by warren and root 1963 using two dimensionless variables the interporosity flow coefficient λ and the storativity ratio ω the interporosity flow coefficient is a measure of how easily fluid transfers from the matrix to the natural fractures this dimensionless parameter directly depends on the ratio of matrix permeability to natural fracture permeability in the x direction higher values of λ represent higher fluid exchange between the matrix and the natural fractures the latter variable storativity ratio corresponds to the natural fracture fluid capacitance divided by the total natural fracture matrix fluid capacitance the total dual porosity system incorporates the natural fractures and the matrix the warren and root 1963 model results in a typical s shaped curve associated with an inflection point for the pressure response of the well against the time in a semi log plot the value of ω can be calculated using the separation between the two parallel lines as ω 1 or λ the behavior of a dual porosity reservoir approaches that of a single porosity reservoir in the current study the formation is naturally fractured therefore it is expected to observe three traditional flow regimes including natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and total natural fractures and matrix radial flow because of finite acting reservoir only the first two flow regimes are visible and the last one is not seen in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td natural fracture radial flow regime represents the radial flow of fluid through the natural fractures of the dual porosity formation since the pseudo steady state formulation is used for the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures of the dual porosity reservoir transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow is represented by a sharp dip or v shape in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td instead of the total natural fractures and matrix radial flow pseudo steady state flow appears at late times the pseudo steady state flow regime occurs for long producing times due to the pressure being affected by all four boundaries of a bounded reservoir simultaneously this regime is characterized by a straight line with a slope of unity in the log log plots for pwd and dpwd dlntd against td pwd td and dpwd dlntd td 3 2 impact of the interporosity flow coefficient the interporosity flow coefficient eq 5f is a dimensionless parameter which determines the ability of the matrix to flow to the natural fractures and depends on the shape factor the ratio of the matrix permeability to the natural fracture permeability and the square of the hydraulic fracture length in a dual porosity reservoir the interporosity flow coefficient traditionally shows the beginning time of the transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow the speed of responding of the matrix to the pressure depletion is controlled by the interporosity flow coefficient thus the interporosity flow coefficient represents the duration of transition houzé et al 2007 igbokoyi and tiab 2008 used the range of 0 01 λ 100 to investigate about the impact of the partial penetration of an infinite conductivity hydraulic fracture on the pressure transient behavior of a vertical well which is located in a naturally fractured reservoir this range is applied for the interporosity flow coefficient throughout the current study fig 4 illustrates the impact of the interporosity flow coefficient λ on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity formation described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with ω 0 01 and kfd 10 the demonstrated results in fig 4 indicate that by increasing the interporosity flow coefficient the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure decreases the duration of unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened as the interporosity flow coefficient increases however eventually all the dimensionless well pressure curves merge at late times and increase linearly with dimensionless time indicating a bounded or finite formation fig 4 reveals that the duration of the early linear flow is independent from the interporosity flow coefficient in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td the duration of volumetric depletion of natural fractures is prolonged by decreasing the interporosity flow coefficient as the interporosity flow coefficient increases the natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow appear earlier a physical explanation for the earlier occurrence of the last three flow regimes can be given as follows the matrix permeability is higher for a larger interporosity flow coefficient compared to the one for a smaller interporosity flow coefficient therefore the matrix begins to respond to the pressure drop in the natural fractures earlier moreover for a smaller interporosity flow coefficient the generated sharp dip or v shape is shallower in other words the matrix is tighter for a lower interporosity flow coefficient and begins to respond to the pressure drop in the natural fractures later however the generated dip has the same size and shape for all interporosity flow coefficients in addition the duration of the pseudo steady state flow is prolonged by increasing the interporosity flow coefficient since the matrix permeability is higher for a larger interporosity flow coefficient the pressure is influenced by boundaries of the bounded reservoir earlier 3 3 impact of the storativity ratio the storativity ratio eq 5e measures the relative natural fracture storage capacity in a dual porosity reservoir the storativity ratio traditionally determines the depth of the generated dip or v shape during the transition from the natural fracture radial flow to the total natural fractures and matrix radial flow this parameter is usually in the range of 0 01 ω 0 1 dejam et al 2013 which is applied throughout the current study fig 5 demonstrates the impact of the storativity ratio ω on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity formation described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 and kfd 10 fig 5 show that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure decreases as the storativity ratio increases the unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs later for a larger storativity ratio compared to the one for a smaller storativity ratio in addition the duration of the transition between the volumetric depletion of natural fractures and the pseudo steady state flow is shortened by increasing the storativity ratio nevertheless ultimately all the dimensionless well pressure curves merge at late times and increase linearly with dimensionless time representing a finite acting reservoir the results illustrated in fig 5 reveal that the early linear flow can be clearly observed for all storativity ratios in the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td however the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures occur later for a larger storativity ratio compared to the one for a smaller storativity ratio therefore the linear flow from the formation to the hydraulically fractured well is a function of the storativity ratio the same observation has been reported by igbokoyi and tiab 2008 moreover the lower storativity ratio results in earlier natural fracture radial flow and transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and deeper transition nevertheless it is very difficult to distinguish the natural fracture radial flow from the transition for higher values of the storativity ratio in other words the size and shape of the generated dip become smaller and shallower as the storativity ratio increases and finally it becomes flat for ω 0 1 therefore the generated dip does not appear for ω 0 1 in addition the onset time of the pseudo steady state flow remains invariant by changing the storativity ratio 3 4 impact of the natural fracture permeability anisotropy another factor that can influence the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well in a dual porosity formation is the natural fracture permeability anisotropy this parameter is usually larger than unity the range of 1 kfd 1000 is applied for this parameter throughout the current study fig 6 shows the impact of the natural fracture permeability anisotropy kfd on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td in a dual porosity formation described in fig 2 using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 and ω 0 01 the results demonstrated in fig 6 reveal that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure increases as the natural fracture permeability anisotropy increases the unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs earlier by decreasing the anisotropy however finally all the dimensionless well pressure curves merge at late times and increase linearly with dimensionless time due to the finite acting formation from the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td in fig 6 it is concluded that the early linear flow occurs for all anisotropies nevertheless the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller anisotropies the duration of the volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened by increasing the anisotropy this observation can be explained physically as follows based on the definition of the natural fracture permeability anisotropy eq 5d the horizontal natural fracture permeability becomes larger than the vertical natural fracture permeability when the anisotropy increases this implies that the volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs faster as a result the duration of this regime becomes shorter as the anisotropy increases as it is clear from fig 6 the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for kfd 1000 however the anisotropy has no influence on the subsequent flow regimes 3 5 effect of the hydraulically fractured well location to study the effect of the hydraulically fractured well location on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well a dual porosity formation with the dimensionless size of ld 10 wd 10 hd 10 is assumed in which four different cases are considered for the well location see fig 7 the dimensionless coordinates of the hydraulic fracture left and right ends and the well are ad cd bd cd ad 1 2 cd 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 5 2 5 0 75 1 25 1 75 1 25 1 25 1 25 and 0 125 0 625 1 125 0 625 0 625 0 625 for cases 1 to 4 respectively fig 8 shows the effect of the hydraulically fractured well location on the dimensionless well pressure pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 ω 0 01 and kfd 10 the results demonstrated in fig 8 reveal that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure remains unchanged for cases 1 to 3 during the whole time while it decreases for case 4 at early times based on the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td in fig 8 it is worth mentioning that for case 4 where the hydraulically fractured well is located very close to the left formation boundary the early linear flow does not appear and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures is prolonged nevertheless the last three flow regimes are the same for all four cases 3 6 impact of the reservoir size the reservoir size is defined by its dimensionless length ld dimensionless width wd and dimensionless height hd denoted by ld wd hd in order to study the impact of the reservoir size on the dimensionless pressure of a hydraulically fractured well five dual porosity formations with the same shape of square and different dimensionless sizes of ld wd hd 1 1 1 5 5 5 10 10 10 50 50 50 and 100 100 100 are assumed in which the hydraulically fractured vertical production well is located at the center see fig 9 the dimensionless coordinates of the hydraulic fracture left and right ends and the well for each dual porosity formation are ad cd bd cd ad 1 2 cd 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 5 2 5 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 24 5 25 25 5 25 25 25 and 49 5 50 50 5 50 50 50 respectively fig 10 illustrates the impact of the size of the dual porosity formation described in fig 9 on the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure pwd and its derivative dpwd dlntd versus dimensionless time td using eqs 10 and 11 along with λ 10 ω 0 01 and kfd 10 the results illustrated in fig 10 reveals that the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure decreases as the reservoir size increases it is also concluded that all five identified flow regimes differ from a reservoir size to another one however the unit slope line observed in the log log plot for pwd against td due to volumetric depletion of natural fractures occurs later and its duration is shortened by increasing the reservoir size according to the log log plot for dpwd dlntd against td in fig 10 it is found that the early linear flow occurs for all reservoir sizes nevertheless the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller reservoir size compared to the one for a larger reservoir size the duration of the volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened by increasing the reservoir size as it is clear from fig 10 the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for ld wd hd 100 100 100 although the derivative of the dimensionless hydraulically fractured well pressure with respect to the natural logarithm of the dimensionless time dpwd dlntd decreases during the whole time by increasing the reservoir size the onset times of the last three flow regimes remain fixed in addition the generated dip has the same size and shape for all reservoir sizes 4 summary and conclusions a model is derived mathematically to investigate the role of a hydraulic fracturing on the pressure of a vertical well producing from a finite acting dual porosity reservoir to include the effect of the hydraulically fractured vertical production well through the position of the fracture within the reservoir in a two dimensional diffusivity equation the dirac delta function combined with the heaviside step function is used the laplace transform lt and the finite fourier cosine transforms ffct s with respect to horizontal and vertical coordinates are successively used to derive the semi analytical solution of the unsteady state diffusivity equation the developed model can be applied for generation of type curves for well test interpretation or can be applied as a forward model for estimation of reservoir parameters the results identify five flow regimes including early linear flow dpwd dlntd t d 1 2 volumetric depletion of natural fractures pwd td and dpwd dlntd td natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow pwd td and dpwd dlntd td the presented results reveal that the interporosity flow coefficient storativity ratio natural fracture permeability anisotropy and reservoir size play significant roles on the pressure response of a hydraulically fractured vertical well and its derivative in a dual porosity formation compared to the hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir shape by increasing the interporosity flow coefficient the duration of the early linear flow is remained fixed while the duration of volumetric depletion of natural fractures is shortened and the duration of the pseudo steady state flow is prolonged moreover for a smaller interporosity flow coefficient the generated sharp dip or v shape is shallower the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures occur later for a larger storativity ratio compared to the one with a smaller storativity ratio in addition the size and shape of the generated dip become smaller and shallower as the storativity ratio increases and finally it becomes flat for ω 0 1 it is shown that the linear flow from the formation to the hydraulically fractured well is a function of the storativity ratio which agrees with previous studies the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller natural fracture permeability anisotropy moreover the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for kfd 1000 in addition the natural fracture permeability anisotropy has no influence on the subsequent flow regimes the early linear flow and the volumetric depletion of natural fractures appear earlier for a smaller reservoir size compared to the one for a larger reservoir size moreover the natural fracture radial flow occurs immediately after the early linear flow for ld wd hd 100 100 100 although the derivative decreases during the whole period by increasing the reservoir size the onset times of the last subsequent flow regimes remain invariant in addition the generated dip has the same size and shape for all reservoir sizes the developed solution can be used for generation of type curves for well test or pressure transient analysis of a hydraulically fractured vertical well in a bounded dual porosity reservoir it can also be used as a forward model for estimation of different parameters including hydraulic fracture length interporosity flow
