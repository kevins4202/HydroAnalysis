vertical bearing capacity model tests 1 introduction as a kind of subsea shallow foundation mudmats are is widely employed to provide temporary support for jacket structures during installation and permanent support for deep water subsea production infrastructures such as end terminations end manifolds and in line structures for pipelines chen and liu 2018 mudmat foundations are typically fabricated from rectangular steel plates and those subjected to high horizontal loads are commonly designed with skirts perforated mudmats are increasingly common because they facilitate the installation and reduce uplift resistance during the removal the vertical bearing capacity of shallow foundations is traditionally based on conditions of plane strain for an infinitely long strip footing terzaghi 1943 the ultimate vertical bearing capacity q ult of a shallow foundation under undrained conditions is conventionally expressed by 1 q ult n c s u s c i c a where n c is the plane strain bearing capacity factor 2 π s u is the undrained shear strength of the soil s c and i c are modification factors accounting for the foundation shape and load inclination respectively and a is the effective area of the foundation for a rectangular foundation of breadth b and length l the most widely adopted shape factor used to consider the edge effects was proposed by skempton 1951 and is s c 1 2 b l for a circular foundation the shape factor lies between 1 11 and 1 17 for smooth and rough conditions respectively cox et al 1961 for a constant shear strength with depth many previous studies on the q ult of a shallow foundations e g mudmats have been employed by classical lower and upper bound solutions bransby and randolph 1998 lyamin and sloan 2000 michalowski 2001 randolph and puzrin 2003 and finite element analyses feas zhu and michalowski 2005 gourvenec et al 2006 gourvenec 2007 most marine clay soil exhibits a linearly increasing undrained shear strength with depth with a typical gradient k of 1 2 kpa m randolph 2004 published studies kuaskabe et al 1986 gourvenec and randolph 2003 feng et al 2017 have found that the ultimate vertical capacity of a shallow foundation or a mudmat is dependent on the degree of the soil strength heterogeneity and the shape factor decreases as the degree of non homogeneity increases for linearly increasing shear strength with depth under undrained conditions the q ult of a mudmat can be expressed by api 2014 2 q ult f s u m n c k b 4 k c a where f is the correction factor given as a function of k b s um s um is the undrained shear strength of soil at the foundation base level b is the minimum effective lateral foundation dimension and k c is the correction factor that accounts for the load inclination footing shape embedment depth base inclination and seafloor surface inclination recently the bearing capacity of perforated mudmats has received more attention several experimental studies white et al 2005 tapper et al 2015 demonstrated that perforations reduce the capacity of a mudmat during operation due to the smaller foundation bearing area available liu et al 2019 also found from fea that increasing the perforation ratio reduces the bearing capacity and that the degree of reduction increases with increasing dimensionless ratio kb s um unfortunately the impact of perforations is not provided in the current design guidelines api 2014 dnv 2013 this work presents a solution to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat based on an upper bound solution of the classical plasticity theory including the impact of soil strength heterogeneity and perforations moreover a series of small scale model tests and two centrifuge model tests were conducted to investigate the impact of loading rate perforation ratio r perforation number and perforation shape on the vertical bearing capacity the results predicted by the proposed solution agree well with the test results and this study could provide an effective solution for mudmat design 2 upper bound solution for the vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat foundation 2 1 soil kinematic mechanisms at failure the upper bound solution of limit analysis theory has been widely used for solving foundation bearing capacity problems chen 1975 randolph and houlsby 1984 kuaskabe et al 1986 soubra 1999 martin and randolph 2006 we adopted the upper bound solution to analyse the bearing capacity of a rectangular mudmat on clay under undrained conditions the clay soil can be treated as a frictionless material obeying the tresca yield criterion the soil failure mechanisms must be assumed in the upper bound solution of limit analysis thus feas were performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 3 abaqus 2014 two dimensional 2d analyses on the total soil displacement field of strip footings were carried out to determine the kinematic failure mechanisms 2 1 1 finite element model a skirted stripe or perforated stripe footing of width b rested on the surface of clay soil as shown in fig 1 the soil mesh extended a distance of 3 5b from the centre of the footing and 5b beneath the footing zero displacement boundary conditions were imposed over the bottom boundary the lateral displacements were restrained along the lateral boundary various mesh densities were studied to achieve time efficient models that do not compromise accuracy the final minimum and maximum sizes were 0 05b and 0 5b respectively the soil was modelled as an isotropic linear elastic perfectly plastic material obeying a tresca yield criterion the undrained shear strength s u fig 4 was assumed to increase linearly with depth z according to 3 s u s u m k z where s um is the shear strength at the mudline k is the shear strength gradient and z is the soil depth the soil in the model experiments was normally consolidated kaolin clay the soil properties in the fea models were identical to the soil parameters in the experiments table 1 the values of s um and k were taken as 13 kpa and 2 kpa m respectively reflecting the undrained shear strength profile used in centrifuge experiments fig 15 a constant rigidity index of e s u where e is the elastic modulus of 150 was adopted which is typical for kaolin clay tho et al 2013 and a submerged unit weight of 6 kn m3 and a poisson s ratio of 0 49 were adopted for the clay the footing was modelled as a discrete rigid body resting on the surface of the soil the footing soil interface was simulated by surface to surface contact pairs the contact surface modelled a rough interface with no slip and no separation plane strain analyses were carried out to investigate the kinematic failure mechanisms under uniaxial vertical loading the footing was subjected to controlled displacements at the reference point which was taken as the midpoint of the footing base 2 1 2 soil failure mechanism fig 2 presents the total displacement field at failure of the skirted stripe and perforated stripe footings obtained from the 2d feas the soil inside the skirt is within the skirt constraints fig 2 a and can be integrated as part of the foundation figs 4 and 7 illustrate the two assumed mechanisms for skirted and perforated stripe footings respectively the failure mechanisms obtained from the feas and the assumptions in figs 4 and 7 are arranged side by side in fig 3 for ease of comparison a typical prandtl type mechanism is observed in fig 3 a the soil comprises three different regions such as wedge amc downwards as a rigid zone a 90 slip fan zone mch and a passive zone including passive zone i mhf and passive zone ii mkf the angles cmh and mhf are 90 and the angle cma is 45 an approximated hill type mechanism is observed in fig 3 b a double wedge rigid zone occurs beneath the footing the angles bde egf and fhi are 90 and the angles dbe gef and hfi are 45 2 2 vertical bearing capacity of a solid mudmat foundation most mudmat foundations are typically rectangular in plan view and are usually designed with skirts a kinematically admissible velocity field was assumed in the upper bound solution to solve the ultimate bearing capacity of a mudmat foundation under a vertical load v the effect of the self weight of soil is included in the following upper bound calculations 2 2 1 velocity field according to the soil failure mechanisms shown in fig 2 a and 3 a the assumed velocity and hodograph of the failure mechanism are shown in fig 4 the mudmat foundation has a width of b a skirt length of d and a length of l dl is the differential length the undrained shear strength s u was assumed to increase linearly with depth z according to eq 3 2 2 2 ultimate vertical bearing capacity 1 geometric relationships the geometric relationships in fig 4 are given as

dissipation internal energy dissipation occurs along the velocity discontinuity surface as shown in fig 4 the mode of deformation is simple or pure shear with a high shear strain rate in the layer of tresca material and the rate of energy dissipation in the narrow layer is independent of the thickness of t the rate of energy dissipation d along the discontinuity surface is found by multiplying the length of this discontinuity by the soil undrained shear strength s u times the discontinuity in velocity across the surface chen 1975 the total rate of energy dissipation is as follows 7 d d a c d m

in addition to the internal energy dissipation along the velocity discontinuity surface the effect of the self weight of the soil is also included in the upper bound calculations the rate at which work is done by the soil is found by multiplying the area of each zone by the soil unit weight γ times the vertical component of the velocity of each zone chen 1975 the rate of work done in zone gacmk

capacity of a perforated mudmat foundation 2 3 1 velocity field because the impact of perforations is not included in the current design guidelines api 2014 dnv 2013 an upper bound solution based on limit analysis was presented to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of a perforated mudmat the width of the foundation was divided into three parts as shown in fig 7 b 0 refers to the width of the foundation b refers to the effective width defined as the width of the footings between the perforation and s refers to the perforation width the published researches white et al 2005 liu et al 2019 found the perforations reduce the vertical bearing capacity in proportion to the perforated area in this work the perforation area of the mudmat was simplified as a single perforation fig 7 which represents a simplification of 3d geometries to examine the general effect of the perforations r refers to the perforation ratio which is equal to the ratio of the total perforation area to the total foundation area 18 b 0 2 b s s b 0 r according to the soil failure mechanisms shown in fig 2 b and 3 b the assumed velocity and hodograph of the failure mechanism are shown in fig 7 the admissible velocity field becomes a hill mechanism when the perforation ratio r is zero the undrained shear strength s u fig 7 was assumed to increase linearly with depth z according to eq 7 2 3 2

rate of energy dissipation the effect of the self weight of the soil is not included in the upper bound calculations the external rate of work done by the vertical load v u p is v u p v 0 and the ultimate vertical capacity v p can be obtained as follows 28 v u p v 0 2 d 0 substituting the total rate of energy dissipation d eq 27 into the equilibrium eq 28 the ultimate vertical capacity v p can be expressed as follows 29 v u p 1 4 l b 0 4 s u m 2 π 1 r k b 0 1 r 2 where l is the length of the foundation b 0 is the width of the foundation and r is the perforation ratio 0 r 1 2 3 3 bearing capacity factor n c p the upper bound solution eq 29 is presented for perforated stripe footings under plane strain conditions the bearing capacity factor n c stripe can be expressed by 30 n c stripe 2 π 1 r k b 0 4 s u m 1 r 2 in practice the mudmat foundations usually have square or circular geometry for square or circular mudmats with a single central perforation the corresponding bearing capacity factor n c p should be corrected with a shape factor s c n c p n c stripe s c the ultimate bearing capacity of a perforated mudmat is q u p n c p a t s um where a t is the total area ignoring the perforation i e a t b 0 2 or πb 0 2 4 31 n c p n c stripe s c for square and circular footings resting on homogeneous undrained clay the effect of shape factors has been widely investigated the exact solution of a rough circular footing is s c 1 18 cox et al 1961 due to no exact solution existing for a square footing a value of s c 1 15 for a rough square footing obtained by finite element analysis gourvenec et al 2006 is widely accepted although the shape factors s c 1 15 square or 1 18 circular are appropriate for the rough footing resting on homogeneous clay however in this study the perforated mudmats rest on non homogeneous clay where the strength increases with depth the effect of the shape factors s c is examined by the finite element analysis method liu et al 2019 adopted 3d finite element analysis to obtain the bearing capacity factors n c p for rough square mudmats with a single circular or quadrate perforation in order to obtain n c p for circular mudmats with a single circular perforation the axial symmetry finite element models were established the parameters and details of fea models were developed by liu et al 2019 and not repeated here the bearing capacity factors n c p for perforated square or circular mudmats obtained by the fea method are shown in fig 8 it is found that the shape factors s c expressed by the following linear formula eq 32 could agree well with the finite element results 32 n c p n c stripe s c s c 1 15 0 05 k b 0 s u m square s c 1 18 0 05 k b 0 s u m circular it indicates the dimensionless ratio of kb 0 s um has a certain influence on the shape factors s c the perforation shape has little influence on the bearing capacity factor relative to the perforation ratio r in view of this although the perforation area is simplified as a single perforation eq 32 could be used to examine the general effect of the perforations 3 model test 3 1 soil sample the internal size of the model container was 0 5 m length 0 5 m width 0 8 m height the soil in the model experiment was fine china kaolin clay the physical properties of the kaolin clay are listed in table 1 dry kaolin powder was mixed with water in a vacuum mixer to obtain slurry at a water content of 2 times its liquid limit saturated sand was placed into the base of the container and the slurry was poured on top of the sand the soil sample was loaded by a loading plate connected to a pneumatic jack and the consolidation process was achieved through surcharge loading the settlement displacement of the soil sample was monitored by a dial gauge and the subsequent loadings were applied until the settlement displacement remained stable this process formed a thin stiff layer of clay at the top of the soil after consolidation and the top 10 cm of soil was removed a micro vane shear test was employed to measure the clay strength profile to ensure the same soil strength for various model tests the soil was removed from the container after each test the same consolidation steps were employed to prepare for the next model test 3 2 experimental setup 3 2 1 test loading and measurement the model mudmat was loaded by a motor controlled loading device which was composed of the model container the reaction beam the servo motor and the control system the system can be load controlled maximum load of 600 n or displacement controlled maximum displacement of 150 mm square model mudmats were fabricated from aluminium alloy with external dimensions of 10 cm length 10 cm width 1 1 cm height in order to reduce the variables in the tests and make a comparison with the perforated mudmat the model mudmats were all fabricated without skirts four loading rods were placed around the model mudmat fig 9 each model mudmat was installed vertically by these four rods connected to a loading plate to ensure that the mudmat was not subjected to an eccentric load the model mudmat was vertically loaded at a constant velocity of 1 mm s by the loading device and the loading distance was 40 mm a depth of 0 4 times the foundation width for each experiment the vertical displacement of the mudmat was measured by the displacement sensor with a range of 0 80 mm and a resolution of 0 08 mm a load cell with a range of 0 500 n and a resolution of 0 5 n was placed between the loading rod and loading plate to measure the vertical loading the acquisition frequency of the tests was 10 hz 3 2 2 test arrangement to investigate the impact of loading rates on the vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat four model tests on solid mudmats were performed under various loading rates as listed in table 2 table 3 presents the undrained shear strength s u measured by the micro vane shear test for four model tests test v1 v4 to investigate the impact of perforation ratio r perforation number n p and perforation shape on the vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat twelve model tests of perforated mudmats were performed as shown in fig 10 the test arrangements are listed in table 4 the undrained soil shear strengths measured by the micro vane shear tests were all approximately 2 kpa for various tests 3 3 test results 3 3 1 solid mudmat the vertical load settlement curves with four loading rate tests are shown in fig 11 in this study the vertical load corresponding to a settlement of 0 1b 0 where b 0 is the foundation width was determined as the ultimate bearing capacity as shown in fig 11 the bearing capacity factors n c are predicted by using the proposed upper bound method which is compared with the measured results as presented in fig 12 the loading rates have no significant effect on the ultimate bearing capacity the results predicted by the proposed method is similar to the test results 3 3 2 perforated mudmat the vertical load settlement curves of twelve perforated mudmat tests are shown in fig 13 the ultimate bearing capacity was also determined as the vertical load corresponding to a settlement of 0 1b 0 the ultimate bearing capacities are predicted by using the proposed upper bound method eq 32 which is compared with the measured results as presented in table 5 fig 14 shows the relationship between the bearing capacity factor n c p which equals q u p a t s um where a t is the gross mudmat area and perforation ratio r the value of n c p decreases with increasing perforation ratio r the perforation number n p and perforation shape have little influence on n c p at the same perforation ratio r this indicates that the available foundation bearing area mainly controls the value of q u p thus it is reasonable that the perforation area of a mudmat is simplified as a single perforation in the proposed upper bound method the discrepancy in n c p between the test values and proposed method results is generally less than 20 except the discrepancies for tests p2 and p12 especially for the test p12 the test value is obviously larger than the value of n c p predicted by the upper bound method it may be attributed to the large perforation ratio r of test 12 where r is 0 7 and the effective foundation width is only 0 3b 0 the ultimate bearing capacity of test p12 is probably better determined as the vertical load corresponding to a more shallow settlement not 0 1b 0 4 centrifuge model test the present centrifuge model tests were carried out by using the centrifuge lxj 4 450 at the china institute of water resources and hydropower fig 15 its maximum capacity is 450 g t with an effective arm radius of 5 03 m and a maximum acceleration of 300 g an acceleration of 100 g was adopted in this study the scaling laws between the centrifuge model and the prototype are derived from the dimensional analysis by schofield 1980 and garnier et al 2007 and provided in table 6 n is the ratio of centrifugal acceleration to gravity 4 1 soil sample the internal size of the centrifuge model container was 0 6 m length 0 6 m width 0 7 m height the soil in the centrifuge experiment was also fine china kaolin clay and the physical properties of the soil are listed in table 1 dry kaolin powder was mixed with water in a vacuum mixer to obtain slurry at a water content of 2 times its liquid limit saturated sand was placed into the base of the container and the slurry was poured on top of the sand the consolidation process of the soil is the same as that used in the previous model tests at 1 g the water level was maintained at 20 mm above the mudline after the soil consolidation at 1 g according to previous experimental experience the soil sample will settle slightly during the centrifuge reconsolidation process the soil sample was transferred to the centrifuge and consolidated at 100 g for 3 h the soil surface settlement was measured by laser displacement and the final stabilized depth of the soil sample was approximately 40 cm after centrifugal consolidation a micro vane shear test was employed to measure the soil undrained strength profile at 1 g fig 16 shows the measured undrained shear strength profiles of two parallel centrifugal experiments test s1 and test s2 4 2 test loading and measurement two parallel centrifugal experiments tests s1 and s2 were conducted at 100 g square model mudmats were fabricated from aluminium alloy with external dimensions of 100 mm length 100 mm width 11 mm height as shown in fig 17 four loading rods were placed around the model mudmat fig 18 each model mudmat was installed vertically by these four rods connected to a loading plate to ensure that the mudmat was not subjected to an eccentric load three circular holes were made in the mudmat to install the pore pressure transducers ppts three small pieces of filter paper were placed on the bottom of the three holes to prevent blockage of the ppts fig 17 the mudmat was vertically jacked into the soil by the loading actuator at 100 g and a constant velocity of 1 mm s the loading actuator was controlled by a servo controlled loading system with two hydraulic servo valves the two independent hydraulic servo valves controlled the actuator in displacement mode maximum displacement of 400 mm with feedback signals the vertical load of the mudmat was measured by a load cell with a range of 0 3 kn and a resolution of 3 n the vertical displacement of the mudmat was measured by a laser displacement sensor with a range of 0 80 mm and a resolution of 0 08 mm the pore pressure transducers were not activated in these two parallel centrifugal experiments the aim of the installation of the ppts was to fill the holes to ensure that the available foundation bearing area remained constant these ppts will be activated during the subsequent uplift tests to monitor the negative pore pressure at the mudmat soil interface which is not discussed here data from the load cell and the laser displacement sensor were transferred to the data acquisition system through the junction boxes and electrical slip rings the acquisition frequency of the tests was 10 hz 4 3 test results two parallel centrifugal model tests were conducted to guarantee the accuracy of the results these two tests were performed under the same test conditions with the exception of the soil undrained strength profile fig 16 a mudmat was jacked vertically into the soil at a constant velocity of 1 mm s after consolidation of the soil sample at 100 g as shown in fig 19 obvious soil backflow during installation of the mudmat at 100 g fig 20 a was observed while a vertical soil wall formed during installation of the mudmat at 1 g fig 20 b the stress dependent behaviour of the soil was unable to be simulated at 1 g in the model tests because the on site stress cannot be reproduced therefore it is essential to perform centrifugal model tests to simulate the prototype soil stress level the vertical load settlement curves of two centrifugal model tests are shown in fig 21 the ultimate bearing capacity was determined using the break point method mosallanezhad et al 2008 in the break point method the load corresponding to the inflection point between the initial and later portions of the load displacement curve is taken as the ultimate bearing capacity as presented in table 7 the soil undrained shear strengths in the two parallel tests increased approximately linearly with depth z and were assumed to be as follows s u s um kz fig 17 in test s1 s um 13 kpa and k 2 08 kpa m in test s2 s um 13 kpa and k 1 67 kpa m the ultimate bearing capacities predicted by using the proposed upper bound method and api method are also presented in table 7 since the two parallel tests were performed under the same test conditions these two test results are comparable the ultimate bearing capacity q u of test s1 is slightly higher than that of test s2 due to the higher shear strength gradient k clearly the q u predicted by the upper bound method is larger than the api mehtod which may be attributable to the effect of the self weight of the soil in the upper bound calculations moreover the discrepancy between the test results and proposed upper bound method results is is approximate to 7 which further proves the applicability of this proposed method 5 conclusions an upper bound method was proposed to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of solid or perforated mudmats a series of model tests at 1 g and two centrifugal model tests at 100 g were performed to investigate the impact of loading rate perforation ratio r perforation number n p and perforation shape on vertical bearing capacity the results predicted by the upper bound method were in good agreement with the test results the following conclusions were drawn 1 an upper bound method was presented for clay to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of a solid or perforated mudmat the bearing capacity of perforated mudmats is corrected with the shape factors 2 the test results show that the loading rates had little influence on the bearing capacity factor the value of n c p decreased with increasing perforation ratio r while the perforation number n p and perforation shape only slightly affected n c p for the same perforation ratio r 3 it was reasonable to simplify the perforation area of a mudmat as a single perforation in the upper bound method because the available foundation bearing area had the greatest effect on n c the upper bound method results and centrifugal test results are in good agreement which proves the applicability of this proposed method credit authorship contribution statement run liu conceptualization methodology software

strain bearing capacity factor 2 π s u is the undrained shear strength of the soil s c and i c are modification factors accounting for the foundation shape and load inclination respectively and a is the effective area of the foundation for a rectangular foundation of breadth b and length l the most widely adopted shape factor used to consider the edge effects was proposed by skempton 1951 and is s c 1 2 b l for a circular foundation the shape factor lies between 1 11 and 1 17 for smooth and rough conditions respectively cox et al 1961 for a constant shear strength with depth many previous studies on the q ult of a shallow foundations e g mudmats have been employed by classical lower and upper bound solutions bransby and randolph 1998 lyamin and sloan 2000 michalowski 2001 randolph and puzrin 2003 and finite element analyses feas zhu and michalowski 2005 gourvenec et al 2006 gourvenec 2007 most marine clay soil exhibits a linearly increasing undrained shear strength with depth with a typical gradient k of 1 2 kpa m randolph 2004 published studies kuaskabe et al 1986 gourvenec and randolph 2003 feng et al 2017 have found that the ultimate vertical capacity of a shallow foundation or a mudmat is dependent on the degree of the soil strength heterogeneity and the shape factor decreases as the degree of non homogeneity increases for linearly increasing shear strength with depth under undrained conditions the q ult of a mudmat can be expressed by api 2014 2 q ult f s u m n c k b 4 k c a where f is the correction factor given as a function of k b s um s um is the undrained shear strength of soil at the foundation base level b is the minimum effective lateral foundation dimension and k c is the correction factor that accounts for the load inclination footing shape embedment depth base inclination and seafloor surface inclination recently the bearing capacity of perforated mudmats has received more attention several experimental studies white et al 2005 tapper et al 2015 demonstrated that perforations reduce the capacity of a mudmat during operation due to the smaller foundation bearing area available liu et al 2019 also found from fea that increasing the perforation ratio reduces the bearing capacity and that the degree of reduction increases with increasing dimensionless ratio kb s um unfortunately the impact of perforations is not provided in the current design guidelines api 2014 dnv 2013 this work presents a solution to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat based on an upper bound solution of the classical plasticity theory including the impact of soil strength heterogeneity and perforations moreover a series of small scale model tests and two centrifuge model tests were conducted to investigate the impact of loading rate perforation ratio r perforation number and perforation shape on the vertical bearing capacity the results predicted by the proposed solution agree well with the test results and this study could provide an effective solution for mudmat design 2 upper bound solution for the vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat foundation 2 1 soil kinematic mechanisms at failure the upper bound solution of limit analysis theory has been widely used for solving foundation bearing capacity problems chen 1975 randolph and houlsby 1984 kuaskabe et al 1986 soubra 1999 martin and randolph 2006 we adopted the upper bound solution to analyse the bearing capacity of a rectangular mudmat on clay under undrained conditions the clay soil can be treated as a frictionless material obeying the tresca yield criterion the soil failure mechanisms must be assumed in the upper bound solution of limit analysis thus feas were performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 3 abaqus 2014 two dimensional 2d analyses on the total soil displacement field of strip footings were carried out to determine the kinematic failure mechanisms 2 1 1 finite element model a skirted stripe or perforated stripe footing of width b rested on the surface of clay soil as shown in fig 1 the soil mesh extended a distance of 3 5b from the centre of the footing and 5b beneath the footing zero displacement boundary conditions were imposed over the bottom boundary the lateral displacements were restrained along the lateral boundary various mesh densities were studied to achieve time efficient models that do not compromise accuracy the final minimum and maximum sizes were 0 05b and 0 5b respectively the soil was modelled as an isotropic linear elastic perfectly plastic material obeying a tresca yield criterion the undrained shear strength s u fig 4 was assumed to increase linearly with depth z according to 3 s u s u m k z where s um is the shear strength at the mudline k is the shear strength gradient and z is the soil depth the soil in the model experiments was normally consolidated kaolin clay the soil properties in the fea models were identical to the soil parameters in the experiments table 1 the values of s um and k were taken as 13 kpa and 2 kpa m respectively reflecting the undrained shear strength profile used in centrifuge experiments fig 15 a constant rigidity index of e s u where e is the elastic modulus of 150 was adopted which is typical for kaolin clay tho et al 2013 and a submerged unit weight of 6 kn m3 and a poisson s ratio of 0 49 were adopted for the clay the footing was modelled as a discrete rigid body resting on the surface of the soil the footing soil interface was simulated by surface to surface contact pairs the contact surface modelled a rough interface with no slip and no separation plane strain analyses were carried out to investigate the kinematic failure mechanisms under uniaxial vertical loading the footing was subjected to controlled displacements at the reference point which was taken as the midpoint of the footing base 2 1 2 soil failure mechanism fig 2 presents the total displacement field at failure of the skirted stripe and perforated stripe footings obtained from the 2d feas the soil inside the skirt is within the skirt constraints fig 2 a and can be integrated as part of the foundation figs 4 and 7 illustrate the two assumed mechanisms for skirted and perforated stripe footings respectively the failure mechanisms obtained from the feas and the assumptions in figs 4 and 7 are arranged side by side in fig 3 for ease of comparison a typical prandtl type mechanism is observed in fig 3 a the soil comprises three different regions such as wedge amc downwards as a rigid zone a 90 slip fan zone mch and a passive zone including passive zone i mhf and passive zone ii mkf the angles cmh and mhf are 90 and the angle cma is 45 an approximated hill type mechanism is observed in fig 3 b a double wedge rigid zone occurs beneath the footing the angles bde egf and fhi are 90 and the angles dbe gef and hfi are 45 2 2 vertical bearing capacity of a solid mudmat foundation most mudmat foundations are typically rectangular in plan view and are usually designed with skirts a kinematically admissible velocity field was assumed in the upper bound solution to solve the ultimate bearing capacity of a mudmat foundation under a vertical load v the effect of the self weight of soil is included in the following upper bound calculations 2 2 1 velocity field according to the soil failure mechanisms shown in fig 2 a and 3 a the assumed velocity and hodograph of the failure mechanism are shown in fig 4 the mudmat foundation has a width of b a skirt length of d and a length of l dl is the differential length the undrained shear strength s u was assumed to increase linearly with depth z according to eq 3 2 2 2 ultimate vertical bearing capacity 1 geometric relationships the geometric relationships in fig 4 are given as

dissipation internal energy dissipation occurs along the velocity discontinuity surface as shown in fig 4 the mode of deformation is simple or pure shear with a high shear strain rate in the layer of tresca material and the rate of energy dissipation in the narrow layer is independent of the thickness of t the rate of energy dissipation d along the discontinuity surface is found by multiplying the length of this discontinuity by the soil undrained shear strength s u times the discontinuity in velocity across the surface chen 1975 the total rate of energy dissipation is as follows 7 d d a c d m

in addition to the internal energy dissipation along the velocity discontinuity surface the effect of the self weight of the soil is also included in the upper bound calculations the rate at which

capacity of a perforated mudmat foundation 2 3 1 velocity field because the impact of perforations is not included in the current design guidelines api 2014 dnv 2013 an upper bound solution based on limit analysis was presented to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of a perforated mudmat the width of the foundation was divided into three parts as shown in fig 7 b 0 refers to the width of the foundation b refers to the effective width defined as the width of the footings between the perforation and s refers to the perforation width the published researches white et al 2005 liu et al 2019 found the perforations reduce the vertical bearing capacity in proportion to the perforated area in this work the perforation area of the mudmat was simplified as a single perforation fig 7 which represents a simplification of 3d geometries to examine the general effect of the perforations r refers to the perforation ratio which is equal to the ratio of the total perforation area to the total foundation area 18 b 0 2 b s s b 0 r according to the soil failure mechanisms shown in fig 2 b and 3 b the assumed velocity and hodograph of the failure mechanism are shown in fig 7 the

ultimate vertical capacity v p can be obtained as follows 28 v u p v 0 2 d 0 substituting the total rate of energy dissipation d eq 27 into the equilibrium eq 28 the ultimate vertical capacity v p can be expressed as follows 29 v u p 1 4 l b 0 4 s u m 2 π 1 r k b 0 1 r 2 where l is the length of the foundation b 0 is the width of the foundation and r is the perforation ratio 0 r 1 2 3 3 bearing

2 π 1 r k b 0 4 s u m 1 r 2 in practice the mudmat foundations usually have square or circular geometry for square or circular mudmats with a single central perforation the corresponding bearing capacity factor n c p should be corrected with a shape factor s c n c p n c stripe s c the ultimate bearing capacity of a perforated mudmat is q u p n c p a t s um where a t is the total area ignoring the perforation i e a t b 0 2 or πb 0 2 4 31 n c p n c stripe s c for square and circular footings resting on homogeneous undrained clay the effect of shape factors has been widely investigated the exact solution of a rough circular footing is s c 1 18 cox et al 1961 due to no exact solution existing for a square footing a value of s c 1 15 for a rough square footing obtained by finite element analysis gourvenec et al 2006 is widely accepted although the shape factors s c 1 15 square or 1 18 circular are appropriate for the rough footing resting on homogeneous clay however in this study the perforated mudmats rest on non homogeneous clay where the strength increases with depth the effect of the shape factors s c is examined by the finite element analysis method liu et al 2019 adopted 3d finite element analysis to obtain the bearing capacity factors n c p for rough square mudmats with a single circular or quadrate perforation in order to obtain n c p for circular mudmats with a single circular perforation the axial symmetry finite element models were established the parameters and details of fea models were developed by liu et al 2019 and not repeated here the bearing capacity factors n c p for perforated square or circular mudmats obtained by the fea method are shown in fig 8 it is found that the shape factors s c expressed by the following linear formula eq 32 could agree well with the finite element results 32 n c p n c stripe s c s c 1 15 0 05 k b 0 s u m square s c 1 18 0 05 k b 0 s u m circular it indicates the dimensionless ratio of kb 0 s um has a certain influence on the shape factors s c the perforation shape has little influence on the bearing capacity factor relative to the perforation ratio r in view of this although the perforation area is simplified as a single perforation eq 32 could be used to examine the general effect of the perforations 3 model test 3 1 soil sample the internal size of the model container was 0 5 m length 0 5 m width 0 8 m height the soil in the model experiment was fine china kaolin clay the physical properties of the kaolin clay are listed in table 1 dry kaolin powder was mixed with water in a vacuum mixer to obtain slurry at a water content of 2 times its liquid limit saturated sand was placed into the base of the container and the slurry was poured on top of the sand the soil sample was loaded by a loading plate connected to a pneumatic jack and the consolidation process was achieved through surcharge loading the settlement displacement of the soil sample was monitored by a dial gauge and the subsequent loadings were applied until the settlement displacement remained stable this process formed a thin stiff layer of clay at the top of the soil after consolidation and the top 10 cm of soil was removed a micro vane shear test was employed to measure the clay strength profile to ensure the same soil strength for various model tests the soil was removed from the container after each test the same consolidation steps were employed to prepare for the next model test 3 2 experimental setup 3 2 1 test loading and measurement the model mudmat was loaded by a motor controlled loading device which was composed of the model container the reaction beam the servo motor and the control system the system can be load controlled maximum load of 600 n or displacement controlled maximum displacement of 150 mm square model mudmats were fabricated from aluminium alloy with external dimensions of 10 cm length 10 cm width 1 1 cm height in order to reduce the variables in the tests and make a comparison with the perforated mudmat the model mudmats were all fabricated without skirts four loading rods were placed around the model mudmat fig 9 each model mudmat was installed vertically by these four rods connected to a loading plate to ensure that the mudmat was not subjected to an eccentric load the model mudmat was vertically loaded at a constant velocity of 1 mm s by the loading device and the loading distance was 40 mm a depth of 0 4 times the foundation width for each experiment the vertical displacement of the mudmat was measured by the displacement sensor with a range of 0 80 mm and a resolution of 0 08 mm a load cell with a range of 0 500 n and a resolution of 0 5 n was placed between the loading rod and loading plate to measure the vertical loading the acquisition frequency of the tests was 10 hz 3 2 2 test arrangement to investigate the impact of loading rates on the vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat four model tests on solid mudmats were performed under various loading rates as listed in table 2 table 3 presents the undrained shear strength s u measured by the micro vane shear test for four model tests test v1 v4 to investigate the impact of perforation ratio r perforation number n p and perforation shape on the vertical bearing capacity of a mudmat twelve model tests of perforated mudmats were performed as shown in fig 10 the test arrangements are listed in table 4 the undrained soil shear strengths measured by the micro vane shear tests were all approximately 2 kpa for various tests 3 3 test results 3 3 1 solid mudmat the vertical load settlement curves with four loading rate tests are shown in fig 11 in this study the vertical load corresponding to a settlement of 0 1b 0 where b 0 is the foundation width was determined as the ultimate bearing capacity as shown in fig 11 the bearing capacity factors n c are predicted by using the proposed upper bound method which is compared with the measured results as presented in fig 12 the loading rates have no significant effect on the ultimate bearing capacity the results predicted by the proposed method is similar to the test results 3 3 2 perforated mudmat the vertical load settlement curves of twelve perforated mudmat tests are shown in fig 13 the ultimate bearing capacity was also determined as the vertical load corresponding to a settlement of 0 1b 0 the ultimate bearing capacities are predicted by using the proposed upper bound method eq 32 which is compared with the measured results as presented in table 5 fig 14 shows the relationship between the bearing capacity factor n c p which equals q u p a t s um where a t is the gross mudmat area and perforation ratio r the value of n c p decreases with increasing perforation ratio r the perforation number n p and perforation shape have little influence on n c p at the same perforation ratio r this indicates that the available foundation bearing area mainly controls the value of q u p thus it is reasonable that the perforation area of a mudmat is simplified as a single perforation in the proposed upper bound method the discrepancy in n c p between the test values and proposed method results is generally less than 20 except the discrepancies for tests p2 and p12 especially for the test p12 the test value is obviously larger than the value of n c p predicted by the upper bound method it may be attributed to the large perforation ratio r of test 12 where r is 0 7 and the effective foundation width is only 0 3b 0 the ultimate bearing capacity of test p12 is probably better determined as the vertical load corresponding to a more shallow settlement not 0 1b 0 4 centrifuge model test the present centrifuge model tests were carried out by using the centrifuge lxj 4 450 at the china institute of water resources and hydropower fig 15 its maximum capacity is 450 g t with an effective arm radius of 5 03 m and a maximum acceleration of 300 g an acceleration of 100 g was adopted in this study the scaling laws between the centrifuge model and the prototype are derived from the dimensional analysis by schofield 1980 and garnier et al 2007 and provided in table 6 n is the ratio of centrifugal acceleration to gravity 4 1 soil sample the internal size of the centrifuge model container was 0 6 m length 0 6 m width 0 7 m height the soil in the centrifuge experiment was also fine china kaolin clay and the physical properties of the soil are listed in table 1 dry kaolin powder was mixed with water in a vacuum mixer to obtain slurry at a water content of 2 times its liquid limit saturated sand was placed into the base of the container and the slurry was poured on top of the sand the consolidation process of the soil is the same as that used in the previous model tests at 1 g the water level was maintained at 20 mm above the mudline after the soil consolidation at 1 g according to previous experimental experience the soil sample will settle slightly during the centrifuge reconsolidation process the soil sample was transferred to the centrifuge and consolidated at 100 g for 3 h the soil surface settlement was measured by laser displacement and the final stabilized depth of the soil sample was approximately 40 cm after centrifugal consolidation a micro vane shear test was employed to measure the soil undrained strength profile at 1 g fig 16 shows the measured undrained shear strength profiles of two parallel centrifugal experiments test s1 and test s2 4 2 test loading and measurement two parallel centrifugal experiments tests s1 and s2 were conducted at 100 g square model mudmats were fabricated from aluminium alloy with external dimensions of 100 mm length 100 mm width 11 mm height as shown in fig 17 four loading rods were placed around the model mudmat fig 18 each model mudmat was installed vertically by these four rods connected to a loading plate to ensure that the mudmat was not subjected to an eccentric load three circular holes were made in the mudmat to install the pore pressure transducers ppts three small pieces of filter paper were placed on the bottom of the three holes to prevent blockage of the ppts fig 17 the mudmat was vertically jacked into the soil by the loading actuator at 100 g and a constant velocity of 1 mm s the loading actuator was controlled by a servo controlled loading system with two hydraulic servo valves the two independent hydraulic servo valves controlled the actuator in displacement mode maximum displacement of 400 mm with feedback signals the vertical load of the mudmat was measured by a load cell with a range of 0 3 kn and a resolution of 3 n the vertical displacement of the mudmat was measured by a laser displacement sensor with a range of 0 80 mm and a resolution of 0 08 mm the pore pressure transducers were not activated in these two parallel centrifugal experiments the aim of the installation of the ppts was to fill the holes to ensure that the available foundation bearing area remained constant these ppts will be activated during the subsequent uplift tests to monitor the negative pore pressure at the mudmat soil interface which is not discussed here data from the load cell and the laser displacement sensor were transferred to the data acquisition system through the junction boxes and electrical slip rings the acquisition frequency of the tests was 10 hz 4 3 test results two parallel centrifugal model tests were conducted to guarantee the accuracy of the results these two tests were performed under the same test conditions with the exception of the soil undrained strength profile fig 16 a mudmat was jacked vertically into the soil at a constant velocity of 1 mm s after consolidation of the soil sample at 100 g as shown in fig 19 obvious soil backflow during installation of the mudmat at 100 g fig 20 a was observed while a vertical soil wall formed during installation of the mudmat at 1 g fig 20 b the stress dependent behaviour of the soil was unable to be simulated at 1 g in the model tests because the on site stress cannot be reproduced therefore it is essential to perform centrifugal model tests to simulate the prototype soil stress level the vertical load settlement curves of two centrifugal model tests are shown in fig 21 the ultimate bearing capacity was determined using the break point method mosallanezhad et al 2008 in the break point method the load corresponding to the inflection point between the initial and later portions of the load displacement curve is taken as the ultimate bearing capacity as presented in table 7 the soil undrained shear strengths in the two parallel tests increased approximately linearly with depth z and were assumed to be as follows s u s um kz fig 17 in test s1 s um 13 kpa and k 2 08 kpa m in test s2 s um 13 kpa and k 1 67 kpa m the ultimate bearing capacities predicted by using the proposed upper bound method and api method are also presented in table 7 since the two parallel tests were performed under the same test conditions these two test results are comparable the ultimate bearing capacity q u of test s1 is slightly higher than that of test s2 due to the higher shear strength gradient k clearly the q u predicted by the upper bound method is larger than the api mehtod which may be attributable to the effect of the self weight of the soil in the upper bound calculations moreover the discrepancy between the test results and proposed upper bound method results is is approximate to 7 which further proves the applicability of this proposed method 5 conclusions an upper bound method was proposed to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of solid or perforated mudmats a series of model tests at 1 g and two centrifugal model tests at 100 g were performed to investigate the impact of loading rate perforation ratio r perforation number n p and perforation shape on vertical bearing capacity the results predicted by the upper bound method were in good agreement with the test results the following conclusions were drawn 1 an upper bound method was presented for clay to evaluate the ultimate vertical bearing capacity of a solid or perforated mudmat the bearing capacity of perforated mudmats is corrected with the shape factors 2 the test results show that the loading rates had little influence on the bearing capacity factor the value of n c p decreased with increasing perforation ratio r while the perforation number n p and perforation shape only slightly affected n c p for the same perforation ratio r 3 it was reasonable to simplify the perforation area of a mudmat as a single perforation in the upper bound method because the available foundation bearing area had the greatest effect on n c the upper bound method results and centrifugal test results are in good agreement which proves the applicability of this proposed method credit authorship contribution statement run liu conceptualization methodology software

22091,although the trimaran design has gained increasing popularity toward the end of the 20th century there are a few experimental or numerical data available to aid the designer in this study the results of experimental and numerical studies for a high speed trimaran hull are presented to analyze the resistance and running attitude characteristics a 1 125 scale model was tested at a single outrigger configuration for a range of speeds up to froude number of 0 5 a three dimensional rans solver code based on the finite volume method was used to simulate the forward motion of the trimaran under two degrees of freedom in calm water a verification study was conducted to calculate the uncertainties in the computations then nine different outrigger configurations were analyzed using cfd the wave profile on the center hull and the wave patterns are provided to show the effect of the interference between the center hull and outriggers on the calculated resistance the resistance

transportation bring with it many challenging requirements for ship designs such as large deck areas or superior hydrodynamic performance in high speed operations multihulls e g catamarans and trimarans are among the most suitable design concepts to satisfy these requirements that offer a promising hull form due to its potential for reduced resistance at higher speed improved stability and greater upper deck area compared to a monohull having similar displacement the trimaran concept can be defined as a multi hull ship consisting of a center hull and two outriggers located on both sides these side hulls provide a significant improvement in stability and additional displacement as a consequence the center hull can be designed slenderer that may greatly reduce residuary resistance this configuration can create a larger wetted surface area compared to a similar monohull that results in comparatively higher frictional resistance at low speeds however at high speeds due to the use of slender hulls and the favorable wave interference amongst hulls compensates the increase of wetted surface and provides relatively low wave making and form resistance considering the advantages of the trimaran concept a lot of research has been done during the last decades when the literature on trimarans is examined in general it can be clearly seen that the most important parameter in resistance optimization is the configuration of the outriggers because of the flow interference effect between center hull and outriggers optimum placement of them will result in an interaction between the wave train produced by the center hull and the wave trains produced by the outriggers that ideally counteract each other at the primary speed s of interest in recent years the development of advanced computing technology and numerical tools have made the use of cfd computational fluid dynamics techniques more practical with regards to ship resistance calculations cfd analyses have also been widely used to conduct systematic trimaran studies especially most of the researches focused on the optimization of placement of the outriggers to get an optimum interference between hulls and lower resistance one of the early researches was carried out by narita 1976 in this study wave resistance characteristics of a trimaran hull form with different arrangements were investigated to verify the theoretical prediction with comparing towing test cfd method was utilized by suzuki et al 1997 to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of a trimaran hull form with small sized outriggers to determine optimum outrigger positions for minimum wave resistance performance they also considered the wave interactions between the center hull and outriggers to predict the total wave making resistance they performed a numerical analysis of wave making resistance based on the ordinary and modified rankine source the center hull of a trimaran is standard wigley form and the outriggers are designed with cosine and parabolic curves expressed with a given formula mahmood and de bo 2011 investigated the prediction of wave resistance on the trimaran hull forms using a cfd software three different mesh sizes and two different turbulence models were used to investigate the effect of mesh structure and turbulence models on the prediction of the resistance cfd analyses were realized corresponding to froude number ranges from 0 14 to 0 75 and the results were compared with the experimental data son et al 2015 performed cfd computations of a systematic series of trimaran hull forms the center hull form of the trimaran was developed based on the npl national physical laboratory systematic series of round bilge hulls and the side hulls were created by scaling the center hull to one third size firstly they realized cfd analyses with monohull and catamaran hull forms of npl series to verify the efficiency of the cfd then they performed cfd analyses for their developed trimarans with different configurations given some examples above although there is a respectable amount of theoretical and numerical researches regarding optimization of outriggers placement zhang 1997 larsson et al 1997 yang et al 2001 sahoo and doctors 2005 systematic experimental studies of multihulls were rarely reported in the literature one of the most complete sets of experimental data was published by ackers et al 1997 they tested four different conditions of four parameters of a trimaran with the round bilge type center hull and hard chine type side hulls the alternative hulls were created by altering the symmetry longitudinal and transverse locations angles of attack and displacement of the side hulls as a result of the study it was reported that symmetry and position of the side hulls have the most effect on the reduction of the resistance while the angle of attack and displacement are not effective mynard et al 2008 made a numerical and experimental study and investigated a systematic series of high speed trimaran hull forms to determine the wave resistance they used existing test data of tri 9 ship and altered the longitudinal position of the side hulls they also implemented cfd method for systematic series of trimarans and compared all of the results against the model test mizine et al 2009 conducted a study with a large trimaran ship to observe the positioning of the side hulls on wave interference and the influence of the different bow and skeg shapes on the flow they performed several cfd simulations with various codes on a trimaran with three longitudinal and three transverse positions of side hulls which were modeled as small waterplane area type when the results were examined transom wave breaking was observed in case of unfavorable interference which almost doubles the resistance relative to the optimal position battistin 2000 studied the wave resistance interference effect by using analytical numerical and experimental methods he used a trimaran configuration that the main and side hulls have been designed as a standard wigley form and the center hull is two times longer than the side hulls sixteen different configurations created by altering the positions of the side hulls were tested then wave resistance values of the alternatives were calculated by analytical and numerical methods and compared each other to find the accuracy of the methods while predicting the interference effect deng et al 2015 investigated the effects of trim and sinkage on the resistance performance by using cfd method on different conditions they performed cfd analyses both for free and restricted in 6dof degree of freedom conditions additionally they added a t foil under the bow of the center hull and compared the results both with model test and without appendage condition jiang et al 2017 examined a tunnel type planing trimaran consists of a center hull and two demi hulls they performed towing tests and several cfd analyses to observe both the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic performance of the hull they focused on the internal flow of the tunnel and reported that the aerodynamic forces provide major tunnel lift at high speeds and the total resistance increases up to the value of froude number for which wave surface separates from the tunnel roof in this study the main objective is to analyze the wave interference effects of the outriggers configuration on a trimaran resistance by utilizing cfd method based on urans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes firstly the geometric characteristics of the high speed trimaran model and experimental setup are described then a brief introduction of the cfd solver is presented followed by the description of the numerical setup consisting of mesh generation and

computational results with experimental ones in terms of resistance sinkage and trim values after v v verification validation nine different configurations three longitudinal and three lateral are analyzed by cfd the interference effect is calculated to define the best configuration the wave profiles on the center hull for each trimaran configuration are reported to show the effects of interference between the outriggers and center hull on the resistance 2 towing tank tests 2 1 physical description of the model the center hull design was provided by the center for innovation in ship design cisd at the us naval surface warfare center carderock division nswccd and embodies a bulbous bow and a transom stern to accommodate water jets the outrigger is a displacement type hull form which has a typical l b ratio of 20 and is symmetric about the midsection each outrigger displacement is about 3 of the center hull displacement and the length is about 30 that of the center hull a 1 125th scaled test model was fabricated based on the drawings provided by cisd and was tested for various advance speeds the particulars of the prototype and model are shown in table 1 and the lines section view is presented in fig 1 2 2 experimental setup tests were conducted in the davidson laboratory tank 3 which is 95 4 m 313 ft long 5 0 m 16 4 ft wide and 1 98 m 6 5 ft deep the towing carriage rides on a monorail located over the center of the tank with speed capability up to 21 34 m s 70 ft s it is towed by means of a steel cable driven by an electric motor at the far end of the tank the model was ballasted to a specified loading condition by placing ballast weights on weight pegs located in the model the model was free to trim and heave but fixed in yaw roll surge and sway the heave motion of the tow point located at the intersection of lcg longitudinal center of gravity and thrust line was transmitted through a lightly tensioned vertical string wound around a pulley connected to a rotary variable differential transformer unit schaevitz rvdt sample standard error of 1 016 mm trim of the model baseline relative to the horizon was measured using an inclinometer schaevitz lsop 30 sample standard error of 0 05 mounted inside the model the trimaran resistance was measured using a 4 54 kg ten pound drag balance schaevitz lvdt sample standard error of 0 02 kg located directly above a pivot box towing fixture with a hinge permitting pitching motion another 4 54 kg ten pound drag balance was used to measure the outrigger resistance fig 2 the instruments to measure drag trim and heave were calibrated prior to the tests by applying known loads angles and displacements all calibrations were linear and a least squares technique was used to obtain calibration rates model velocity was computed by measuring the time required to travel through the data trap data were acquired at 250 hz in a 30 48 m 100 ft data trap after the model had accelerated to a steady speed and were transmitted by overhead cables to a shore based pc for processing and storage the tests were carried out for seven different advance speeds comprising low mid and high froude numbers table 2 in addition the center hull was tested separately at the same conditions to obtain the individual resistance values trimaran tests were performed for the f configuration described in the cfd simulation cases see table 3 3 computational method the hydrodynamic analyses of the high speed trimaran naval combatant have been performed by a commercial unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations solver the fluid flow around the trimaran has been considered as 3 d and incompressible the computational domain has been discretized with fully hexahedral elements during the simulations the free surface effects have been considered using the volume of fluid vof method which was developed by hirt and nichols 1981 and utilized by the eulerian fluid approach the free water surface is initially assumed as calm water the reynolds stresses have been computed using standard realizable k ε turbulence model which uses two layer y wall treatment according to the turbulence model the velocity profiles very close to the no slip walls are calculated with a utilized wall function which is activated when the dimensionless wall y value is between 30 and 300 in this chapter simulation cases and details about the computational method are presented in an orderly manner 3 1 simulation cases it is aimed to determine the resistance characteristics of the trimaran hull form for different outrigger placements in both longitudinal and lateral directions by using cfd method the longitudinal stagger is shown as s l and the transverse spacing is shown as t b defined in fig 3 as a result nine separate outrigger longitudinal position and transverse spacing configurations table 3 were tested and analyzed this allowed a detailed investigation of the effect of changing outrigger position on wave interference and total resistance the configuration f is chosen for the validation study all other configurations are assessed at a service speed of 0 18 froude number 3 2 numerical setup the averaged continuity and momentum equations in the cartesian coordinate system can be written as follows for an incompressible flow with constant viscosity and assuming there are no body forces acting on the hull ferziger and perić 2002 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j u i u j x j 1 ρ p x j τ i j x j in which τ i j are the mean viscous stress tensor components as shown below 3 τ i j ν u i x j u j x i and p is the mean pressure u i is the average cartesian components of the velocity vector ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress ρ is the fluid density and ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient implicit solver with 1st order temporal discretization has been implemented the time domain has been divided into time steps according to ittc international towing tank conference cfd recommendations ittc 2011 as follows 4 δ t 0 005 0 01 l v here l is the length between perpendiculars and v is the ship advance speed segregated solver has been used in order to compute velocity and pressure of each particle separately 3 3 boundary conditions in this work a trimaran hull form in 1 125th scale ratio with a slender transom stern center hull stabilized by two small outriggers is used in order to investigate the effects of outriggers on the resistance characteristics both experimentally and numerically fig 4 an xyz cartesian coordinate system is created for the numerical simulations where the origin is the intersection of forward perpendicular and baseline the center hull and outriggers are assigned as no slip walls where the normal and tangential components of the velocity to be zero the wall effects have been eliminated by identifying the side faces of the computational domain as symmetrical boundaries upstream is in the ve x direction while the pressure outlet is located in the ve x direction as shown in fig 5 3 4 grid resolution static rigid grid technique is adopted for the straight ahead towing simulations of the trimaran hull the grid sizes are gradually increased away from the hull fig 6 the free water surface zone is treated carefully in order to capture the wave deformations well the same grid structure is used in both monohull and trimaran computations explained in subsection 3 1 a structured grid system is adopted near the hull surfaces which includes the boundary layer and an unstructured grid for the rest of the computational domain is constructed by using fully hexahedral elements 4 cfd verification and validation this chapter contains the solution verification analyses and the validation of the computational method there are two configurations of trimaran discussed in this chapter configuration f and monohull condition the outriggers positions are set in longitudinal and lateral directions see table 4 longitudinal percentage represents the distance between the stem of the center hull and the midship of the outrigger while lateral percentages are given for shell to shell clearance between center hull and outrigger computations are repeated for configuration f and monohull condition in a range of 0 10 0 50 froude numbers cfd results are compared against the experimental data all the simulations reported in this study have been performed by using star ccm software version 13 02 011 from siemens plm siemens 2018 4 1 uncertainty assessment the latest solution verification methods namely grid convergence index gci correction factor cf and factors of safety fs are implemented in order to obtain the uncertainties in the computations for the verification and validation study froude number of 0 30 was chosen which can be considered as a critical point due to the fact that pressure based resistance components increase drastically at increasing speeds after this froude number the theoretical order of accuracy pth is set to 2 which is commonly used for spatial discretization uncertainty here pre represents the observed order of accuracy and p is the ratio of pre to pth as can be seen from table 7 the highest uncertainties δfs are calculated by the fs method the highest values of uncertainties must be considered to be on the safe side the converging conditions are calculated as 0 70 and 0 31 for monohull and trimaran respectively which indicate that the computational results converge monotonically to a certain value extra two analyses of 2 1 m and 1 1 m cell numbers are also performed to demonstrate the convergence condition and the mesh sensitivity of the trimaran fig 7 with the presented verification study the limits of the computational method are determined properly on the other hand computational effort and time efficiency must be taken into consideration when the results are checked it can be seen that the relative error between fine and medium grids is about 0 8 see tables 5 and 6 thus the medium grid is used in the rest of the cfd simulations in order to reduce the computation time in this case the relative error must be taken into account together with the calculated uncertainty value for fine grid quality the validation study is also carried out with the medium grid in this regard detailed information about the verification procedure can be found in roache 1994 stern et al 2001 2006 ittc 2008 celik et al 2008 phillips and roy 2014 and applications can be found in duman et al 2018 duman and bal 2019 4 2 validation the verification and validation study is completed by comparing the computational results against the experimental ones relative errors are calculated using the following formula 5 ε r t e x p r t c f d r t e x p x 100 all hydrodynamic analyses reported in the present study are performed under free to sinkage and trim conditions total and frictional resistance forces are given in the si unit system it should be noted that the frictional resistance forces are calculated by integrating the shear forces acting on the hull while the ittc 57 friction line is used in the experimental results tables 8 and 9 cfd results of monohull and trimaran f configurations are compared with the experimental data in terms of resistance sinkage and trim values in tables 8 and 9 relative errors in total resistance and frictional resistance are also shown in table 10 the percentage errors for sinkage and trim are not presented as these would incorrectly show large percentage error while the actual difference in the magnitude is very small table 8 shows the comparison of the numerical and experimental results for the monohull case the numerical results show good agreement with experiment results at each speed the calculated average errors in total resistance and frictional resistance are 6 14 and 3 16 respectively hydrodynamic performance of trimaran f hull form is analyzed as a next step approximately 200 000 extra cells are required to discretize each outrigger surface for medium grid quality computational results of the trimaran f for resistance sinkage trim values are given in table 9 in comparison with the experimental results relative errors are also shown in table 10 the calculated average errors in total resistance and frictional resistance are 7 25 and 3 18 respectively the compared results are also shown in figs 8 10 for the monohull and trimaran f to show that the cfd computations predict the similar tendency with the experimental data therefore the validity of this numerical method is approved since the dynamic wetted surface areas could not be measured in the experiments the total resistance values calculated by cfd are compared against experiment in dimensional form fig 8 the wave profiles along the center hull and the transom wave patterns are compared with the experiments fig 11 shows the wave profile comparison between experimental and numerical studies for trimaran f configuration at fn 0 40 and fig 12 shows the same for transom wave pattern the cfd solver captures the wave profile along the center hull the transom separation and wave interferences between the outriggers and center hull successfully as it compared to the experiment results 5 computational results for different outrigger positions the uncertainty analyses and comparison between experiments show that the computational method is quite capable of predicting resistance components dynamic behavior and free surface deformations of a trimaran hull form at low medium and high froude numbers the purpose of the present study is to analyze the effects of outrigger positioning on the resistance characteristics of a trimaran surface combatant by cfd which is considered as a robust repeatable and cost effective method the simulation cases are introduced in subsection 3 1 5 1 general assessment all cases are analyzed at the service speed of the vessel which is priorly known as 0 18 froude number computational results are given in table 11 for each configuration and monohull condition when the outriggers are located at t 1 07 and t 1 27 in the lateral direction a decrease in total resistance is observed by shifting outriggers to the stern since the frictional resistance values are almost the same the reason for this is the wave making resistance at t 1 07 and t 1 27 a decrease of 9 82 between trimaran d and trimaran f and 10 32 between trimaran g and trimaran i are calculated respectively table 12 it should be noted that the pressure based resistance component changes between 19 and 26 of the total resistance at service speed for all configurations table 11 at the position t 0 86 on the other hand minimum total resistance is calculated at the closest position to the stern however no direct correlation is found at this position by shifting the outriggers in the stern direction an increase in sinkage amplitudes and trim values by the stern are observed for three of lateral positions at s 0 28 in the longitudinal direction closest position to the stem it is found that the total resistance values increase as the outriggers move away from the center hull besides gravity center of the trimaran goes up and also trim values by the stern decrease a dramatic change in residual resistance is obtained at the position of t 1 07 in the lateral direction by moving outriggers towards the stern a decrease of 44 34 in residual resistance between trimaran d and trimaran f another noticeable change in the residual resistance is calculated at the longitudinal position s 1 27 by moving outriggers away from the center hull a decrease of 25 99 in residual resistance between trimaran b and trimaran h 5 2 interference effects when the resistance performance of a multi hull vessel is investigated the resistance of the multihull concept varies from the sum of the resistance values of each hull which are towed individually equation 6 is used to calculate this difference in total resistance 6 δ r t r t t r i m a r a n r t c e n t e r 2 r t s i d e where δ r t is the interference resistance coefficient r t t r i m a r a n is the total resistance when tested as a trimaran r t c e n t e r is the total resistance when the center hull is tested separately and r t s i d e is the total resistance when the outrigger is tested separately to analyze the results the percentage interference is calculated using equation 7 and the results are shown in table 12 negative percentage interference value means the resistance of the trimaran configuration is less than that of the center hull and outrigger tested separately and summed 7 i f δ r t r t t r i m a r a n as it is known to reduce the total resistance of the trimaran the wave making resistance can be reduced by changing the outrigger positions the wave resistance can be separated from the residual resistance by calculating the form factor of the vessel du et al 2019 since the percentage of the wave making resistance is the major part of the pressure based resistance component comparison of the residual resistance for different outrigger positions is still reasonable it is seen from table 12 that the farthest aft locations c f i are the best configurations out of the nine tested configurations when the outriggers are located close to the aft decreased interference effects are observed the percentage interference is negative for these three configurations related to the total resistance and residuary resistance which means the resistance of the trimaran is less than the resistance of the three hulls summed the effects of the interference between the center hull and outriggers on the resistance are also investigated via wave profiles on the center hull for the different trimaran conditions by using cfd the wave elevations exhibit similar profiles up to the interaction region and show variation towards to stern of the center hull due to interference the waves generated by the center hull will have a specific wave length depending on the speed and will have different height and phase angle at the outriggers placed at different locations hence these waves will interact differently with the waves generated by the outriggers and the interference effect would be constructive or destructive depending on the phase difference between the two sets of waves the complexity of this interference for different outrigger locations is shown in these figures fig 13 shows the wave profiles of different longitudinal outrigger positions on the center hull while figs 14 15 show the same longitudinal positions of outriggers with different lateral clearance as it can be seen from fig 13 the wave amplitude of configuration c is lower than configuration a and b in the interaction region which leads to minimum resistance value among these three configurations this is also similar for figs 14 and 15 it can be concluded that the wave amplitudes in the generated wave profiles are lower when the total resistance has lower value and the interference effect is negative 6 conclusions in the present study numerical and experimental hydrodynamic analyses of a high speed trimaran hull form have been carried out to investigate the side hull effects on the resistance characteristics in a range of 0 10 0 50 froude numbers first 2 dof straight ahead towing simulations of the monohull and the trimaran configuration f at low medium and high froude numbers have been performed the computational results have been compared against the experiments in terms of total resistance wave elevations and dynamic motion amplitudes sinkage and trim bow waves and the wave pattern in the wake field have also been clearly captured by cfd as in the experiment uncertainty analyses have been carried out at 0 30 froude number which is considered as the critical point due to the fact that pressure based resistance components increase drastically at increasing speeds after this froude number monotonic convergence has been observed in the computational analyses the total amount of uncertainties in the computations have been determined as 9 17 and 12 69 for monohull and trimaran f respectively the fs method has been found to be more conservative than the other two verification methods after the detailed v v process outrigger positions have been changed in both longitudinal and lateral directions at 0 18 froude number which is considered as the service speed of the vessel and the computations have been repeated a general assessment has been made for the trimaran configurations to find out the proper positions that reduce the residual resistance values total resistance values have been computed for not only trimaran but also separately analyzed center hull and outriggers for the purpose of calculating an interference factor explained in the previous chapter the interference factors show that c f and i configurations are the best configurations out of the nine tested configurations the general trend in total resistance has been observed to decrease as the outriggers shifted towards the stern the wave profiles along the center hull have been plotted to observe the effects of wave interaction between the outriggers and the center hull on the resistance performance as expected minimum resistance values have been obtained for the cases which generates lower wave amplitudes the authors emphasized that when the outriggers are located close to the aft wave interference phenomenon positively affects the resistance of the trimaran considerable changes in total resistance values have been reported in some cases the presented numerical method has proved itself to be robust and cost effective in predicting resistance characteristics of a trimaran hull form at the initial design stage in future works wave interference subject will be investigated for trimaran maneuvers in asymmetric sailing conditions dynamic overset grid technique will be implemented to analyze the maneuvering performance of the trimaran hull form for the presented configurations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

transportation bring with it many challenging requirements for ship designs such as large deck areas or superior hydrodynamic performance in high speed operations multihulls e g catamarans and trimarans are among the most suitable design concepts to satisfy these requirements that offer a promising hull form due to its potential for reduced resistance at higher speed improved stability and greater upper deck area compared to a monohull having similar displacement the trimaran concept can be defined as a multi hull ship consisting of a center hull and two outriggers located on both sides these side hulls provide a significant improvement in stability and additional displacement as a consequence the center hull can be designed slenderer that may greatly reduce residuary resistance this configuration can create a larger wetted surface area compared to a similar monohull that results in comparatively higher frictional resistance at low speeds however at high speeds due to the use of slender hulls and the favorable wave interference amongst hulls compensates the increase of wetted surface and provides relatively low wave making and form resistance considering the advantages of the trimaran concept a lot of research has been done during the last decades when the literature on trimarans is examined in general it can be clearly seen that the most important parameter in resistance

computational results with experimental ones in terms of resistance sinkage and trim values after v v verification validation nine different configurations three longitudinal and three lateral are analyzed by cfd the interference effect is calculated to define the best configuration the wave profiles on the center hull for each trimaran configuration are reported to show the effects of interference between the outriggers and center hull on the resistance 2 towing tank tests 2 1 physical description of the model the center hull design was provided by the center for innovation in ship design cisd at the us naval surface warfare center carderock division nswccd and embodies a bulbous bow and a transom stern to accommodate water jets the outrigger is a displacement type hull form which has a typical l b ratio of 20 and is symmetric about the midsection each outrigger displacement is about 3 of the center hull displacement and the length is about 30 that of the center hull a 1 125th scaled test model was fabricated based on the drawings provided by cisd and was tested for various advance speeds the particulars of the prototype and model are shown in table 1 and the lines section view is presented in fig 1 2 2 experimental setup tests were conducted in the davidson laboratory tank 3 which is 95 4 m 313 ft long 5 0 m 16 4 ft wide and 1 98 m 6 5 ft deep the towing carriage rides on a monorail located over the center of the tank with speed capability up to 21 34 m s 70 ft s it is towed by means of a steel cable driven by an electric motor at the far end of the tank the model was ballasted to a specified loading condition by placing ballast weights on weight pegs located in the model the model was free to trim and heave but fixed in yaw roll surge and sway the heave motion of the tow point located at the intersection of lcg longitudinal center of gravity and thrust line was transmitted through a lightly tensioned vertical string wound around a pulley connected to a rotary variable differential transformer unit schaevitz rvdt sample standard error of 1 016 mm trim of the model baseline relative to the horizon was measured using an inclinometer schaevitz lsop 30 sample standard error of 0 05 mounted inside the model the trimaran resistance was measured using a 4 54 kg ten pound drag balance schaevitz lvdt sample standard error of 0 02 kg located directly above a pivot box towing fixture with a hinge permitting pitching motion another 4 54 kg ten pound drag balance was used to measure the outrigger resistance fig 2 the instruments to measure drag trim and heave were calibrated prior to the tests by applying known loads angles and displacements all calibrations were linear and a least squares technique was used to obtain calibration rates model velocity was computed by measuring the time required to travel through the data trap data were acquired at 250 hz in a 30 48 m 100 ft data trap after the model had accelerated to a steady speed and were transmitted by overhead cables to a shore based pc for processing and storage the tests were carried out for seven different advance speeds comprising low mid and high froude numbers table 2 in addition the center hull was tested separately at the same conditions to obtain the individual resistance values trimaran tests were performed for the f configuration described in the cfd simulation cases see table 3 3 computational method the hydrodynamic analyses of the high speed trimaran naval combatant have been performed by a commercial unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations solver the fluid flow around the trimaran has been considered as 3 d and incompressible the computational domain has been discretized with fully hexahedral elements during the simulations the free surface effects have been considered using the volume of fluid vof method which was developed by hirt and nichols 1981 and utilized by the eulerian fluid approach the free water surface is initially assumed as calm water the reynolds stresses have been computed using standard realizable k ε turbulence model which uses two layer y wall treatment according to the turbulence model the velocity profiles very close to the no slip walls are calculated with a utilized wall function which is activated when the dimensionless wall y value is between 30 and 300 in this chapter simulation cases and details about the computational method are presented in an orderly manner 3 1 simulation cases it is aimed to determine the resistance characteristics of the trimaran hull form for different outrigger placements in both longitudinal and lateral directions by using cfd method the longitudinal stagger is shown as s l and the transverse spacing is shown as t b defined in fig 3 as a result nine separate outrigger longitudinal position and transverse spacing configurations table 3 were tested and analyzed this allowed a detailed investigation of the effect of changing outrigger position on wave interference and total resistance the configuration f is chosen for the validation study all other configurations are assessed at a service speed of 0 18 froude number 3 2 numerical setup the averaged continuity and momentum equations in the cartesian coordinate system can be written as follows for an incompressible flow with constant viscosity and assuming there are no body forces acting on the hull ferziger and perić 2002 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j u i u j x j 1 ρ p x j τ i j x j in which τ i j are the mean viscous stress tensor components as shown below 3 τ i

coefficient implicit solver with 1st order temporal discretization has been implemented the time domain has been divided into time steps according to ittc international towing tank conference cfd recommendations ittc 2011 as follows 4 δ t 0 005 0 01 l v here l is the length between perpendiculars and v is the ship advance speed segregated solver has been used in order to compute velocity and pressure of each particle separately 3 3 boundary conditions in this work a trimaran hull form in 1 125th scale ratio with a slender transom stern center hull stabilized by two small outriggers is used in order to investigate the effects of outriggers on the resistance characteristics both experimentally and numerically fig 4 an xyz cartesian coordinate system is created for the numerical simulations where the origin is the intersection of forward perpendicular and baseline the center hull and outriggers are assigned as no slip walls where the normal and tangential components of the velocity to be zero the wall effects have been eliminated by identifying the side faces of the computational domain as symmetrical boundaries upstream is in the ve x direction while the pressure outlet is located in the ve x direction as shown in fig 5 3 4 grid resolution static rigid grid technique is adopted for the straight ahead towing simulations of the trimaran hull the grid sizes are gradually increased away from the hull fig 6 the free water surface zone is treated carefully in order to capture the wave deformations well the same grid structure is used in both monohull and trimaran computations explained in subsection 3 1 a structured grid system is adopted near the hull surfaces which includes the boundary layer and an unstructured grid for the rest of the computational domain is constructed by using fully hexahedral elements 4 cfd verification and validation this chapter contains the solution verification analyses and the validation of the computational method there are two configurations of trimaran discussed in this chapter configuration f and monohull condition the outriggers positions are set in longitudinal and lateral directions see table 4 longitudinal percentage represents the distance between the stem of the center hull and the midship of the outrigger while lateral percentages are given for shell to shell clearance between center hull and outrigger computations are repeated for configuration f and monohull condition in a range of 0 10 0 50 froude numbers cfd results are compared against the experimental data all the simulations reported in this study have been performed by using star ccm software version 13 02 011 from siemens plm siemens 2018 4 1 uncertainty assessment the latest solution verification methods namely grid convergence index gci correction factor cf and factors of safety fs are implemented in order to obtain the uncertainties in the computations for the verification and validation study froude number of 0 30 was chosen which can be considered as a critical point due to the fact that pressure based resistance components increase drastically at increasing speeds after this froude number the theoretical order of accuracy pth is set to 2 which is commonly used for spatial discretization uncertainty here pre represents the observed order of accuracy and p is the ratio of pre to pth as can be seen from table 7 the highest uncertainties δfs are calculated by the fs method the highest values of uncertainties must be considered to be on the safe side the converging conditions are calculated as 0 70 and 0 31 for monohull and trimaran respectively which indicate that the computational results converge monotonically to a certain value extra two analyses of 2 1 m and 1 1 m cell numbers are also performed to demonstrate the convergence condition and the mesh sensitivity of the trimaran fig 7 with the presented verification study the limits of the computational method are determined properly on the other hand computational effort and time efficiency must be taken into consideration when the results are checked it can be seen that the relative error between fine and medium grids is about 0 8 see tables 5 and 6 thus the medium grid is used in the rest of the cfd simulations in order to reduce the computation time in this case the relative error must be taken into account together with the calculated uncertainty value for fine grid quality the validation study is also carried out with the medium grid in this regard detailed information about the verification procedure can be found in roache 1994 stern et al 2001 2006 ittc 2008 celik et al 2008 phillips and roy 2014 and applications can be found in duman et al 2018 duman and bal 2019 4 2 validation the verification and validation study is completed by comparing the computational results against the experimental ones relative errors are calculated using the following formula 5 ε r t e x p r t c f d r t e x p x 100 all hydrodynamic analyses reported in the present study are performed under free to sinkage and trim conditions total and frictional resistance forces are given in the si unit system it should be noted that the frictional resistance forces are calculated by integrating the shear forces acting on the hull while the ittc 57 friction line is used in the experimental results tables 8 and 9 cfd results of monohull and trimaran f configurations are compared with the experimental data in terms of resistance sinkage and trim values in tables 8 and 9 relative errors in total resistance and frictional resistance are also shown in table 10 the percentage errors for sinkage and trim are not presented as these would incorrectly show large percentage error while the actual difference in the magnitude is very small table 8 shows the comparison of the numerical and experimental results for the monohull case the numerical results show good agreement with experiment results at each speed the calculated average errors in total resistance and frictional resistance are 6 14 and 3 16 respectively hydrodynamic performance of trimaran f hull form is analyzed as a next step approximately 200 000 extra cells are required to discretize each outrigger surface for medium grid quality computational results of the trimaran f for resistance sinkage trim values are given in table 9 in comparison with the experimental results relative errors are also shown in table 10 the calculated average errors in total resistance and frictional resistance are 7 25 and 3 18 respectively the compared results are also shown in figs 8 10 for the monohull and trimaran f to show that the cfd computations predict the similar tendency with the experimental data therefore the validity of this numerical method is approved since the dynamic wetted surface areas could not be measured in the experiments the total resistance values calculated by cfd are compared against experiment in dimensional form fig 8 the wave profiles along the center hull and the transom wave patterns are compared with the experiments fig 11 shows the wave profile comparison between experimental and numerical studies for trimaran f configuration at fn 0 40 and fig 12 shows the same for transom wave pattern the cfd solver captures the wave profile along the center hull the transom separation and wave interferences between the outriggers and center hull successfully as it compared to the experiment results 5 computational results for different outrigger positions the uncertainty analyses and comparison between experiments show that the computational method is quite capable of predicting resistance components dynamic behavior and free surface deformations of a trimaran hull form at low medium and high froude numbers the purpose of the present study is to analyze the effects of outrigger positioning on the resistance characteristics of a trimaran surface combatant by cfd which is considered as a robust repeatable and cost effective method the simulation cases are introduced in subsection 3 1 5 1 general assessment all cases are analyzed at the service speed of the vessel which is priorly known as 0 18 froude number computational results are given in table 11 for each configuration and monohull condition when the outriggers are located at t 1 07 and t 1 27 in the lateral direction a decrease in total resistance is observed by shifting outriggers to the stern since the frictional resistance values are almost the same the reason for this is the wave making resistance at t 1 07 and t 1 27 a decrease of 9 82 between trimaran d and trimaran f and 10 32 between trimaran g and trimaran i are calculated respectively table 12 it should be noted that the pressure based resistance component changes between 19 and 26 of the total resistance at service speed for all configurations table 11 at the position t 0 86 on the other hand minimum total resistance is calculated at the closest position to the stern however no direct correlation is found at this position by shifting the outriggers in the stern direction an increase in sinkage amplitudes and trim values by the stern are observed for three of lateral positions at s 0 28 in the longitudinal direction closest position to the stem it is found that the total resistance values increase as the outriggers move away from the center hull besides gravity center of the trimaran goes up and also trim values by the stern decrease a dramatic change in residual resistance is obtained at the position of t 1 07 in the lateral direction by moving outriggers towards the stern a decrease of 44 34 in residual resistance between trimaran d and trimaran f another noticeable change in the residual resistance is calculated at the longitudinal position s 1 27 by moving outriggers away from the center hull a decrease of 25 99 in residual resistance between trimaran b and trimaran h 5 2 interference effects when the resistance performance of a multi hull vessel is investigated the resistance of the multihull concept varies from the sum of the resistance values of each hull which are towed individually equation 6 is used to calculate this difference in total resistance 6 δ r t r t t r i m a r a n r t c e n t e r 2 r t s i d e where δ r t is the interference resistance coefficient r t t r i m a r a n is the total resistance when tested as a trimaran r t c e n t e r is the total resistance when the center hull is tested separately and r t s i d e is the total resistance when the outrigger is tested separately to analyze the results the percentage interference is calculated using equation 7 and the results are shown in table 12 negative percentage interference value means the resistance of the trimaran configuration is less than that of the center hull and outrigger tested separately and summed 7 i f δ r t r t t r i m a r a n as it is known to reduce the total resistance of the trimaran the wave making resistance can be reduced by changing the outrigger positions the wave resistance can be separated from the residual resistance by calculating the form factor of the vessel du et al 2019 since the percentage of the wave making resistance is the major part of the pressure based resistance component comparison of the residual resistance for different outrigger positions is still reasonable it is seen from table 12 that the farthest aft locations c f i are the best configurations out of the nine tested configurations when the outriggers are located close to the aft decreased interference effects are observed the percentage interference is negative for these three configurations related to the total resistance and residuary resistance which means the resistance of the trimaran is less than the resistance of the three hulls summed the effects of the interference between the center hull and outriggers on the resistance are also investigated via wave profiles on the center hull for the different trimaran conditions by using cfd the wave elevations exhibit similar profiles up to the interaction region and show variation towards to stern of the center hull due to interference the waves generated by the center hull will have a specific wave length depending on the speed and will have different height and phase angle at the outriggers placed at different locations hence these waves will interact differently with the waves generated by the outriggers and the interference effect would be constructive or destructive depending on the phase difference between the two sets of waves the complexity of this interference for different outrigger locations is shown in these figures fig 13 shows the wave profiles of different longitudinal outrigger positions on the center hull while figs 14 15 show the same longitudinal positions of outriggers with different lateral clearance as it can be seen from fig 13 the wave amplitude of configuration c is lower than configuration a and b in the interaction region which leads to minimum resistance value among these three configurations this is also similar for figs 14 and 15 it can be concluded that the wave amplitudes in the generated wave profiles are lower when the total resistance has lower value and the interference effect is negative 6 conclusions in the present study numerical and experimental hydrodynamic analyses of a high speed trimaran hull form have been carried out to investigate the side hull effects on the resistance characteristics in a range of 0 10 0 50 froude numbers first 2 dof straight ahead towing simulations of the monohull and the trimaran configuration f at low medium and high froude numbers have been performed the computational results have been compared against the experiments in terms of total resistance wave elevations and dynamic motion amplitudes sinkage and trim bow waves and the wave pattern in the wake field have also been clearly captured by cfd as in the experiment uncertainty analyses have been carried out at 0 30 froude number which is considered as the critical point due to the fact that pressure based resistance components increase drastically at increasing speeds after this froude number monotonic convergence has been observed in the computational analyses the total amount of uncertainties in the computations have been determined as 9 17 and 12 69 for monohull and trimaran f respectively the fs method has been found to be more conservative than the other two verification methods after the detailed v v process outrigger positions have been changed in both longitudinal and lateral directions at 0 18 froude number which is considered as the service speed of the vessel and the computations have been repeated a general assessment has been made for the trimaran configurations to find out the proper positions that reduce the residual resistance values total resistance values have been computed for not only trimaran but also separately analyzed center hull and outriggers for the purpose of calculating an interference factor explained in the previous chapter the interference factors show that c f and i configurations are the best configurations out of the nine tested configurations the general trend in total resistance has been observed to decrease as the outriggers shifted towards the stern the wave profiles along the center hull have been plotted to observe the effects of wave interaction between the outriggers and the center hull on the resistance performance as expected minimum resistance values have been obtained for the cases which generates lower wave amplitudes the authors emphasized that when the outriggers are located close to the aft wave interference phenomenon positively affects the resistance of the trimaran considerable changes in total resistance values have been reported in some cases the presented numerical method has proved itself to be robust and cost effective in predicting resistance characteristics of a trimaran hull form at the initial design stage in future works wave interference subject will be investigated for trimaran maneuvers in asymmetric sailing conditions dynamic overset grid technique will be implemented to analyze the maneuvering performance of the trimaran hull form for the presented configurations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

22092,one of the key issues concerning the use of composite materials in the construction of steel ships or vice versa the use of steel in the construction of composite ships is related to the ways of joining composite parts to the adjacent steel structure carbon steel joints are of increasing interest for the maritime industry but knowledge is scarce applications of adhesive joints as an alternative method to welding or riveting has numerous advantages still gathering more information about the behaviour of such joints through numerical sensitivity analysis and simulation are necessary to speed up applications on ships and marine structures the present investigation aims at assessing the sensitivity of the parameters that define the traction separation law on the numerical simulation of the de bonding of a steel to composite single lap joint following a previous experimental campaign the test is intended to induce a mode ii separation although the slight bending moment caused by the misalignment of the two ends leads to mixed mode effects as well two finite element software were compared adina and ls dyna the influence of peak traction penalty stiffness and energy

high tensile steel czm cohesive zone method 1 introduction the volume and number of applications of composite materials has been growing steadily penetrating and conquering new market relentlessly barbero 2011 as for marine industry the use of composite materials has been on increase since the early 1950s initially fibre reinforced plastics was used for small crafts such as pleasure crafts and lifeboats this has changed over the years to the point where structures having a mass of several hundred tonnes are regularly produced and used generally low cost glass reinforced plastic grp showed poor stiffness which limited the length of full composite ships in the past due to hull girder deformation issues however as composite materials and technology advanced today we have examples of full composite ships up to 70 m long the marine environment is extremely aggressive and this has resulted in a widespread use of fiber reinforced composite materials adhesive bonding is a lightweight and corrosion resistant means of joining these materials da silva et al da silva et al 2011 therefore todays potential applications range from small components such as masts piping bulkheads to larger structures such as ship hulls superstructures or offshore and submersibles structure modules shenoi and wellicome 2008 moreover besides strong research activities on materials for offshore structures for wind energy renewable energy aquafarming and deep sea mining there are several eu projects aimed at developing the applications of composite materials in large scale shipbuilding e g fibreship horizon 2020 programme 2017a ramsses horizon 2020 programme 2017b composites are intended not only as non structural elements such as hatch covers or lower decks for example of car carrier vessels but also as structural part of passenger ships ferries or even larger merchant ships such as container vessels this will also depend on further development of smart composite materials as well as fabrication technologies josefson et al 2018 on the other hand considering composites application on board a steel ship joining composite parts to the adjacent steel structure has been and still remains one of the key issues developing adequate joints should be a baseline for any application simplicity durability and reliability are the recommended design guidelines for designing joints as an alternative method to welding riveting and other conventional fasteners applications of adhesive joints have been used widely in marine structures shipbuilding and offshore industries in an assembly of composite structures usage of mechanical fasteners causes high stress concentration that results in structurally inefficient joints adhesive joints can redistribute the loads so that stress concentrations can be lowered as proposed by sarrado et al 2016 and provide good strength weight and cost effectiveness ratios these requirements cannot be met by mechanical joints the other reasons why adhesive bonding is so desirable compared to other conventional joining methods are adams et al 1997 thinner gage materials can be used with attendant weight and cost savings the number of production parts can be reduced whereas the design is more simplified the need for milling machining and forming operation of details is reduced large area bonds can be made with a minimum work force without special skills provides a high strength to weight ratio with three times higher shearing force of riveted joints improved aerodynamic hydrodynamic smoothness and visual appearance use as a seal and or corrosion preventer when joining incompatible materials excellent electrical and thermal insulation superior fatigue resistance adhesively bonded assemblies have shown a fatigue life twenty times better than riveted structures of identical parts the adhesive is sufficiently flexible to allow for the variations in coefficients of thermal expansion when joining dissimilar materials the use of metal to composite joints has extended into the marine field as a novel method banea et al 2018 from other fields such as automotive and aerospace industry replacement of structures such as masts superstructures even internal non structural decks and bulkheads using composite materials could provide substantial savings in weight and increase seakeeping ability and vessel stability most of the research carried out on metal to composite connections has been on secondary process joints this involves the manufacture of a composite structure and subsequent adhesive bonding to the metallic structure there is increasing interest in producing joints by the co curing method which involves the making of the joint while consolidating the composite material boyd 2006 when large composite components are considered bolting is not usually cost effective as the number of bolts increases the manufacturing process of the joint becomes slow and costly also the bolts are adding weight to composite components on the other hand it is quite difficult to perform effective adhesive bonding in a metal shipyard environment where the conditions in terms of cleanness temperature and humidity form a severe obstacle for achieving adhesively bonded joints with high and uniform quality a way to overcome these problems is to prefabricate metallic joint elements which are adhesively bonded to the composite substructure by the frp manufacturer and then welded to the ship structure such a procedure allows the adhesive joint to be manufactured in a suitable environment and accordingly allows the shipyard to weld the frp parts to the ship in a similar manner as corresponding metal parts composite materials present a number of failure modes which is much higher if compared to traditional isotropic ductile materials current theories only provide reliable results to assess the first ply failure of laminates only among failure modes the most critical to assess is the delamination delamination is also a frequent mode of failure strongly affecting the structural performance of composite laminates the interface between layers offers a low resistance path for crack growth because the bonding between two adjacent layers depends mainly on matrix properties delamination may originate from manufacturing imperfections blass et al 2018 cracks produced by fatigue or low velocity impact stress concentration near geometric or material discontinuities such as joints and free edges or due to high interlaminar stresses barbero 2013 relevant works were conducted in recent years to predict the opening and the growth of delamination in fibre reinforced composites and to assess for their effect in terms of global response of the structure gaiotti et al 2014 compared different numerical strategies to determine the buckling capacity of delaminated composite panels and colombo and vergani 2014 studied the effect of delamination on fatigue behaviour the effects of different parameters of the composite laminate and delaminated area are investigated analytically under buckling load by kharghani kharghani and guedes soares 2016 and the results are compared to three dimensional finite element analysis considering the advances of numerical simulations in this field although the theory was developed in the past decades due to the high computational efforts cohesive elements have become available in finite element software only recently this fact has introduced a new tool to simulate delamination opening and growth turon et al 2018 still current applications are limited to small scale models for two main reasons both related to computational limits primarily because of the higher number of elements required to simulate cohesive layers and secondarily cohesive are solid elements requiring a 3d solid modelling strategy in general cohesive models currently represent a powerful instrument to investigate the influence of adhesive parameters in small scale models while their implementation in large scale design is still limited due to computational limits nevertheless there are some results such as those presented by sonstabo et al 2016 or those in the form of a new cohesive element presented by neumayer at al neumayer et al 2016 that enable the simulation of delamination failure in bonded joints on a full scale structural level the principle of the approach is to compute the through the thickness stresses of the adherends analytically within the cohesive element representing the cohesive behaviour of the complete adhesive over a stress based interaction criterion it becomes possible to detect delamination in the adherents the delamination failure is implemented by an adaptation of the cohesive law the convergence behaviour of the model is improved and numerical efficiency is high and enables a representation of both cohesive failure of the adhesive and delamination failure on a structural level some other promising applications include the evaluation of different modelling conditions in the cohesive zone analysis rocha et al rocha and campilho 2018 as well as the numerical characterization of the material capacity to resist against delaminating stresses as reported by cricrì and perrella 2017 and woo et al 2013 jalalvand et al 2016 described the energy dissipation mechanism of opening delaminations finding out that nonlinear shear deformations in the plies adjacent to the cohesive area absorb a non negligible amount of energy the experimental traction separation relation at the interface was found to be trapezoidal hence trapezoidal law is included in the present numerical work the influence of different shapes of the traction law in the cohesive zone model as available in abaqus on the maximum force was recently studied numerically and experimentally by fernandes and campilho 2017 for an aluminium dcb specimen and by de sousa et al de sousa et al 2017 for an aluminium single lap joint in de sousa et al 2017 the cohesive zone model and the xfem model were com found that the xfem technique was found to be inadequate in particular for crack growth in a mixed mode 1 1 present investigation experimental data on composite materials are often scattered as they also depend on the manufacturing method and on the environmental parameters during the curing of the polymeric matrix temperature and humidity in particular hence reproducible data are a challenging task and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters that describe the mechanical behaviour of the lap joint needs to be assessed to determine the effect of such uncertainties on the strength of the joint in the present paper we will investigate the impact of the constitutive parameters in the traction separation law in the cohesive elements on the strength at failure of a lap joint the aim is to determine the most sensitive constitutive parameter which as a consequence will require a more precise experimental determination to prevent serious error in the joint behaviour results are presented in terms of the impact that each of the investigated cohesive parameters has on the global response i e the maximum axial force before failure the cohesive zone models in two commercial fe software adina heory and modeling 2013 and ls dyna ls dyna r8 1 0 2016 will be used and compared with experimental results from tomaso et al 2014 2 model description material properties and mesh size the specimen which measures 25 mm in width is shown in fig 1 the resulting cohesive area is 12 5 25 0 mm2 the experimental specimen described in tomaso et al 2014 is clamped at both ends with fixed rotations whereas one end can experience axial translation in order to transfer the tensile force these conditions are simulated by the fe model as follows the nodes on the external surfaces of the solid model in the end sections up to 50 mm from each end experience fixed translations namely null on one edge and equal to the imposed axial displacement on the other in order to simulate the clamped condition of the experimental setup by constraining the displacements the specimen rotations are restrained in the model considering that solid elements only have translational degrees of freedom the assumption is acceptable considering the saint venant s principle as the cohesive area is located at a distance of almost one order of magnitude from the elements on which boundary conditions are imposed with respect to the specimen thickness the composite is made mostly by unidirectional carbon fibres in an epoxy matrix with a negligible amount of 45 layers and other non structural plies to improve impregnation and resin distribution detailed data on model parts materials and associated properties are shown in table 1 the steel is modelled as elasto plastic with isotropic hardening with yield stress σ y 315 mpa and ultimate stress σ u 455 mpa the carbon reinforced plastic is modelled as elastic orthotropic material properties are collected in table 1 data for the adhesive epoxy resin is given by the manufacturer and also used in previous work tomaso et al 2014 the fe model required an 8 node hexahedron solid element in both software due to compatibility issues with the cohesive element the maximum element edge size was set to 1 07 mm after a preliminary mesh sensitivity analysis resulting in five layers of elements through the thickness for steel and seven for composite as shown in fig 2 the test is intended to induce an in plane shear stress responsible for mode ii separation of the single lap joint the slight misalignment of the clamped ends as reported by the experimental tests tomaso et al 2014 induces a bending moment responsible for mode i opening behaviour in some areas of the cohesive zone as shown in fig 3 where the numerical model is displayed and magnified at the early stage of cohesive failure as well as at the end of the process in particular it is clear how at one tip of the cohesive areas shear stresses are predominant while mixed mode separation occurs on the opposite edge with a possible predominant mode i fig 3 left 3 cohesive model and reference cohesive parameters the cohesive zone method czm is based on the assumption that stress transfer capacity between the two separating faces of a delamination is not lost completely at damage initiation but rather is a progressive event governed by progressive stiffness reduction of the interface between the two separating faces therefore cohesive elements are modelled in the overlapping area between steel and composite in general there are two types of czm elements first one with zero thickness used to model delamination behaviour of adhesive bonds where the thickness of the interface is negligible the second one is used where the thickness of the interface is considerable although there is not strict border regarding interface thickness both types are used within software packages in adina the element has an initial thickness equal to zero while ls dyna may use a non null initial thickness which was set to 0 5 mm the cohesive element is defined by a traction separation constitutive behaviour which relate the interface traction to the nodal displacement such law is triangular by default in adina while ls dyna allows more complex functions in the present work both triangular bi linear and trapezoidal tri linear laws were tested in a triangular traction separation law three parameters define the cohesive separation whose effects are described in fig 4 the penalty stiffness k which defines the steepness of the initial linear part of the law the energy release rate g ic which is the signed area shaded in fig 4 left under the curve up to the maximum opening displacement at which separation occurs the peak traction σ max t s defining the maximum point in the traction separation law a trapezoidal law can be defined by the same parameters although once the peak traction is reached it remains constant in the so called plateau region for a certain range of displacements before dropping to zero fig 4 right shows tri linear stress displacement curve for pure normal peel and pure tangential shear loading the shape of the curve is determined with user parameters as follows in pure tension t is the yield stress δ n1 is the yield displacement δ n2 is the damage initiation displacement and δ nf is the failure displacement the corresponding parameters for pure shear are s δ t1 δ t2 and δ tf the stiffness k in normal and shear direction is computed as 1 k n t δ n 1 k t s δ t 1 once k and σ max t s are defined the parameter g c also defines the maximum opening displacement the cohesive law can be defined separately for mode i and mode ii although in adina the penalty stiffness must be the same for both modes the cohesive behaviour can act independently for the two modes or it can consider a mixed mode opening behaviour fig 5 the material cohesive model used in ls dyna marzi et al 2009 includes three general irreversible mixed mode interaction cohesive formulations with arbitrary normalized traction separation law given by a load curve these three formulations are differentiated via the type of effective separation parameter where power law is selected the interaction between fracture modes i and ii is considered and irreversible conditions are enforced via a damage formulation unloading reloading path pointing to from the origin traction separation behaviour of this model is mainly given by g ic and t for normal mode i g iic and s for tangential mode ii and an arbitrary normalized traction separation load curve for both modes the total mixed mode relative displacement δ m is defined as 2 δ m δ i 2 δ i i 2 where δ i is the separation in normal direction mode i and δ ii is the separation in tangential direction mode ii the ultimate mixed mode displacement δ f total failure for the power law is 3 δ f 1 β 2 a t s l c t g i c α s x β 2 g i i c α 1 α where β δ ii δ i is the mode mixity and a tslc is the area under the normalized traction separation curve the larger the exponent α is chosen the larger the fracture toughness in mixed mode situations should be therefore in the present work the power law defined in equation 4 is considered and the influence of parameter α investigated 4 g i g i c α g i i g i i c α 1 the separation occurs once inequality 4 is no longer satisfied g i is the signed area defined by the separation law at a specific load step the following reference parameters were chosen previously adopted by tomaso et al 2014 and in good agreement with previous works on epoxy adhesives by prolongo et al 2006 stewart et al 2007 and park and lee 2010 among others see table 1 energy

purposes having this in mind a trapezoidal shape in the traction separation low was used as an option fig 6 left graph from the ls dyna with normalized axis but regarding to material characteristics the triangular shape right is appropriate as well as shown in fernandes and campilho 2017 4 experimental numerical comparison and influence of cohesive parameter 4 1 influence of parameter k the first parameter to be investigated is the penalty stiffness k representing the steepness of the initial linear part of the traction separation curve earlier research from turon et al 2007 proposed a simple relationship between the specimen thickness and the transverse modulus of elasticity to obtain a reference value for the penalty stiffness such formulation was later adopted and discussed by motamedi and milani 2013 based on previously adopted reference parameters range of penalty stiffness k is calculated and in relation to mode i and ls dyna presented in table 2 with the present data the resulting penalty stiffness as proposed by turon et al 2007 would be 4 33e13 nm 3 which is one order of magnitude lower than the reference value from tomaso et al 2014 adopted in the present paper as reference value this fact justifies the wide range of penalty stiffness investigated in current analysis the penalty stiffness is varied in the range 3 8 1012 5 6 1014 for ls dyna and 1011 1016 for adina the results in terms of axial strains are compared to those achieved by strain gauges placed at different spots in the specimen as shown in fig 1 fig 7 indicates that ls dyna model is more sensitive to penalty stiffness in comparison to the adina model although the influence of this parameter is quite poor in both software in general adina better matches the experimental data especially for strain gage 2 and 3 larger errors are found for strain gage 1 where local strains are widely overestimated by both software adina seems to overestimate local strains in all cases while local strains are underestimated by ls dyna on strain gage 3 placed at the bottom of composite side in terms of axial force adina generally over estimate the maximum force before failure while ls dyna underestimates it the maximum force before failure for the models with different penalty stiffness k is also plotted and reported in fig 8 where a quite constant value of force in the range 1011 1016 is shown though ls dyna covers a smaller range outside such range the numerical results quickly diverge in agreement to the behaviour described by song et al song and dàvila 2007 in conclusion it can be said that the penalty stiffness if chosen in a reasonable wide range has low impact on the numerical results and a rough approximation of such value is sufficient 4 2 influence of gc the next step was to investigate the influence of the parameter g c on the maximum force before failure of the single lap joint considering a contemporary variation for both g ic and g iic expressed in percentile value fig 9 the bilinear traction separation law shows a fairly linear trend in the area around the reference value in both adina and ls dyna although in adina the parameter has a greater impact in the determination of the maximum force before failure the ls dyna trilinear law leads to slightly different behaviour but the impact is minimal in terms of failure force adina is much more sensitive to energy release rate variation rather than ls dyna a possible explanation is that when cohesive failure affects one of the elements in the cohesive zone the stress redistribution is more widespread in adina leading to an increment of the force transferred by the surrounding elements this leads to a higher average stress in the cohesive area when increasing the energy release rate and vice versa this is likely due to the mathematical definition of the 3d element also considering the different initial separation being equal to zero in adina the reason why the energy release rate has such a strong impact in the maximum force of the single lap joint is a matter of investigation as one might be lead to think that the parameter could only affect local strains and the global stiffnes of the joint being the peak traction the only responsible for the joint strength hints are found when plotting the distribution of the tangential stress on the cohesive area extracted at the maximum force the results are reported in fig 10 which shows the shear stress at mid width derived from adina and normalized along the longitudinal coordinate of the cohesive zone the figure show different distribution at each value of energy release rate tested expressed at percentual variation over the reference value from fig 10 it can be said that although the maximum stress may not exceed the peak traction of the cohesive law the stress tends to distribute on the cohesive interface transferring a higher force to the joint this is probably due to the fact that for higher values of energy release rate the stress drop becomes smoother past the peak traction keeping higher values of stress for relatively large displacements in practice once the displacement relative to the peak traction has been exceeded the cohesive interface can still sustain relatively high stresses as the traction displacements are increasing as shown in fig 3 4 3 influence of α finally the parameter α described in equation 4 is investigated fig 1 it is worth nothing that in the present case a predominant mode ii opening behaviour is expected although the bending moment led by the misalignment of the two parts of the joint also induces some contribution from mode i in equation 4 the parameter has similar impact on both adina and ls dyna software with similar decrement for α 1 5 conclusions the present research was aimed at determining the effect that a single constitutive parameter among those used to define the cohesive law in typical fe models has on the axial maximum force of a carbon steel single lap joint the authors acknowledge that the experimental validation presented in the current paper is quite limited as it refers to a single specimen although strains were measured at different points however it is worth noting that determining the actual cohesive parameters by tests is quite challenging and the scatter data currently available in literature for epoxy adhesives on different supports confirm this trend for that reason it was decided to investigate the impact that each parameter has on the global behaviour of the joint in order to determine which variables require a precise characterization and which on the contrary can be assumed by a rough approximation being their overall effect minimal in addition two different numerical fe software were tested and compared namely adina and ls dyna as noted above the cohesive algorithm is different in these two programs since ls dyna requires the input of an initial separation which is null by default in adina generally adina tends to overestimate the experimental failure force while ls dyna underestimates it good matching is found for axial strains with better results from adina experimental numerical comparison with strain gauges fig 7 shows good agreement especially for strain gauge 2 and 3 regarding the sensitivity on the numerical cohesive parameters the following conclusions can be made after the present numerical investigation the most significant influence on the maximum force have the variation of energy release rate g c fig 9 the differences regarding the used traction separation curve bilinear trilinear are small although in absolute values the increase in g c leads to a significant increase of the resultant force a 30 increase in g c results in a 15 increase in the reaction force in case of trilinear cohesive law linear dependence is present it should be noted that reference value 100 is g ic 140 jm 2 g iic 280 jm 2 whose ratio is kept constant g iic g ic 2 the reaction force versus displacement response for the whole model with respect to different values of penalty stiffness k shows small differences in term of reaction force therefore a range of k from 1011 to 1015 nm 3 may be equally used in calculations this implies an initial opening displacement from 0 002 mm k 1 to 0 0000135 mm k 4 the shape of a traction separation curve i e law for cohesive elements bilinear triangular or trilinear with plateau trapezoidal figs 4 and 6 in cohesive mixed mode model also has no significant impact on the resultant reaction force this was quite expected since peak traction in normal t and tangential direction s are kept constant as well as energy release rate g c for both modes it means that in case of bilinear curve algorithm calculate or adjust maximal separation in mm from these two constant values t and g c keeping the area under the traction separation curve constant the similar situation is with trilinear curve where the ratio g p g c is keeping constant where g p is the area of the plateau and g c is total area under trilinear curve the influence of the interaction between modes i e power failure criterion exponent α on reaction force shows small differences within range of α 1 5 for both bilinear and trilinear traction separation law fig 11 similar influence is found for parameter α in both software it is recommended to use α between 1 and 2 since the reaction force has maximal values in conclusion the failure force is sensitive to g c variation especially in adina while negligible influence is found for parameter k use of a trilinear or bilinear traction separation law leads to comparable results finally although the numerical models are calibrated nonlinear fe analysis is performed and comparison against available experimental data is made the present work is basically a numerical investigation on the influence of cohesive parameters in fe analysis therefore more experimental analyses are required for the most reliable validation

22092,one of the key issues concerning the use of composite materials in the construction of steel ships or vice versa the use of steel in the construction of composite ships is related to the ways of joining composite parts to the adjacent steel structure carbon steel joints are of increasing interest for the maritime industry but knowledge is scarce applications of adhesive joints as an alternative method to welding or riveting has numerous advantages still gathering more information about the behaviour of such joints through numerical sensitivity analysis and simulation are necessary to speed up applications on ships and marine structures the present investigation aims at assessing the sensitivity of the parameters that define the traction separation law on the numerical simulation of the de bonding of a steel to composite single lap joint following a previous experimental campaign the test is intended to induce a mode ii separation although the slight bending moment caused by the misalignment of the two ends leads to mixed mode effects as well two finite element software were compared adina and ls dyna the influence of peak traction penalty stiffness and energy

high tensile steel czm cohesive zone method 1 introduction the volume and number of applications of composite materials has been growing steadily penetrating and conquering new market relentlessly barbero 2011 as for marine industry the use of composite materials has been on increase since the early 1950s initially fibre reinforced plastics was used for small crafts such as pleasure crafts and lifeboats this has changed over the years to the point where structures having a mass of several hundred tonnes are regularly produced and used generally low cost glass reinforced plastic grp showed poor stiffness which limited the length of full composite ships in the past due to hull girder deformation issues however as composite materials and technology advanced today we have examples of full composite ships up to 70 m long the marine environment is extremely aggressive and this has resulted in a widespread use of fiber reinforced composite materials adhesive bonding is a lightweight and corrosion resistant means of joining these materials da silva et al da silva et al 2011 therefore todays potential applications range from small components such as masts piping bulkheads to larger structures such as ship hulls superstructures or offshore and submersibles structure modules shenoi and wellicome 2008 moreover besides strong research activities on materials for offshore structures for wind energy renewable energy aquafarming and deep sea mining there are several eu projects aimed at developing the applications of composite materials in large scale shipbuilding e g fibreship horizon 2020 programme 2017a ramsses horizon 2020 programme 2017b composites are intended not only as non structural elements such as hatch covers or lower decks for example of car carrier vessels but also as structural part of passenger ships ferries or even larger merchant ships such as container vessels this will also depend on further development of smart composite materials as well as fabrication technologies josefson et al 2018 on the other hand considering composites application on board a steel ship joining composite parts to the adjacent steel structure has been and still remains one of the key issues developing adequate joints should be a baseline for any application simplicity durability and reliability are the recommended design guidelines for designing joints as an alternative method to welding riveting and other conventional fasteners applications of adhesive joints have been used widely in marine structures shipbuilding and offshore industries in an assembly of composite structures usage of mechanical fasteners causes high stress concentration that results in structurally inefficient joints adhesive joints can redistribute the loads so that stress concentrations can be lowered as proposed by sarrado et al 2016 and provide good strength weight and cost effectiveness ratios these requirements cannot be met by mechanical joints the other reasons why adhesive bonding is so desirable compared to other conventional joining methods are adams et al 1997 thinner gage materials can be used with attendant weight and cost savings the number of production parts can be reduced whereas the design is more simplified the need for milling machining and forming operation of details is reduced large area bonds can be made with a minimum work force without special skills provides a high strength to weight ratio with three times higher shearing force of riveted joints improved aerodynamic hydrodynamic smoothness and visual appearance use as a seal and or corrosion preventer when joining incompatible materials excellent electrical and thermal insulation superior fatigue resistance adhesively bonded assemblies have shown a fatigue life twenty times better than riveted structures of identical parts the adhesive is sufficiently flexible to allow for the variations in coefficients of thermal expansion when joining dissimilar materials the use of metal to composite joints has extended into the marine field as a novel method banea et al 2018 from other fields such as automotive and aerospace industry replacement of structures such as masts superstructures even internal non structural decks and bulkheads using composite materials could provide substantial savings in weight and increase seakeeping ability and vessel stability most of the research carried out on metal to composite connections has been on secondary process joints this involves the manufacture of a composite structure and subsequent adhesive bonding to the metallic structure there is increasing interest in producing joints by the co curing method which involves the making of the joint while consolidating the composite material boyd 2006 when large composite components are considered bolting is not usually cost effective as the number of bolts increases the manufacturing process of the joint becomes slow and costly also the bolts are adding weight to composite components on the other hand it is quite difficult to perform effective adhesive bonding in a metal shipyard environment where the conditions in terms of cleanness temperature and humidity form a severe obstacle for achieving adhesively bonded joints with high and uniform quality a way to overcome these problems is to prefabricate metallic joint elements which are adhesively bonded to the composite substructure by the frp manufacturer and then welded to the ship structure such a procedure allows the adhesive joint to be manufactured in a suitable environment and accordingly allows the shipyard to weld the frp parts to the ship in a similar manner as corresponding metal parts composite materials present a number of failure modes which is much higher if compared to traditional isotropic ductile materials current theories only provide reliable results to assess the first ply failure of laminates only among failure modes the most critical to assess is the delamination delamination is also a frequent mode of failure strongly affecting the structural performance of composite laminates the interface between layers offers a low resistance path for crack growth because the bonding between two adjacent layers depends mainly on matrix properties delamination may originate from manufacturing imperfections blass et al 2018 cracks produced by fatigue or low velocity impact stress concentration near geometric or material discontinuities such as joints and free edges or due to high interlaminar stresses barbero 2013 relevant works were conducted in recent years to predict the opening and the growth of delamination in fibre reinforced composites and to assess for their effect in terms of global response of the structure gaiotti et al 2014 compared different numerical strategies to determine the buckling capacity of delaminated composite panels and colombo and vergani 2014 studied the effect of delamination on fatigue behaviour the effects of different parameters of the composite laminate and delaminated area are investigated analytically under buckling load by kharghani kharghani and guedes soares 2016 and the results are compared to three dimensional finite element analysis considering the advances of numerical simulations in this field although the theory was developed in the past decades due to the high computational efforts cohesive elements have become available in finite element software only recently this fact has introduced a new tool to simulate delamination opening and growth turon et al 2018 still current applications are limited to small scale models for two main reasons both related to computational limits primarily because of the higher number of elements required to simulate cohesive layers and secondarily cohesive are solid elements requiring a 3d solid modelling strategy in general cohesive models currently represent a powerful instrument to investigate the influence of adhesive parameters in small scale models while their implementation in large scale design is still limited due to computational limits nevertheless there are some results such as those presented by sonstabo et al 2016 or those in the form of a new cohesive element presented by neumayer at al neumayer et al 2016 that enable the simulation of delamination failure in bonded joints on a full scale structural level the principle of the approach is to compute the through the thickness stresses of the adherends analytically within the cohesive element representing the cohesive behaviour of the complete adhesive over a stress based interaction criterion it becomes possible to detect delamination in the adherents the delamination failure is implemented by an adaptation of the cohesive law the convergence behaviour of the model is improved and numerical efficiency is high and enables a representation of both cohesive failure of the adhesive and delamination failure on a structural level some other promising applications include the evaluation of different modelling conditions in the cohesive zone analysis rocha et al rocha and campilho 2018 as well as the numerical characterization of the material capacity to resist against delaminating stresses as reported by cricrì and perrella 2017 and woo et al 2013 jalalvand et al 2016 described the energy dissipation mechanism of opening delaminations finding out that nonlinear shear deformations in the plies adjacent to the cohesive area absorb a non negligible amount of energy the experimental traction separation relation at the interface was found to be trapezoidal hence trapezoidal law is included in the present numerical work the influence of different shapes of the traction law in the cohesive zone model as available in abaqus on the maximum force was recently studied numerically and experimentally by fernandes and campilho 2017 for an aluminium dcb specimen and by de sousa et al de sousa et al 2017 for an aluminium single lap joint in de sousa et al 2017 the cohesive zone model and the xfem model were com found that the xfem technique was found to be inadequate in particular for crack growth in a mixed mode 1 1 present investigation experimental data on composite materials are often scattered as they also depend on the manufacturing method and on the environmental parameters during the curing of the polymeric matrix temperature and humidity in particular hence reproducible data are a challenging task and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters that describe the mechanical behaviour of the lap joint needs to be assessed to determine the effect of such uncertainties on the strength of the joint in the present paper we will investigate the impact of the constitutive parameters in the traction separation law in the cohesive elements on the strength at failure of a lap joint the aim is to determine the most sensitive constitutive parameter which as a consequence will require a more precise experimental determination to prevent serious error in the joint behaviour results are presented in terms of the impact that each of the investigated cohesive parameters has on the global response i e the maximum axial force before failure the cohesive zone models in two commercial fe software adina heory and modeling 2013 and ls dyna ls dyna r8 1 0 2016 will be used and compared with experimental results from tomaso et al 2014 2 model description material properties and mesh size the specimen which measures 25 mm in width is shown in fig 1 the resulting cohesive area is 12 5 25 0 mm2 the experimental specimen described in tomaso et al 2014 is clamped at both ends with fixed rotations whereas one end can experience axial translation in order to transfer the tensile force these conditions are simulated by the fe model as follows the nodes on the external surfaces of the solid model in the end sections up to 50 mm from each end experience fixed translations namely null on one edge and equal to the imposed axial displacement on the other in order to simulate the clamped condition of the experimental setup by constraining the displacements the specimen rotations are restrained in the model considering that solid elements only have translational degrees of freedom the assumption is acceptable considering the saint venant s principle as the cohesive area is located at a distance of almost one order of magnitude from the elements on which boundary conditions are imposed with respect to the specimen thickness the composite is made mostly by unidirectional carbon fibres in an epoxy matrix with a negligible amount of 45 layers and other non structural plies to improve impregnation and resin distribution detailed data on model parts materials and associated properties are shown in table 1 the steel is modelled as elasto plastic with isotropic hardening with yield stress σ y 315 mpa and ultimate stress σ u 455 mpa the carbon reinforced plastic is modelled as elastic orthotropic material properties are collected in table 1 data for the adhesive epoxy resin is given by the manufacturer and also used in previous work tomaso et al 2014 the fe model required an 8 node hexahedron solid element in both software due to compatibility issues with the cohesive element the maximum element edge size was set to 1 07 mm after a preliminary mesh sensitivity analysis resulting in five layers of elements through the thickness for steel and seven for composite as shown in fig 2 the test is intended to induce an in plane shear stress responsible for mode ii separation of the single lap joint the slight misalignment of the clamped ends as reported by the experimental tests tomaso et al 2014 induces a bending moment responsible for mode i opening behaviour in some areas of the cohesive zone as shown in fig 3 where the numerical model is displayed and magnified at the early stage of cohesive failure as well as at the end of the process in particular it is clear how at one tip of the cohesive areas shear stresses are predominant while mixed mode separation occurs on the opposite edge with a possible predominant mode i fig 3 left 3 cohesive model and reference cohesive parameters the cohesive zone method czm is based on the assumption that stress transfer capacity between the two separating faces of a delamination is not lost completely at damage initiation but rather is a progressive event governed by progressive stiffness reduction of the interface between the two separating faces therefore cohesive elements are modelled in the overlapping area between steel and composite in general there are two types of czm elements first one with zero thickness used to model delamination behaviour of adhesive bonds where the thickness of the interface is negligible the second one is used where the thickness of the interface is considerable although there is not strict border regarding interface thickness both types are used within software packages in adina the element has an initial thickness equal to zero while ls dyna may use a non null initial thickness which was set to 0 5 mm the cohesive element is defined by a traction separation constitutive behaviour which relate the interface traction to the nodal displacement such law is triangular by default in adina while ls dyna allows more complex functions in the present work both triangular bi linear and trapezoidal tri linear laws were tested in a triangular traction separation law three parameters define the cohesive separation whose effects are described in fig 4

opening displacement at which separation occurs the peak traction σ max t s defining the maximum point in the traction separation law a trapezoidal law can be defined by the same parameters although once the peak traction is reached it remains constant in the so called plateau region for a certain range of displacements before dropping to zero fig 4 right shows tri linear stress displacement

computed as 1 k n t δ n 1 k t s δ t 1 once k and σ max t s are defined the parameter g c also defines the maximum opening displacement the cohesive law can be defined separately for mode i and mode ii although in adina the penalty stiffness must be the same for both modes the cohesive behaviour can act independently for the two modes or it can consider a mixed mode opening behaviour fig 5 the material cohesive model used in ls dyna marzi et al 2009 includes three general irreversible mixed mode interaction cohesive formulations with arbitrary normalized traction separation law given by a

strong impact in the maximum force of the single lap joint is a matter of investigation as one might be lead to think that the parameter could only affect local strains and the global stiffnes of the joint being the peak traction the only responsible for the joint strength hints are found when plotting the distribution of the tangential stress on the cohesive area extracted at the maximum force the results are reported in fig 10 which shows the shear stress at mid width derived from adina and normalized along the longitudinal coordinate of the cohesive zone the figure show different distribution at each value of energy release rate tested expressed at percentual variation over the reference value from fig 10 it can be said that although the maximum stress may not exceed the peak traction of the cohesive law the stress tends to distribute on the cohesive interface transferring a higher force to the joint this is probably due to the fact that for higher values of energy release rate the stress drop becomes smoother past the peak traction keeping higher values of stress for relatively large displacements in practice once the displacement relative to the peak traction has been exceeded the cohesive interface can still sustain relatively high stresses as the traction displacements are increasing as shown in fig 3 4 3 influence of α finally the parameter α described in equation 4 is investigated fig 1 it is worth nothing that in the present case a predominant mode ii opening behaviour is expected although the bending moment led by the misalignment of the two parts of the joint also induces some contribution from mode i in equation 4 the parameter has similar impact on both adina and ls dyna software with similar decrement for α 1 5 conclusions the present research was aimed at determining the effect that a single constitutive parameter among those used to define the cohesive law in typical fe models has on the axial maximum force of a carbon steel single lap joint the authors acknowledge that the experimental validation presented in the current paper is quite limited as it refers to a single specimen although strains were measured at different points however it is worth noting that determining the actual cohesive parameters by tests is quite challenging and the scatter data currently available in literature for epoxy adhesives on different supports confirm this trend for that reason it was decided to investigate the impact that each parameter has on the global behaviour of the joint in order to determine which variables require a precise characterization and which on the contrary can be assumed by a rough approximation being their overall effect minimal in addition two different numerical fe software were tested and compared namely adina and ls dyna as noted above the cohesive algorithm is different in these two programs since ls dyna requires the input of an initial separation which is null by default in adina generally adina tends to overestimate the experimental failure force while ls dyna underestimates it good matching is found for axial strains with better results from adina experimental numerical comparison with strain gauges fig 7 shows good agreement especially for strain gauge 2 and 3 regarding the sensitivity on the numerical cohesive parameters the following conclusions can be made after the present numerical investigation the most significant influence on the maximum force have the variation of energy release rate g c fig 9 the differences regarding the used traction separation curve bilinear trilinear are small although in absolute values the increase in g c leads to a significant increase of the resultant force a 30 increase in g c results in a 15 increase in the reaction force in case of trilinear cohesive law linear dependence is present it should be noted that reference value 100 is g ic 140 jm 2 g iic 280 jm 2 whose ratio is kept constant g iic g ic 2 the reaction force versus displacement response for the whole model with respect to different values of penalty stiffness k shows small differences in term of reaction force therefore a range of k from 1011 to 1015 nm 3 may be equally used in calculations this implies an initial opening displacement from 0 002 mm k 1 to 0 0000135 mm k 4 the shape of a traction separation curve i e law for cohesive elements bilinear triangular or trilinear with plateau trapezoidal figs 4 and 6 in cohesive mixed mode model also has no significant impact on the resultant reaction force this was quite expected since peak traction in normal t and tangential direction s are kept constant as well as energy release rate g c for both modes it means that in case of bilinear curve algorithm calculate or adjust maximal separation in mm from these two constant values t and g c keeping the area under the traction separation curve constant the similar situation is with trilinear curve where the ratio g p g c is keeping constant where g p is the area of the plateau and g c is total area under trilinear curve the influence of the interaction between modes i e power failure criterion exponent α on reaction force shows small differences within range of α 1 5 for both bilinear and trilinear traction separation law fig 11 similar influence is found for parameter α in both software it is recommended to use α between 1 and 2 since the reaction force has maximal values in conclusion the failure force is sensitive to g c variation especially in adina while negligible influence is found for parameter k use of a trilinear or bilinear traction separation law leads to comparable results finally although the numerical models are calibrated nonlinear fe analysis is performed and comparison against available experimental data is made the present work is basically a numerical investigation on the influence of cohesive parameters in fe analysis therefore more experimental analyses are required for the most reliable validation

22093,in the present study the occurrence of bragg resonance has been demonstrated due to scattering of long gravity waves by an array of submerged trenches in the presence of the sloping sea bed the closed form long wave analytical solutions are derived using the solutions of bessel equations and validated with numerical results obtained via the boundary element method bem known results in case of submerged breakwaters in water of uniform depth are reproduced as special cases while both analytic and numerical results are compared for accuracy role of various physical parameters such as trench configurations depth width sloping angle and distance between the adjacent trenches are investigated by analyzing the reflection coefficient optimal collocation curves for different trench configurations reveal that maximal peak bragg reflection varies approximately linearly with a change in water depth in case of a pair of trenches and follows certain non linear pattern in the case of multiple trenches the study reveals that bragg reflection is larger due to a change in seabed slope between the trenches than that of trenches having uniform sloping seabed keywords long gravity waves bessel function peak bragg reflection submerged trenches sloping seabed boundary elementary method 1 introduction in recent decades the frequency of occurrence of storm surges due to global warming are in the rise which leads to large scale destruction of facilities and infrastructures along the coastal zone moreover the upsurge in human activities has brought in additional challenges to the coastal zone for reducing the impact of wave loads on marine facilities and attenuating wave heights various structural and non structural methods are being practiced one of the non structural methods for increasing wave reflection and creating a tranquility zone is the bragg scattering of gravity waves by an array of submerged trenches the bragg resonance phenomenon was first observed and discussed by bragg et al 1913 while performing the experiment of x rays reflection by crystalline solids the occurrences of bragg resonance due to the propagation of surface gravity waves by sinusoidally varying bottom topography was shown experimentally by heathershaw 1982 it was demonstrated that bragg resonance occurs when the wave length of the sinusoidal bottom bed profile is half of the wavelength of the incident wave davies 1982b used the fourier transform method to study the bragg resonance phenomena in case of surface gravity waves passed over a sinusoidally varying topography the observation is same as mentioned in heathershaw 1982 davies 1982a extended the aforementioned study for second order wave theory a considerable study on the occurrence of bragg resonance due to surface gravity wave propagation on different periodic bed profiles has been made by davies and heathershaw 1984 dalrymple and kirby 1986 liu 1987 and mei et al 1988 kirby and anton 1990 studied the bragg reflection of free surface gravity waves by artificial bars placed on the bottom bed in a discrete manner both theoretical and experimental analysis were conducted mattioli 1990 studied bragg resonant reflection of surface gravity waves by a series of rectangular submerged bars guazzelli et al 1992 experimentally demonstrated the occurrence of higher order bragg reflection due to the propagation of small amplitude gravity waves over doubly sinusoidal beds the study reveals that higher order effects are a combination of harmonic and subharmonic bragg reflections with subharmonic reflection being large for small bottom undulation hsu et al 2003 studied the bragg scattering of gravity waves by an array of submerged bars using mild slope approximation method wang et al 2006

the bragg scattering of gravity waves by an array of floating horizontal flexible membranes in the presence of submerged rectangular bars recently kar et al 2019 studied the effect of bragg scattering due to multiple bottom undulations on a floating dock in finite water depth these studies were based on the linearized theory of water waves during the last two decades significant progress on the study of bragg scattering of gravity waves using finite amplitude wave theory has been witnessed in the literature liu and yue 1998 used a perturbation method and a higher order spectral approach to study the generalized bragg reflection due to bottom ripples by taking fully nonlinear boundary conditions into consideration on the other hand a higher order spectral method was developed by guyenne and nicholls 2007 to simulate nonlinear surface gravity waves propagation over static and moving bottom topography in this study bragg resonance was discussed for sinusoidal varying topography using the nonlinear boussinesq equation hsu et al 2007 developed a numerical model for analyzing bragg scattering of surface water waves by submerged bars alam et al 2009a b demonstrated the occurrence of bragg reflection due to the interaction of gravity waves by ripples in the seabed in case of a stratified fluid model having a free surface and an interface by taking into account the non linear free surface boundary conditions using the multipole expansion method liu et al 2016 examined the bragg reflection of surface waves by multiple semicircular breakwaters in these studies as mentioned above the undulated bottom bed is considered as rigid on the other hand mase and takeba 1995 studied the bragg scattering of gravity waves over a porous seabed using biot s theory of poroelastic media lan et al 2011 analyzed the scattering of surface waves propagating by an array of rectangular poroelastic bars and demonstrated the phenomenon of bragg resonance ning et al 2016 used time domain higher order boundary element method to obtain the numerical solution for the diffraction of non linear water waves they have also performed experimental validation apart from the use of various approximate methods for analyzing bragg reflection of gravity waves due to bottom undulation in finite water depth analytic methods are employed to study bragg reflection of linear long gravity waves due to changes in the sea bed chang and liou 2007 investigated long gravity waves scattering by an array of submerged trapezoidal breakwaters using the matching method liu et al 2012b studied analytically long wave reflection by breakwaters and trenches having curvilinear slopes medina rodríguez et al 2016 investigated scattering of linear long gravity waves by cycloidal breakwaters of varied configurations apart from the various study on long wave scattering of breakwaters of varied configurations efforts have been made to obtain optimal collocation of breakwater configurations for maximum wave reflection liu et al 2015a b plotted optimal collocation curves in case of different types of bragg breakwaters for maximum reflection of long waves in uniform water depth zeng et al 2017 derived the optimal collocation curves for long wave reflection by an array of rectangular bragg breakwaters placed on a sloping seabed unlike the case of bragg reflection by multiple breakwaters there is a negligible study on the scattering of long waves by an array of trenches moreover no study is available to the author s knowledge on obtaining optimal collocation curves in case submerged trenches for maximum bragg reflection liu et al 2019 studied the bragg reflection of regular water waves over fringing reefs based on fully non linear boussinesq model funwave tvd kaur et al 2019 used an analytic solution technique to study the obliquely incident water wave propagation over a pair of asymmetrical rectangular trenches liu et al 2020 studied the bragg resonant reflection of surface gravity waves by a finite array of trapezoidal bars in case of short long and intermediate wave ranges in the present manuscript the bragg scattering of long gravity waves by an array of submerged rectangular trenches over sloping seabed of different configurations is studied in two dimensions the physical problem is studied analytically in terms of bessel s function and is validated with numerical solution obtained via boundary element method various known results in the literature are reproduced in special cases from the solutions of the general model role of different physical parameters such as trench width and depth trench configurations seabed slopes and the distance between adjacent sides of trenches on bragg scattering is analyzed from the numerical results on reflection coefficient moreover optimum collocation curves are plotted for different trench dimensions and seabed slope for determining maximum bragg reflection 2 mathematical formulation scattering of surface gravity wave by an array of trenches is investigated on a sloping sea bed in the two dimensions here the x axis is along the horizontal direction and the y axis is vertically downward the position of the series of trenches sloping sea bed profiles and associated water depths are shown in fig 1 under the assumption of linearized water wave theory with the motion being simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω the velocity potential φ x y t is of the form re ϕ x y e i ω t with re being the real part of the complex expression and i 1 thus the velocity potential ϕ satisfies 1 2 ϕ

radiation conditions as in eq 4 has the alternate form given by 8 lim x x i k ϕ 1 ϕ 3 0 on γ c 1 γ c 2 where ϕ 1 ϕ ϕ i n c k k 1 on γ c 1 and ϕ 3 ϕ k k 3 on γ c 2 respectively using green s second

g d γ with c being the constant and depends on the angle between the linear boundary elements now the total boundary of the computational domain used in the boundary element method as shown is fig 2 is discretized into a large number of line segments termed as boundary elements and it is assumed that ϕ and ϕ n are linearly varying over each segment in this way eq 11 is transformed into the following system of linear equations 12 j 1 n f h i j k 1 g i j ϕ j γ f j 1 n b h i j ϕ j γ b j 1 n c 2 h i j i k 3 g i j ϕ j γ c 2 j 1 n c 1 h i j i k 1 g i j ϕ j γ c 1 j 1 n c 1 ϕ i n c j x g i j i

influence coefficients in the literature here c i α i 2 π with α i being the angle between the boundary elements γ i 1 and γ i it is to be noted that in eq 14 the expressions for g k i j and h k i j

influence coefficients are calculated using gaussian quadrature formula on the other hand if the field points matches with the source points logarithmic and cauchy type singularity will appear and the influence coefficients are calculated analytically the details for the same is provided in katsikadelis 2016 it is worth mentioning that the total number of boundary elements over the computational domain n is same at the sum of the number of boundary elements over the sub boundaries as in eq 12 i e n n f n b n c 1 n c 2 using method of collocation as in katsikadelis 2016 a system of linear equations is generated which is solved numerically for determining the velocity potentials over the boundaries of the computational domain then using the far field boundary conditions as in eq 4 the unknowns r and t are computed finally the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t are evaluated using the formulae as in kar et al 2018 18 k r r i ω g a ϕ x 0 e i k 1 x 1 x 19 and k t t ω g a ϕ x 0 x here ϕ 0 and ϕ 0 are located on the right and left most panel at the free surface respectively 4 analytic solutions in case of long waves in this section small amplitude long gravity waves propagating over the series of submerged rectangular trenches as shown in fig 1 are studied analytically using the technique of matrix multiplication two types of slopes namely slopes in between trenches and trenches with slopes are considered as discussed in the previous section the co ordinate system characteristics of fluid and its motion is assumed to be the same as discussed in section 2 thus the free surface elevation ζ x t is assumed to be of the form ζ x t re η x e i ω t where η x is the spatial component of the free surface elevation under the assumption that u v are the velocity component of the fluid in two dimensions the equation of motion in the case of linearized long waves takes the form 20 u t g ζ x 0 moreover the continuity equation associated with linearized long wave equation is given by 21 ζ t h u x 0 where h x is the depth function of seabed profile of the submerged trench as defined in eqs 6 7 thus from eqs 20 and 21 the long wave equation in terms of the free surface elevation η x is obtained as see as sahoo 2012 and dean and dalrymple 1991 22 d dx h x d η dx k 1 η 0 hence for constant water depth h x h t for t 1 2 3 eq 22 reduces to 23 d dx d η dx k 1 h t η 0 after rewriting eq 23 we have 24 d 2 η dx 2 k t 2 η 0 where k t 2 k 1 h t i e k t k 1 h t for t 1 2 3 represents wave number of the propagating waves using the bed profile h x as in eq 6 in the case of trenches having bottom slope β 1 solution of eq 24 in open water regions of constant depths are given by as in zeng et al 2017 25 η x e i k 1 x x 1 1 a r e i k 1 x x 1 1 for x x 1 1 a 1 j e i k 2 x x j 2 a 2 j e i k 2 x x j 2 for x j 1 x x j 2 a t e i k 3 x x n 2 for x x n 2 for j 1 2 3 n and using another form of depth function h x as in eq 7 in case of trenches with linear slope β 2 the form of solutions of eq 24 in open water regions of constant depths are expressed as 26 η x e i k 1 x x 1 1 a r e i k 1 x x 1 1 for x x 1 1 a 1 j e i k 1 x x j 1 1 a 2 j e i k 1 x x j 1 1 for x j 2 x x j 1 1 j 1 2 3 n 1 a t e i k 1 x x n 2 for x x n 2 where a r and a t are the unknown complex amplitudes of the reflected and the transmitted waves respectively a 1 j and a 2 j are unknowns which are related with the amplitudes of the waves propagating along inclined region proceeding in a similar manner as mentioned in the previous section k r and k t are defined as 27 k r a r and k t a t assuming x x is a common boundary continuity of pressure and flow fluxes across the interface boundaries between the trench and open water regions yield 28 η x η x h x d η d x x h x d η d x x next full solutions of η x for long wave propagation over trenches in different slope regions are discussed separately in the subsequent subsections 4 1 non dimensionalization in case of constant water depth h j for j 1 2 3 we define k j k j h j as the dimensional wave numbers corresponding to the water depths h j in case of slope β 1 we define k j 1 k 1 h j 1 and k j 2 k 1 h j 2 as the non dimensional wave numbers corresponding water depths h j 1 h x j 1 for j 2 3 n and h j 2 h x j 2 for j 1 2 3 n 1 where h x is defined as in eq 6 similarly in case of trenches with slope β 2 k j 1 k 1 h j 1 k j 2 k 1 h j 2 are defined as the non dimensional wave numbers corresponding to the water depths h j 1 h x j 1 and h j 2 h x j 2 for j 1 2 3 n where h x is defined as in eq 7 as used in bartholomeusz 1958 various non dimensional variables h 1 h 1 h 2 w w l 1 d 2 d l 1 are used for better understanding the phenomena in different cases as in zeng et al 2017 where l j 2 π k j for j 1 2

scattering over trenches placed over sloping sea bed for the purpose of numerical computation numerical codes are written using matlab software the slopes tan β j for j 1 2 are selected appropriately ensuring that the condition n 1 d w h 2 tan β j h for j 1 2 is satisfied for consistency of bed slope moreover the values of different physical parameters such as water depths h 1 4 m trench depth h 2 1 5 h 1 the trench width w 90 m the distance between two adjacent sides of trenches d 180 m and tan β j 1 500 for j 1 2 are kept fixed unless otherwise mentioned as define in zeng et al 2017 from eq 24 we have k 1 k t k t for t 1 2 3 so k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 3 i e k 1 k 2 h 2 h 1 1 5 and k 3 k 1 h 1 h 3 hence k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 1 5 k 1 and k 3 k 1 k 3 k 1 h 3 h 1 k 1 k 1 as h 2 h 1 1 5 and h 3 h 1 1 as tan β j 0 for j 1 2 respectively thus in the subsequent numerical discussions the range of k 1 is fixed as 0 k 1 0 26 to ensure that the non dimensional wave numbers k 1 k 2 and k 3 lie in the shallow water regime 5 1 convergence of the boundary element method in the present subsection the convergence of the solutions based on the boundary element method is discussed for trenches with three different slopes the convergence of the numerical computations based on the boundary element method depends on the panel size used to discretize the physical boundaries the panel size is inversely proportional to the wave number k 1 of the incident wave as stated in kar et al 2018 therefore the panel size p s is expressed in the form p s 1 κ k 1 with κ being the constant of proportionality to be determined from the convergence study table 1 demonstrate the convergence study of solution based on boundary element method for wave scattering by trenches with different slopes respectively it is observed that the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients converge up to three decimal places for κ 30 in both the cases trenches thus for the sake of convergence of the solutions panel size is chosen judiciously with κ 30 in the subsequent numerical computations 5 2 validation of numerical and analytic solutions in fig 3 a reflection coefficient k r versus k 1 and b maximal peak bragg reflection b max versus non dimensional depth of the breakwaters h are plotted for similar data sets as mentioned in zeng et al 2017 fig 3 a depicts that present bem solution with linear elements agrees well with that of zeng et al 2017 moreover fig 3 b demonstrates that present analytic long wave solution matches exactly with maximum peak bragg reflection curve as in fig 14 b of zeng et al 2017 in fig 5 the analytic long wave solutions are compared with bem solutions as discussed above in the present study in case of trenches having slopes a tan β 1 1 500 with β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 with β 1 0 with n 3 both figs 5 a and 5 b reveal that the analytic and numerical solutions are well matched hence the analytic method can be used for water of intermediate depth moreover fig 5 reveals that bragg resonance reflection occurs in the case of an array of submerged trenches with two types of slopping sea bed which was observed in case of trenches over the sloping bed as in zeng et al 2017 a comparison of figs 5 a and 5 b demonstrates that wave reflection is higher for trenches with slope in between trenches than trenches having slope which is due to a decrease in water depths in between the trenches since analytic results are suitable for long waves i e 0 k 1 0 26 effect of bottom slope is analyzed using bem in fig 4 to understand bragg resonance pattern for wave number in the range 0 k 1 3 covering long waves and waves of intermediate depth in fig 4 the reflection coefficient k r versus wave number k 1 are plotted in case of finite water depth for rectangular trenches having slopes a tan β 1 1 500 with β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 with β 1 0 with h 0 33 n 3 w 30 m d 60 m and h 1 4 m fig 4 depicts that amplitude of wave reflection k r decreases as wave number k 1 increases further bragg reflection occurs once only for all k 1 and is restricted to the long wave regime the result is similar to that of kar et al 2019 further the occurrence of multiple subharmonic peaks occurs between two consecutive harmonic peaks moreover frequency of occurrence of zero reflection reduces due to the presence of sloping bed a comparison between figs 4 a and 4 b reveals that amplitude of wave reflection is higher in case trenches having slope in between the trenches since various numerical results based on the analytic and numerical methods agree well in the long wave regime for 0 k 1 0 26 see fig 5 the subsequent analysis is performed using the analytic solution derived based on long wave theory and the study is restricted to 0 k 1 0 26 it may be noted that the present analytic solution is computationally more efficient and requires much less time compared to the numerical code for the physical problem understudy however the boundary element solution can be used to analyze the physical problem in finite water depth 5 3 effect of trench dimensions on bragg reflection fig 6 demonstrates the change of the reflection coefficient k r against wave number k 1 for different slope a tan β 1 and β 2 0 b tan β 2 and β 1 0 with h 0 33 n 3 w 90 m d 100 m and h 1 4 m fig 6 a reveals that as the in slope in between the trenches β 1 increases reflection coefficient increases this is because of the bragg reflection of water waves by the sloping seabeds within the gap between the trenches the pattern in wave reflection is similar to that of the bragg scattering by an array of asymmetric trenches as discussed in kar et al 2018 however fig 6 b reveals that with an increase in the trench slope β 2 amplitude of bragg reflection decreases which is due to the decrease in water depth within the trenches moreover in the presence of sea bed slope non zero minima in bragg reflection occurs which approaches to zero as the sloping angle approaches to zero which is similar to that of kar et al 2018 in case of uniform sea bed in fig 7 the reflection coefficient k r n 1 is plotted against wave number k 1 for different number of trenches n with slope a tan β 1 1 500 β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 β 1 0 fig 7 reveals that the span in the pattern of the reflection coefficient increases as the number of submerged trenches increases further subharmonic peaks are observed in wave reflection for an array of multiple trenches and between two consecutive harmonic peaks the total number of subharmonic peaks is found to be two less than the number of trenches which is similar to the observation found in kar et al 2018 moreover the amplitude of the harmonic peak in the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in wave number a comparison of figs 7 a and 7 b reveals that the wave reflection is higher in the presence of slope in between trenches relative to that of submerged trenches with slope which is similar to the observation made in fig 3 in fig 8 k r versus k 1 is plotted for different values of trench depth h in case of trenches having slopes a tan β 1 1 500 and β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 with β 1 0 n 3 w 90 m d 100 m h 1 4 m both the figures reveal that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in trench depth moreover certain phase shift in the reflection coefficient pattern occurs as the depth ratio h increases further it is observed that the optima in the harmonic and subharmonic peak depression of the reflection coefficient increases with an increase is wave number k 1 the change in the reflection coefficient k r is plotted against wave number k 1 in fig 9 for different values of trench a width w with d 180 m and b distance between adjacent sides of trenches d with tan β 1 1 500 β 2 0 with w 90 m fig 9 a exhibits that maxima in bragg reflection decrease as the trench width increases whilst fig 9 b demonstrates the opposite trend as the distance between the adjacent side of trenches d increases however the trend in the occurrence of optima in bragg reflection varies alternately with the change in trench width w the distance between the adjacent side of trenches d as wave number k 1 increases hereafter bragg reflection b r max k r n h w d β 1 β 2 and maximal peak bragg reflection b max max b r by a series of trenches placed on sloping sea bed similar to the definition in case of wave scattering by multiple submerged breakwaters as defined in zeng et al 2017 are studied by optimizing the non dimensional parameters associated with trenches such as trench depth h 1 h 1 h 2 trench width w w l 1 and the relative trench distance d 2 d l 1 since the choice of the number of trenches is independent of the position of occurrence of optima in wave reflection with respect to distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches d and trench width w hereafter number of trenches have been chosen independently to understand the optima in the amplitude of bragg reflection it is noted that as 0 k 1 0 26 so l 1 2 π k 1 96 66 hence maximum value of the dimensionless parameters such as d and w are d 2 d l 1 2 180 96 66 3 72 and w w l 1 90 96 66 0 93 respectively hence in the subsequent study range of d and w are restricted to 0 d 3 72 and 0 w 0 93 respectively fig 10 a exhibits the change in the reflection coefficient k r against the distance between the adjacent sides of trenches d whereas fig 10 b illustrates the changes in the bragg reflection coefficient b r against trench width w for different values of slope in between trenches tan β 1 with h 0 33 n 3 β 2 0 h 1 4 m l 1 40 π m fig 10 a reveals that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in the slope tan β 1 within the range 1 2000 to 1 300 fig 10 a depicts that the magnitude of the harmonic peak in wave reflection attains maximum almost when the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches is approximately an integer multiple of half of the wavelength irrespective of the sloping angle β 1 a similar phenomenon in case of long gravity wave interaction with multiple submerged breakwaters of different configurations was referred as the principle of bragg reflection by liu et al 2015a b moreover the changes in the occurrence of maxima in wave reflection are due to the increase in the sloping angle β 1 taking into the point of maxima in the occurrence of bragg reflection the global maximum in bragg reflection b r is plotted against trench width w for d 3 see table 2 fig 10 b depicts that the global maximum of the bragg resonant reflection b r increases when the seabed slope increases moreover fig 10 b reveals that when n 3 and the sea bed tan β 1 1 300 the bragg resonant reflection b r attends its global maximum value 0 69 when the trench width 0 3 times the wavelength of the incident waves fig 11 a illustrates the changes in the reflection coefficient k r versus the distance between the adjacent sides of trenches d with w 0 2 whereas fig 11 b shows the variation of bragg reflection coefficient b r against trench width w for different trench slope tan β 2 with h 0 33 n 3 β 1 0 h 1 4 m l 1 40 π m fig 11 a reveals that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in slope tan β 1 within the range 1 2000 to 1 300 fig 11 a depicts that the magnitude of the harmonic peak of reflection coefficient attains maximum almost when the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches is approximately an integer multiple of half of the wavelength irrespective of the sloping angle β 2 which follows the principle of bragg reflection as discussed in fig 10 a however a comparison of figs 10 a and 11 a reveals that the variation in the occurrence of maxima in wave reflection due to the increase in the sloping angle β 2 is negligible compared to that of β 1 which is due to the fact that due to an increase in water depth the trench slope is less effective in reflecting the resonating waves than the slope of the seabed within the distance between the trenches to understand the effective role of bragg resonance in creating a tranquility zone taking the points of maxima in bragg reflection as evaluated in fig 11 a global maximum in bragg reflection b r is plotted against trench width w at d 1 see table 3 fig 11 b depicts that the global maximum of the bragg resonant reflection b r increases when the seabed slope decreases moreover fig 11 b reveals that when seabed slope tan β 2 1 1500 bragg resonant reflection b r attends its global maximum value 0 55 when the trench width is close to 0 3 times the wavelength of the incident waves further global maxima in bragg reflection does not change with a further decrease in slope below 1 1500 in fig 12 reflection coefficient k r against distance between the adjacent side of trenches d is plotted for various values of non dimensional trench width w with h 0 33 h 1 4 m l 1 40 π m in case of multiple trenches fig 12 depicts that the magnitude of harmonic peak of reflection coefficient attains maximum almost under the bragg resonance condition d 1 irrespective of the number of trenches however the wave reflection pattern neither follows any uniform increasing decreasing pattern with an increase in trench width for 0 05 w 0 60 irrespective of the number of trenches figs 12 a 12 f reveal that minima in wave reflection increases with an increase in trench slope on the other hand figs 12 a 12 c depicts that wave reflection increases with an increase in the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches whilst figs 12 d 12 f demonstrates the opposite trend however figs 12 g 12 i reveals the occurrence of zero reflection in case of trenches having uniform sea bed i e with β 1 0 and β 2 0 and the general pattern of wave reflection remains uniform as the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches increases this observation was first reported by xie et al 2011 and later confirmed by liu et al 2012b moreover all the sub figures reveal the occurrence of subharmonic peaks in the graph of the reflection coefficient when the number of trenches is more than two irrespective of seabed slope a comparison between figs 8 and 12 demonstrates that optimum in the bragg reflection depends on the distance between the adjacent sides of trenches and trench width simultaneously thus to account for maximum bragg reflection trench dimensions are optimized in the subsequent analysis fig 13 demonstrates the variation of bragg reflection b r versus trench width w in case of a c tan β 1 1 300 β 2 0 d f tan β 2 1 1500 β 1 0 and g i β 1 0 β 2 0 with h 1 4 m and l 1 40 π m for various values of relative trench depth h 1 h 1 h 2 moreover the results are plotted for n 2 5 and 10 in figs 12 a d g 12 b e h and 12 c f i respectively in all the subfigures 13 a 13 i the global maximum of b r is marked with the symbol further these peak values and positions are provided in tables 4 6 all the subfigures show that the global maximum of b r increases as the trench depth h increases however the amplitude of bragg reflection is higher in the presence of slope in between trenches relative to that of trenches having a slope which is similar to the observation made in figs 3 and 6 further it is observed that the number of optima in bragg reflection increases as trench depth h as well as the number of trenches n increases moreover the global maxima in bragg reflection occur for smaller values of the trench width w as trench depth increases further in the case of seabed slope in between trenches global maxima in bragg reflection approach to unity irrespective of trench depth for a higher number of trenches fig 14 demonstrates the variation of optimal curves w w n h against trench depth h in case of a tan β 1 1 300 β 2 0 b tan β 2 1 1500 β 1 0 and c β 1 0 β 2 0 for different numbers of multiple trenches n with h 1 4 m and l 1 40 π m fig 14 a reveals that for any fixed n n an optimal curve w w n h exists this means in the optimal curve w w n h for any given dimensionless trench depth h the associated dimensionless trench width is given by w w n h fig 15 demonstrates the maximal peak bragg reflection b max against trench depth h in case of a tan β 1 1 300 β 2 0 b tan β 2 1 1500 β 1 0 and c β 1 0 β 2 0 for different numbers of multiple trenches n with h 1 4 m and l 1 40 π m fig 15 exhibits the maximum peak bragg reflection coefficients associated with the optimal trench dimensions w n h it is observed that the maximum peak bragg resonant reflection b max in optimum trenches are approximately linear concerning the dimensionless trench depth h in case of two trenches and nonlinear in nature for a higher number of trenches the non linearity in the pattern of maximum peak bragg resonant reflection b max curve is due to the presence of harmonic and subharmonic peaks in wave reflection a similar pattern has been exhibited by zeng et al 2017 in case of multiple bragg breakwaters over the sloping sea bed 6 conclusion in this paper the scattering of long wave over an array of submerged trenches having sloping sea bed is investigated numerically using the boundary element method the closed form analytic long wave solutions obtained using the solution of bessel equation and matrix multiplication method are validated with the numerical solutions obtained via the boundary elementary method three types of bed slope are considered to understand the effect of seabed slope on maximum bragg reflection known results related to surface gravity wave scattering by bragg breakwaters are reproduced as special cases the study reveals that the reflection coefficient increases as the sloping angle in between trenches increases and decreases with an increase in slope for trenches having a slope however for multiple trenches with sloping bed subharmonic peaks are found in the bragg reflection the number of subharmonic peaks between two harmonic peaks in bragg reflection is found to be two less than the number of trenches which is similar to that of wave scattering by an array of multiple trenches over uniform seabed as discussed in the literature further the study depicted that the magnitude of the harmonic peak of the reflection coefficient attains maximum when the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches is approximately an integer multiple of half of the wavelength irrespective of sea bed slope the study depicts that the maximal peak bragg reflection curve is nearly linear for a pair of submerged trenches whilst non linear for an array of multiple trenches as the non dimensional depth of trenches increases for engineering application optimal collocations curves of all three configurations can be used as quantitative information for the fundamental design and construction of trapezoidal trenches to optimum the bragg resonance reflection the analysis on bragg resonance over the submerged trenches with without sloping bed will be of immense help for understanding the role of submerged trenches on wave transformation over submerged trenches near the continental shelves and navigational channels moreover the study will be useful for the creation of tranquility zones in the marine environment with the help of submerged trenches credit authorship contribution statement p kar validation software

22093,in the present study the occurrence of bragg resonance has been demonstrated due to scattering of long gravity waves by an array of submerged trenches in the presence of the sloping sea bed the closed form long wave analytical solutions are derived using the solutions of bessel equations and validated with numerical results obtained via the boundary element method bem known results in case of submerged breakwaters in water of uniform depth are reproduced as special cases while both analytic and numerical results are compared for accuracy role of various physical parameters such as trench configurations depth width sloping angle and distance between the adjacent trenches are investigated by analyzing the reflection coefficient optimal collocation curves for different trench configurations reveal that maximal peak bragg reflection varies approximately linearly with a change in water depth in case of a pair of trenches and follows certain non linear pattern in the case of multiple trenches the study reveals that bragg reflection is larger due to a change in seabed slope between the trenches than that of trenches having uniform sloping seabed keywords long gravity waves bessel function peak bragg reflection submerged trenches sloping seabed boundary elementary method 1 introduction in recent decades the frequency of occurrence of storm surges due to global warming are in the rise which leads to large scale destruction of facilities and infrastructures along the coastal zone moreover the upsurge in human activities has brought in additional challenges to the coastal zone for reducing the impact of wave loads on marine facilities and attenuating wave heights various structural and non structural methods are being practiced one of the non structural methods for increasing wave reflection and creating a tranquility zone is the bragg scattering of gravity waves by an array of submerged trenches the bragg resonance phenomenon was first observed and discussed by bragg et al 1913 while performing the experiment of x rays reflection by crystalline solids the occurrences of bragg resonance due to the propagation of surface gravity waves by sinusoidally varying bottom topography was shown experimentally by heathershaw 1982 it was demonstrated that bragg resonance occurs when the wave length of the sinusoidal bottom bed profile is half of the wavelength of the incident wave davies 1982b used the fourier transform method to study the bragg resonance phenomena in case of surface gravity waves passed over a sinusoidally varying topography the observation is same as mentioned in heathershaw 1982 davies 1982a extended the aforementioned study for second order wave theory a considerable study on the occurrence of bragg resonance due to surface gravity wave propagation on different periodic bed profiles has been made by davies and heathershaw 1984 dalrymple and kirby 1986 liu 1987 and mei et al 1988 kirby and anton 1990 studied the bragg reflection of free surface gravity waves by artificial bars placed on the bottom bed in a discrete manner both theoretical and experimental analysis were conducted mattioli 1990 studied bragg resonant reflection of surface gravity waves by a series of rectangular submerged bars guazzelli et al 1992 experimentally demonstrated the occurrence of higher order bragg reflection due to the propagation of small amplitude gravity waves over doubly sinusoidal beds the study reveals that higher order effects are a combination of harmonic and subharmonic bragg reflections with subharmonic reflection being large for small bottom undulation hsu et al 2003 studied the bragg scattering of gravity waves by an array of submerged bars using mild slope approximation method wang et al 2006 analyzed bragg reflection of surface waves by a pair of submerged bars of varied geometry jeon and cho 2006 studied the bragg resonance phenomena of gravity waves past an array of trapezoidal submerged breakwaters they have used rans model along with k ϵ turbulence model to obtain numerical solution of the associated physical problem and validated the same using model test results apart from wave propagation over multiple submerged bars efforts are made to study wave propagation over submerged trenches xie et al 2011 found closed form solution of the problem of gravity wave transformation over submerged scour trenches xie and liu 2012 obtained analytic solutions to the modified mild slope equation to analyze gravity wave propagation over trenches of different configurations further liu et al 2012a used modified mild slope equation model to investigate the gravity wave interaction with rectangular submerged breakwater with scour trenches kar et al 2018 analyzed the interaction of surface gravity waves by an array of submerged trenches and demonstrated the phenomenon of bragg resonance in case of multiple submerged trenches ding et al 2019 studied the bragg scattering of gravity waves by an array of floating horizontal flexible membranes in the presence of submerged rectangular bars recently kar et al 2019 studied the effect of bragg scattering due to multiple bottom undulations on a floating dock in finite water depth these studies were based on the linearized theory of water waves during the last two decades significant progress on the study of bragg scattering of gravity waves using finite amplitude wave theory has been witnessed in the literature liu and yue 1998 used a perturbation method and a higher order spectral approach to study the generalized bragg reflection due to bottom ripples by taking fully nonlinear boundary conditions into consideration on the other hand a higher order spectral method was developed by guyenne and nicholls 2007 to simulate nonlinear surface gravity waves propagation over static and moving bottom topography in this study bragg resonance was discussed for sinusoidal varying topography using the nonlinear boussinesq equation hsu et al 2007 developed a numerical model for analyzing bragg scattering of surface water waves by submerged bars alam et al 2009a b demonstrated the occurrence of bragg reflection due to the interaction of gravity waves by ripples in the seabed in case of a stratified fluid model having a free surface and an interface by taking into account the non linear free surface boundary conditions using the multipole expansion method liu et al 2016 examined the bragg reflection of surface waves by multiple semicircular breakwaters in these studies as mentioned above the undulated bottom bed is considered as rigid on the other hand mase and takeba 1995 studied the bragg scattering of gravity waves over a porous seabed using biot s theory of poroelastic media lan et al 2011 analyzed the scattering of surface waves propagating by an array of rectangular poroelastic bars and demonstrated the phenomenon of bragg resonance ning et al 2016 used time domain higher order boundary element method to obtain the numerical solution for the diffraction of non linear water waves they have also performed experimental validation apart from the use of various approximate methods for analyzing bragg reflection of gravity waves due to bottom undulation in finite water depth analytic methods are employed to study bragg reflection of linear long gravity waves due to changes in the sea bed chang and liou 2007 investigated long gravity waves scattering by an array of submerged trapezoidal breakwaters using the matching method liu et al 2012b studied analytically long wave reflection by breakwaters and trenches having curvilinear slopes medina rodríguez et al 2016 investigated scattering of linear long gravity waves by cycloidal breakwaters of varied configurations apart from the various study on long wave scattering of breakwaters of varied configurations efforts have been made to obtain optimal collocation of breakwater configurations for maximum wave reflection liu et al 2015a b plotted optimal collocation curves in case of different types of bragg breakwaters for maximum reflection of long waves in uniform water depth zeng et al 2017 derived the optimal collocation curves for long wave reflection by an array of rectangular bragg breakwaters placed on a sloping seabed unlike the case of bragg reflection by multiple breakwaters there is a negligible study on the scattering of long waves by an array of trenches moreover no study is available to the author s knowledge on obtaining optimal collocation curves in case submerged trenches for maximum bragg reflection liu et al 2019 studied the bragg reflection of regular water waves over fringing reefs based on fully non linear boussinesq model funwave tvd kaur et al 2019 used an analytic solution technique to study the obliquely incident water wave propagation over a pair of asymmetrical rectangular trenches liu et al 2020 studied the bragg resonant reflection of surface gravity waves by a finite array of trapezoidal bars in case of short long and intermediate wave ranges in the present manuscript the bragg scattering of long gravity waves by an array of submerged rectangular trenches over sloping seabed of different configurations is studied in two dimensions the physical problem is studied analytically in terms of bessel s function and is validated with numerical solution obtained via boundary element method various known results in the literature are reproduced in special cases from the solutions of the general model role of different physical parameters such as trench width and depth trench configurations seabed slopes and the distance between adjacent sides of trenches on bragg scattering is analyzed from the numerical results on reflection coefficient moreover optimum collocation curves are plotted for different trench dimensions and seabed slope for determining maximum bragg reflection 2 mathematical formulation scattering of surface gravity wave by an array of trenches is investigated on a sloping sea bed in the two dimensions here the x axis is along the horizontal direction and the y axis is vertically downward the position of the series of trenches sloping sea bed profiles and associated water depths are shown in fig 1 under the assumption of linearized water wave theory with the motion being simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω the velocity potential φ x y t is of the form re ϕ x y e i ω t with re being the real part of the complex expression and i 1 thus the velocity potential ϕ satisfies 1 2 ϕ

of trenches and depth of trench respectively 3 numerical solution here the aforementioned boundary value problem is handled numerically using boundary element method bem as in kar et al 2018 the radiation conditions as in eq 4 has the alternate form given by 8 lim x x i k ϕ 1 ϕ 3 0 on γ c 1 γ c 2 where ϕ 1 ϕ ϕ i n c k k 1 on γ c 1 and ϕ 3 ϕ k k 3 on γ c 2 respectively using green s second

is discretized into a large number of line segments termed as boundary elements and it is assumed that ϕ and ϕ n are linearly varying over each segment in this way eq 11 is transformed into the

influence coefficients are calculated using gaussian quadrature formula on the other hand if the field points matches with the source points logarithmic and cauchy type singularity will appear and the influence coefficients are calculated analytically the details for the same is provided in katsikadelis 2016 it is worth mentioning that the total number of boundary elements over the computational domain n is same at the sum of the number of boundary elements over the sub boundaries as in eq 12 i e n n f n b n c 1 n c 2 using method of collocation as in katsikadelis 2016 a system of linear equations is generated which is solved numerically for determining the velocity potentials over the boundaries of the computational domain then using the far field boundary conditions as in eq 4 the unknowns r and t are computed finally the reflection and transmission coefficients k r and k t are evaluated using the formulae as in kar et al 2018 18 k r r i ω g a ϕ x 0 e i k 1 x 1 x 19 and k t t ω g a ϕ x 0 x here ϕ 0 and ϕ 0 are located on the right and left most panel at the free surface respectively 4 analytic solutions in case of long waves in this section small amplitude long gravity waves propagating over the series of submerged rectangular trenches as shown in fig 1 are studied analytically using the technique of matrix multiplication two types of slopes namely slopes in between trenches and trenches with slopes are considered as discussed in the previous section the co ordinate system characteristics of fluid and its motion is assumed to be the same as discussed in section 2 thus the free surface elevation ζ x t is assumed to be of the form ζ x t re η x e i ω t where η x is the spatial component of the free surface elevation under the assumption that u v are the velocity component of the fluid in two dimensions the equation of motion in the case of linearized long waves takes the form 20 u t g ζ x 0 moreover the continuity equation associated with linearized long wave equation is given by 21 ζ t h u x 0 where h x is the depth function of seabed profile of the submerged trench as defined in eqs 6 7 thus from eqs 20 and 21 the long wave equation in terms of the free surface elevation η x is obtained as see as sahoo 2012 and dean and dalrymple 1991 22 d dx h x d η dx k 1 η 0 hence for constant water depth h x h t for t 1 2 3 eq 22 reduces to 23 d dx d η dx k 1 h t η 0 after rewriting eq 23 we have 24 d 2 η dx 2 k t 2 η 0 where k t 2 k 1 h t i e k t k 1 h t for t 1 2 3 represents wave number of the propagating waves using the bed profile h x as in eq 6 in the case of trenches having bottom slope β 1 solution of eq 24 in open water regions of constant depths are given by as in zeng et al 2017 25 η x e i k 1 x x 1 1 a r e i k 1 x x 1 1 for x x 1 1 a 1 j e i k 2 x x j 2 a 2 j e i k 2 x x j 2 for x j 1 x x j 2 a t e i k 3 x x n 2 for x x n 2 for j 1 2 3 n and using another form of depth function h x as in eq 7 in case of trenches with linear slope β 2 the form of solutions of eq 24 in open water regions of constant depths are expressed as 26 η x e i k 1 x x 1 1 a r e i k 1 x x 1 1 for x x 1 1 a 1 j e i k 1 x x j 1 1 a 2 j e i k 1 x x j 1 1 for x j 2 x x j 1 1 j 1 2 3 n 1 a t e i k 1 x x n 2 for x x n 2 where a r and a t are the unknown complex amplitudes of the reflected and the transmitted waves respectively a 1 j and a 2 j are unknowns which are related with the amplitudes of the waves propagating along inclined region proceeding in a similar manner as mentioned in the previous section k r and k t are defined as 27 k r a r and k t a t assuming x x is a common boundary continuity of pressure and flow fluxes across the interface boundaries between the trench and open water regions yield 28 η x η x h x d η d x x h x d η d x x next full solutions of η x for long wave propagation over trenches in different slope regions are discussed separately in the subsequent subsections 4 1 non dimensionalization in case of constant water depth h j for j 1 2 3 we define k j k j h j as the dimensional wave numbers corresponding to the water depths h j in case of slope β 1 we define k j 1 k 1 h j 1 and k j 2 k 1 h j 2 as the non dimensional wave numbers corresponding water depths h j 1 h x j 1 for j 2 3 n and h j 2 h x j 2 for j 1 2 3 n 1 where h x is defined as in eq 6 similarly in case of trenches with slope β 2 k j 1 k 1 h j 1 k j 2 k 1 h j 2 are defined as the non dimensional wave numbers corresponding to the water depths h j 1 h x j 1 and h j 2 h x j 2 for j 1 2 3 n where h x is defined as in eq 7 as used in bartholomeusz 1958 various non dimensional variables h 1 h 1 h 2 w w l 1 d 2 d l 1 are used for better understanding the phenomena in different cases as in zeng et al 2017 where l j 2 π k j for j 1 2

h 2 x x 1 1 tan β 2 d 2 η d x 2 tan β 2 d η d x ω 2 g η 0 using the auxiliary transforms t h 2 x x 1 1 tan β 2 η t η x eq 38 is rewritten as 39 t d 2 η d t 2 d η d t k 1 tan β 2 η 0 thus solution of

finally using the matching conditions as in eq 28 at x x n 2 eq 40 gives 44 c 1 n c 2 n j 0 2 k n 2 tan β 2 y 0 2 k n 2 tan β 2 k n 2 tan β 2 j 1 2 k n 2 tan β 2 k n 2 tan β 2 y 1 2 k n 2 tan β 2 1 1 i k 1 a t s n 1 i k 1 a t using matrix multiplication from eqs 41 44 it is easily derived that 45 1 a r h 1 s 1 j 1 n 1 s j 2 q s j 1 1 s n 1 i k 1 a t b 1 b 2 a t where q h 2 h 1 thus from eqs 27 and 45 the reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained as 46 k r b 2 b 1 and k t 1 b 1 5 results and discussion to analyze the effects of different wave and structural parameters on wave scattering over trenches placed over sloping sea bed for the purpose of numerical computation numerical codes are written using matlab software the slopes tan β j for j 1 2 are selected appropriately ensuring that the condition n 1 d w h 2 tan β j h for j 1 2 is satisfied for consistency of bed slope moreover the values of different physical parameters such as water depths h 1 4 m trench depth h 2 1 5 h 1 the trench width w 90 m the distance between two adjacent sides of trenches d 180 m and tan β j 1 500 for j 1 2 are kept fixed unless otherwise mentioned as define in zeng et al 2017 from eq 24 we have k 1 k t k t for t 1 2 3 so k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 3 i e k 1 k 2 h 2 h 1 1 5 and k 3 k 1 h 1 h 3 hence k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 1 5 k 1 and k 3 k 1 k 3 k 1 h 3 h 1 k 1 k 1 as h 2 h 1 1 5 and h 3 h 1 1 as tan β j 0 for j 1 2 respectively thus in the subsequent numerical discussions the range of k 1 is fixed as 0 k 1 0 26 to ensure that the non dimensional wave numbers k 1 k 2 and k 3 lie in the shallow water regime 5 1 convergence of the boundary element method in the present subsection the convergence of the solutions based on the boundary element method is discussed for trenches with three different slopes the convergence of the numerical computations based on the boundary element method depends on the panel size used to discretize the physical boundaries the panel size is inversely proportional to the wave number k 1 of the incident wave as stated in kar et al 2018 therefore the panel size p s is expressed in the form p s 1 κ k 1 with κ being the constant of proportionality to be determined from the convergence study table 1 demonstrate the convergence study of solution based on boundary element method for wave scattering by trenches with different slopes respectively it is observed that the values of the reflection and transmission coefficients converge up to three decimal places for κ 30 in both the cases trenches thus for the sake of convergence of the solutions panel size is chosen judiciously with κ 30 in the subsequent numerical computations 5 2 validation of numerical and analytic solutions in fig 3 a reflection coefficient k r versus k 1 and b maximal peak bragg reflection b max versus non dimensional depth of the breakwaters h are plotted for similar data sets as mentioned in zeng et al 2017 fig 3 a depicts that present bem solution with linear elements agrees well with that of zeng et al 2017 moreover fig 3 b demonstrates that present analytic long wave solution matches exactly with maximum peak bragg reflection curve as in fig 14 b of zeng et al 2017 in fig 5 the analytic long wave solutions are compared with bem solutions as discussed above in the present study in case of trenches having slopes a tan β 1 1 500 with β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 with β 1 0 with n 3 both figs 5 a and 5 b reveal that the analytic and numerical solutions are well matched hence the analytic method can be used for water of intermediate depth moreover fig 5 reveals that bragg resonance reflection occurs in the case of an array of submerged trenches with two types of slopping sea bed which was observed in case of trenches over the sloping bed as in zeng et al 2017 a comparison of figs 5 a and 5 b demonstrates that wave reflection is higher for trenches with slope in between trenches than trenches having slope which is due to a decrease in water depths in between the trenches since analytic results are suitable for long waves i e 0 k 1 0 26 effect of bottom slope is analyzed using bem in fig 4 to understand bragg resonance pattern for wave number in the range 0 k 1 3 covering long waves and waves of intermediate depth in fig 4 the reflection coefficient k r versus wave number k 1 are plotted in case of finite water depth for rectangular trenches having slopes a tan β 1 1 500 with β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 with β 1 0 with h 0 33 n 3 w 30 m d 60 m and h 1 4 m fig 4 depicts that amplitude of wave reflection k r decreases as wave number k 1 increases further bragg reflection occurs once only for all k 1 and is restricted to the long wave regime the result is similar to that of kar et al 2019 further the occurrence of multiple subharmonic peaks occurs between two consecutive harmonic peaks moreover frequency of occurrence of zero reflection reduces due to the presence of sloping bed a comparison between figs 4 a and 4 b reveals that amplitude of wave reflection is higher in case trenches having slope in between the trenches since various numerical results based on the analytic and numerical methods agree well in the long wave regime for 0 k 1 0 26 see fig 5 the subsequent analysis is performed using the analytic solution derived based on long wave theory and the study is restricted to 0 k 1 0 26 it may be noted that the present analytic solution is computationally more efficient and requires much less time compared to the numerical code for the physical problem understudy however the boundary element solution can be used to analyze the physical problem in finite water depth 5 3 effect of trench dimensions on bragg reflection fig 6 demonstrates the change of the reflection coefficient k r against wave number k 1 for different slope a tan β 1 and β 2 0 b tan β 2 and β 1 0 with h 0 33 n 3 w 90 m d 100 m and h 1 4 m fig 6 a reveals that as the in slope in between the trenches β 1 increases reflection coefficient increases this is because of the bragg reflection of water waves by the sloping seabeds within the gap between the trenches the pattern in wave reflection is similar to that of the bragg scattering by an array of asymmetric trenches as discussed in kar et al 2018 however fig 6 b reveals that with an increase in the trench slope β 2 amplitude of bragg reflection decreases which is due to the decrease in water depth within the trenches moreover in the presence of sea bed slope non zero minima in bragg reflection occurs which approaches to zero as the sloping angle approaches to zero which is similar to that of kar et al 2018 in case of uniform sea bed in fig 7 the reflection coefficient k r n 1 is plotted against wave number k 1 for different number of trenches n with slope a tan β 1 1 500 β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 β 1 0 fig 7 reveals that the span in the pattern of the reflection coefficient increases as the number of submerged trenches increases further subharmonic peaks are observed in wave reflection for an array of multiple trenches and between two consecutive harmonic peaks the total number of subharmonic peaks is found to be two less than the number of trenches which is similar to the observation found in kar et al 2018 moreover the amplitude of the harmonic peak in the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in wave number a comparison of figs 7 a and 7 b reveals that the wave reflection is higher in the presence of slope in between trenches relative to that of submerged trenches with slope which is similar to the observation made in fig 3 in fig 8 k r versus k 1 is plotted for different values of trench depth h in case of trenches having slopes a tan β 1 1 500 and β 2 0 and b tan β 2 1 500 with β 1 0 n 3 w 90 m d 100 m h 1 4 m both the figures reveal that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in trench depth moreover certain phase shift in the reflection coefficient pattern occurs as the depth ratio h increases further it is observed that the optima in the harmonic and subharmonic peak depression of the reflection coefficient increases with an increase is wave number k 1 the change in the reflection coefficient k r is plotted against wave number k 1 in fig 9 for different values of trench a width w with d 180 m and b distance between adjacent sides of trenches d with tan β 1 1 500 β 2 0 with w 90 m fig 9 a exhibits that maxima in bragg reflection decrease as the trench width increases whilst fig 9 b demonstrates the opposite trend as the distance between the adjacent side of trenches d increases however the trend in the occurrence of optima in bragg reflection varies alternately with the change in trench width w the distance between the adjacent side of trenches d as wave number k 1 increases hereafter bragg reflection b r max k r n h w d β 1 β 2 and maximal peak bragg reflection b max max b r by a series of trenches placed on sloping sea bed similar to the definition in case of wave scattering by multiple submerged breakwaters as defined in zeng et al 2017 are studied by optimizing the non dimensional parameters associated with trenches such as trench depth h 1 h 1 h 2 trench width w w l 1 and the relative trench distance d 2 d l 1 since the choice of the number of trenches is independent of the position of occurrence of optima in wave reflection with respect to distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches d and trench width w hereafter number of trenches have been chosen independently to understand the optima in the amplitude of bragg reflection it is noted that as 0 k 1 0 26 so l 1 2 π k 1 96 66 hence maximum value of the dimensionless parameters such as d and w are d 2 d l 1 2 180 96 66 3 72 and w w l 1 90 96 66 0 93 respectively hence in the subsequent study range of d and w are restricted to 0 d 3 72 and 0 w 0 93 respectively fig 10 a exhibits the change in the reflection coefficient k r against the distance between the adjacent sides of trenches d whereas fig 10 b illustrates the changes in the bragg reflection coefficient b r against trench width w for different values of slope in between trenches tan β 1 with h 0 33 n 3 β 2 0 h 1 4 m l 1 40 π m fig 10 a reveals that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in the slope tan β 1 within the range 1 2000 to 1 300 fig 10 a depicts that the magnitude of the harmonic peak in wave reflection attains maximum almost when the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches is approximately an integer multiple of half of the wavelength irrespective of the sloping angle β 1 a similar phenomenon in case of long gravity wave interaction with multiple submerged breakwaters of different configurations was referred as the principle of bragg reflection by liu et al 2015a b moreover the changes in the occurrence of maxima in wave reflection are due to the increase in the sloping angle β 1 taking into the point of maxima in the occurrence of bragg reflection the global maximum in bragg reflection b r is plotted against trench width w for d 3 see table 2 fig 10 b depicts that the global maximum of the bragg resonant reflection b r increases when the seabed slope increases moreover fig 10 b reveals that when n 3 and the sea bed tan β 1 1 300 the bragg resonant reflection b r attends its global maximum value 0 69 when the trench width 0 3 times the wavelength of the incident waves fig 11 a illustrates the changes in the reflection coefficient k r versus the distance between the adjacent sides of trenches d with w 0 2 whereas fig 11 b shows the variation of bragg reflection coefficient b r against trench width w for different trench slope tan β 2 with h 0 33 n 3 β 1 0 h 1 4 m l 1 40 π m fig 11 a reveals that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in slope tan β 1 within the range 1 2000 to 1 300 fig 11 a depicts that the magnitude of the harmonic peak of reflection coefficient attains maximum almost when the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches is approximately an integer multiple of half of the wavelength irrespective of the sloping angle β 2 which follows the principle of bragg reflection as discussed in fig 10 a however a comparison of figs 10 a and 11 a reveals that the variation in the occurrence of maxima in wave reflection due to the increase in the sloping angle β 2 is negligible compared to that of β 1 which is due to the fact that due to an increase in water depth the trench slope is less effective in reflecting the resonating waves than the slope of the seabed within the distance between the trenches to understand the effective role of bragg resonance in creating a tranquility zone taking the points of maxima in bragg reflection as evaluated in fig 11 a global maximum in bragg reflection b r is plotted against trench width w at d 1 see table 3 fig 11 b depicts that the global maximum of the bragg resonant reflection b r increases when the seabed slope decreases moreover fig 11 b reveals that when seabed slope tan β 2 1 1500 bragg resonant reflection b r attends its global maximum value 0 55 when the trench width is close to 0 3 times the wavelength of the incident waves further global maxima in bragg reflection does not change with a further decrease in slope below 1 1500 in fig 12 reflection coefficient k r against distance between the adjacent side of trenches d is plotted for various values of non dimensional trench width w with h 0 33 h 1 4 m l 1 40 π m in case of multiple trenches fig 12 depicts that the magnitude of harmonic peak of reflection coefficient attains maximum almost under the bragg resonance condition d 1 irrespective of the number of trenches however the wave reflection pattern neither follows any uniform increasing decreasing pattern with an increase in trench width for 0 05 w 0 60 irrespective of the number of trenches figs 12 a 12 f reveal that minima in wave reflection increases with an increase in trench slope on the other hand figs 12 a 12 c depicts that wave reflection increases with an increase in the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches whilst figs 12 d 12 f demonstrates the opposite trend however figs 12 g 12 i reveals the occurrence of zero reflection in case of trenches having uniform sea bed i e with β 1 0 and β 2 0 and the general pattern of wave reflection remains uniform as the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches increases this observation was first reported by xie et al 2011 and later confirmed by liu et al 2012b moreover all the sub figures reveal the occurrence of subharmonic peaks in the graph of the reflection coefficient when the number of trenches is more than two irrespective of seabed slope a comparison between figs 8 and 12 demonstrates that optimum in the bragg reflection depends on the distance between the adjacent sides of trenches and trench width simultaneously thus to account for maximum bragg reflection trench dimensions are optimized in the subsequent analysis fig 13 demonstrates the variation of bragg reflection b r versus trench width w in case of a c tan β 1 1 300 β 2 0 d f tan β 2 1 1500 β 1 0 and g i β 1 0 β 2 0 with h 1 4 m and l 1 40 π m for various values of relative trench depth h 1 h 1 h 2 moreover the results are plotted for n 2 5 and 10 in figs 12 a d g 12 b e h and 12 c f i respectively in all the subfigures 13 a 13 i the global maximum of b r is marked with the symbol further these peak values and positions are provided in tables 4 6 all the subfigures show that the global maximum of b r increases as the trench depth h increases however the amplitude of bragg reflection is higher in the presence of slope in between trenches relative to that of trenches having a slope which is similar to the observation made in figs 3 and 6 further it is observed that the number of optima in bragg reflection increases as trench depth h as well as the number of trenches n increases moreover the global maxima in bragg reflection occur for smaller values of the trench width w as trench depth increases further in the case of seabed slope in between trenches global maxima in bragg reflection approach to unity irrespective of trench depth for a higher number of trenches fig 14 demonstrates the variation of optimal curves w w n h against trench depth h in case of a tan β 1 1 300 β 2 0 b tan β 2 1 1500 β 1 0 and c β 1 0 β 2 0 for different numbers of multiple trenches n with h 1 4 m and l 1 40 π m fig 14 a reveals that for any fixed n n an optimal curve w w n h exists this means in the optimal curve w w n h for any given dimensionless trench depth h the associated dimensionless trench width is given by w w n h fig 15 demonstrates the maximal peak bragg reflection b max against trench depth h in case of a tan β 1 1 300 β 2 0 b tan β 2 1 1500 β 1 0 and c β 1 0 β 2 0 for different numbers of multiple trenches n with h 1 4 m and l 1 40 π m fig 15 exhibits the maximum peak bragg reflection coefficients associated with the optimal trench dimensions w n h it is observed that the maximum peak bragg resonant reflection b max in optimum trenches are approximately linear concerning the dimensionless trench depth h in case of two trenches and nonlinear in nature for a higher number of trenches the non linearity in the pattern of maximum peak bragg resonant reflection b max curve is due to the presence of harmonic and subharmonic peaks in wave reflection a similar pattern has been exhibited by zeng et al 2017 in case of multiple bragg breakwaters over the sloping sea bed 6 conclusion in this paper the scattering of long wave over an array of submerged trenches having sloping sea bed is investigated numerically using the boundary element method the closed form analytic long wave solutions obtained using the solution of bessel equation and matrix multiplication method are validated with the numerical solutions obtained via the boundary elementary method three types of bed slope are considered to understand the effect of seabed slope on maximum bragg reflection known results related to surface gravity wave scattering by bragg breakwaters are reproduced as special cases the study reveals that the reflection coefficient increases as the sloping angle in between trenches increases and decreases with an increase in slope for trenches having a slope however for multiple trenches with sloping bed subharmonic peaks are found in the bragg reflection the number of subharmonic peaks between two harmonic peaks in bragg reflection is found to be two less than the number of trenches which is similar to that of wave scattering by an array of multiple trenches over uniform seabed as discussed in the literature further the study depicted that the magnitude of the harmonic peak of the reflection coefficient attains maximum when the distance between the adjacent sides of the trenches is approximately an integer multiple of half of the wavelength irrespective of sea bed slope the study depicts that the maximal peak bragg reflection curve is nearly linear for a pair of submerged trenches whilst non linear for an array of multiple trenches as the non dimensional depth of trenches increases for engineering application optimal collocations curves of all three configurations can be used as quantitative information for the fundamental design and construction of trapezoidal trenches to optimum the bragg resonance reflection the analysis on bragg resonance over the submerged trenches with without sloping bed will be of immense help for understanding the role of submerged trenches on wave transformation over submerged trenches near the continental shelves and navigational channels moreover the

22094,in welded clad pipelines the weld toe is a critical failure position due to the combined effects of the potential weld defects and the stress concentration induced by weld reinforcement the fracture risk in this position has seldom been assessed moreover the pipelines are often exposed to complicated loading environments during the service period thus the fracture responses of the pipelines with a crack at the weld toe and subjected to tension and internal pressure are considered in this study a reference strain fracture assessment formulation is derived for the weld toe crack in welded clad pipelines the formulation detailed expression form is determined by the extensive parametric finite element fe analyses and standard least square fitting method the accuracy of the proposed formulation is validated by conducting a comparative study in j values attained from the formulation and fe analysis finally a further study on extending the application range of the estimation formulation is carried out keywords welded clad pipeline weld toe surface crack reference strain fracture assessment formulation 1 introduction the increasing demand for recoverable corrosive hydrocarbons has motivated the introduction of a clad c mn steel pipe with an internal layer of corrosion resistant alloy cra the clad pipe segments are welded together to construct the whole pipeline during the welding procedure some micro defects may be incorporated in the pipe welds and these defects are not easily identified by non destructive testing ndt during the service period the welded pipelines can experience complicated loading conditions e g longitudinal and transversal forces generated by ground movement internal pressure exerted by transported gas or liquid external pressure induced by sea water giving rise to large plastic deformation in pipelines up to the order of 3 yi et al 2012a b c the combined effects of these loads may trigger the growth and coalescence of micro defects to further propagate into a macro crack which finally leads to the structural failure hoh et al 2010 therefore it is important to perform the fracture assessment for the cracked pipelines subjected to large plastic deformation based on the ge epri approach kim et al 2002 performed engineering estimates for j integral in pipes with a part through surface crack then the obtained ge epri j estimation equation was re derived by using the reference stress method anderson 2005 which extends its application range for all types of stress strain behaviors not only limited to the ramberg osgood material constitutive model subsequently the reference stress method was further developed by tkaczyk et al 2011 for a defect assessment in pipelines and the proposed method for a parent material can also be safely applied to the case of over matched welds it is worth noting that the estimation methods mentioned above are all designed for the pipelines under the load controlled conditions chiodo and ruggieri 2010 paredes and ruggieri 2015 souza and ruggieri 2015 souza et al 2016 however the loading scheme of pipelines is controlled by the displacement or strain in some cases therefore the strain based method should be developed for the structural integrity assessment bastola et al 2017 budden 2006 jayadevan et al 2004 jia et al 2016 2017 lie et al 2017 østby et al 2005 parise et al 2015 souza and ruggieri 2017 zhao et al 2017 2019 2018 a reference strain approach was established by nourpanah and taheri 2010 to evaluate the fracture responses of a homogeneous pipeline subjected to large plastic strains yi et al 2012a b c conducted the fracture analyses of girth welded clad pipelines with a circumferential surface crack subjected to biaxial loading conditions and it is concluded that bs 7910 2013 gives an over conservative prediction in the fracture assessment especially for a large plastic strain loading case however the formulation proposed by yi et al 2012a b c is only for a specific pipe geometric configuration as seen in fig 1 the weld centerline wcl and weld toe are two main failure positions in welded pipelines in comparison with the wcl the weld toe is a more vulnerable position of crack initiation and propagation due to the stress concentration raised by weld reinforcement fig 1 b and the potential defects induced by incomplete fusion fig 1 c slag inclusions etc yi et al 2012a b c however the aforementioned research works all aimed at the pipelines with surface cracks located at the wcl bastola et al 2017 budden 2006 chiodo and ruggieri 2010 jayadevan et al 2004 jia et al 2016 2017 lie et al 2017 østby et al 2005 paredes and ruggieri 2015 parise et al 2015 souza and ruggieri 2015 2017 zhao et al 2019 and seldom investigations can be found for the fracture analysis of a weld toe crack i e a crack located at the interface of outer pipe and girth weld in welded pipelines yi et al 2012a b c zhao et al 2018 therefore the fracture assessment for welded clad pipelines with an interface crack and subjected to complicated loading conditions is carried out in the present study 2 fracture assessment strategies of welded clad pipes 2 1 stress based fracture assessment method for structures under load controlled conditions the stress based evaluation procedures are usually used for the fracture assessment of cracked components the epri j estimation approach and the reference stress method anderson 2005 are the two commonly used stress based methods by dividing the total j into the sum of the elastic component j e and the plastic component j p the epri procedure provides a j integral estimation approach of covering the full range of elastic plastic regime as 1 j j e j p where j e is the elastic release rate which can be determined through the following expression 2 j e k i 2 e where k i is the mode i stress intensity factor e e for plane stress condition and e e 1 ν 2 for plane strain condition with e and ν being the elastic modulus and the poisson s ratio respectively the second term of eq 1 fully plastic equation of j is determined as follows 3 j p α ε y σ y b h 1 a t θ π d e t n p p l n 1 where α is a dimensionless constant ε y and σ y are the yield strain and yield stress of the material respectively a θ t d e are the crack depth half central angle of crack length pipe wall thickness and pipe outside diameter respectively b is the uncracked ligament length with b t a n is the material strain hardening exponent h 1 is the geometry factor depending on a t θ π d e t and n p and p l are the applied load and the limit load of the structure respectively the above epri j estimation procedure aiming at the tension case was developed by chiodo and ruggieri 2010 for the structural components subjected to a bending moment 4 j p α ε y σ y b h 1 a t θ π d e t n m m l n 1 where m is the applied bending moment m l is the limit bending moment and its expression is given as the following 5 m l 2 σ y r m 2 t 2 sin β a t sin θ where r m is the pipe mean radius with r m d e t 2 and β is defined as 6 β π 2 1 θ π a t the material obeying the ramberg osgood model is assumed in the epri j estimation procedure however the flow behavior exists in many materials deviating considerably from the power law in this case applying eq 3 or eq 4 for the fracture assessment causes a significant error in order to better characterize the flow behavior of materials ainsworth anderson 2005 proposed a reference stress j estimation approach by defining a reference stress σ ref as 7 σ ref σ y p p l or m m l substituting eq 7 into eq 3 or eq 4 gives the following equation 8 j p σ ref b h 1 ε ref σ ref ε y σ y where ε ref is the reference strain corresponding to the σ ref for a material following the ramberg osgood model eq 8 can predict the same j integral value with eq 3 or eq 4 it is noted that eq 8 is equally applicable for other types of stress strain relationship in other words the reference stress approach is a generalization of the conventional epri j estimation procedure 2 2 strain based fracture assessment method for the offshore pipelines under reeling installation the pipelines are subjected to large plastic deformation up to the order of 3 lie et al 2017 yi et al 2012a b c during this process the strain controlled or displacement controlled boundary condition is dominant therefore it is more appropriate and accurate to use the strain based approach for the fracture assessment based on the reference stress approach underlying r6 a reference strain method is proposed as follows 9 j f 2 π a σ nom ε nom ε ref σ ref ε nom σ nom where f is the geometry factor depending on the structural geometry and loading mode σ nom and ε nom are the nominal stress and strain respectively the next step is to replace σ nom and ε nom in eq 9 by σ uc and ε uc linkens et al 2000 where σ uc and ε uc are the elastic plastic uncracked body equivalent stress and strain respectively eq 9 now becomes the following form by adding the safety factor of 2 10 j 2 f 2 π a σ uc ε uc the strain formulation as indicated in eq 10 is not sufficiently accurate in a quantitative fracture assessment which can qualitatively capture the fracture responses of the pipelines the reason is that the difference between ε nom and ε uc becomes larger and larger with the increasing crack depth violating the underlying assumption of small cracks in eq 10 on the basis of eq 10 nourpanah and taheri 2010 developed a more accurate strain based j estimation formulation by proposing a linear relationship between the normalized j and ε uc this formulation was originally established for a crack normal to the pipe surface however whether it is equally applicable for the case of an interface crack remains unknown in this study it is observed that the linear relationship between the j and ε uc still holds true for the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack therefore the reference strain evaluation formulation proposed by nourpanah and taheri 2010 is valid for the integrity assessment of an interface crack in welded clad pipelines subjected to tension and internal pressure by developing the new parameter expressions of f 1 and f 2 instead of original ones as 11 j σ y t f 1 ε uc f 2 where f 1 and f 2 are the two new parameter expressions depending on the pipe geometry crack size and material properties 3 numerical models and procedures 3 1 material properties and geometrical details fig 2 shows the schematics of a welded clad pipe with a circumferential part through surface crack along the interface of girth weld and outer pipe which is a critical location of crack initiation and growth the welded clad pipe is composed of three different materials fig 2 outer pipe steel weld metal and internal cra layer it is noted that the heat affected zone haz is not incorporated in this study due to its narrow width in comparison with the weld width and uncracked ligament length hence ignoring the haz causes an ignorable effect on the fracture behaviors besides the haz typically presents over matched material properties compared to its surrounding constituents i e outer pipe steel and weld metal thus neglecting the haz results in a slightly conservative prediction for fracture responses which is beneficial for the engineering critical assessment of pipelines kim and schwalbe 2001 for the cra material and weld metal identical material properties are adopted it is because the filler material commonly used in the welding of clad pipe segments such as nickel chromium alloy 625 uns n06625 has almost the same mechanical properties as the cra material souza et al 2016 souza and ruggieri 2017 in this study it is assumed that the material properties of outer pipe steel and weld metal or inner cra material follow the classical ramberg osgood relationship a weld strength mismatch factor m y is introduced to characterize the mismatch effect between these two types of materials 12 m y σ y w σ y out where σ y w and σ y out are the yield stress of the weld metal and outer pipe steel respectively three mismatch levels viz m y 0 8 20 undermatch m y 1 0 evenmatch and m y 1 25 25 overmatch are considered in the current analysis covering a wide range of material types found in real application souza and ruggieri 2015 an api x60 pipeline grade steel is selected as the outer pipe material herein and its material properties are σ y out 483 mpa and n out 12 chiodo and ruggieri 2010 souza and ruggieri 2015 hence the yield stress of weld metal can be calculated based on eq 12 which are summarized in table 1 table 2 tabulates the details of pipe geometry girth weld and crack dimensions two different ratios of pipe outside diameter to pipe wall thickness d e t are adopted viz d e t 10 and 20 with a constant wall thickness t 20 6 mm and cra layer thickness t cra 3 mm the crack size is characterized by the crack depth a and crack length 2s d e θ and the crack depth ratio a t and crack length ratio θ π used in this analysis are varying from 0 1 to 0 4 and from 0 05 to 0 20 respectively the weld groove angle ϕ weld root opening width h and weld reinforcements r u and r d are employed to define the weld geometry for the weld groove angle ϕ 45 is considered and the value of h t adopted is 0 3 signifying the typical girth weld profile encountered in engineering practice however the girth welds with flushed surface are considered in this study which means that r u and r d both tend to infinity it is because the presence of the weld reinforcement restrains the crack tip opening inducing a smaller crack driving force therefore neglecting the weld reinforcement can produce a slightly conservative prediction in the j values please refer to sub section 5 2 for details 3 2 model development and numerical procedures as mentioned in the above various parameters i e pipe diameter weld geometry crack size yield stress and strain hardening exponent are incorporated in this study to investigate the fracture responses of welded clad pipelines with an interface crack a large number of fe models are required to be created therefore a fe mesh generator is developed by using matlab code to simplify the cumbersome and time consuming task the fe mesh generator can conveniently produce fe models of various pipeline types and crack locations not limited to the pipe model of the present study a detailed function list is depicted in fig 3 a to better describe the function modules of the mesh generator the generated fe models are processed by abaqus 2011 and post processed by a self developed python script to extract the required results e g displacement stress j integral fig 3 b in the generation of the fe models the most pivotal part is to determine the position coordinates of the crack front line which is the baseline of constructing the crack tube fig 4 a the crack front line can be described by considering the constant crack depth part ab and varying depth part bc separately as follows 13 θ arc arcsin 2 a d e 14 y d d e 2 a sin β d 15 z d d e 2 a cos β d 16 y e d e 2 a cos β e sin θ θ arc a sin β e cos θ θ arc 17 z e d e 2 a cos β e cos θ θ arc a sin β e sin θ θ arc where d and e are any point in segment ab and bc respectively β d and β e denote the corresponding angle of aod and bo e fig 4 b based on the crack front line a focused spider web mesh pattern along the crack front is used with a small keyhole geometry at the crack tip to capture the high strain gradient and overcome the convergent issue induced by the large plastic deformation fig 4 a the small radius of the keyhole in this study is set to 0 001 mm 12 circumferential layers surrounding the crack front are employed to provide the distance sufficiently far from the crack tip to ensure the path independence of the j integral based on the mesh strategies described above the crack tube can be generated fig 4 a finally the welded clad pipe model is constructed step by step as shown in fig 5 the element type used is 20 node brick element with reduced integration c3d20r the deformation plasticity and the small geometry change scc assumption are incorporated in the present fe analysis fig 6 shows the boundary conditions used in the present study for the welded clad pipeline due to symmetry only half of the pipe needs to be considered hence a symmetric boundary condition is applied to the surface of y 0 at the left end of the pipe the displacements in x axis and z axis directions are constrained for preventing rigid motion a tensile displacement loading u is applied to the right end of the pipe for providing the tension and ε uc can be expressed in the form of u as 18 ε uc u l ε uc is set up to 3 by allowing for the large plastic deformation of the pipeline during the reeling installation or in service operation besides an internal pressure p of 20 mpa is applied to the internal surface of the pipeline to realize the biaxial loading conditions based on the flow theory of plasticity the j integral value depends on the loading path for the biaxial loading conditions of tension and internal pressure three different loading paths are considered applying p first and then ε uc load path 1 applying p and ε uc simultaneously load path 2 and applying ε uc first and then p load path 3 fig 7 shows the comparisons of the j integral values obtained from the three loading paths and it is observed that the load path 1 induces the maximum value of j integral which produces the same conclusion with yi et al 2012a b c therefore the biaxial loading path used in this study is to apply the internal pressure p first before the ε uc acts on the pipeline segment the validity of the generated fe model needs to be confirmed before it is used for the fracture analysis of the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack and subjected to biaxial loading conditions at first the fe mesh generator is employed to create the fe model of the homogeneous pipeline with a surface crack normal to the pipe surface by setting ϕ 0 and the j values obtained are compared with nourpanah and taheri 2010 results a good agreement between one another is observed with the largest percentage difference being about 6 fig 8 convincingly verifying the validity of the mesh refinement and fe modelling then for the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack convergent tests covering the range of various parameters tabulated in tables 1 and 2 are conducted to determine the required number of elements it is noted that the number of elements ranging from 20 000 to 35 000 is adequate in this study depending on the pipe geometry and crack size the above sensitivity analyses provide confidence in the accuracy of the subsequent parametric study for the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack 4 determination of the reference strain j estimation formulation the necessity of developing a new reference strain j estimation formulation for an interface crack in welded clad pipelines subjected to tension and internal pressure should be confirmed first the engineering critical assessments of a cracked pipeline under uniaxial stress state tension or bending were carried out by some scholars chiodo and ruggieri 2010 paredes and ruggieri 2015 souza and ruggieri 2015 2017 souza et al 2016 even though yi et al 2012a b c have established the estimation equation for a cracked clad pipeline under tension and internal pressure their equation is only applicable to a specific pipe geometry and material property in this study the fracture analysis for a cracked clad pipeline under biaxial loading conditions is conducted by covering a wide range of geometric configurations and weld strength mismatch values fig 9 shows the comparison of j values for the cracked clad pipeline subjected to uniaxial and biaxial stress state respectively it is clearly noted that the j values obtained from the biaxial stress state are always larger than those from the uniaxial stress state and the largest percentage difference between one another is attained at the case of d e t 20 a t 0 1 m y 0 8 and n w 12 with the value being about 60 verifying a remarkable influence of the internal pressure induced by the transported liquid or gas on the structural integrity besides in some working conditions the pipelines undergo the combined action of bending moment and internal pressure and the relationship between the global strain and bending moment is given as 19 ε uc d e γ 2 l where γ denotes the rotation angle of the pipeline fig 10 presents a comparative study of j values for the pipeline under two different biaxial loading condition cases viz tension internal pressure and bending moment internal pressure respectively the j values of the former case are always slightly larger than that of the latter case therefore it is more significant by proposing the reference strain estimation formulation for the combined tension and internal pressure case since it can be equally suitable for the bending moment and internal pressure case but not vice versa as indicated in eq 11 the key of proposing the reference strain j estimation formulation is to confirm the expressions of f 1 and f 2 for convenience eq 11 can be rewritten into the following form by replacing the original f 1 and f 2 as 20 j σ y out t f 1 d e t a t θ π m y n w ε uc f 2 d e t a t θ π m y n w parametric fe analyses totally including 280 models are performed to develop the factors f 1 and f 2 by covering a wide range of parameter values as tabulated in tables 1 and 2 and fig 11 depicts the whole process of determining f 1 and f 2 a nonlinear evolution curve between j σ y out t and ε uc can be observed at the initial deformation stage which is referred to as a short transient region prior to the fully plastic deformation state zhao et al 2018 then a linear dependence of j σ y out t on ε uc always holds true for the range of 0 5 3 0 hence the factors f 1 and f 2 are ascertained by fitting the numerical data in this range the factor f 1 can be easily obtained by extracting the slope of this curve in fig 11 and the intercept at ordinate is employed to determine the f 2 the same operation procedure is carried out for all the parameter combinations incorporated in this study and a series of f 1 and f 2 values varying with d e t a t θ π m y and n w are attained based on the evolution trends of f 1 and f 2 their concrete expression forms can be constructed by using multiple regression analysis as 21 f 1 a 1 θ π a 2 a t a 3 θ π a 4 22 f 2 b 1 θ π b 2 a t b 3 where a 1 to a 4 and b 1 to b 3 are coefficients depending on d e t m y and n w as given in tables 3 and 4 substituting eqs 21 and 22 into eq 20 obtains the reference strain j estimation formulation for an interface crack in welded clad pipelines under biaxial loading conditions the goodness of fit of the proposed formulation is required to be verified due to its complex form fig 12 displays the comparisons of j values obtained from the formulation and numerical data by considering effects of various parameters and these two sets of values are well consistent with one another signifying the j estimation formulation being a good fit to the fe data 5 extension in application scope of the estimation formulation the objective of this section is to extend the application range of the developed reference strain j estimation formulation in eq 20 by considering the effects of yield strength weld profile potential material property difference realistic stress strain relation and temperature 5 1 effect of yield strength and pipe wall thickness on the j even though the j estimation formulation in eq 20 has been nondimensionalized by σ y out t it is developed based on the outer pipe made of an api x60 pipeline grade steel with the σ y out and t being 483 mpa and 20 6 mm respectively thus the general applicability of eq 20 needs to be proved due to the variation in the material property and geometrical dimension of the pipelines encountered in practice it is noted from fig 13 a that the dimensionless j i e j σ y out t obtained from σ y out 483 mpa and σ y out 579 6 mpa 20 higher than 483 mpa for an identical t are well consistent with one another and the same is true for the case of the lower σ y out value which demonstrates the validity of the σ y out as part of the characteristic variable σ y out t for the pipe wall thickness three different t viz t 15 mm t 20 6 mm and t 25 mm are considered and almost identical j σ y out t values are observed fig 13 b therefore setting the σ y out t as the characteristic variable largely reduces the dependence of eq 20 on the outer pipe yield strength and pipe wall thickness in other words the developed j estimation formulation can be available for a wide range of outer pipe yield strengths and pipe wall thickness not just limited to the case of σ y out 483 mpa and t 20 6 mm 5 2 effect of weld profile on the j the estimation formulation is built up for the cracked clad pipelines with flushed weld surface i e r u or h u 0 0 mm fig 2 however the weld reinforcement more or less exists in some actual situations hence the availability of the proposed formulation for the girth weld with face reinforcement should be investigated herein three different cases viz h u 0 0 mm case 1 h u 2 6 mm case 2 and h u 4 0 mm case 3 are considered the h u value in case 2 is taken from a real weld reinforcement dimension as shown in the paper of yi et al 2012a b c and the h u in case 3 is set to 4 0 mm in view of the aws d1 1 2000 recommendation of retaining minimum weld reinforcement not exceeding 3 mm fig 14 shows the comparative study of the j values obtained from the three cases by covering varying crack sizes weld mismatch levels and strain hardening exponents and it is clearly noted that the reduced h u causes an increase in the j in a linear elastic fracture mechanics regime the corresponding fracture parameter i e stress intensity factor sif can be magnified due to the stress concentration induced by the weld reinforcement especially for a shallow crack however for the large plastic strain case of this study the magnification effect can be negligible and the presence of weld reinforcement restrains the further opening of the crack tip resulting in a decreased j value therefore the reference strain j estimation formulation in eq 20 can provide a reasonably conservative fracture assessment for the cracked clad pipelines with weld reinforcement as stated previously a typical girth weld profile with ϕ 45 and h t 0 3 is adopted in the development of the j estimation formulation in order to extend the application scope of the formulation in the weld profile the ϕ and h t values ranging from 30 to 60 and from 0 2 to 0 4 respectively are employed in this analysis incorporating the commonly used weld shape found in welded pipelines it is observed from fig 15 a that for a constant h t a larger ϕ results in a decrease in the j value by considering various weld mismatch levels and strain hardening exponents as the ϕ increases the angle 90o ϕ 2 between the crack face and the applied tensile loading becomes smaller and smaller reducing the effective loading in opening the crack fig 2 and then decreasing the corresponding j hence the reference strain j estimation formulation for ϕ 45 can reliably predict the fracture responses for the cracked clad pipelines including ϕ varying from 45 to 60 with the largest over estimation percentage difference being only 6 4 in the case of fig 15 a for the weld root opening width the change of h t with a constant ϕ exerts relatively little effect on the j by noticing the percentage difference between one another in fig 15 b within 2 except the case of m y 0 8 and n w 12 in which the j decreases with the reduced h t therefore the j estimation formulation initially developed for h t 0 3 can make a slightly conservation prediction in the j for the cracked clad pipelines with h t being smaller than 0 3 however the formulation mentioned above should be used with caution in the fracture assessment when the h t of the girth weld is larger than 0 3 5 3 effect of potential material property difference between adjacent pipes on the j the clad pipelines are composed of a series of pipe segments by welding even though these pipe segments are made of an identical material the adjacent pipes welded together may exist difference in material properties due to the effect of pressing process hence it is necessary and significant to investigate the influence of potential material property difference between adjacent pipes on the j fig 16 presents the comparative study of the j values calculated for varying yield strengths and strain hardening exponents of outer pipe in this analysis the welded clad pipeline is divided into two parts viz pipe 1 and pipe 2 and the material property difference is implemented by changing the properties σ y out and n out of pipe 1 and keep these of pipe 2 constant as indicated in fig 16 it is noted that a smaller σ y out in pipe 1 relative to pipe 2 always causes a downward shift in the j values and a reverse trend is observed for the n out a smaller yield strength and a larger strain hardening exponent both imply a softer pipe thus when a same displacement loading is applied to the welded pipeline the softer pipe 1 will undergo a larger deformation and then a smaller deformation occurs in the pipe 2 inducing a decrease in the j value therefore the reference strain j estimation formulation in eq 20 can predict a reasonably conservative result in the j for a smaller yield strength or a larger strain hardening exponent in pipe 1 in comparison with that in pipe 2 and the largest over estimation percentage difference is about 14 in the case of fig 16 however as the potential material property difference between adjacent pipes further enlarges the proposed formulation will produce an over conservative prediction in the j for example if the yield strength of pipe 1 is 20 lower than that of pipe 2 the percentage difference of the j value given by the formulation and fe analysis becomes almost 60 in general the adjacent pipes made of the same material do not exhibit distinct property difference hence the above j estimation formulation can still be well applied to the fracture assessment of welded clad pipelines with potential material property difference between adjacent outer pipes 5 4 effect of lüders plateau and temperature on the j in this study the ramberg osgood model is employed to characterize the stress strain relation of the clad pipeline however the material of the outer pipe in clad pipelines is usually low carbon steel which exhibits a lüders plateau after initial yielding wang et al 2019 in addition more and more pipelines are exposed to low temperature conditions due to the exploitation of oil and gas resources continuously moving into harsher environments e g the arctic dahl et al 2018 yield strength and ductile to brittle transition dbt are two parameters apparently affected by the low temperature while the latter one is not the scope of this analysis østby et al 2013 and ren et al 2015 investigated the tensile properties of a 420 mpa steel with the temperature varying from 0 c to 90 c and the dependent relationships of yield strength σ y t and lüders strain ε l on the temperature are given as 23 σ y t 420 0 73 10 5 491 1 8 t 137 24 ε l 0 0142 exp 0 005 t the engineering stress strain curves of the steel at different temperatures are shown in fig 17 the σ y t and ε l values are 470 mpa and 1 42 at t 0 c and gradually increased to 542 mpa and 2 23 respectively at t 90 c in a word a lower temperature brings about an increase in the yield strength and lüders strain for the steel hence the effect of lüders plateau on the stress strain relation should be considered especially for a pipeline operated in low temperature environment wang et al 2019 carried out the fracture analysis of a cracked x65 pipe with lüders plateau and it is concluded that properly selecting the softening modulus of an up down up constitutive model contributes to the fracture assessment of cracked pipes in the presence of lüders plateau in the present analysis a ramberg osgood fitting of realistic stress strain curves with lüders plateau is applied for evaluating the fracture responses of an interface crack in welded clad pipelines under tension and internal pressure0 fig 18 a displays three different fitting strategies for the stress strain curve with lüders plateau i e a best fit to the elastic part of the curve red line a best fit to the strain hardening part of the curve dark cyan line and an average fit blue line the evolution curves of j with ε uc obtained from the realistic stress strain curve and the three ramberg osgood fits are depicted in fig 18 b the j values given by the three fitting approaches can reasonably trace the realistic j ε uc curve well within a certain range of ε uc however the elastic fitting method is recommended for use since it can conservatively predict the fracture responses for most of the strain range relative to the other two methods therefore the reference strain j estimation formulation can be employed for the fracture assessment of cracked pipelines with a realistic stress strain relation based on the elastic fitting method 6 conclusions the fracture responses for an interface crack in welded clad pipelines subjected to tension and internal pressure are analyzed a fe mesh generator is developed to create the corresponding fe models and the accuracy of the models is verified by observing a consistent result in the j values extracted from the present analysis and nourpanah and taheri 2010 paper then the necessity of proposing a reference strain evaluation scheme for the cracked clad pipelines under biaxial loading conditions is elucidated by considering the particularity of the interface crack and the significant influence of internal pressure on the final j therefore based on the research work of nourpanah and taheri 2010 a reference strain j estimation formulation is established for the interface crack and biaxial loading case and a linear dependence of the j on the global strain is observed the detailed expression forms of the formulation are determined by using the extensive parametric fe analyses which incorporate the various pipe diameters crack sizes weld mismatch levels and strain hardening exponents the accuracy of the proposed formulation is confirmed by comparing the j results from the formulation with those from fe analysis finally the application scope of the developed formulation is largely extended by taking into account the effects of yield strength weld profile potential material property difference realistic stress strain relation and temperature credit authorship contribution statement haisheng zhao conceptualization writing original

whole pipeline during the welding procedure some micro defects may be incorporated in the pipe welds and these defects are not easily identified by non destructive testing ndt during the service period the welded pipelines can experience complicated loading conditions e g longitudinal and transversal forces generated by ground movement internal pressure exerted by transported gas or liquid external pressure induced by sea water giving rise to large plastic deformation in pipelines up to the order of 3 yi et al 2012a b c the combined effects of these loads may trigger the growth and coalescence of micro defects to further propagate into a macro crack which finally leads to the structural failure hoh et al 2010 therefore it is important to perform the fracture assessment for the cracked pipelines subjected to large plastic deformation based on the ge epri approach kim et al 2002 performed engineering estimates for j integral in pipes with a part through surface crack then the obtained ge epri j estimation equation was re derived by using the reference stress method anderson 2005 which extends its application range for all types of stress strain behaviors not only limited to the ramberg osgood material constitutive model subsequently the reference stress method was further developed by tkaczyk et al 2011 for a defect assessment in pipelines and the proposed method for a parent material can also be safely applied to the case of over matched welds it is worth noting that the estimation methods mentioned above are all designed for the pipelines under the load controlled conditions chiodo and ruggieri 2010 paredes and ruggieri 2015 souza and ruggieri 2015 souza et al 2016 however the loading scheme of pipelines is controlled by the displacement or strain in some cases therefore the strain based method should be developed for the structural integrity assessment bastola et al 2017 budden 2006 jayadevan et al 2004 jia et al 2016 2017 lie et al 2017 østby et al 2005 parise et al 2015 souza and ruggieri 2017 zhao et al 2017 2019 2018 a reference strain approach was established by nourpanah and taheri 2010 to evaluate the fracture responses of a homogeneous pipeline subjected to large plastic strains yi et al 2012a b c conducted the fracture analyses of girth welded clad pipelines with a circumferential surface crack subjected to biaxial loading conditions and it is concluded that bs 7910 2013 gives an over conservative prediction in the fracture assessment especially for a large plastic strain loading case however the formulation proposed by yi et al 2012a b c is only for a specific pipe geometric configuration as seen in fig 1 the weld centerline wcl and weld toe are two main failure positions in welded pipelines in comparison with the wcl the weld toe is a more vulnerable position of crack initiation and propagation due to the stress concentration raised by weld reinforcement fig 1 b and the potential defects induced by incomplete fusion fig 1 c slag inclusions etc yi et al 2012a b c however the aforementioned research works all aimed at the pipelines with surface cracks located at the wcl bastola et al 2017 budden 2006 chiodo and ruggieri 2010 jayadevan et al 2004 jia et al 2016 2017 lie et al 2017 østby et al 2005 paredes and ruggieri 2015 parise et al 2015 souza and ruggieri 2015 2017 zhao et al 2019 and seldom investigations can be found for the fracture analysis of a weld toe crack i e a crack located at the interface of outer pipe and girth weld in welded pipelines yi et al 2012a b c zhao et al 2018 therefore the fracture assessment for welded clad pipelines with an interface crack and subjected to complicated loading conditions is carried out in the present study 2 fracture assessment strategies of welded clad pipes 2 1 stress based fracture assessment method for structures under load controlled conditions the stress based evaluation procedures are usually used for the fracture assessment of cracked components the epri j estimation approach and the reference stress method anderson 2005 are the two commonly used stress based methods by dividing the total j into the sum of the elastic component j e and the plastic component j p the epri procedure provides a j integral estimation approach of covering the full range of elastic plastic regime as 1 j j e j p where j e is the elastic release rate which can be determined through the following expression 2 j e k i 2 e where k i is the mode i stress intensity factor e e for plane stress condition and e e 1 ν 2 for plane strain condition with e and ν being the elastic modulus and the poisson s ratio respectively the second term of eq 1 fully plastic equation of j is determined as follows 3 j p α ε y σ y b h 1 a t θ π d e t n p p l n 1 where α is a dimensionless constant ε y and σ y are the yield strain and yield stress of the material respectively a θ t d e are the crack depth half central angle of crack length pipe wall thickness and pipe outside diameter respectively b is the uncracked ligament length with b t a n is the material strain hardening exponent h 1 is the geometry factor depending on a t θ π d e t and n p and p l are the applied load and the limit load of the structure respectively the above epri j estimation procedure aiming at the tension case was developed by chiodo and ruggieri 2010 for the structural components subjected to a bending moment 4 j p α ε y σ y b h 1 a t θ π d e t n m m l n 1 where m is the applied bending moment m l is the limit bending moment and its expression is given as the following 5 m l 2 σ y r m 2 t 2 sin β a t sin θ where r m is the pipe mean radius with r m d e t 2 and β is defined as 6 β π 2 1 θ π a t the material obeying the ramberg osgood model is assumed in the epri j estimation procedure however the flow behavior exists in many materials deviating considerably from the power law in this case applying eq 3 or eq 4 for the fracture assessment causes a significant error in order to better characterize the flow behavior of materials ainsworth anderson 2005 proposed a reference stress j estimation approach by defining a reference stress σ ref as 7 σ ref σ y p p l or m m l substituting eq 7 into eq 3 or eq 4 gives the following equation 8 j p σ ref b h 1 ε ref σ ref ε y σ y where ε ref is the reference strain corresponding to the σ ref for a material following the ramberg osgood model eq 8 can predict the same j integral value with eq 3 or eq 4 it is noted that eq 8 is equally applicable for other types of stress strain relationship in other words the reference stress approach is a generalization of the conventional epri j estimation procedure 2 2 strain based fracture assessment method for the offshore pipelines under reeling installation the pipelines are subjected to large plastic deformation up to the order of 3 lie et al 2017 yi et al 2012a b c during this process the strain controlled or displacement controlled boundary condition is dominant therefore it is more appropriate and accurate to use the strain based approach for the fracture assessment based on the reference stress approach underlying r6 a reference strain method is proposed as follows 9 j f 2 π a σ nom ε nom ε ref σ ref ε nom σ nom where f is the geometry factor depending on the structural geometry and loading mode σ nom and ε nom are the nominal stress and strain respectively the next step is to replace σ nom and ε nom in eq 9 by σ uc and ε uc linkens et al 2000 where σ uc and ε uc are the elastic plastic uncracked body equivalent stress and strain respectively eq 9 now becomes the following form by adding the safety factor of 2 10 j 2 f 2 π a σ uc ε uc the strain formulation as indicated in eq 10 is not sufficiently accurate in a quantitative fracture assessment which can qualitatively capture the fracture responses of the pipelines the reason is that the difference between ε nom and ε uc becomes larger and larger with the increasing crack depth violating the underlying assumption of small cracks in eq 10 on the basis of eq 10 nourpanah and taheri 2010 developed a more accurate strain based j estimation formulation by proposing a linear relationship between the normalized j and ε uc this formulation was originally established for a crack normal to the pipe surface however whether it is equally applicable for the case of an interface crack remains unknown in this study it is observed that the linear relationship between the j and ε uc still holds true for the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack therefore the reference strain evaluation formulation proposed by nourpanah and taheri 2010 is valid for the integrity assessment of an interface crack in welded clad pipelines subjected to tension and internal pressure by developing the new parameter expressions of f 1 and f 2 instead of original ones as 11 j σ y t f 1 ε uc f 2 where f 1 and f 2 are the two new parameter expressions depending on the pipe geometry crack size and material properties 3 numerical models and procedures 3 1 material properties and geometrical details fig 2 shows the schematics of a welded clad pipe with a circumferential part through surface crack along the interface of girth weld and outer pipe which is a critical location of crack initiation and growth the welded clad pipe is composed of three different materials fig 2 outer pipe steel weld metal and internal cra layer it is noted that the heat affected zone haz is not incorporated in this study due to its narrow width in comparison with the weld width and uncracked ligament length hence ignoring the haz causes an ignorable effect on the fracture behaviors besides the haz typically presents over matched material properties compared to its surrounding constituents i e outer pipe steel and weld metal thus neglecting the haz results in a slightly conservative prediction for fracture responses which is beneficial for the engineering critical assessment of pipelines kim and schwalbe 2001 for the cra material and weld metal identical material properties are adopted it is because the filler material commonly used in the welding of clad pipe segments such as nickel chromium alloy 625 uns n06625 has almost the same mechanical properties as the cra material souza et al 2016 souza and ruggieri 2017 in this study it is assumed that the material properties of outer pipe steel and weld metal or inner cra material follow the classical ramberg osgood relationship a weld strength mismatch factor m y is introduced to characterize the mismatch effect between these two types of materials 12 m y σ y w σ y out where σ y w and σ y out are the yield stress of the weld metal and outer pipe steel respectively three mismatch levels viz m y 0 8 20 undermatch m y 1 0 evenmatch and m y 1 25 25 overmatch are considered in the current analysis covering a wide range of material types found in real application souza and ruggieri 2015 an api x60 pipeline grade steel is selected as the outer pipe material herein and its material properties are σ y out 483 mpa and n out 12 chiodo and ruggieri 2010 souza and ruggieri 2015 hence the yield stress of weld metal can be calculated based on eq 12 which are summarized in table 1 table 2 tabulates the details of pipe geometry girth weld and crack dimensions two different ratios of pipe outside diameter to pipe wall thickness d e t are adopted viz d e t 10 and 20 with a constant wall thickness t 20 6 mm and cra layer thickness t cra 3 mm the crack size is characterized by the crack depth a and crack length 2s d e θ and the crack depth ratio a t and crack length ratio θ π used in this analysis are varying from 0 1 to 0 4 and from 0 05 to 0 20 respectively the weld groove angle ϕ weld root opening width h and weld reinforcements r u and r d are employed to define the weld geometry for the weld groove angle ϕ 45 is considered and the value of h t adopted is 0 3 signifying the typical girth weld profile encountered in engineering practice however the girth welds with flushed surface are considered in this study which means that r u and r d both tend to infinity it is because the presence of the weld reinforcement restrains the crack tip opening inducing a smaller crack driving force therefore neglecting the weld reinforcement can produce a slightly conservative prediction in the j values please refer to sub section 5 2 for details 3 2 model development and numerical procedures as mentioned in the above various parameters i e pipe diameter weld geometry crack size yield stress and strain hardening exponent are incorporated in this study to investigate the fracture responses of welded clad pipelines with an interface crack a large number of fe models are required to be created therefore a fe mesh generator is developed by using matlab code to simplify the cumbersome and time consuming task the fe mesh generator can conveniently produce fe models of various pipeline types and crack locations not limited to the pipe model of the present study a detailed function list is depicted in fig 3 a to better describe the function modules of the mesh generator the generated fe models are processed by abaqus 2011 and post processed by a self developed python script to extract the required results e g displacement stress j integral fig 3 b in the generation of the fe models the most pivotal part is to determine the position coordinates of the crack front line which is the baseline of constructing the crack tube fig 4 a the crack front line can be described by considering the constant crack depth part ab and varying depth part bc separately as follows 13 θ arc arcsin 2 a d e 14 y d d e 2 a sin β d 15 z d d e 2 a cos β d 16 y e d e 2 a cos β e sin θ θ arc a sin β e cos θ θ arc 17 z e d e 2 a cos β e cos θ θ arc a sin β e sin θ θ arc where d and e are any point in segment ab and bc respectively β d and β e denote the corresponding angle of aod and bo e fig 4 b based on the crack front line a focused spider web mesh pattern along the crack front is used with a small keyhole geometry at the crack tip to capture the high strain gradient and overcome the convergent issue induced by the large plastic deformation fig 4 a the small radius of the keyhole in this study is set to 0 001 mm 12 circumferential layers surrounding the crack front are employed to provide the distance sufficiently far from the crack tip to ensure the path independence of the j integral based on the mesh strategies described above the crack tube can be generated fig 4 a finally the welded clad pipe model is constructed step by step as shown in fig 5 the element type used is 20 node brick element with reduced integration c3d20r the deformation plasticity and the small geometry change scc assumption are incorporated in the present fe analysis fig 6 shows the boundary conditions used in the present study for the welded clad pipeline due to symmetry only half of the pipe needs to be considered hence a symmetric boundary condition is applied to the surface of y 0 at the left end of the pipe the displacements in x axis and z axis directions are constrained for preventing rigid motion a tensile displacement loading u is applied to the right end of the pipe for providing the tension and ε uc can be expressed in the form of u as 18 ε uc u l ε uc is set up to 3 by allowing for the large plastic deformation of the pipeline during the reeling installation or in service operation besides an internal pressure p of 20 mpa is applied to the internal surface of the pipeline to realize the biaxial loading conditions based on the flow theory of plasticity the j integral value depends on the loading path for the biaxial loading conditions of tension and internal pressure three different loading paths are considered applying p first and then ε uc load path 1 applying p and ε uc simultaneously load path 2 and applying ε uc first and then p load path 3 fig 7 shows the comparisons of the j integral values obtained from the three loading paths and it is observed that the load path 1 induces the maximum value of j integral which produces the same conclusion with yi et al 2012a b c therefore the biaxial loading path used in this study is to apply the internal pressure p first before the ε uc acts on the pipeline segment the validity of the generated fe model needs to be confirmed before it is used for the fracture analysis of the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack and subjected to biaxial loading conditions at first the fe mesh generator is employed to create the fe model of the homogeneous pipeline with a surface crack normal to the pipe surface by setting ϕ 0 and the j values obtained are compared with nourpanah and taheri 2010 results a good agreement between one another is observed with the largest percentage difference being about 6 fig 8 convincingly verifying the validity of the mesh refinement and fe modelling then for the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack convergent tests covering the range of various parameters tabulated in tables 1 and 2 are conducted to determine the required number of elements it is noted that the number of elements ranging from 20 000 to 35 000 is adequate in this study depending on the pipe geometry and crack size the above sensitivity analyses provide confidence in the accuracy of the subsequent parametric study for the welded clad pipelines with an interface crack 4 determination of the reference strain j estimation formulation the necessity of developing a new reference strain j estimation formulation for an interface crack in welded clad pipelines subjected to tension and internal pressure should be confirmed first the engineering critical assessments of a cracked pipeline under uniaxial stress state tension or bending were carried out by some scholars chiodo and ruggieri 2010 paredes and ruggieri 2015 souza and ruggieri 2015 2017 souza et al 2016 even though yi et al 2012a b c have established the estimation equation for a cracked clad pipeline under tension and internal pressure their equation is only applicable to a specific pipe geometry and material property in this study the fracture analysis for a cracked clad pipeline under biaxial loading conditions is conducted by covering a wide range of geometric configurations and weld strength mismatch values fig 9 shows the comparison of j values for the cracked clad pipeline subjected to uniaxial and biaxial stress state respectively it is clearly noted that the j values obtained from the biaxial stress state are always larger than those from the uniaxial stress state and the largest percentage difference between one another is attained at the case of d e t 20 a t 0 1 m y 0 8 and n w 12 with the value being about 60 verifying a remarkable influence of the internal pressure induced by the transported liquid or gas on the structural integrity besides in some working conditions the pipelines undergo the combined action of bending moment and internal pressure and the relationship between the global strain and bending moment is given as 19 ε uc d e γ 2 l where γ denotes the rotation angle of the pipeline fig 10 presents a comparative study of j values for the pipeline under two different biaxial loading condition cases viz tension internal pressure and bending moment internal pressure respectively the j values of the former case are always slightly larger than that of the latter case therefore it is more significant by proposing the reference strain estimation formulation for the combined tension and internal pressure case since it can be equally suitable for the bending moment and internal pressure case but not vice versa as indicated in eq 11 the key of proposing the reference strain j estimation formulation is to confirm the expressions of f 1 and f 2 for convenience eq 11 can be rewritten into the following form by replacing the original f 1 and f 2 as 20 j σ y out t f 1 d e t a t θ π m y n w ε uc f 2 d e t a t θ π m y n w parametric fe analyses totally including 280 models are performed to develop the factors f 1 and f 2 by covering a wide range of parameter values as tabulated in tables 1 and 2 and fig 11 depicts the whole process of determining f 1 and f 2 a nonlinear evolution curve between j σ y out t and ε uc can be observed at the initial deformation stage which is referred to as a short transient region prior to the fully plastic deformation state zhao et al 2018 then a linear dependence of j σ y out t on ε uc always holds true for the range of 0 5 3 0 hence the factors f 1 and f 2 are ascertained by fitting the numerical data in this range the factor f 1 can be easily obtained by extracting the slope of this curve in fig 11 and the intercept at ordinate is employed to determine the f 2 the same operation procedure is carried out for all the parameter combinations incorporated in this study and a series of f 1 and f 2 values varying with d e t a t θ π m y and n w are attained based on the evolution trends of f 1 and f 2 their concrete expression forms can be constructed by using multiple regression analysis as 21 f 1 a 1 θ π a 2 a t a 3 θ π a 4 22 f 2 b 1 θ π b 2 a t b 3 where a 1 to a 4 and b 1 to b 3 are coefficients depending on d e t m y and n w as given in tables 3 and 4 substituting eqs 21 and 22 into eq 20 obtains the reference strain j estimation formulation for an interface crack in welded clad pipelines under biaxial loading conditions the goodness of fit of the proposed formulation is required to be verified due to its complex form fig 12 displays the comparisons of j values obtained from the formulation and numerical data by considering effects of various parameters and these two sets of values are well consistent with one another signifying the j estimation formulation being a good fit to the fe data 5 extension in application scope of the estimation formulation the objective of this section is to extend the application range of the developed reference strain j estimation formulation in eq 20 by considering the effects of yield strength weld profile potential material property difference realistic stress strain relation and temperature 5 1 effect of yield strength and pipe wall thickness on the j even though the j estimation formulation in eq 20 has been nondimensionalized by σ y out t it is developed based on the outer pipe made of an api x60 pipeline grade steel with the σ y out and t being 483 mpa and 20 6 mm respectively thus the general applicability of eq 20 needs to be proved due to the variation in the material property and geometrical dimension of the pipelines encountered in practice it is noted from fig 13 a that the dimensionless j i e j σ y out t obtained from σ y out 483 mpa and σ y out 579 6 mpa 20 higher than 483 mpa for an identical t are well consistent with one another and the same is true for the case of the lower σ y out value which demonstrates the validity of the σ y out as part of the characteristic variable σ y out t for the pipe wall thickness three different t viz t 15 mm t 20 6 mm and t 25 mm are considered and almost identical j σ y out t values are observed fig 13 b therefore setting the σ y out t as the characteristic variable largely reduces the dependence of eq 20 on the outer pipe yield strength and pipe wall thickness in other words the developed j estimation formulation can be available for a wide range of outer pipe yield strengths and pipe wall thickness not just limited to the case of σ y out 483 mpa and t 20 6 mm 5 2 effect of weld profile on the j the estimation formulation is built up for the cracked clad pipelines with flushed weld surface i e r u or h u 0 0 mm fig 2 however the weld reinforcement more or less exists in some actual situations hence the availability of the proposed formulation for the girth weld with face reinforcement should be investigated herein three different cases viz h u 0 0 mm case 1 h u 2 6 mm case 2 and h u 4 0 mm case 3 are considered the h u value in case 2 is taken from a real weld reinforcement dimension as shown in the paper of yi et al 2012a b c and the h u in case 3 is set to 4 0 mm in view of the aws d1 1 2000 recommendation of retaining minimum weld reinforcement not exceeding 3 mm fig 14 shows the comparative study of the j values obtained from the three cases by covering varying crack sizes weld mismatch levels and strain hardening exponents and it is clearly noted that the reduced h u causes an increase in the j in a linear elastic fracture mechanics regime the corresponding fracture parameter i e stress intensity factor sif can be magnified due to the stress concentration induced by the weld reinforcement especially for a shallow crack however for the large plastic strain case of this study the magnification effect can be negligible and the presence of weld reinforcement restrains the further opening of the crack tip resulting in a decreased j value therefore the reference strain j estimation formulation in eq 20 can provide a reasonably conservative fracture assessment for the cracked clad pipelines with weld reinforcement as stated previously a typical girth weld profile with ϕ 45 and h t 0 3 is adopted in the development of the j estimation formulation in order to extend the application scope of the formulation in the weld profile the ϕ and h t values ranging from 30 to 60 and from 0 2 to 0 4 respectively are employed in this analysis incorporating the commonly used weld shape found in welded pipelines it is observed from fig 15 a that for a constant h t a larger ϕ results in a decrease in the j value by considering various weld mismatch levels and strain hardening exponents as the ϕ increases the angle 90o ϕ 2 between the crack face and the applied tensile loading becomes smaller and smaller reducing the effective loading in opening the crack fig 2 and then decreasing the corresponding j hence the reference strain j estimation formulation for ϕ 45 can reliably predict the fracture responses for the cracked clad pipelines including ϕ varying from 45 to 60 with the largest over estimation percentage difference being only 6 4 in the case of fig 15 a for the weld root opening width the change of h t with a constant ϕ exerts relatively little effect on the j by noticing the percentage difference between one another in fig 15 b within 2 except the case of m y 0 8 and n w 12 in which the j decreases with the reduced h t therefore the j estimation formulation initially developed for h t 0 3 can make a slightly conservation prediction in the j for the cracked clad pipelines with h t being smaller than 0 3 however the formulation mentioned above should be used with caution in the fracture assessment when the h t of the girth weld is larger than 0 3 5 3 effect of potential material property difference between adjacent pipes on the j the clad pipelines are composed of a series of pipe segments by welding even though these pipe segments are made of an identical material the adjacent pipes welded together may exist difference in material properties due to the effect of pressing process hence it is necessary and significant to investigate the influence of potential material property difference between adjacent pipes on the j fig 16 presents the comparative study of the j values calculated for varying yield strengths and strain hardening exponents of outer pipe in this analysis the welded clad pipeline is divided into two parts viz pipe 1 and pipe 2 and the material property difference is implemented by changing the properties σ y out and n out of pipe 1 and keep these of pipe 2 constant as indicated in fig 16 it is noted that a smaller σ y out in pipe 1 relative to pipe 2 always causes a downward shift in the j values and a reverse trend is observed for the n out a smaller yield strength and a larger strain hardening exponent both imply a softer pipe thus when a same displacement loading is applied to the welded pipeline the softer pipe 1 will undergo a larger deformation and then a smaller deformation occurs in the pipe 2 inducing a decrease in the j value therefore the reference strain j estimation formulation in eq 20 can predict a reasonably conservative result in the j for a smaller yield strength or a larger strain hardening exponent in pipe 1 in comparison with that in pipe 2 and the largest over estimation percentage difference is about 14 in the case of fig 16 however as the potential material property difference between adjacent pipes further enlarges the proposed formulation will produce an over conservative prediction in the j for example if the yield strength of pipe 1 is 20 lower than that of pipe 2 the percentage difference of the j value given by the formulation and fe analysis becomes almost 60 in general the adjacent pipes made of the same material do not exhibit distinct property difference hence the above j estimation formulation can still be well applied to the fracture assessment of welded clad pipelines with potential material property difference between adjacent outer pipes 5 4 effect of lüders plateau and temperature on the j in this study the ramberg osgood model is employed to characterize the stress strain relation of the clad pipeline however the material of the outer pipe in clad pipelines is usually low carbon steel which exhibits a lüders plateau after initial yielding wang et al 2019 in addition more and more pipelines are exposed to low temperature conditions due to the exploitation of oil and gas resources continuously moving into harsher environments e g the arctic dahl et al 2018 yield strength and ductile to brittle transition dbt are two parameters apparently affected by the low temperature while the latter one is not the scope of this analysis østby et al 2013 and ren et al 2015 investigated the tensile properties of a 420 mpa steel with the temperature varying from 0 c to 90 c and the dependent relationships of yield strength σ y t and lüders strain ε l on the temperature are given as 23 σ y t 420 0 73 10 5 491 1 8 t 137 24 ε l 0 0142 exp 0 005 t the engineering stress strain curves of the steel at different temperatures are shown in fig 17 the σ y t and ε l values are 470 mpa and 1 42 at t 0 c and gradually increased to 542 mpa and 2 23 respectively at t 90 c in a word a lower temperature brings about an increase in the yield strength and lüders strain for the steel hence the effect of lüders plateau on the stress strain relation should be considered especially for a pipeline operated in low temperature environment wang et al 2019 carried out the fracture analysis of a cracked x65 pipe with lüders plateau and it is concluded that properly selecting the softening modulus of an up down up constitutive model contributes to the fracture assessment of cracked pipes in the presence of lüders plateau in the present analysis a ramberg osgood fitting of realistic stress strain curves with lüders plateau is applied for evaluating the fracture responses of an interface crack in welded clad pipelines under tension and internal pressure0 fig 18 a displays three different fitting strategies for the stress strain curve with lüders plateau i e a best fit to the elastic part of the curve red line a best fit to the strain hardening part of the curve dark cyan line and an average fit blue line the evolution curves of j with ε uc obtained from the realistic stress strain curve and the three ramberg osgood fits are depicted in fig 18 b the j values given by the three fitting approaches can reasonably trace the realistic j ε uc curve well within a certain range of ε uc however the elastic fitting method is recommended for use since it can conservatively predict the fracture responses for most of the strain range relative to the other two methods therefore the reference strain j estimation formulation can be employed for the fracture assessment of cracked pipelines with a realistic stress strain relation based on the elastic fitting method 6 conclusions the fracture responses for an interface crack in welded clad pipelines subjected to tension and internal pressure are analyzed a fe mesh generator is developed to create the corresponding fe models and the accuracy of the models is verified by observing a consistent result in the j values extracted from the present analysis and nourpanah and taheri 2010 paper then the necessity of proposing a reference strain evaluation scheme for the cracked clad pipelines under biaxial loading conditions is elucidated by considering the particularity of the interface crack and the significant influence of internal pressure on the final j therefore based on the research work of nourpanah and taheri 2010 a reference strain j estimation formulation is established for the interface crack and biaxial loading case and a linear dependence of the j on the global strain is observed the detailed expression forms of the formulation are determined by using the extensive parametric fe analyses which incorporate the various pipe diameters crack sizes weld mismatch levels and strain hardening exponents the accuracy of the proposed formulation is confirmed by comparing the j results from the formulation with those from fe analysis finally the application scope of the developed formulation is largely extended by taking into account the effects of yield strength weld profile potential material property difference realistic stress strain relation and temperature credit authorship contribution statement haisheng zhao conceptualization writing original
